         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

which have been accomplished in our

as such we publish them; those of <hi>Mr.

bar, being one night visited by two of his intimate
acquaintances, or bosom friends, as he himself
called them, they began to complain of the cruelty
of the times, and the malice and usage of time-serving
brethren; to which Mr. Love answered,
<q>And think you this is an evil time?</q> No, no;
this is the very time when grace and true god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now turned back for the roughness of the way,
and the sore trial and tribulation which others met

            <q>
               <p>There are many in London at this very day,
who think to go to heaven in their gilded coaches,
and have denied Christ's cause before men (against

sent this day to have a few words with them here in

But, ah! how will they look the blessed Jesus in the

me to utter:—This usurped authority of Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,

powerful preachers, and dull hearers: good sermons
to them will be as music to a sleepy man; they

the heart, to practise it in their lives, to walk by it.
O England, thou shalt wax old in wickedness; thy
sins abound like those of Sodom; thy voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall cry aloud for vengeance; the Lord shall
threaten and chastise thee, yet in mercy and
love will he look upon those that fear him, and
call upon his name: he will spare of his anger,
when the wicked shall be sifted from amongst you
as the chaff is sifted from amongst the wheat; for
out of thee, O England, shall a bright star arise,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33422:4"/>
whose light and voice shall make the heathen to
quake, and knock under with submission to the
gospel of Jesus; he shall be as a sound of thunder
in the ears of the wicked, and as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anthorn to
the Jews, to lead them to the knowledge of Jesus,
the only son of God, and true Messiah, whom they
so long mistrusted, for the short work spoken of by
the apostle, which the Lord is to make upon the
earth, in the latter age of the world, cannot be far
off. Observe, my dear friend, while you live my
calculation of the dates in the book of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in Daniel, which the Spirit of the Lord
led me into; for the Lord will reveal it to some
of his own, ere that time come; for the nearer the
time is, the seals shall be taken away, and more
and more shall be revealed to God's people; for
the Lord doth nothing without he reveal it, by
his Spirit, to his servants the prophets: He destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the old world, without the knowledge of
Noah—He did not overthrow Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,
without the knowledge of Abraham. I do
not mean now, that any new prophet shall arise;
but the Lord by his Spirit shall cause knowledge
to abound among his people, whereby the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
shall be clearly and perfectly understood.
And I die in that thought, and really believe that
my calculations are right, on the Revelation by St.
John, and the prophecy which St. Jerome copied off
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33422:4"/>
and translated out of the Hebrew language, as it is
written on Seth's pillar in Damascus, which pillar
is said to have stood since before the flood and was
built by Seth, Adam's son, and written by Enoch
the prophet; as likewise the holy precepts whereby
the patriarch walked before the law was given to
Moses, which were also engraven on the said pillar.
whereof many Jews have copies, in their own
language written on parchment, and engraven on
brass and copper; but the alteration of the date
makes them to stagger at it, not knowing that the
dates were to be altered by the birth of Christ. First,
This prophecy is enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led. A short work of the
Lord's in the latter age of the world. Great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
and commotions by sea and land shall come
in the year of God 1779. Great wars in Germany
and America, in 1780. The destruction of popery,
or Babylon's fall, in the year 1790. God will be
known by many in the year 1795. This will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a great man. The stars will wander, and the
moon turn as blood, in 1800. Africa, Asia, and
America, will tremble, in 1803. A great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
over all the world, in 1805. God will be
universally known by all: Then a general reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and peace for ever, when the people shall
learn war no more. Happy is the man that liveth
to see this day!</p>

This kingdom is the most considerable <hi>part</hi> or

upon the ruins of the <hi>papal empire,</hi> and enrich
itself with the spoils of those who shall take part
with the <hi>papacy.</hi> They who at this day <hi>persecute</hi>
the <hi>protestants,</hi> know not whither God is leading
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33422:5"/>
them: this is not the way by which he will lead
<hi>France</hi> to the height of glory. If she comes thither
'tis because she shall shortly change her road. Her
greatening will be no damage to <hi>protestant states;</hi> on
the contrary, the <hi>protestant states</hi> shall be enriched
with the spoils of others; and be strengthened by the
<hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Antichrist</hi>'s <hi>empire.</hi> This <hi>tenth</hi> part of the <hi>city</hi> shall <hi>fall,</hi> with respect to the <hi>papacy;</hi> it shall break
with <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Roman religion.</hi> One thing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the Babylonian empire shall perish through
the refusal of obedience by the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> who had
given their power to the <hi>beast.</hi> The thing is already
come to pass in part. The kingdoms of <hi>Sweden,
Denmark, England,</hi> and several <hi>sovereign states of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
have withdrawn themselves from the <hi>Iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Pope. They have spoiled the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rlot</hi> of her
<hi>riches. They have eaten her flesh, ie.</hi> seized her <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
and <hi>revenues,</hi> which she had in their countries.
This must go on, and be finished as it began. <hi>The
Kings,</hi> who yet remain under the <hi>empire of Rome,</hi>
must break with her, leave her solitary and desolate.</p>
            <p>But who must begin this <hi>last revolt?</hi> 'Tis most
probable that <hi>France</hi> shall. Not <hi>Spain,</hi> which as yet
is plunged in superstition, and is as much under the
<hi>tyranny</hi> of the <hi>clergy</hi> as ever. Not the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who
in temporals is subject to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and permits the
<hi>Archbishop of Strigonium</hi> in his states, to teach that
the Pope can take away the <hi>Imperial</hi> crown from him.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33422:6"/>
It cannot be any country but <hi>France,</hi> which a long
time ago hath begun to shake off the yoke of Rome.
'Tis well known, how <hi>solemnly</hi> and openly <hi>war</hi> hath
been declared against the <hi>Pope,</hi> by declaration of the
<hi>King</hi> (ratified in all the <hi>parliaments</hi>) by the decisions
of the assembly of the <hi>French clergy,</hi> by a <hi>disputation</hi>
against the authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> managed in the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
solemnly, and by order of the <hi>Court.</hi> And to
heighten the affront, the <hi>theses</hi> were posted up, even
upon the gates of his <hi>Nuncio.</hi> Nothing of this kind
had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>herto happened, at least in a time of peace,
and unless the <hi>Pope</hi> had given occasion by his info<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</p>
            <p>Besides this, <hi>superstition</hi> and <hi>idolatry</hi> lose their credit
much in <hi>France.</hi>—There is a secret party, though
well enough known, which greatly despiseth the
popular <hi>devotions, images,</hi> worship of <hi>Saints,</hi> and is
convinced that these are <hi>human inventions;</hi> God is
before-hand preparing for this great work.</p>
            <p>To this it may be objected, that for the last fifty
years, the Pope's empire hath not been made up of
ten Kings, because England, Sweden, Denmark,
&amp;c. have thrown off his government; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<hi>France</hi> is not at this day the <hi>tenth</hi> part of
the <hi>Babylonian empire;</hi> for 'tis more than a <hi>tenth</hi> part
of it. But this is no difficulty: for we must know,
that things retain the names which they bore in their
original (without regarding the alterations which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33422:6"/>
time does bring along). Though at this day, there are
not ten kingdoms under the Babylonian empire, 'tis
notwithstanding certain, that each Kingdom was
called, and ought to be called in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> prophecy, the
<hi>tenth</hi> part; because the prophet having described
this <hi>empire</hi> in its beginning, by its <hi>ten horns</hi> or <hi>ten
Kings,</hi> 'tis necessary for our clear understanding, that
every one of these <hi>ten Kings,</hi> and <hi>kingdoms</hi> should be
called one of the <hi>ten Kings</hi> or of the <hi>ten kingdoms,</hi>
with respect to the constitution of the Antichristian
empire.</p>
            <p>Seeing the tenth part of the city that must fall, is
France, this gives me some hopes, that the death of
the <hi>two witnesses</hi> hath a particular relation to this
kingdom. 'Tis the <hi>street</hi> or place of <hi>this city. i. e.</hi>
the most fair and eminent part of it. The <hi>witnesses</hi>
must remain dead upon <hi>this street,</hi> and upon it they
must be raised again. And as the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
and their <hi>resurrection</hi> have a relation to the
<hi>kingdom of France,</hi> it may well fall out, that we may
not be far distant from the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>resurrection</hi> of
the <hi>witnesses</hi> seeing the three <hi>years</hi> and a half of their
<hi>death</hi> are either begun, or will begin shortly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the earthquake were slain seven thousand;</hi> in
the Greek it is, <hi>seven thousand names of men,</hi> and not
seven thousand men. I consess, that this seems
somewhat mystericus: in other places we find not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33422:7"/>
this phrase, <hi>names of men,</hi> put simply for <hi>men.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there is here a figure of grammar called <hi>hypal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
casus,</hi> so that <hi>names of men</hi> are put for <hi>men of
name, i. e.</hi> of raised and considerable quality, be it
on account of riches, or of dignity, or of learning.
But I am more inclined to say, that <hi>here</hi> these words,
<hi>names of men,</hi> must be taken in their natural significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and do intimate, that the total <hi>Reformation of
France</hi> shall not be made without bloodshed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall be destroyed but <hi>names;</hi> such as are the
names of <hi>Monks,</hi> of <hi>Carmelites,</hi> of <hi>Augustines,</hi> of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi>
of <hi>Iacobins,</hi> of <hi>Franciscans, Capuchins, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
Minimes,</hi> and an infinite company of others,
whose number 'tis not easy to define, and which the
Holy Ghost denotes by the number <hi>seven,</hi> which is
the number of perfection, to signify, the number of
<hi>monks</hi> and <hi>nuns</hi> shall perish for ever. This is an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
so degenerated from its first original, that
'tis become the arm of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> These orders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perish one without another.</p>
            <p>These <hi>great events</hi> deserve to be distinguished from
all others; for they have changed, and shall change,

TO
NIXON's CHESHIRE PROPHECY,
BY THE
AUTHOR of his LIFE.</head>
               <p>THIS remarkable Prophecy has been carefully revised,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orrected, and improved; also some account given
of our author, Robert Nixon, who was but a kind of
ideot, and used to be employed in following the
plough. He lived in some farmers' families, and
was their drudge and jest.</p>
               <p>At last, Thomas Cholmondeley, of Vale-Royal,
Esq. took him into his house, and he lived there
when he composed this Prophecy, which he delivered
with as much gravity and solemnity as if he had
been an oracle; and it was observed, that though
the fool was a driveler, and could not speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense when he was uninspired, yet in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Propecies he spoke plainly and sensibly;
how truly will be seen in the following pages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:33422:8"/>As to the credit of this Prophecy, I dare say it is
as well attested as any of Nostradamus's or Merlin's,
and come to pass as well as the best of Squire Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staff's.
It is pain enough that great men have in
all ages had recourse to prophecy as well as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
I would not have all grave persons despise the
inspirations of Nixon. The late French King gave
audience to an inspired farrier, and rewarded him
with an hundred pistoles for his prophetical intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
though by what I can learn, he did not
come near our Nixon for gifts.</p>
               <p>The simplicity, the circumstances, and history, of
the Cheshire Prophecy, are so remarkable, that I hope
the public will be as much delighted as I was myself.</p>
               <p>By the way, this is not a prophecy of to-day; it
is as old as the Powder plot, and the story will make
it appear that there is as little imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Jacobites pretend there is in the person it seems to
have an eye to: but whether they are both impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
alike or not, I leave to the reader to determine.</p>

               <head>THE
PROPHECY.</head>
               <p>IN the reign of King James the First, there lived a
man, generally repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed a fool, whose name was
Nixon. One day, when he returned home from
ploughing in the field, he laid the things down
which he had in his hands, and continuing for some
time in a seemingly deep and thoughtful meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at length he pronounced in a loud voice, Now
I will prophesy. And spoke as follows:</p>
               <p>When a Raven shall build in a stone Lion's mouth
on the top of a Church in Cheshire, then a King of
England shall be driven out of his kingdom, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return more.</p>
               <p>When an eagle shall sit on the top of the house,
then an heir shall be born to the Cholmodeley's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and this heir shall live to see England inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by foreigners, who shall proceed so far as a town
in Cheshire; but a miller named Peter, shall be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33422:9"/>
born with two heels on one Foot and at that time
living in a mill of Mr Cholmondeley's, he shall be
instrumental in delivering the nation.</p>
               <p>The person who then governs the nation will be
in great trouble, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> about: The invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King shall be killed, laid across a horse's back
like a calf, and led in triumph. The miller hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been instrumental in it, shall bring forth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that then governs the kingdom, and be knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for what he has done; and after that England
see happy days. A young new set of men shall come,
who shall prosper, and make a flourishing Church
for two hundred years.</p>
               <p>As a token of the truth of all this, a wall of Mr.
Cholmondeley's shall fall: If it fall downwards, the
Church shall be oppressed, and rise no more: but if
upwards, next the rising hill on the side of it, then
it shall flourish again. Under this wall shall be
found the bones of a British King.</p>
               <p>A pond shall run with blood three days, and the
Cross-stone Pillar in the Forest su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k so low into the
ground, that a crow from the top of it shall drink
of the best blood in England.</p>
               <p>A boy shall be born with three thumbs, and shall
hold three King's horses, while England shall be
three times won and lost in one day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33422:9"/>THE original may be seen in several families in
Cheshire, and in particular in the hands of Mr. Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of Oulton, with many other remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
as that Pecferton Wind mill should be removed
to Ludditon Hill, that horses saddled should run about
'till their girts rotted away. But this is sufficient to
prove Nixon as great a prophet as Partridge, and we
shall give other proofs of it before we have done.</p>
               <p>Now as for authorities to prove this Prophecy to
be genuine, and how it has hitherto been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
I might refer myself to the whole county
of Chester, where it is in every one's mouth, and
has been for these forty years. As much as I have
of the manuscript was sent me by a person of sense
and veracity, and as little disposed to believe visions
as any body. There is something so very odd in
the story, and so pat in the wording of it, that I
cannot help giving it as I found it. The family
of the Cholmondeley's is very ancient in this
county, and takes its name from a place so called
near Nantwich. There are also Cholmton and
Cholmondeston; but the feat of that branch of the
family, which kept our Prophet Nixon, is at Vale
Royal, on the river Weaver in Delamere forest. It
was formerly an Abbey founded by Edward I. and
came to the Cholmondeley's from the famous family
of the Holcro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts. When Nixon prophesied, this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
was near being extinct, the heir having mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33422:10"/>
Sir Walter St. John's daughter, a lady not
esteemed very young, who, notwithstanding being
with child, fell in labour, and continued so for some
days. During which time an eagle fat upon the
house-top, and flew away when she was delivered,
which proved to be a son.</p>
               <p>A Raven is also known to have built in a Stone
Lion's mouth, in the steeple of the Church of Over,
in the forest of Delamere. Not long before the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of King James, the wall spoken of fell
down and fell upwards, and in removing the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish,
were found the bones of a man of more than
ordinary size. A pond at the same time ran with
water that had a reddish tincture, and was never
known to have done so before or since.</p>
               <p>Headless Cross, in the Forest, which in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of man was several feet high, is now sunk
within half a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oot of the ground.</p>
               <p>In the parish of Budworth, a boy was born with
three thumbs; he had also two heels on one foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—
Lady Egerton, wishing well to another restoration,
often instigated her husband to turn Peter, the miller
of Negenshire mills, out of the mills; but he locoked
upon it as a whimsy, and so permitted Peter still to
ontinue there, in hopes of becoming as good a
knight as Sir Philip his landlord was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33422:10"/>Of this Peter I have been told that the Lady Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff,
of Chelsea, and the lady St. John of Battersea
have often been heard to talk, and that they both
asserted the truth of our Prophecy, and its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
with particulars that are more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
than any I have yet mentioned. The noise of
Nixon's predictions reaching the ears of King James
the First, he would needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee this fool, who cried
and made a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o that he might not go to Court; and
the reason that he gave was, That he should be
starved.</p>
               <p>(A very whimsical fancy of his: Courts are not
places where people use to starve in, when they
once come there, whatever they did before.) The
King being informed of Nixon's refusing to come,
said he would take particular care that he should
not be starved, and ordered him to be brought up.
Nixon cried out, He was sent for again, and soon
after the messenger arrived, who brought him up
from Cheshire.</p>
               <p>How or whether he prophesied to his Majesty, no
body can tell; but he is not the first fool that has
made a good Court Prophet.</p>
               <p>That Nixon might be well provided for, 'twas
ordered that he should be kept in the kitchen,
where he grew so troublesome in licking and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the meat, that the cooks locked him up in a
hole, and the King going on a sudden from Ham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33422:11"/>
Court to London, they forgot the fool in the
hurry, and he was really starved to death.</p>
               <p>There are a great many passages of this Fool-Phrophet's
life and sayings transmitted by tradition
from father to son in this county palatine; as, that
when he lived with a farmer, before he was taken
into Mr. Cholmondeley's family, he gored an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x so
cruelly, that one of the ploughmen threatened to
beat him for abusing his master's beast. Nixon
said, My master's beast will not be his three days.
A life in an estate dropping in that time, the Lord
of the manor took the same ox for an herriot. This
account, as whimsical and romantic as it is, was
told to the Lady Cowper, in the year 1670, by Dr.
Parric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Walter St. John; and that Lady had the following
farther particulars, relating to this Prophecy, and
the fulfilling of many parts of it, from Mrs
Chute, fister of Mrs. Cholmondeley, of Vale-Royal
who affirmed, that a multitude of people
gathering together to see the Eagle before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
the bird was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed,
and we shall have a foreign King. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that she read over the prophecy many
times, when her sister was with child of the heir
who now enjoys the estate. She particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33422:11"/>
membered that King James II. was plainly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, and that it was foretold he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to subvert the laws and religion of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for which reason they would rise and turn
him out; that the Eagle of which Nixon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
perched in one of the windows at the
time her sister was in labour. She said it was the
biggest bird she ever saw; that it was in a deep
snow, and that it perched on the edge of a great
bow-window, which had a large border on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and she and many others opened the
window, to try to scare it away, but it would
not stir till Mrs Cholmondeley was delivered;
after which it took flight to a great tree over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the room her sister lay in, where having
staid about three days, it flew away in the night.
She affirmed further to the Lady Cowper, that the
falling of the garden-wall was a thing not to be
questioned, it being in so many people's memory;
That it was foretold that the heir of Vale-Royal
should live to see England invaded by foreigners,
and that he should fight bravely for his King and
his country: That the Miller mentioned is alive,
and expects to be knighted, and is in the very
mill that is foretold: That he should kill two
invaders who would come in, the one from the
West, and the other from the North: That he
from the North should bring with him of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
Swedes, Danes, Germans, and Dutch; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33422:12"/>
that in the solds of his garments he should bring
fire and famine, plague and murder: That many
great battles should be fought in England, one
upon London Bridge, which would be so bloody,
that people would ride in London streets up to
their horses bellies in blood; that several other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
should be sought up and down most parts in
Cheshire; and that the last that ever would be
fought in England should be on Delamere fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est:
That the heir of Oalton, whose name is E—n,
and has married Earl Cholmondeley's si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, shall
be hanged up at his own gate.</p>
               <p>Lastly, He foretels great glory and prosperity
to those who stand up in defence of their laws and
liberties, and ruin and misery to those that should
betray them. He says, the year before this would
happen, bread-corn would be very dear, and that
the year following more troubles should begin
which would last three years; that the first would
be moderate, the second bloody, and the third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable;
that unless they were shortened no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
could bear them; and that there were no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
but what poor England would feel at that
time. But that <hi>George,</hi> the son of <hi>George,</hi> shall put
an end to all. That afterwards the Church should

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, and England be the most glorious nation
upon Earth. The same Lady Cowper was not
content to take these particulars from Mrs. Chute,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33422:12"/>
but she inquired of Sir Thomas Aston of the truth
of this Prophecy, and he attested it was in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in Cheshire, and that the facts were known
by every one to have happened as Nixon said they
would, adding, that the morning before the garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall
fell, his neighbour Mr. Cholmondeley going to
ride out a hunting, said, Nixon seldom fails, but
now I think he will; for he foretold that this day
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y garden wall would fall, and I think it looks as
if it would stand these forty years; that he had not
been gone a quarter of an hour before the wall split,
and fell upwards against the rising of the hill,
which, as Nixon would have it, was the presage of a
flourishing church.</p>
               <p>As to the removal of Pecserton mill, it was done
by Sir John Crewe, the mill having lost its trade
there, for which he ordered it to be set upon Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diton
hill; and being asked if he did it to fulfill the
Prophecy, he declared he never thought of it. I
myself have inquired of a person who knows Mr.
Cholmondeley's pond as well as Rosamond's in St.
James's Park, and he assured me the falling of
the wall, and the pond running blood as they call
it, are facts which, in Cheshire, any one would be
reckoned mad for making the least question of. As
there are several particulars in this Prophecy which
remain unfulfilled, so when they come to pass some
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33422:13"/>
other circumstances may be added, which are not
convenient to be told now for private reasons, but will
shortly appear.</p>
               <p>If I had a mind to look into the antiquities of this
county, I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind that Prodigies and Prophecies
are no unusual things there. Cambden tells us, that
at Brereton, not many miles from Vale Royal,
which gave name to a famous, antient, numerous,
and knightly family, there is a thing as strange as
the perching Eagle, or the falling of the wall,
which he says was attested to him by many persons,
and was commonly believed; that before any heir
of this family dies, there are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en in a lake adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the bodies of trees swimming upon the water
for several days together. He likewise adds, that
near the Abbey of St. Maurice, in Burgundy, there
is a fish-pond, in which a number of fishes are put
equal to the number of Monks of that place; and
if any one of them happens to be sick, there is a
fish seen floating on the water: and in case the fit
of sickness proves fatal to the Monk, the fish foretells
it by its own death some days before. This the
learned Cambden relates in his description of Cheshire,
and the opinion of the trees swimming in the lake
near Brereton prevails all about the country to this
day, only with this difference, that some say 'tis one
log that swims, and some say many.</p>

PREDICTIONS
Of that Holy, Learned, and Excellent Bishop
JAMES USHER,
Late Lord Primate of IRELAND.</head>
               <p>THE Author of the Life of this excellent
and worthy Primate and Archbishop,
gives an Account that, among other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Gifts and Graces, which it pleased the
Almighty to bestow upon him, he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
endued with a Spirit of Prophecy,
whereby he gave out several true Predictions
and Prophecies of Things a great while before
they came to pass, whereof some we have seen
fulfilled, and others remain y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33422:15"/>
And though he was one that abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Enthusiastic Notions, being too learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,
rational, and knowing, to admit of such idle
Freaks and Whimsies: Yet he professed, <q>That
several Times in his Life he had many Things,
impressed upon his Mind concerning future
Events, with so much Warmness and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
that he was not able to keep them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
but lay under an unavoidable Necessity
to make them known.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From which Spirit he foretold the <hi>Irish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
forty Years before it came to pass, with
the very Time when it should break forth, in a
Sermon preached in <hi>Dublin</hi> in 1601, where,
from <hi>Ezek.</hi> iv. 6, discoursing concerning the
Prophets bearing the Iniquity of <hi>Iudah</hi> forty
Days, the Lord therein appointed a Day for a
Year: He made this direct Application in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Connivance at Popery at that
Time. <hi>From this Year</hi> (says he) <hi>will I reckon
the Sin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that those whom you now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
shall be your R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>niquity.</hi> Which Prediction proved exactly
true, for from that Time 1601, to the Year
1641, was just forty Years, in which it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
known, that the Rebellion and Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction
of <hi>Ireland</hi> happened, which was acted
by those Popish Priests, and other Papists,
which were then connived at. And of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Bishop reserved the Notes, and put a
Note thereof in the Margin of his Bible; and
for twenty years before, he still lived in the
Expectation of the fulfilling thereof; and the
nearer the Time was, the more confident he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33422:15"/>
was that it was near Accomplishment, though
there was no visible Appearance of any such
Thing; and, (says Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi>) the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Rebellion broke forth, the Bishop
taking his Leave of me, being then going from
<hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> he advised me to a serious
Preparation, for I should see heavy Sorrows
and Miseries before I saw him again, which he
delivered with as great Confidence as if he had
seen it with his Eyes; which seems to verify
that of the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> iii. 7. <hi>Surely the
Lord will do nothing, but he will reveal it to his
Servants, the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this Spirit of Prophecy, he foresaw
the Changes and Miseries of <hi>England</hi> in Church
and State; for having in one of his Books,
called <hi>De Prim. Eccl. Brit.</hi> given a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Destruction of the Church and
State of the <hi>Britons,</hi> by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> about

               <p>From this Spirit he foresaw his own Poverty

of not writing any more; adding, That
if he did write any thing it should not exceed
above a Sheet or two: But upon my continued
Importunity, I at last obtained his Promise.</p>
               <p>He coming to Town some Time after, was
pleased to give me a Visit at my own House
where I failed not to challenge the Benefit of
the Promise he had made me: He replied,
<hi>That he had not writ, and yet he could not charge
himself with any Breach of Promise; For</hi> (said he)
<hi>I did begin to write, but when I came to write of
Sanctification, that is, of the New Creature which
God formeth by his Spirit in every Soul which he
doth truly regenerate, I found so little of it wrought
in myself, that I could speak of it only as Parrots
by Rote, and without the Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of what I might have expressed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I durst not presume to proceed any further
upon it.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>d amazed, to hear
such an humble Confession from so great and
experienced a Christian, He added, <hi>I must tell
you, We do not well understand what Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the New Creature are; It is no less than
for a Man to be brought to an entire Resignation of
his Will to the Will of God, and to live in the
Offering up of his Soul continually in the Flames of
Love, as a whole burnt Offering to Christ; and
how little</hi> (says he) <hi>are many of those who profess
Christianity experimentally acquainted with this
Work on their Souls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Discourse, I conceived he had very
excellently and clearly discovered to me that

                  </gap> of Sanctification which he was unwilling
to write.</p>
               <p>I then presumed to enquire of him what his
present Apprehensions were concerning a very
great Persecution which should fall upon the
Church of God in these Nations of <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which this reverend
Primate had spoken with great Confidence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years before, when we were in the highest
and fullest State of outward Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I asked him whether he did believe those
sad Times to be past, or that they were yet to
come? To which he answered, <hi>That they were
yet to come, and that he did as confidently expect i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of</hi> Europe; I replied, That I did hope it
might have been past as to these Nations of
ours, since I thought that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ugh we, who
are the People thereof, have been punished
much less than our Sins have deserved, and
that our late Wars had made far less Devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than War commonly brings upon those
Countries where it pleaseth God in Judgment
to suffer it; yet we must needs acknowledge,
that many great Houses had been burnt, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and left without Inhabitants, many great
Families impoverished and undone, and many

you all you have yet seen, hath been but the

than ever yet was upon them; and therefore

before the Altar, for Christ will measure all
those that profess his name, and call themselves
his People; and the outward Worshippers he
will leave out to be trodden down by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
The outward Court (<hi>says he</hi>) is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Christian, whose Religion lies in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the outside duties of Christianity, without
having an inward Life and Power of Faith and
Love, uniting them to Christ, and these God will
leave to be trodden down, and swept away by
the Gentiles; but the Worshippers within the
Temple, and before the Altar, are those who
do indeed worship God in spirit and in truth,
whose souls are made his Temples, and he is
honoured and adored in the most inward
Thoughts of their Hearts, and they sacrifice

                  </gap>
which I have before observed him to have,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33422:18"/>
when I have heard him foretel some things
which in all human appearance were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to come to pass, which yet I myself have
lived to see happen according to his prediction,
and this made me give the more earnest atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to what he then uttered.</p>
               <p>He then added, <q>That the <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This was the substance, and, I think, for the
greatest part, the very same words which this
Holy Man spake to me at the time before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
not long before his death, and which I
writ down, that so great and notable a predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>This gracious man repeated the same things

the same time that he had expressed what is
aforesaid to me, and which the Lady <hi>Tyrril</hi>
assured me of with her own m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That opening the Door of his Chamber, she
found him with his Eyes lift up to Heaven, and
the Tears running apace down his Cheeks, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>

continued for about half an Hour, not taking
the least Notice of her, though she came into
the Room; but at last turning to her, he told
her, That his Thoughts had been taken up
about the Miseries and Persecutions that were
coming upon the Churches of Christ, which
would be so sharp and bitter, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of them had fetched those Tears
from his Eyes.</p>
               <p>The same Things he also repeated to the

this way as any, yet with me it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
that so great a Prophet, so sanctified

are the ways of ungodliness, and their paths
are those of injustice and oppression. In those
days (and they are at hand) the mighty Lord
of truth shall avenge the injuries of his people,
and his name shall be known throughout.
The reign of his justice shall succeed that of
his mercy, and long forbearance; his mighty
arm shall exalt the humble, and prostrate the

that the blood of Africans shall be repaid, and

            <p>It is to be lamented that the Compiler could
not collect the whole of this great man's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
but hopes to get them shortly, being
promised them by a friend, who will interpret
them faithfully from the old Irish. The fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of M`Auliffes were formerly an ancient
Irish family in the County of Cork, and possessed
of large estates there; some of which are now
enjoyed by the respectable families of the name
of St. Leger, who purchased them; this great
prophet foretold the transferring of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
property, and the total extinction of his
name, which he said would be forgotten, and
hardly remembered by the rising generations;
which has all turned out as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e foretold. He
also foretold a gentleman in his days, named
Anthony St. Leger, that he would live to a
great age, providing he would never pass over
Bennet's Bridge in the county of Kilkenny, and
if he would, that there he most undoubtedly
was to lose his life; but as destiny in human
circumstances is by some deemed unavoidable,
it was most unfortunately verified in Mr. S.
who lost his life by a gun shot at Bennet's
Bridge, by the following accident:—One of
his carriage horses had dropped a shoe travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through that country, from which accident
Mr. S. could not pursue his journey without
getting a shoe on his beast, and being told there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33422:20"/>
was a smith's forge at Bennet's Bridge, on his
way, he drove to the fatal place (where a forge
remains to this day) but there had not been
any person at work in it; the smith was found,
and applied to, to put a shoe on the horse with
all convenient dispatch; who excused himself,
saying he had no iron. The horse being lame,
and not able to go on further without a shoe,
necessitated Mr. S. to get out of his carriage
and im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortune the smith to search diligently for
iron sufficient for the purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when after a

having recourse to an old rusty gun barrel,
from which a shot had not been fired p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shoe: little did Mr. S. think of M`Auliffe's
prophecy, or eternity at hand, whilst he stood
in the forge all the time. The rusty old gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrel,
which had been load<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ball of a long time, no sooner had got the
heat of the fire, than the contents went off,
and unluckily killed Mr. S. on the spot, which
shews that Mr. S. had either disbelieved or had
forgotten the Prophet's caution, which too
often has been the case of many, who are
ashamed of taking council in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The following other prophecy of M'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe's,
has not yet come to pass, and is dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
shall the Protestants and Romanists (Papists) kill
each other with great slaughter. But as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
have been spoken and wrote in Irish, it is
left with the wise and sagacious to explain his
words, which signify battles between the Sasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughs
and Irish. The Irish word Sasanough
signifies an English Protestant, and what is
difficult to explain; whether between the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Romish persuasion, aginst the other
dissenting sects in Ireland, or nation against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is not easy to say.</p>
            <p>Another of his prophecies is as follows:
<q>
                  <l>In seventeen hundred ninety and five,</l>
                  <l>Whoever will be at that period alive,</l>
                  <l>Will see plenty revisit this fortunate land,</l>
                  <l>And Ireland emerg'd from her slavish command;</l>
                  <l>Ere the period arrives will a torrent of blood,</l>
                  <l>Discolour'd, be forc'd from it's primitive flood;</l>
                  <l>The verdure of Spring will be shaded with red,</l>
                  <l>And the fruits of the earth oppress'd with the dead.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It should be seriously remarked, that the year
1795 has been pointed out particularly by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Prophets, as a year of greater destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and human slaughter than any year previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
even Mrs. Shipton prophecied a century
or two back, that E—'s ruin would begin in
1792, and terminate in 1795. The wicked in
all nations and ages ridicule prophecies, never
acknowledging the ordained will of an angry
Providence; yet they are always more fearful
than such as believe: and though it appears in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33422:21"/>
holy writ, that revolutions happen from the
foundation of the world, and will to the end of
time; yet the Almighty always, and without
exception, gives some people the gift of foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
such changes in human affairs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
declares he will not do any such things,
but he will first impart to his servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
And as often as he threatens his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with any dreadful change, it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them it proceeds from his wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
originating from their intolerable
wickedness, and changing his love into hatred,
yet always and at all times promises to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the scourge or persecution, if the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nations of people will cry out for mercy,
and call in fervency upon his holy name, to
come to their a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

wrath and vengeance from them, but they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never do, though he quotes examples
(to every succeeding generation in vain) viz.
Noah's flood, the cities of Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,
with many others, when the people
laughed at predictions, and timely advice, as
they do still. In the whole course of human
affairs holy writ proves his threats and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are all conditional, calculated to stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
people to call always on him for mercy,
and to execute his easy commands, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his doctrines in the new Testament; be

him, and in the blind career of their lives have
insensibly bid defiance to him and his laws.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33422:22"/>
that the text of scripture in the book of Esdras
may be fulfilled to their eternal condemnation,
wherein the Lord God desires Esdras not mind
who shall be damned, but seek after them who
shall be saved, for Hell was created for the
multitude, and Heaven for the few. Let all
who read this book strive to be of that few,
and mind the rules mentioned therein, and also
in the new Testament, and if they do not, they
will be outcasts in Hell, and all their finery and

               </gap>ad, and fulfilled to the utmost of human
power, the mighty God would not have so
great cause against his creatures, or to warn
them to turn to him (the merciful and loving
Father) by the voice of Prophets and other
warnings, than that blessed book. Is he not
constantly looking down from his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(the variety of the glories and pleasures of
which never yet entered the heart of mankind
to conceive the least idea of,) on the wicked
universe with grief and sorrow, saying, O my
people, my people, how often would I have
gathered ye together, as a hen gathers her
chickens, but ye would not. Hear now, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
you have a loving God, a weeping God,
and a God who tells you in the bible his nature
and his name is Love, with out-stretched arms,
open to receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ter performing faithfully all

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33422:22"/>
the alluring ways of this world, in
which all your thoughts are enveloped) expect
the dreadful sentence from him, who will then,
he says, appear to ye as a roaring Lion, and
say I know ye not; go ye accursed into ever<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lasting
torments, prepared for the Devil and his
servants. Let none be alarmed at the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in France, such revolutions must happen
in all idolatrous nations; they corroborate
with the holy bible, a nation shall be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a day, that is, emerging from idolatry and
idolatrous persecution, at destined periods, in
the fulness of the time of the Most High, and
so on previous to the coming of the great Judge,
idolatrous Monarchs must be all cut off. But
if mighty men should plan and scheme for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
to reduce things to their own human
weak and wicked wishes, their labour is in
vain, they are mocked by God, they cannot
see into the great causes; they are greedy for
dominion and filthy lucre, they are cruel and
unjust, and all their ways are an abomination
before the face of the great One; they are
poor, blind, naked, miserable, foolish and
wicked. Give attention now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dress, and pride, which Christ says is of
your father the Devil; cease from superfluous
dress, be a Quaker entirely in dress, and a very
plain one, for your soul's sake, to obey Christ,
and fulfill the holy scriptures, cry aloud to the
Most High (with the true baptismal tears of
repentance) which is the real water baptism
of salvation, previous to the operation of the
Holy Ghost, and externally described in the
third chapter of St. John in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Beware of hypocrisy, ostentation, and
falsehood, banish these hydras from the inmost
recesses of your hearts; make room there for
the Holy Ghost to dwell in, for with them hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras
he cannot dwell, and without him do not
trouble yourselves to look forward to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
do not strive to please human creatures,
or you cannot please God; talk no more of
fashions or of the circle of your acquaintances,
such conversation is abominable to God; boast
no more of your acquaintances, Lord such a
one, or Lady such a one, they are earth and
dirt, titles are sacrilegeous and blasphemous,
which is always the consequence of accursed
wealth, for wealth is a curse from God, because
it never was and never will be applied as God
commanded it, therefore he declares it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of
Heaven than for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle; when a person gets wealth he gets
pride, and contempt for all who do not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
the same curse, wealth, and in consequence
of that wealth and pride, the Devil instigates
him to renounce his name, and take the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33422:23"/>
name of a river, a town, a hill, or a
province, and tacks God's name and title to
it. Then he is exalted, and God positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
and says, whoever exalts himself shall
surely be abased, that is, cast into Hell; and
thus does the Devil sport with all wealthy
people, and proud people, and dressy people.
Dress draws every curse from God down upon
the soul; the more dressy, the more vicious;
clothing was first invented to cover sin and
shame, and ought therefore be as plain as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
besides God strictly commands it should
be so. Now, hear the declaration of a fine
shewy dressy person to God, viz. I will dress,
powder, curl, and paint, to spite you, God,
because you desire me not; I will flirt, laugh,
please and be pleased, praise and be praised,
read plays, romances, and all other devilish
books, because you say all those will corrupt
me, and that I must account for every idle
word I speak; I will not read the bible, nor do
therein, because you desire me, for every thing
you command me I will not do, and every
thing you forbid me I will do, God, because
my father and mother brought me up this way,
and they follow the same life themselves, for
we all prefer the damnation of Hell, to you
and your old book filled with stories of love,
terrors, Heaven, Hell, and all such tedious
nonsense, to people of fashion going into Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The more wicked and abominable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is before God, the more glaringly they wish
to adorn the filthy carcase, iniquity invented

people should perceive their own damnation,
and rebel against idolatry; the contagion is in
England, Ireland, &amp;c.; the world is teeming

               </gap>hapes, previous to the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is now the general dread of the
people, teeming with iniquity, and filled with
terrors without one single exception among the
wicked. whenever the Almighty intendsany great
event he puts it more or less in the people's minds
before the execution, to induce them to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for there is no other way to prevent his
wrath. But instead, they continue to act as
if they were never to die, and blinding each
other with praise, flattery, hypocrisy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
Suppose Christ was this instant to come
down and judge all people, shewing Heaven's
great expanse of innumerable pleasures on one
side, and Hell's yawning torments on the other,
how would the proud and dressy appear?
Would the not with their pride and fashionable
dress in Hell, where it originated? Are they
the pious holy people, marked with the Holy
Ghost to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ, whose face is of flaming fire? Or are
they those pointed out in the bible, who are
marked by the Devil, to devote themselves to
the pleasures and passions of this Hell-grown
world? Let them answer for themselves; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

souls for fashionable dress &amp; pride; and as
God says, cannot escape the damnation of Hell.
Therefore, Readers, do not ye be of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
number, but follow the advice given in
this little pamphlet of very great value; cast
away instantly your fashionable dress, pride,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rippery, and all accursed worldly show, and
you will make the Devil fly away from you,
roaring with despair; and God and the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
host of Heaven will shout for joy, and
the windows of Heaven will be opened unto
you. Give atrention now, ye wealthy, ye great
wicked ones, who are squandering thousands
and tens of thousands yearly in superfluous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
which are the works of the son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Squander your thousands on the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of millions of bibles, new testaments,
hymn books, and psalm books, scatter them
among the people like corn before the plow,
by which all the human race will learn to know
the Lord, and do his blessed will; propagate
the gospel of Christ in its original purity, until
all the people shall know that the gospel sound
alone is sure salvation, and not the abominable
works of man's hands; renounce idolatry; sue
for the property of the distressed, when wronged
by the unjust; distrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te justice without favour
or affection, and God will love you and keep
you in safety. Read the bible the ensuing long
winter evenings, ye and your families; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33422:25"/>
it to each other every night, and if at
leisure in the day time also. Glorify God, let
your conversation turn on every verse, on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
chapter you read, of the wonderful works
of the Lord Iesus Christ and his Apostles:
then your conversation will be in Heaven, and
this is also the communion of Saints, so little
understood in this world. Let that same Jesus
never leave your thoughts; this is what the
Apostle means, where he says, pray without
ceasing; this incessant silent meditation on
Jesus, is certain salvation; this is worshiping in
spirit and in truth, because God is in Christ,
your souls then feed on him, and grow rich in
grace, and grace is the gradual operation of the
Holy Ghost, which brings you from glory to
glory. Let all men and women be exhorters
to good, by their profound knowledge of the
bible, which will abolish evil from the human
race; empty your purses to put all the indigent
to industry, who have the inclination but not
the means; and after doing all these things,
and ten thousand times more, do not take the
least merit to yourselves; it is not ye that do
it, it is the Holy Ghost in ye; therefore give
all the merit to God, and all the glory; and
then know he has only done ye the honor of
choosing ye to be useful machines to do his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
and if ye are conscious in your hearts
it is so, and that ye firmly believe that property
which ye so distribute is his, and not your own,
(as all wealthy fools imagine) then the wide
expanse of Heaven is open for your enjoyment
as soon as your fervency of love for him desire
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33422:25"/>
it, with millions of millions of pleasures, with
him on his holy mountain; do all those things
if you can, and if you can and do not, read your
dreadful sentence in the new testament. Give
attention again, ye wealthy; cast away all your

               </gap>ereat:
and therefore I beseech you, in the Name of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS
CHRIST, do not defile your Souls which
are dear and precious, by any wilful sin: and
amongst other things, do not ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Name of God in vain, for the Lord will not
hold him or her guiltless that taketh his holy
Name in vain.</p>
            <p>GOD is willing to save you; why should any
of you lose and destroy yourselves? Observe
this attentively; for notwithstanding all that
the LORD has done, and is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Abstain from drunkenness, and all excess,
and from every appearance of evil, love one
another, as JESUS CHRIST hath loved you;
apply yourselves to the witness of God within
you, which reproves you for evil; submit to,
and obey its holy manifestations and discoveries
and it will do much more for you than a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is the word of his Grace, even the word of Life,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33422:28"/>
the Holy Ghost, which is able to save your
souls. In the love of the Gospel, I invite
you all to come and taste how good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
the LORD is towards all those that return
to him with their whole hearts. If you are
such a one, who can, through an ill habit and
bad custom, curse, swear, and do any other bad
action, almost without reproof or feeling;
though your case be so desperate, there is yet
mercy with God that he may be feared: and
I advise you to endeavour to be still a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
in the morning, when you awake, before
you rise up, and then think seriously with
yourself thus: <q>I have not given my being to
myself: I am accountable to the Author
and Creator of it; and this day He (the
LORD of all) will take notice of all my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
this day he will hear all my Words;
this day he will know all my thoughts;
and at a certain time (yet unknown to me
when) my soul must give him a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q>
I am not without some degree of
hope, that such serious reflections may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive
to raise desires like these: <q>Oh! that I
may be watchful. Oh! that I may sin no
more as long as I live:</q> For we must cease
to do evil before we can learn to do well.
Therefore silence before the LORD, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his reproofs of instruction in your own
heart, which are the way to life, are the first
steps to come to CHRIST, and to be made a
real Christian.</p>

be quenched by putting dry fuel on it, which
will make it burn more violent; oppression always
terminates in human slaughter, though the fire
may be a century kindling, or centuries: it

like a death bed repentance, which
God does not listen to; for what man worth
five, ten, or twenty thousand pounds yearly, in
the hands of a banditti of assassins, would not
give it all for his life. Here follows the
preventative: take a poor man, and settle
him in a comfortable situation, making him
pay (or fecure) a reasonable valuation; then
see what family he has, and for himself, wife,
and children, abate twenty shillings yearly,
each, on the following terms, give him the
book called the new testament, and then say,
do you and your family read this as often as ye
are at leisure, and whilst you perform its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
I will keep you in the comfortable place
I have given, but no longer: wealthy one, you
must do more, establish a school in your parish,
or neighbourhood, and pay the teacher also;
and thus do ye wealthy ones, with all the poor,
and idolatry goes to destruction; the poor will
all love you, and God will love you, the poor
will revolt at the idea of invasion, or revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

a million of guineas, and all people you suspect
for wishing your overthrow, give them a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea

America. But this last advice will not prevent
an invasion, it would be only a foolish act of
charity, that God reqnires; besides, it wonld
depopulate the nation, and lessen the rent roll,
then would the wealthy cry out, O my rent roll,
my rent roll is not half what it was; but God
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33422:42"/>
will answer, O thy rent roll has shut thee out
eternally from me, thou did not send my mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
among the nations (that is to distribute
the new testament among the poor); thou did
not propagate the gospel. You will say your
Ministers did propagate the gospel, but the
Lord will say. your Ministers are ordained with
human forms, but my Ministers are ordained
with the Holy Ghost, from the foondations of
the world, but ye and your Ministers persecute
them: and perhaps he will even say, ye have
also called yourselves Lords, and great ones
who are but earth, which names and titles are
for me only, and how can you look in my

            <head>EXTRACTS,
FROM
DUPATY'S TRAVELS,
IN ITALY.</head>
            <p>IN my way to the capitol I met a coach,
in which were two recollet Friars, the
one seated backwards, the other forwards,
holding between their legs something I could
not distinguish. Every one stopped and saluted
with profound respect. I asked to whom this
reverence was addressed. It is, answered one
of the standers-by, to the Bambino, which
these good Fathers are carrying to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
who is very ill and given over by his
physicians.</p>
            <p>I afterwards procured an explanation what
this Bambino was. The Bambino is a little
wooden Jesus, richly dressed and ornamented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:33422:43"/>The Convent, which has the good fortune
to possess this image, neither has, nor needs any
other patrimony.</p>
            <p>As soon as any person (who can afford the
expence,) is seriously ill, they send for the
Bambino, and always in a coach, for he never
goes on foot. Two Recollets conduct, and
place him by the sick man, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
at his expence, until he dies or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers.</p>
            <p>The Bambino is constantly running about;
they sometimes fight who shall have him at the
gate of the Convent, and tear him from each
other; in the Summer, especially, he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
business, though he makes them
pay very dearly for his visits, on account of
the demand, and the hot weather. This is
but fair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:33422:44"/>THE progress, insolence, and intolerable
tyranny of the church of Rome, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of serious consideration and publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
the establishment of which will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be the destruction of church, state, laws,
liberties, properties, and lives. The Protestant
writers, ever since the Revolution, have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and effectually exposed and confuted
this pernicious doctrine, calculated to plunder
and rob the ignorant and illiterate; to whom
only the Church of Rome pretends to be the
mother and mistress of all churches; and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineers
the vulgar and wicked into that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or faith; always exerting her tyranny to
continue them in the grossest darkness, and from
a knowledge of the Gospel light from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to generation.</p>
            <p>The Pope always imposes a belief on the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that he is successor to Christ, St. Peter,
&amp;c. and such blasphemy; and none can be saved
but his subjects: and eating of all the luxuries
and dainties in the world, on a friday or satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
sends people to Heaven, except meat,
which sends to Hell, but all his, wicked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33422:44"/>
being contrary to that of Christ, he takes

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are the gospel light shall be kept from them,
as long as he can; well knowing a general
knowledge of it, would destroy his craft, as St.
Paul did that of Alexander the Copper-Smith.</p>
