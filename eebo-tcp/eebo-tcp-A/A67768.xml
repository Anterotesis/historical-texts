            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Hiloſophy teaches, that admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and corrections are the chiefeſt offices of love: That it is the onely true love, which to profit and do good, feareth not to hurt and offend: That to connive at our friends faults, is to make them our own. That ſharp reprehenſion is the healing of the ſoul; and that love to the ſoul, is the very ſoul of love. Whence <hi>Euripides</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101589:3"/>
men to get ſuch friends, as would not ſpare to diſpleaſe them. Whence <hi>Scipio</hi> the Elder, when his friends for ſo doing tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his enemies, was able to ſay, <hi>I have given my enemies as great cauſe to love me, as my friends.</hi> And indeed he that loves not ſuch a friend, hates himſelf. And commonly, he that will not tell us of our faults, will be very ready to tell others of them: whereas one that is faithful, will ſpeak of our faults to our face, of our virtues behind our backs. But ſee farther the ſweet fruit of ſharp reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Suppoſe one ſhould be ſtung by a Bee, (when aſleep) whereby he is delivered from a Serpent, which otherwiſe had ſtung him to death: Hath he cauſe to complain? And not to chide a friend, leſt we offend him, is to let him drown, rather than catch him by the hair. Wherefore give me ſuch a friend as <hi>Photion,</hi> who when a friend of his would have caſt himſelf away, ſuffered him not, ſaying; <hi>I was made thy friend to this purpoſe.</hi> All which is found Divinity, neither wants it Scripture-ſeal to confirm it. Not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh our brother, is to hate him, as the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. But to ſcorn our brother ſhould admoniſh us, is more to hate our ſelves; in that <hi>open rebuke is better than ſecret love.</hi> And for that <hi>the very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101589:3"/>
wounds of a lover are faithful, and better than the kiſſes of an enemy, Prov.</hi> 27.5, 6. Yea, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches, that no friend is ſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this caſe as an enemy; becauſe he tels us of that, which otherwiſe we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo happy as to hear of.</p>
               <p>Nevertheles, reſolved ſinners ſcorn reproof: Admonition to them, is like goads to ſuch as are mad already: or like powring oyl down the chimney, which may ſet the houſe on fire, but never abate the heat; which is not for want of ignorance: for by refuſing to hear in this caſe, they become (like <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>) wilful murtherers of their own ſouls, as wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> affirms, his words are, <hi>He that refuſeth admonition is bruitiſh, and deſtroyeth his own ſoul, Prov.</hi> 12.1. and 15.32. yea, he goes further, and ſayes, <hi>A man that hardeneth his neck when he is reproved, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cannot be cured, Prov.</hi> 29.1. and 1.24, 25, 26. of which you have moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dreadful examples, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16, 20.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Nevertheleſſe, how few are there ſo wiſe, as to take admonition well? For, <hi>Reprove a ſcorner</hi> (that is, a fool) <hi>and he will hate thee; reprove a wiſe man, and he will love thee, Prov</hi> 9.8. To which we may add <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>A wiſe man foreſeeth the evil,</hi> (that is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101589:4"/>
evil of Hell, ſayes <hi>Bernard) and preventeth it; but fools go on and are puniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that theſe Bruits and Soul-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may the better be known to themſelves and others, and the greatneſſe of their folly and madneſſe, together with what a world of them there are amongſt us, (for to be wiſe, according to wiſe <hi>Solomons</hi> deſcription, is the portion but of a few, as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence witneſſeth.) I will paint them out in a ſmall table, or map; and ſo expoſe them to view.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place you ſhall know them by this mark: A man no ſooner tels them of a fault, but it works in their brains as yeeſt in a barrel, until they have requited their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſher with a miſchief; being like gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, to which you no ſooner give fire, but they fly in your face. Admonition may move them to choller, never to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Who when they have heard an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toothſom truth, like waters after a tempeſt, are full of working and ſwelling againſt their Admoniſher. We read that in the Law of jealouſies, if the ſuſpected wife were guilty, that drank of the bitter waters of trial, ſhe would preſently ſwell, if otherwiſe, ſhe was well enough. And it is a ſure ſigne the Horſe is gauled, that ſtirs too much when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101589:4"/>
he is touched; ſo when they ſwell againſt their Reprehender, and hiſſe like Serpents, if we trouble their neſts never ſo little, you may juſtly conclude them guilty perſons. For no greater ſigne of innocencie, when we are accuſed, than mildneſſe, as we ſee in <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 39.17.18. And <hi>Suſannah, Suſan. ver.</hi> 42, 43. And <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15, 16. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there a greater ſymptome of guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, than our breaking into choller, when we have any thing laid to our charge: witneſſe <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.9. that Hebrew which ſtrook his fellow, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.13, 4. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.32, 33. <hi>Abner,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.27. <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16. <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Herod</hi> the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trach, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.19, 20. The men of <hi>Nazareth, Luke</hi> 4.28, 29. The Phariſees, <hi>John</hi> 8.47, 48. The High Prieſts and Scribes, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.19, 20. And the like touching a mans wiſdome and humility. <hi>Plato</hi> being demanded, how he knew a wiſe man, anſwered, <hi>When being rebuked he would not be angry, and being praiſed he would not be proud.</hi> And to this accords that of the wiſe man, <hi>Prov<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 11.2. and 19 <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. But for one that is ſo wiſe, there is a thouſand of thoſe fools I am to decipher, who with <hi>Balaam</hi> will grutch to be hindered in their way to Hell, and fly upon thoſe that oppoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101589:5"/>
their perdition: even ſuch as think it better to fry everlaſtingly in a furnace of fire and brimſtone in Hell-flames, than to inherit a celeſtial and eternal Kingdome, and weight of ſuperabundant Glory in Heaven, to enjoy a Paradiſe of pleaſure, where are ſuch joyes, <hi>as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can ever enter into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. This is moſt mens depth of brain, and thus it fares with all wilful and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners. But how hath the Devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht them? Is it poſſible that the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſoul of man (not profeſſedly barbarous) ſhould be capable of ſuch a monſter? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if I did not know the truth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of it, by occular and experimental de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration from day to day, I could hardly bring my underſtanding to beleeve it!</p>
               <p>But to make this further appear, though I have ſmall hope to prevail with the parties themſelves (for they that have no reaſon, will hear none; and he that learns of none but himſelf, hath a fool for his Teacher.) Guilty ſinners will ſwell againſt their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender, innocent ſouls will be cheered and cleered by it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.21, 22. Reſolved of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders being reproved, in ſtead of penitence break into choller, fury ſparkles in thoſe eyes which ſhould guſh out with water, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101589:5"/>
in ſtead of embracing the counſel, will rage at the Counſellour. Croſſed wickedneſſe proves deſperate, and in ſtead of yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeks for revenge of its own ſins upon others uprightneſſe: whereas if anothers ſimple fidelity ſhews it ſelf in reproving the honeſt-hearted, he loves his Monitor ſo much the more, by how much the more he ſmarteth, allowing of truth as well when it hurts him, as when it helps him.</p>
               <p>But unſound fleſh loves to be ſtroked, the leaſt roughneſſe puts it into a rage; a feſtered conſcience will not endure a drawing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a putrid and ſcabbed limb delights to be ſcratcht and rubbed, foule faces would have falſe glaſſes: <hi>Diomedes</hi> muſt have a crooked ſhooe for his wry foot: <hi>Caligula</hi> muſt be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a God, forſooth, though he live like a Devil, poyſoning his unckle, and deflowring all his ſiſters. Thorns muſt be touched with a gentle hand, not graſped; theſe ulcers muſt be no further ſearched into, than the dead fleſh reaches, for if you but touch them to the quick, you ſhall quickly hear of it, and be ſure to ſmart for it.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101589:6"/>
my intended matter, or at uttermoſt but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a Preparative before hand, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians do to their Patients, that their phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick may work the more kindly, your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour hath for many years preached in the Metropolitane City, where they are more civilized and better bred, without any cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; yea, with much approbation: for they enterteined him as <hi>Lot</hi> did thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that came to fetch him out of Sodom: but you enterteine him as courſely, as the Ammonites did <hi>Davids</hi> meſſengers. Nor did the Devil ever ſo rage in this rude place, as he hath done ſince his preaching hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened your conſciences, and by the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe of the Law, and light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſhewen you the deformity &amp; filthineſs of your ſouls. A notable argument that Satan fears he ſhall be routed, and his Kingdome more ſhaken in your quarters, than hath fallen out in former times, or by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any that have gone before him, for he daily rages more and more amongſt you. As for inſtance, at firſt he was oppoſed by a few ſimple Sectaries, and that was no ſmall honour to him, as <hi>Hiram</hi> told <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the like caſe. But now his preaching againſt drunkennes, deceitfulnes, ſwearing, Sabbath-breaking, ignorance, formality, and ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101589:6"/>
other common ſins, hath brought all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh about his ears; not alone the wit-foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Drunkard, but the civil Juſticiary, the formal Hypocrite, the ignorant Animal, and all ſorts of impenitent ſinners. And why? But becauſe the virtue and efficacie of Gods word, which is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide between the ſoul and ſpirit, joynts and marrow, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. hath diſcovered and made manifeſt to your ſelves and others, the very ſecrets and moſt inward intents of your hearts. Inſomuch that your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are forced to bear witneſs againſt your ſelves, that you are the parties to whom he ſpeaks, as if he named you, or each of you in particular, as you have an inſtance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. whence your guilty conſciences ſuggeſt, that he aims at you in particular, though he names none, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is onely the prerogative and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity of the Word above all other writings, to diſcover the hearts, and ſpeak home to the conſciences of all that hear it delivered with power and authority. As for the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, the truth of his heart gives him bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to profeſs before him who onely knows it, that he ſtrives againſt no man but his ſtrife, malignes no man but his malice, envies no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101589:7"/>
man but his envie, as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeaks. Yea, he could be more glad to ſee any mans (even his greateſt enemies) amendment, than his puniſhment. This (I ſay) is the genuine reaſon, why hundreds of you fret, and chaſe, and fume, and ſwell, and ſtorm, and rage, and are ready to burſt again when you hear him. Your ſins and deformities are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and detected, your preſumptuous confidence of being Chriſtians good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and of your going to Heaven ſo que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, that your peace is diſturbed, and you will be revenged of ſome body.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that when our Saviour ſent forth his Apoſtles to preach abroad in the world, having firſt taught them the way, his words to them were, <hi>Behold, I ſend you forth, as ſheep amongst wolves, Matth.</hi> 10.16. Are not you theſe wolves? not onely wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, but meer wolves; yes, you are, and will be, until the Goſpel ſhall have wrought a change in your hearts and natures, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. and 20.29. Again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. he ſayes, <hi>Cast not your pearls before ſwine, lest they tread them under their feet, and turning again all to reut you.</hi> Are not you thoſe unreaſonable beaſts and ſwine? If not, who are? Yea, you are more bruitiſh than a ſwine, or any other unreaſonable creature.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101589:7"/>
For whereas Chriſt by his Miniſters, would reconcile you to God, as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abſalom</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> by the woman of Tekoah; you cry they <hi>come to torment you before the time, Matth.</hi> 8.29. Your caſe is juſt like his in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that called himſelf <hi>Legion,</hi> who having been poſſeſt with Devils a long time, was at length very loth to part with his gueſts: yea, he thought himſelf tormented, when Chriſt came to caſt out them, and ſave him, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.28.</p>

For this makes you hate him above meaſure, miſ-conſtrue his actions and intentions, rail on him, ſlander him, curſe him, withſtand and contrary his doctrine, watch for his halting, combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and lay plots how you may do him the moſt miſchief, which is all you are able to do: for elſe you would bring him before the Magiſtrate, impriſon, ſmite, wound, and put him to death, as the Jews ſerved Chriſt, as I could ſhew you from a world of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and examples out of the Word. See onely <hi>John</hi> 16.2, 33. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.34, 35, 36. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.51, 52, 53. and 21.16, 17: But our comfort is, you have not ſo much authority as malice; reſembling the Serpent <hi>Porphyrus,</hi> which abounds with poiſon, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101589:8"/>
can hurt none, for want of teeth. Though your puniſhment ſhall be never the leſſe; for good and evil thoughts, and deſires, in Gods account, are good and evil works, and ſhall ſo be judged in that Court of Juſtice where is no partiality.</p>
               <p>But ſince you cannot do as you would, you will do what you can; as it fared with <hi>Zoilus</hi> that common ſlanderer, or as it does with the Devil, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.15. For if the Law binds your hands, yet you will be ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with your tongues; and if the Law ſo keeps you in awe, that you dare not ſmite him on the mouth, as the High Prieſt did <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23.2. Yet you will do what you dare, you will ſmite him with the mouth, as <hi>Ziba</hi> did honeſt <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.3. And the like touching his maintenance, becauſe you cannot out him of his living, you will defraud and rob him of his means and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and neither pay him a peny your ſelves, nor ſuffer others, ſo far as you can help it, which is a plot to pluck up all religion by the roots: For how ſhould our Paſtours feed our ſouls, if we feed not their bodies? How ſhould the lamp burn, if we take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the holy oyl that ſhould maintein it? and in caſe it burn not, there will be but a dark houſe. So that to expect that Miniſters
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101589:8"/>
ſhould preach without maintenance, is as if you ſhould ſhut a bird into a cage, give her no meat, and yet bid her ſing.</p>
               <p>Never the leſſe it pleaſes you, that you can (as you think) diſpleaſe him, and withall pleaſure your ſelves in ſaving your ſilver, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dreaming what you do; for look but narrowly into it, and you ſhall ſee that this is not onely perſecution, theft, ſacriledge, murther of bodies and ſouls, of provoking God to ſend a famine of his Word, and the like: but you become by it guilty of high treaſon againſt God, in thus uſing his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, and againſt Chriſt and all his members, as I have elſwhere made manifeſt. Though it is wicked enough for you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach his credit, aſperſe his ſpotleſſe name, and take away his reputation, that ſo none elſe may hear him, or regard what he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which is a wickeder plot than your blind ſouls are able to diſcern.

               <p>Indeed his life is ſo well known, that all the harm you do him is, but as a candle to a white wall: that may much black it (among ſuch Senſualiſts as your ſelves) but cannot burn it, though that be too much, for a mans
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101589:9"/>
good name is like a milk white ball, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly gathers ſoil even with toſſing.</p>
               <p>Nor can he expect to fare better, ſo long as he tarries with you, where Satan hath his throne, in a place that moſtly conſiſts of Swearers, Drunkards, and Drink-ſellers. He hath by his powerful preaching raiſed the Devil in many of you, but it will be hard laying him again: yea, once to expect it (when God hath given men over to their own luſts) were an effect of frenzie, not of hope. For can he with <hi>Crabronius,</hi> be ever pudling in a waſps neſt, and think to eſcape their ſtings? Or be ſtill blowing in the duſt, and not endanger his eyes? It is no way poſſible. For, he that toucheth pitch ſhall be defiled therewith. <hi>He that reproveth a ſcorner, purchaſeth to himſelf ſhame: and he that rebuketh the wicked, getteth himſelf a blot, Prov.</hi> 9.7, 8. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Though I ſpeak not this to diſ-hearten him, whom God hath placed over you: for Gods glory we are bound to redeem with our own lives. And a conſcionable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is like <hi>David,</hi> who would venture upon a Bear, rather than loſe a Lamb. Or <hi>Jacob,</hi> who would endure heat by day, and froſt by night, rather than neglect his flocks. Or <hi>Moſes,</hi> who would fight with odds, rather

               <p>Nor can I wiſh him to ſpare you ever the more, by delivering himſelf in a gentler tone; as you, like the men of <hi>Bengala,</hi> would have onely words of down and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, have him ſpeak nothing but pure ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But I dare refer the caſe to thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to determine, (if the cuſtome of ſin, and the god of this world hath not totally blinded thee) where the fault lies, and who is to be blamed in this particular? Is the Phyſician to be blamed for the pain of his Patient, or the diſeaſe? The Chirurgeon or the wound, which he endeavors by all means to cure? Yea, what is the genuine reaſon, why the worſt men and members of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh evermore regard a good Miniſter leaſt? complain of his bitterneſs, and ſeek by all means to remove him? Is it not becauſe they are feet, and legs, and thighs, and arms out of joynt, and ſo cannot endure the touch of the Chirurgeons hand, &amp; the acrimony of his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101589:10"/>
medicines. Alas, every good Phyſician h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Nothing will eaſe the Plureſie, but letting of bloud: and to ſuch as are ſick of a dead Apoplexie, they are forced to give a double quantity of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or their faculties will not be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is the very caſe of theſe deſperate ſinners, who if they wanted not brains, would in ſtead of complaining be thankful. The Phyſician and Chirurgion heals us not without pain, and yet we reward them. Yea, had any of you but a leg, or an arm putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupt, you would even give mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and think your ſelves beholding too, to have them cut off, becauſe it is the onely way and means to preſerve the whole body. And if ſo, what love and thanks can be too much, that is expreſt to them who would (would you give them leave) pluck you out of Satans clutches, and bring you to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal? Nor can he ever be thankful to God; who is not thankful to the Inſtrument, or means, by whom God does, or would do him good.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it were a breach of Juſtice, not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101589:11"/>
to proportion the rebuke to the crime: For, for a Miniſter to uſe gentle reprehenſion, in caſe of capital offences, that is in caſe of thefts, rapines, ſacriledges, adulteries, and inceſts, to ſay to his people, as <hi>Eli</hi> to his ſons, <hi>Why did you ſo?</hi> Is no other than to ſhave that head which deſerves cutting off. For as it is with ill humours in the body, that a weak doſe doth but ſtir and anger them, not purge them out; yea, if phyſick be not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to purge out choller, it encreaſeth choller; the humours it would have purged and expelled (if it had been ſtrong enough) it inflameth, exaſperateth and ſharpeneth. And as the Sun in the Spring-time breedeth agues, and other diſtempers, becauſe it ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth humours and doth not waſte them; ſo it fareth with ſins in the ſoul. An eaſie and gentle reproof doth but encourage wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and make it think it ſelf ſo ſlight, as that rebuke importeth; which is to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize evil in ſtead of reproving it.

               <p>But wo to ſuch Preachers, as ſhall heal the hurt of theſe people with ſweet words, ſaying, <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> and give them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort (as <hi>Jezabel</hi> did <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.5, 6, 7.) when they rather deſerve a curſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.11. For this is no other than guilded treaſon, like that of <hi>Hazael</hi> to his Maſter, who told him with his mouth that he ſhould recover, when on the morrow he ſtifled him with his hand, and a wet cloth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.14, 15. Whence the Holy Ghoſt brands all flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers, that ſow pillows, for <hi>falſe Prophets, Jer.</hi> 8.11. And indeed it is but a Mountebank trick, to heal an ulcer, and leave in the core. A good Phyſician, either for ſoul or body, firſt tels the ſtate of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe with its ſymptomes, and then preſcribes; and in preſcribing, firſt puls down the body with purgatives, and then raiſeth it with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials.

and be ſure to diſcharge his conſcience from the burthen of any ones bloud, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.18. and 33.8. Yea, an ingenious Patient ſhould be ſo wiſe as to know, that the ſtomack ſhould ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And ſo it fares touching ſpiritual truths. Whence a good Preacher cares not ſo much to ſtroke the car, as to ſtrike the conſcience: being like a good Phyſician, who gives ſharp me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and bitter potions, that he may make ſho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The true method of preaching, and the likelieſt way to undeceive the deceived, and (with bleſſing from above) to pluck ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners out of Satans ſnares is: for a Miniſter to deal with his hearers, as the Prophet did by <hi>Hazael,</hi> when he plainly told him the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable wickedneſs of his heart, and what evil (even beyond beleef} he ſhould ſhortly do or execute, had he been wiſe enough to have been warned thereby.

As the Centinel or Captain, that doth not what he can to maintain the wals, doth what he can to betray the City The word is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Chriſts, though delivered by a weak Inſtrument. Who ever be the Crier, the proclamation is the King of Heavens. (While it goes for mans, it is no marvel if it lye open to deſpite.) So that in hating your Miniſter, and complaining of his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, you do as wiſely and juſtly, as if the people ſhould impute the cauſe of the war to the Herald, or accuſe the Trumpet for all that their rebellion hath brought upon them. Yea, conſider who is the Authour of the Word, what the cauſe and ends of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters delivering it; and that there is nothing can cure your grief, but the ſame Word that cauſed it: and then thou wilt receive him as an Angel of God, yea, even as Chriſt Jeſus; as the primitive Chriſtians did the Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. who <hi>acknowledged to owe, even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to their ſpiritual Paſtours, Philem. 19.</hi> And <hi>would, if it had been poſſible, have pluckt

               <p>You have heard ſufficiently, that this is the true method of preaching, though it be little uſed; becauſe diſcretion (with many) eats up well nigh all true devotion. Their diſcretion and moderate ſtayedneſs, much abates of their zeal, honeſty and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Nor can there be a better argument to prove, that a Miniſter ſtudies more to profit than to pleaſe men with his wholeſome counſel; than when he will not let them ſleep and ſnort in their ſins, but cry aloud againſt their abominations.</p>
               <p>I grant Corraſives are not to be uſed in all caſes, Lenatives and Cordials are of no leſſe uſe to weak conſtitutions. Whence the care of every wiſe and able Miniſter, that hath skill to divide the word of God aright, muſt be and is, to give to each man his due portion; comfort to whom comfort belongs, terrour to whom terrour is due: obſerving the ſame rule that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, who meeting with an <hi>Elymas,</hi> one that reſiſted the truth, and laboured to keep others from it, entreats him not with fair and ſweet words, as he did <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was hopefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to embrace the truth. Wherefore the ſame Apoſtle ſayes to the one,<hi>O full of all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101589:19"/>
ſubtilty and all miſchief, thou child of the Devil, and enemy of all righteouſneſſe, Acts</hi> 13.10. But when he ſpeaks to the other, it is in a more mild, gentle, and winning tone. Or as our Saviour himſelf uſed, (that Lamb of God, <hi>who would not break the bruized reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax.</hi>) As how doth he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply wo upon wo, and threaten double damnation, when he was to deal with hard-hearted Hypocrites, Oppoſers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, thoſe Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. And indeed, the beſt muſick is made by a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial correſpondence of ſharp and flat. Let all merciful &amp; meal-mouthed Preachers, ſuch as flatter ſin and flout holineſs, ſuch whoſe ſcope of their preaching is but to feed the people with hopes, though they give them no grounds for it: that Heaven ſhall meet them at their laſt hour, be their condition never ſo wretched; which is the reaſon that moſt men walk in the broad way, and yet every man thinks to enter in at the ſtraight gate. Let theſe, I ſay, take notice of this. As alſo ſcorners of their teachers &amp; Inſtructors, and more of their godly inſtruction: then will they love where and what they now hate, and hate where and what they now love. But you have no cauſe to complain of either extream: for in the Sermons, againſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101589:19"/>
which you except, there is matter of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of reprehenſion, of conſolation, of exhortation; for the ignorant, for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for the faithfull, for the deſpairing ſoul and drooping ſpirit: not Goſpel without Law, nor Law without Goſpel: but a ſweet compoſition of ſeverity and mercie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Law and Goſpel meet, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> met upon the Mount: the one to direct your obedience, the other to anſwer for your diſobedience, if you will but repent and turn unto God, with ſuch Chriſtian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as may argue zeal without malice, and deſire to win ſouls, no will to gaul them. For as <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants did not onely tell him that he had an evil ſpirit, but withall told him a remedy, and helpt him to the party that gave him eaſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.16, 18. So your Paſtour, with a diſcovery of your ſins, ſhews you a means of cure and recovery for your ſouls. Yea, do but ſubmit, and the very ſame Word (like the ſword of <hi>Achilles</hi>) will heal again, whom it hath wounded.

But above all reſiſt it not, kick not againſt it, mock not at Gods Word or Meſſengers. O do not ſport away your ſouls into thoſe pains, which are eaſeleſs, endleſs, and remedileſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101589:22"/>Do you beleeve there is a God? Are you willing to be ſaved? If you are, <hi>Break off your ſins by repentance, Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. Seriouſly grieve &amp; bewail for the millions of times that you have provoked God, and never more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like impiety: yea, as you tender the everlaſting happineſs and welfare of your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt and drowned ſouls, ſet upon the work preſently, before the draw-bridge be taken up. Provide with <hi>Joſeph</hi> for the dearth to come, &amp; with <hi>Noah</hi> in the dayes of your health, build the Ark of a good conſcience, againſt the flouds of ſickneſs: yea, do it while the yearning bowels, and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate arms of Jeſus Chriſt lye open to receive you, abjure and utterly renounce all wilful and affected evil, leſt when it is too late, it vex every vein of your hearts, that you had no more care of your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Again, if God by his Spirit ſhall work this upon your conſciences, (as you will have cauſe to bleſſe his name, that ever you met with ſuch a ſtop, ſo) reſemble not the ruſtick Sailour, who when he is in danger of ſhipwrack, will promiſe to change his life; but when the ſtorm is overpaſt, he returns to his former vomit, making no conſcience

nor account of his vows and proteſtations. But remember that perſeverance is the crown of graces, and Heaven the crown of perſeverance. If you are convinced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a new courſe, let you reſolutions be peremptory and conſtant, and take heed you harden not again as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the young man in rhe Goſpel, <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble not the iron, which is no longer ſoft than it is in the fire, leſt your latter end prove worſe than your beginning, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 45. As it fared with <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, and <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytour; for millions are now in Hell, who thought they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hereafter.</p>
               <p>God will not give his heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual graces at the hour of death, to thoſe who have contemned them all their life. If in any reaſonable time we pray, he will hear us; if we repent, he will pardon us; if we amend our lives, he will ſave us: But for want of this timely conſideration, <hi>Dives</hi> prayed, but was not heard; <hi>Eſau</hi> wept, but was not pitied; the fooliſh Virgins knockt, but were denied. And ſo it fares with all ſuch fools, they died as they have lived, and commonly go from deſpair unto deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101589:23"/>If you would prevent the like, lay not hold upon mercy, until you be thoroughly humbled. The onely way to become good, is firſt to beleeve that you are evil. God does not pour the oyl of grace, but into a broken and contrite heart. Would you truly know how evil and miſerable you are by nature, and be very ſenſible how evil &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked your hearts are, ſeriouſly conſider theſe three particulars: 1 The corruption of your nature by reaſon of original ſin; 2 Your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold breaches of Gods righteous Law by actual ſin; 3 The guilt and puniſhment due to you for both. This being done, you will ſee and find your neceſſity of a Redeemer, who came to ſave none but the weary and heavie laden ſinners, even <hi>the lost ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 15.24. and 11.28. And indeed the ſence of our wretchedneſs, and the valuation of our ſpiritual helps, are the beſt trial of our Regeneration.</p>
               <p>All which, if you would obtain, omit not to pray for the divine aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit. For of our ſelves we cannot think a good thought, a <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. Swift we are to all evil, but to any good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. Wherefore beg of God, that he will give you a new heart, and when the

Onely let me add, be ſure you wholly and onely reſt on your Saviour Jeſus Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abhorring to attribute or aſcribe ought to doing. To conclude, if you receive any power againſt your corruptions, forget not to be thankful; &amp; when God hath the fruit of his mercies, he will not ſpare to ſow much, where he reaps much. This do, and my ſoul for yours, God by his grace, will more than ſupply what is wanting; (as may be ſeen in his entertainment of the prodigal Son) and thou ſhalt be for ever happy, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. which is the prayer, and hope, and ſhould be the joy of</p>
