            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>VOLATILE OLEOSE TEMPER,</hi> THE Standard of Health IN HUMANE BODIES.</head>
            <p>MAN, the accompliſh'd Draught of the Univerſe, Prince of all Creatures and of the Lower World; for his ſuper-cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial and divine Soul has an immortal Ray of the Divine Light, reflected to the ſame, by the ſharp Sight and ſoaring Contemplations of his Mind, which ſhew he is a dependent Spirit on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Spirits of all Fleſh.</p>
            <p>And for his Body he has a beautified Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Elements, a perfect mixture in Life, illuminated with an undiſcernable Spark of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Fire, the Form of a mixt Body, firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a Radical Moiſture, then bound to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104290:3"/>
an Elementary Body, by the Mediation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, giving it individual Being. And Life thus deriv'd is the moſt ſupream and compleat Act of Nature.</p>
            <p>For the Souls of Living Creatures are vaſtly diſtant from the dark and earthy Matter of their Bodies, till by this ſubtile mean of an Aetherial Spirit they are faſtned to 'em by the ſtricteſt Tye in Nature.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe two Souls I leave to the Conduct of Divines; the latter falling within my Sphere, I'll endeavour to direct into an harmonious Union with the Body, by the help of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is a ſmall portion of the pureſt Air, a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Nature betwixt the Body and Soul; light and inviſible, temper'd with Fire, Volatile, and a moſt pure Subſtance, begetting Vital Spirits. Its firſt Cloathing is with an Univerſal Sperm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got on Sulphureo-Saline Exhalations drawn up into the Air, rowling up and down in the Belly of the Wind, till it takes up its proper Reſidence in the Seeds of Things. And thus deſcending to the Lower Region, it aſſumes the Moiſture of a watery Vapour, and by degrees the Element of <hi>Water,</hi> which is a mean betwixt the Air and Earth; a paſſive yielding Nature, aſſuming multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Shapes, apt to mix with things, delighted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104290:3"/>
much in motion; fit to receive and preſerve every thing that's ſubtile; capable of the heavenly Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to convey 'em thro' the Pores of our <hi>Earth,</hi> which is an empty place, into which all the other Elements project their Virtues, a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for the Spiritual Elements, a convenient hiding place to conceal the Principles and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature. Here I may take notice, how the four Elements, which upholds the Fabrick of the World, continually acting one upon the other, beget and bring to light the fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature and Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fire</hi> acting on the <hi>Air</hi> produces <hi>Sulphur:</hi> The <hi>Air</hi> acting on the <hi>Water</hi> brings forth <hi>Mercury:</hi> The <hi>Water</hi> acting on the <hi>Earth</hi> brings forth <hi>Salt:</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> having nothing to work upon, brings forth nothing: So that we muſt take up with three Principles out of the four Elements. But I muſt not enter into ſo large a Field, ſince I deſign but a ſhort Lecture, not ſo much for Theory, as to demonſtrate a rational Practice from my <hi>Sal Volatile ſulphureum,</hi> which is the moſt ſenſible and beneficial Performance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore conſider, that the joyning of the Principles well or ill together makes up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or imperfect Body. And that the prime Agent is the Fire that is plac'd in mixt Bodies,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104290:4"/>
and hath choſen the Radical Moiſture as its proper ſeat, the principal reſidence of which (in Man) is in the Heart, the Centre of the little World, the prime Organ of Life, altho' it be diffus'd thro' all the parts of the Body. But there commanding from its Caſtle, doth move concordantly all the Faculties and Organs, and breath Life into the Spirits, Humours, and the whole elementary Maſs. Its Food is a vivi<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ical Spirit flowing down from the Superiour Natures thro' the Air, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a natural oleoſe ferment and food of Life, without which, neither Man, nor any living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cou'd ſubſiſt: for Man lives not by Bread alone, but by the heavenly Food of Air. Yet the Lamp muſt be fed with the nutritious Juices of corruptible Bodies, which have in 'em a fixt Fire: But the leſs we partake of thoſe Meats and Drinks which have loſt their ſupple nouriſhing Particles, the more evenly we feed our vital flame: For ſalt Meats, ſour Drinks, firy Wines, and ſtrong Drams, are like ſo many fire-works thrown into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazeen of the Heart, which will blow up the Man. 'Tis of dangerous conſequence to enrage our <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum innatum,</hi> making fluſhings of Wild-fire to run about our Bodies, like flaſhes of Lightning from the Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104290:4"/>
As the Sun is the Centre amongſt the Spheres of the Planets, and ſcatters its beams downward by its motion; ſo is the Heart the Centre of the Body, which by its perpetual Motion (in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Air in circulating the Blood) ſends heat to the Superficies of the Body, which we allay from day to day with Liquids that penetrate our Pores, and cool it: In imitation of the Air and Clouds, which flying round the World, temper and mitigate the heat of the heavenly Sun. For as the heat of the Sun would deſtroy all things, and nothing produc'd in Nature, if the Air and Clouds did not intervene: ſo wou'd the inviſible central fire of Bodies conſume 'em, if balmy Sulphurs and watery Vapours coming betwixt did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
            <p>'Tis the univerſal Fire thro' the medium of the Air that governs all the ſubordinate ſixt Fires of Bodies: for Air hath ingreſs into Air, and they join themſelves together, Nature being delighted in Nature. And by how much the greater are the Pores, by ſo much the better the Body may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd. Thus beams of Light incircled with radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moiſture are our ſpiritual Nouriſhment: But that will not ſupport us without corporeal Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment; the former will avail but little without the latter. We ſtand in need therefore of Food,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104290:5"/>
that the natural Spirits may be recruited, which do continually ſlide forth thro' the Pores; for thus we muſt maintain a ſucceſſive repair of the loſs of Nature. Our nouriſhing Juices are made by the more ſucculent ſubſtance of our Meat, whereby the Parts and Humours of the Body are reinforc'd. The radical Moiſture is renewed out of the purer Particles of Blood, with the celeſtial Influences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingling with 'em by Reſpiration. Thus the natural Ferment of Man's Body, as well from his ſpiritual as his corporeal Diet, ſeems to conſiſt in a Sulphureo-Saline Temperament, which Vital Union becomes more inbodied in oleoſe Salts, and then aſſumes a greater Corporeity.</p>
            <p>The ſpiritual Sulphurs are exalted with the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salts, and beget a mild and eaſie Ferment in the happy Concentration of the Principles; from whence the fix'd parts receive their vivid Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the inſite Fire is fed with its proper <hi>Pabulum,</hi> and kept from rebelling.</p>
            <p>In all things, near the Principle of Life, is a ſmooth, ſupple, oily Subſtance: in all Seeds we find it more or leſs, therefore from ſo ſmall Bodies as Seeds, Oils are drawn. The Subſtance of all animal Sperms, that of Eggs, and many other things, will help to demonſtrate that 'tis an oleoſe Body that early covers the Principles of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104290:5"/>
Life, till they are cloathed with our Bodies, as our Bodies are cover'd with Cloaths.</p>
            <p>But when the inbred fire is harſh and inrag'd, thro defect of this Balſom and Union, and by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abounding of Acids; then the Spirits are inflam'd, the Oil burns, the <hi>Stamina Vitae</hi> ſhake: At length the purer Flements fly the Texture, the mixt Body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, and the Corruption of the frail Elements come to a loſs: The Aetherial Nature returns to its native home, and there is nothing left in the Carcaſs, but a perturbation and confuſion of the corruptible Ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, having loſt their Governour. Then reigns Corruption, Death, and Darkneſs, in the deprived Matter; until the virtue of Heaven does again ſlow down into it, and ſummoning the wandring Elements re-inkindles the weak light of a new Form, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumes the Elements into the methodical compoſure of a new mixture.</p>
            <p>Life is an harmonious Copulation of Matter and Form, conſtituting the perfect Being of an individual Nature; the Health of that Life is a regular Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Principles into magnetick Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our natural Fire, retain'd by ſpiritual Sulphurs, lies well beded in Oleity, rightly ſeaſon'd with Nitro-aereal Salts; not lock'd up, depreſt, or drawn out beyond its Centre. And this I call the Salino-ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Temperament, which to preſerve or reſtore, is the Scope of Medicine, the Deſign of Phyſick and Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104290:6"/>
I am warranted in this rational Conjecture from ſome experimental Obſervations, which is as near as humane ſight can penetrate. 'Tis true, theſe things in their own nature, are inviſible and tranſacted in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which makes em not underſtood by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lity of Men, who know not the <hi>occuls,</hi> much leſs to make it <hi>manifeſt;</hi> and are altogether unaccuſtom'd to ſuch Contemplations and Experiments. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are not to be look'd upon as Dreams and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; no more than the Spirit of Life which animates 'em. For altho' Nature is not viſible, yet ſhe acts viſibly from a volatile ſulphureous Spirit, which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes her Office in Bodies.</p>
            <p>'Tis generally granted, that Life lies eminently in the Blood; and ſo I ſay, and that from its abounding with a pure Sulphur and a volatile Salt, which are demonſtrable. <hi>Sulphur</hi> illuminates, gives Tincture and Centrality; What Red more beautiful and more vivid than in good Blood? and what a ſibrous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence has it? That there is plenty of volatile Salts appears to an Artiſt, who can extract em; beſides, 'tis evident to all, by Sweat and Urine, both which abound with volatile Salts. But ſome may ſay, the <hi>Ingeſta</hi> of Meats and Drinks may ſupply thoſe: no, it cannot be, for theſe Diſcharges are larger than they amount to. Be pleas'd to make the Experiment of living with Bread and Water for one Week, and uſe hard Labour, yet you'll find your Sweat and Urine

well impregnated with Salts; very few of which proceeded from your Dyet. The great Repairer of theſe is the ambient Air in which both are eminently, and therefore plentifully convey'd in breathing thro the Lungs to the Blood, helping it to ſanguiſie the new Acceſs of Chyle, in beſtowing vital Ferment and a vivid Colour.</p>
            <p>I'll take it for grant, that by this time we are agreed on the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the healthful juvenile Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Bodies conſiſts in the Harmony of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sulphurs and volatile Salts, which magnetical ly join to the ſubjected Natures, and gives 'em their proper ſeaſoning: Theſe tun'd with vital Air rariſie and illuminate our Bodies, ſtill preſerving a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen of our inbred Fire, and a healthful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>This Temperament preſery'd, is an Antidote againſt all Diſeaſes and Decay. 'Tis true, 'tis very nice to hit and keep it, becauſe we deal ſo low in the corruptible World, and depend ſo much on corporeal Supplies for our Subſiſtance, and are liable to ſo many changes of Seaſons, Weather, and Chance, that 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo few make up a competent number of Years: Yet 'tis good to know the Standard of Health, that we may ſtill be aiming at that Mark, ſome near Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to which, will preſerve Life, altho' it is not acted with that Satisfaction and Pleaſure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly healthy do enjoy. But to lye under riveling

Acids, ſcorbutick Wildfires, Stones in wrong places, Tartar in Joints, rambling and fixt Pains, and forty more troubleſome Diſtempers, which make the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuch a Clog to the Soul, that to a generous mind 'tis the greateſt Puniſhment in the World to attend upon it, in blowing its Noſe, wiping its Breech, dreſſing, undreſſing, waſhing, combing, cleaning, and colouring it, in order only to the eating of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gruel and drinking Small beer with him. Who would not rather be at ſome Pains, and Coſt too, to make him a little better Company for himſelf and his Friends, by introducing that ſmooth, oleoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I have already deſcrib'd. And where that does bear ſway, the Saline Stem of Acids cannot ſet up to play its Pranks. The inbred Fire is kept ſo truly delighted and entertained with thoſe Solar Gueſts, that it can't turn ſour or ill-natur'd. For the Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all Salts ariſes from the inſite Fire of Mixts: And the more the fixt Fire is urg'd, the greater the Sharpneſs; from both the Blood's corrupted, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſeaſes are deriv'd throughout the whole Body, which exerciſe the utmoſt Skill of Phyſicians, and notwithſtanding all their Cunning, they are often buffled by 'em.</p>
            <p>So great is the Energy of Acids, that it preys upon all the Sulphureity in the Blood, till it has devour'd its whole Tincture, and left it ſizy, or turn'd it into Matter, at leaſt ſeveral Colours; but robb'd it of its
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104290:7"/>
Life; and tranſmuted the other Juices into a Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tartneſs. Such Acids will corrode Metals, eat Holes in Iron, and make the Sulphurs putrid and ſtink, to the offending of your Noſe.</p>
            <p>But I'll ſhew in particular Diſtempers ſome of the many Miſchiefs that ariſe from this Root of Acids. the grand Enemy of Man's Health. Our natural Fire diveſted of its vital Allay grows burning and ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and being fed with the Fires of mixt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd Elements, at length puts on a raging Fit and ſharpens all the Humours; and when 'tis more intenſe, enkindles the Aetherial Spirit, and becomes a ſtrong Fever, more difficult to cure than putrid ones, and when it becomes mortiferous, uſually ends in Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: if it be not timely underſtood, and ſupply'd with proper <hi>Alkali's</hi> in the method, and often enough repeated to correct the Acids. But when by good Conduct you get it to a Remiſſion and then an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, it is like to iſſue well. For in the Intervals you have time to apply <hi>Alkali's,</hi> which abate the Fire by abſorbing the acid Fuel: for Acids commonly cauſe this Fire, and this Fire creates Acids. This ſeems to be the Reaſon of the uſe of <hi>Jeſuits Powder:</hi> Tis freely given in Intermiſſions, ſerving to good Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe impos'd ſo long, till it ſhall do ſomething. Not but that other <hi>Alkali's</hi> may do as well, nay, it may be better in ſome Caſes, if adminiſtred in as large Doſes, as often repeated, and as long continu'd, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104290:8"/>
I doubt not to ſay, with leſs injurious Conſequences.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jeſuits Bark</hi> at preſent is got in faſhion, and muſt be ſo, becauſe it ſometimes does the Feat, tho ſeldom conſider'd how it comes about; but reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look'd upon among the occult Qualities, which to examine is reckon'd unmannerly, becauſe difficult. In continued Fevers of pure accenſion, Blood-letting is proper in the beginning, and a cloſe Application of <hi>Alkali's,</hi> and there are of ſuch ſort as may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely given, although the Fever neither intermit or remit. But the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> muſt not be ſo us'd, he plays Tricks in a Paroxyſm: for beſides his <hi>Alkaliſate</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbing Quality, he has a churliſh Roughneſs and Stipticity, which at ſometimes recommends him, but at other times makes him very ill Company. Where the Fever comes Aguiſhly, or intermittingly, with Cold and Heat by turns, thro' the abundance of indigeſted roapy Humours; here <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi> by its Aſtringency, Roughneſs, and Bitterneſs <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generis,</hi> beſides its <hi>Alkalious</hi> Quality, becomes a very good common Remedy, if well apply'd. But in all Fevers ariſing from Faetid Sulphurs, which are to determine in ſeaſonable Separations to the Superſicies, there <hi>Jeſuits Powder</hi> is altogether improper: but the Variety in theſe ſort of Fevers is ſo great, that 'tis not at preſent to be medled with.</p>
            <p>The Riſe of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> proceeds from the Blood impoveriſht and ſeparated; for when the lively vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104290:8"/>
Spirits are exhul'd, what remains divides into two parts, a wateny and a thick Subſtance; which latter being of a Tartarous Nature, is impower'd with a faculty of turning the Juices into Acids. The watery part conveys to the Glands, and by them to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies a firy, ſharp, thin Humour, which ſtets and corrodes the Gums and Skin, ſometimes break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out on the Hands and Legs, and will run a great quantity of clear and limpid, but ſharp Water: and from the Tantarous Fund this is ſupply'd, which ſtill tranſmutes the thinner parts of your Aliment into this ſort of Acid Liquor. Until the Blood ſhall be again brought to its due Mixture, by the Addition of a <hi>ſweet Sulphureous Spirit,</hi> the Jively Principle that gives Tincture and keeps it in a juſt Conſiſtence, and makes it perfect. And thus it becomes a Mediclnal Fountain from which all parts are ſupply'd, according as they differ, each by its attractive quality drawing Nouriſhment peculiar to its kind. From this decay of lively Principles, and Separation of the Blood, tho' with ſome Alteration, where the ſlegmatick Humour more abounds, and the Tartarous Body leſs, proceeds thoſe Overflowings and inundations of the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> which tho' of fatal conſequence, if confirm'd, yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in time, by proper Medicines and Methods, may be prevented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gout</hi> is a Diſtemper that owes its Original to <hi>Tartar,</hi> which in the extraordinary undue Ferment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104290:9"/>
of the Blood is work'd off into the extream parts, thro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſmall Meandets, and lodg'd in the Interſtices of Joints, from whence it can't return: and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Ferments increaſes its Maſs to a viſible chalky Subſtance, which is of a dry ſtiptick Nature, that by degrees drinks up the Joint-water, and loading the Socket, renders the part crooked and uſeleſs: tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all it does not come to this height; nor needs it, if timely care be taken. The <hi>Stone</hi> differs but little from it, unleſs in Scituation. Many other Diſeaſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd too from this general Root. But becauſe the Miſchiefs from Acids and ſick Blood are more obvious than their <hi>Remedies,</hi> I ſhall therefore betake my ſelf to the Deſcription of a Univerſal Noble Medicine, abundantly qualified to bring about the great Deſign of Health, and reſcue Life from the innumerable Dangers wherewith it is ſurrounded.</p>

            <head>The True <hi>SAL VOLATILE OLEOSUM</hi> OF THE Ancient Philoſophers.</head>
            <p>FRom what I have ſaid already it may appear that the <hi>Volatile Oleoſe Temper</hi> is the moſt natural to our Bodies, and governs beſt our <hi>Calidum innatum;</hi> contrary to the <hi>Saline Stem of Acids,</hi> which divides and precipitates, enraging the inſite Fire, ſcattering it up and down, ſcorching the Body, till it has one way or other ruin'd it; like ſlaſhes of unbounded conſuming Fire from the Heavens.</p>
            <p>In order therefore to the preventing of ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I have laid my Deſign in Phyſick, and liberally expended in preparing two general noble Remedies; a <hi>Panacea,</hi> which I formerly treated of, and this <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum;</hi> for extraordinary <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> whereby leſler or greater Aberrations may be reclaim'd to a due ſtate of Health.</p>
            <p>

For altho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all Perſons that are declin'd from a juſt Temper, are not immediately turn'd out of their Beings; yet ſo many live in pain, decaying, and waſting away, that 'tis grievous to a Phyſician, beſides a great Reproach to Art, to hear 'em com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and crying out their very Lives are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ſome wonderful ſtrong Bodies that will hold out thro' courſes of Exceſs to great Ages. But hundreds, for one ſuch, go early to the Grave; and they too, with ſuch hail Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions (in all probability) might have liv'd much longer with Temperance: I'm ſure they ought to have liv'd to much better purpoſes. But 'tis not my buſineſs to diſturb ſuch tranquil Souls, who riſque their Lives in a perpetual Tickle of Senſuality, aways ſtimulated with the wild fires of Wines and Drams, to the committing of very odd Actions. Thus the glare of borrowed <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and 'twere a Divine Bleſſing thus to be brutify'd. But I'll betake my ſelf to the aſſiſtance of the Infirm, and ſuch as thro' the want of bodily Health know how to value that. And here, if perſons will but contribute one quarter of that Care about them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which I have done faithfully to preſerve and ſerve em, abundance of complaints wou'd ſoon be remedied on very eaſie terms.</p>
            <p>I appeal to every one, whether 'tis not a fair deſign in Medicine, to aim at the right Amendment of the Spirit of Life, which animates the mighty lump of Matter, the Body. Alas! what are We without it? and by what ſmall inviſible Power is ſo great a maſs of Matter lightly mov'd about at pleaſure? When the Spirits are rich and well uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how ſupple, gay, and vivid, are all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Organs of the Body, how concordantly, do they move in all their juſt Dependencies? no one griev'd on a<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Compoſitio</hi> is the joining of Bodies without a new Form, <hi>Miſtio</hi> is the joining or putting together of Bodies under a new Form. For the new Form is <hi>Commune Vinculum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Natural Philoſophers know that <hi>Compoſitio</hi> is <hi>Opus hominis,</hi> and <hi>Miſtio, Opus Naturae.</hi> Man makes a fit Application of Bodies together; but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Fermentation and Incorporation of 'em muſt be left to Nature, to make that <hi>Continuum</hi> which otherwiſe is but <hi>Contiguum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis therefore a great turn of Thought, to find out the Art of compounding in Life; ſo that Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at firſt troubled, may grow after clear and ſettled, by the benefit of Reſt, Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The due Contemplation of Nature, as well above as below, and ſome competent Knowledge how the ſuperiour act on inferiour Bodies, ſeems to me altogether needful. For the Heavens do not enrich themſelves by the Earth and Seas; nor keep no dead ſtock, nor untouch'd Treaſures of that they draw from below: but what they do take up, they return and ſpend in Dew and Showers impregnated with Life and Power.</p>
            <p>This Conſent in Nature, and ſome other luckey Hints, have prov'd ſufficient to beget my <hi>Sal Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Oleoſum,</hi> which is a Nitro-aereal volatile
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104290:11"/>
               <hi>Salt</hi> magnetically ty'd (by the Knot of Love in Nature) to a luminous Sulphur. 'Tis more Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical to call it <hi>Sal Volatile Sulphureum.</hi> But to ſpeak it at once, 'tis Spirit of Air, and the beſt ſeaſoning in the whole World of Animal Bodies in Life. For by Philoſophick Management, the trueſt, pureſt, and moſt wholſome Volatile Salt may be extracted from the Air; and the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Oleity in the World; which tranſparent radical Moiſture (prior to all ſpecifick Lives) has ſome portion of the univerſal Form that animates it: And this may properly be call'd a luminous Sulphur, which is the root of all Oleity; for I wou'd have it take the Name Oleoſe when the Sulphurs are cloath'd upon more bodily; and thus you may deſcend to the more groſs Bodies of Oils and Fats. But to comply with the common Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men, I'll call my Medicine no more than <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum,</hi> but then it muſt be conſider'd as perfectionate. And without doubt 'twas ſome <hi>quondam</hi> great Philoſopher (favour'd with a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Birth) that firſt diſcover'd this Union in Nature: And ſome learned Doctor ſearching into Sacred Remains, an Admirer of the Diſguis'd Learning of the Ancients, that robb'd the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of the Name, but not the Secret, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it down to our Age. How cou'd elſe ſo many agree in the name, and not underſtand the reaſon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104290:12"/>
or truth of the Medicine. Yet every one can talk of a <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum,</hi> and every little Proceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger can make it. That I expect in a little while to hear it cry'd about the Streets like <hi>Elixirs</hi> made of Brandy, Jalop, Seeds, and Licoriſh. Whenas by the name <hi>Elixir,</hi> the Philoſophers of old mentioned their moſt Venerable Secret; but now 'tis profan'd and affix'd to a parcel of murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Traſh. And the World finding ſuch ſorry Stuff under the higheſt Titles in Philoſophy, have of late damn'd and ridicul'd the whole Science. But I admire the Wiſdom of the Ancients in vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch glorious Knowledge under their Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical Figures and Aenigmatical Expreſſions, to ſecure it from barbarous and profane hands. No, let all their Followers, the true Sons of Art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worthy of uſeful Rarities, by imitating their Piety and Honeſty: then I wiſh they may find <hi>Ariadnes</hi> Thread to conduct 'em thro' the deluſive Windings of this intricate Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>'Tis one of the greateſt Misfortunes of latter times, that all Medicinal Experiments are put out to making. The Phyſician muſt by no means now-a-days know more than half of his Art, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to ſhew but <hi>multitudo librorum.</hi> The compleateſt Medicine wou'd ſtigmatize him with Quackery, altho' it is the Accompliſhment of all his Learning.</p>

Nothing's more difficult than to hit a Curioſity aright, which the beſt of Authors have difficultly enough diſcover'd: And he's a very ſenſible perſon that can correct twenty miſtakes in a Preparation, and by them grow wiſe enough to bring about his end. And 'tis not a low educated perſon can thus improve, he will take <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and if the Phyſitian is not experimentally skillful he muſt be put upon, and conſequently his Patients: Thus we become full of <hi>Medicines</hi> but no <hi>Remedies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if any one can but raiſe a Volatile Salt from Horns or Bones, and join therewith ſome Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Oils, which for Odour and Thinneſs couple to the beſt advantage with his Salt, then he cries out preſently, 'tis a <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum,</hi> altho 'tis no more a Medicine than a gilt Shilling is a Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea. And Miſtakes herein are of fatal conſequence to them that rely on ſuch Preparations: for they are at once banter'd out of their money, the time of helping themſelves, and thus by delay out of Life too ſometimes.</p>

               </gap> affirm, 'tis not from Horns, Hoofs, nor Bones, which abound with Salts; no, nor from Sal Armoniac that this Remedy can be drawn. For altho' there be plenty of Volatile Salts, which Chymiſts call ſo, that by the force of Fire will come over the Helm; yet they bring with 'em ſomewhat of Fixity, petrifying Diſpoſitions, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104290:13"/>
cauſtic Qualities. And as for Horns and Bones, they are endow'd with very faetid, corporal Oils: ſo that from theſe they borrow only a little pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Salt dilated in a Phlegm, which is ſo poor a Vehicle, that the Salts will drop through to the bottom of the Glaſs. Now having made a ſhift for his Salt, the Chymiſt is to ſeek for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sulphurs or oleoſe part, which conſtitutes the Medicine. Here he's at a loſs in Philoſophy, and bluntly takes an oily body to join to his Salt; and becauſe he finds the groſſer bodies of Oil are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and wont mix well, he wittily turns one Thought to the purer Oils of Seeds or Aromaticks, and there he gets a Scent too, and finding they will hang about his Salts, he then pronounces <hi>ore rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> that 'tis the right <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum</hi> of <hi>Silvius de le Boe,</hi> or of ſome other cry'd-up Doctor, whoſe Reputation can ſupport it; not regarding <hi>Science,</hi> or the Medicinal Virtues, ſo long as 'twill paſs for a Commodity in Trade.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, 'tis very difficult, and a great piece of Art, to prepare this Medicine, ſo as to anſwer learned Teſts and Phyſical Intentions. For the Salts, as well as the Sulphurs, are deeply conceal'd in Nature, and their Union is a great myſtery, as nice as the Subtile mixtions in Life; not to be received into one another by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers adjoining, altho' he muſt have a hand in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104290:13"/>
buſineſs, till his Deſign is wrought about by Art.</p>
            <p>The Sulphurs muſt be ſpiritualiz'd that mix with Volatile Salts, and be united by the mean of an Aetherial Spirit, and held to view illuminated and perfectly united. As in ſine fermented Ale the Water, Malt, and Hop, are ſo entirely one, that Art can never more ſhew the Ingredients apart; all three make up one thing, call'd Ale.</p>
            <p>I have well conſider'd the Vegetable nature, and in the Mineral Kingdom have much pleas'd my ſelf with fine Sulphurs, difficultly enough obtain'd from Antimony; but yet am diſappointed in both. Animals methinks ſhou'd ſeem to yield the beſt Sulphureous Volatile, as neareſt of kin to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but ſo ſubtile are the Spiritual Elements, that they wing away with Life in one quinteſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al form to the Aereal Manſions, and leave you only their corruptible Natures to work upon.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine where to apply my ſelf in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a very wholſom <hi>Salino-Sulphureous Volatile,</hi> unleſs it be from the Atmoſpherical Air, where Nature forms the Univerſal Sperm of the World by her heavenly fire on the gentle and ſoft Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the purer Elements, and incorporates 'em to your hand, beyond the profoundeſt skill of the moſt inquiſitive Philoſopher, altho' he have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the greateſt part of Nature on <hi>Vulcan's</hi> Anvil.</p>
            <p>

For amidſt all the Variety of Salts and Sulphurs in the World, which are as many as there be Species of things, none can be more agreeable than what's drawn from this general Bank of Nature; whence I borrow not only my Matter, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome portion of the Univerſal Form, and that's a lively Touch indeed.</p>
            <p>And ſince I can find here what I want, why need I look any farther. I have rov'd and ſearch't as well as others, but reckon I have anchor'd well at laſt, conſidering I had no Pilot. And he will prove a luckey man that hits my Knack, or rather diſcovers ſuch a <hi>Terra incognita</hi> in Philoſophy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' I give him here that aim which I never receiv'd. But ſhou'd he find my Bait, yet one half of the Skill does not lie in catching my ſtarry Volatiles: for I do aſſure him, he muſt well underſtand, and have long labour'd in Experimental Philoſophy, before he ſhall be Maſter of this Rarity in Nature. <hi>Dii omnia laboribus vendunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, 'tis curious to know the Operation of Nature, and how ſhe produceth things by her Workings which requires ſubtilneſs and quickneſs of Mind; for ſhe is not perceived by vulgar eyes. 'Tis neceſſary to learn firſt with the Brain and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, if 'twere but to ſave labour and charges in Fires and Glaſſes. Beſides, there is no pleaſure in the dull compoſition of things. Give me vital

Principles wreath'd together by a magnetic Virtue, whence they become a ſure food of Life, and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the haſty ſeparation by Death, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Life ſeparating it ſelf, by its ſelf, from a Corruptible Body.

            <p>Now in deſcribing more particularly the Virtues and Uſe of this <hi>Remedy,</hi> I'll begin from its firſt entrance into the Body. In the Stomach theſe Sulphureo-Saline Volatiles do looſen and cleanſe away all viſcid clammy Humours and ill Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they correct the auſtere and acid Ferment, which gives Heart-burn, Sourneſs, Pains in the Stomach, Flatulencies, Collicks, Convulſions, and ill Vapours offending the Head.

            <p>But here you may again remedy theſe contrary Ferments and abounding Acids, and vanquiſh the Root of 'em: and not only ſo, but in lieu thereof regain a well-condition'd Stomach, oily Bowels, a true natural Ferment; and a Supply of Oleoſe Volatile Particles, which mixing with the Chyle renders it not barely nutritious, but medicinal and balſamic.

            <p>This Medicine keeps the Orifice of the Stomach clean, and as tite as that of the <hi>Anus,</hi> folds up all the expanded Wrinkles, reimpregnates remaining Food, and gives a thouſand pretty pleaſing Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (beſides ſubſtantial Services) to the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
