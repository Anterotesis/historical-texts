            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter written from <hi>Prague,</hi> the firſt of Aprill, 1620. concerning the Chriſtning of the Kings Sonne, borne at Chriſtmas laſt.</head>
            <p>AFTER the King by way of Embaſſie had intreated the Prince of Tranſiluania to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his Childe, the young Prince I meane borne, ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiciouſly in Prague about the end of December 1619. to the vnexpreſſable comfort of all the Kingdome, and confederate Prouinces: hee made a iourney to Proſlaw, the principall towne of Sileſia, the effect whereof tended to this purpoſe, that by his perſonall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance amongſt them, he not onely corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their good opinions of him, but rectified cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſorders, and from that excellent diuiſion of <hi>Commutatiue and diſtributiue Iuſtice,</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a larger hand of bountie to ſuch as ſtood in need of his fauour, and ſhewed a ſtronger arme of Maieſtie to thoſe that neglected his power. But vnderſtanding that the Tranſiluanians were alreadie on the way toward Prague, hee haſted
<pb facs="tcp:21798:4"/>
thither; and by the middle of March was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed with many happie relations of ſeuerall victories, both in opening the paſſages, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the Emperours armie; as if <hi>Philip</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon ſhould haue newes at an inſtant, that the Spartanes were ſubiugated: <hi>Olympia</hi> bare him a Sonne, and his ſeruants carried away the games of <hi>Hercules.</hi> So that to make him more way to his ioy, about the end of March, <hi>Count Henricus Turzo,</hi> with other Noble-men, in the name of <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> came to bee God-father to the young Prince; there were diuers Lords of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie in his companie, and thirtie <hi>Huſſaros,</hi> as they call them, exceedingly wel mounted, ſix Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roches, each of them drawne with ſixe Horſes, and an hundred horſes beſides, with good equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and well appointed. Notwithſtanding ſuch was the pleaſure of the King to keepe correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with his owne magnificence, that he ſent them twelue Coaches more, with diuers officers of the Crowne, among whom was principall the high great Steward the Baron of <hi>Lobcowitz,</hi> a man grateful vnto them, as hauing formerly been in Hungarie, and now of ſufficiencie to put an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall recompence in the other ſcale againſt many fauours by them extended toward him: In this manner they came to the great Citie, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie next day had audience, wherin as an ouer plus to their embaſſie, they aſſured his Maieſtie, that about the 1. of May, which was the Diet of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnak,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:4"/>
the Crowne of Hungarie would be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and thoſe forces he had requeſted, accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated vnto him.</p>
            <p>When the day of ſolemnitie approached, wherein I paſſe ouer the concourſe of people, and many remarkable accidents tending to the expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating the Bohemian glorie, his Maieſtie ſent his owne Caroch by the Baron of <hi>Buſlwitz,</hi> the better to accommodate the Earle to the Court; and ſo the King, with Count <hi>Turzo,</hi> the Duke of Wittenbergh, and the Prince of Orange his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, who were the other God-fathers, went to the Church with the Lords of the States of the Countrey, and the Ambaſſadors of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated Prouinces: Doctor <hi>Scultetus</hi> did preach, taking his Text out of the 15. of <hi>Iohn, I am the Vine:</hi> And when the Sermon was finiſhed, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious ceremonies began, the yong Prince being brought into a place of ſequeſtration, yet publique enough for the ſatisfaction of the people; by the greateſt Ladie in the Land, called <hi>Ouerburgrauen,</hi> who ſupplied the place of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; and had on her right hand, his Maieſties brother; and on her left, the Duke of <hi>Weymar:</hi> The Lords and Officers went before them, and the Ladies and Gentlewomen followed behind: At euerie entrie or change of places, the trumpets ſounded, and the drummes beate, till they came vp to a ſtately marble table, whereon a bazon of Gold ſtood, ſeruing in ſteed of a Font to dip the
<pb facs="tcp:21798:5"/>
Child in. The Count <hi>Turzo</hi> held him in his armes all the Chriſtning time, and gaue him the name of <hi>Robert,</hi> as intimating, that the firſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperor of his Maieſties Family was ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but queſtionleſſe this was the direction of both the Councels, and a policie of the Prince of Tranſiluania, to induce the people to conceiue or apprehend, that there might once againe be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours from their now Bohemian King.</p>
            <p>After the Prince was named, he was deliuered to the reſt of the Ambaſſadors there preſent; and ſo the deputies of the three States of the Crown, the Lords of Sileſia, Morauia, the higher and lower Luſatia, with many other Ladies of eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had the ſight of him by turnes, and bleſſed him extraordinarily euen in his cradle.</p>
            <p>But time is the determiner of all things, and ſo in time, after ſome accompliſhment of ceremonie, they returned in order as they came, except the King, and ſome ſpeciall Lords and Ladies, who followed by themſelues, making as it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew of State: but it ſhould ſeeme the reaſon of the Kings protraction was to entertaine a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which the <hi>Count Turzo</hi> offered at the going out of the Church, a verie faire and well ſhaped Turkiſh Horſe, richly capariſond; the ſaddle and all things appertaining, were pounced with floures of Gold-ſmiths worke, interlaced with many precious Stones, the verie couering was richly embroydered; and the Horſe, as if he had
<pb facs="tcp:21798:5"/>
knowne his owne glorie, grew want only proud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to ſhew his brauerie to the companie.</p>
            <p>The royall dinner was ſolemniſed in a great Hall builded on the Riuer for that purpoſe, ſome call it the Mew; ſome, Moldan; and ſome, Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauia, as it maketh ſeuerall windings thorow the Cities. The Feaſt laſted ſo long, that that night they could doe no more, but retyre into a houſe of pleaſure, ſcituated in the priuie Garden, and for this purpoſe made as it were to ſhew a new countenance with great varietie of refreſhing, as guilding, painting, and vnvſuall pargetting: He's here. They paſſed the reſidue of the time with muſicke, dances, and another banquet. The next day, the States of Bohemia preſented a gift to the young Prince, of 2000. pounds in valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the other Ambaſſadors and Lords offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red verie largely: ſo that a man may well crie out of the warres, as a conſumer of Treaſure, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poueriſher of Kingdomes. For I am ſure here was ſo great remonſtrance of abundance, that a man would ſweare they neyther wanted men, nor money.</p>
            <p>To morrow is a preparation to celebrate the Baron of <hi>Donaws</hi> marriage, and the next day an expectation of a Tilting, and euerie day an inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of iollitie. For in truth, they that ſaw the noble cuſtomes and princely iollity of King <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> his Queene, his Brother the Duke of Weymar, and the reſt of the Lords and Ladies,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:6"/>
(more then ſolemnitie of Prayers and giuing thankes vnto God) would little imagine, they had ſuch intanglements of affaires abroad, or at any time diſcomforts at home.</p>

            <p>Wee ſay then, that if theſe Inducers are not

more Spaniſh then French, at the leaſt they doe heauily offend againſt the Principles of our State by a groſſe folly: by a remarkable baſeneſſe, and by a manifeſt iniuſtice.</p>
            <p>By folly, firſt in ſetting themſelues againſt thoſe who ſerue for a counterpoyſe for the State of France, to balance it againſt a power ſo great, as is alreadie become fearefull to all the States of Chriſtendome; particularly in this, that by the Inſtrumencie of the Ieſuites, it pretendeth to be erected into a fift Monarchie, by the ruine of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings and Princes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond follie were, to goe with ſuch faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to the ſuccour of them, who in the life time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, did refuſe his interpoſition to accommodate the differences riſen betweene certaine Princes of the Empire, allied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with France; one of the principall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Emperour <hi>Rodulph,</hi> hauing dared to ſay, that the King ſhould trouble himſelfe with the affaires of his own State, and in the difference now in queſtion, while it was yet in termes to bee acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated: my Lord the Duke of Neuers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then at Vienna, and hauing charge from our King to offer his interpoſition, it was neglected and contemned. And now after the Turke hath refuſed to giue them ſuccour, ſued for at his gate foure ſeuerall times, they come to our King and State, againſt which they haue continually prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, during theſe laſt fiftie yeares: which they

            <p>The third folly, were out of meere iollitie to intangle our ſelues in a quarrell, to reeſtabliſh that which it ſeemes the will of God is, that it ſhould not bee: whoſe workes doe appeare in the ſudden conſent of ſo many Nations, and the vnanimous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation of ſo different inclinations, all ſwaying to caſt off the yoke of a domination violent and cruell; and tending to the ouerthrow of all right, both diuine and humane.</p>
            <p>The fourth folly were to drayne the reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the King, to weaken him in Men, by the diminutions which ſuch warres doe bring, and to reduce the harts of the French to the affection of that Stranger, from whoſe faction the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Kings haue had pain enough to diuert them, and into which they had beene throwne by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked inducements.</p>
            <p>The fifth were, in that our King taking a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to beare his Armes againſt his Allies, in fauour of the common enemie, it might cauſe ſo
<pb facs="tcp:21798:7"/>
great an hatred againſt him, that they might grow to accord with this enemie, thruſt on by an indignation, which could not bee in this caſe but very forcible; ioyntly to turn their forces againſt the State of France, which they ſhould find drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of money, weakned in men, and no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſuch an inconuenience. Whereas the true Counſell of State were, when the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are in warre, to make a ſtock of money, to furniſh the frontiers with men and munitions of warre, and to keepe our ſelues on our Gard more then euer.</p>
            <p>So ſhould it likewiſe be a great ingratitude and baſeneſſe, to perſwade a moſt Chriſtian King, to render euill for good, to thoſe Princes who haue ſo often, ſo readily, and ſo vſefully ſuccoured him with Men, Armes, and Money, for which hee is yet indebted in ſums of very great importance, employed for the conſeruation of the Houſe Royall and State of France, againſt the attempts and aſſaults of thoſe, who are not now aſhamed to demand ſuccour againſt our Benefactors.</p>
            <p>Herein likewiſe are they anſwered that would ſuccour the Emperor vnder hand: for that which is naught being done openly, is not better by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done in ſecret: and to commit a baſeneſſe in ſecret, is as much as to commit a theft without witneſſe. Beſides, that it is vnworthy of the dignitie of our King, to counſell him to ſuch actions which haue need to be concealed, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:21798:8"/>
cannot be, being ſubiect to diſaduow and reuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when hee ſhall bee required thereto by his Allies.</p>
            <p>Finally, there ſhould bee a great wickedneſſe in ſuch a proceeding, and a great iniuſtice in the maine matter: for as to the firſt, who is it that can approue that one ſhould runne vpon his friends, vpon the ſimple report of his enemies? Muſt not both the parties be heard, and haue leiſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the King of their actions, or if you will not belieue them, to ſend vnto the place to know the truth? And as for the maine cauſe, it will be found very good on the ſide of the Bohemians; For firſt, the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was neuer choſen (neither could be) King of Bohemia; then when it is pretended that hee was choſen, hee was not choſen, becauſe the States of Morauia, Sileſia, and Luſatia, were not called vnto it, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall perſons of Bohemia had no voice in it: but this pretended Election was made by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of certaine Penſioners of Spaine; who on the other ſide could not proceed to a new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, during the life of the Emperour, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo King of Bohemia: for hee that liues hath no Heire.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the Election of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to be good, hauing after it, againſt his ſolemne Oath, violated the Lawes of his Countrey, endeuoured to aboliſh the Priuiledges, and ſo to make it of an electiue Kingdome, hereditary: failed in his faith
<pb facs="tcp:21798:8"/>
and word giuen to the States of the Countrey, not to meddle with the gouernment during the life of the Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi>: exerciſed all kinds of violences and cruelties againſt the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; his domination being degenerated into Tyranny, thoſe whoſe had right to elect him King, might reiect him, hauing rendred himſelfe vnworthy.</p>
            <p>Now againſt all theſe reaſons, there are made fiue Obiections, to wit, that this war being made for the ſubiect of Religion, that the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King ought to vndertake it: that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is Vncle by the Mother to the Queene: that ſuccour in diſtreſſe is a mutuall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which Kings doe owe one to another: that the example of reuolt againſt the Prince ought to be repreſſed: and laſtly, that it is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Turke may make his vſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of theſe wars among the Chriſtians his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. As for the firſt it may bee remembred, that when the houſe of Auſtria did inuade France, they did ſticke this calumnie vpon our Kings, that they were Heretikes or fauourers of Heretikes; And now to diſunite them from their friends and ancient Allies, they doe coniure them by the protection of the Church of Rome, which from all antiquitie they haue che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and peraduenture would not ſtick to tell the King, with Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt Pope of that name, that the Kings of France doe alone
<pb facs="tcp:21798:9"/>
deſerue the name of Catholike, which doth not belong to any elſe.</p>
            <p>But this pretext of Religion, is the ordinarie Maske of thoſe who would ouerrunne ſuch as are of a beliefe differing from them, and beg the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of them which are of their owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is that olde Cloke of two ſides, which ſhewes on the one ſide the publike good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and ſets forth on the other ſide, a fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned zeale of Religion, thorow which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is nothing to be ſeene but ambition and hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>It is queſtion (ſay they) of Religion, but may not that bee preſerued but vnder the Empire of Auſtria? Will you beleeue the accuſers only? ſhall wee condemne our Allies without hearing them vpon this point? And if it were true, would not the Catholike inhabitants of the Countrey ſend to requeſt the Kings aſſiſtance? And yet in this caſe were it fit to thinke of the matter. For ſince euery King and Soueraigne in his Territorie is not accountable of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to his Neighbours, and that wee our ſelues would not approoue that others ſhould come to controll vs in this point, wee ought to feare the example of ſuch a proceeding in time to come.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you pronounce a iudgement that it is a warre of Religion, you giue leaue thereby to the greateſt part of the Emperours Armie to
<pb facs="tcp:21798:9"/>
depart home, who are Proteſtants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Stiria, Carinthia, Auſtria, &amp;c. And you doe put the Duke of Saxe, and other Proteſtants out of doubt, who haue not hitherto taken this warre for other then a warre of State. Beſides there doe follow two inconueniences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that you doe taxe of deſertion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, thoſe Princes and States Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, who doe aſſiſt the King of Bohemia.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, that you doe alarme, deuide, and put into euill agreement the Subiects of this State, the inclinations of whom cannot be too wel vnited, for the repoſe of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But to take away this Maske of Religion, you need but to conſider the matter how it hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for at that inſtant that the Ieſuites were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of Bohemia, by the aduice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes themſelues, all the other Orders of Prieſts and Religious perſons, were receiued into the protection of the States of the Countrey. Since that, the King <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt, both at the time of his Election and Coronation hath confirmed it, and hath moreouer publiſhed it in his Declaration: and laſtly hath written it to our King by his Letter of the 20 of October laſt. By which it followeth that this feare cannot fall into the conceit of any, but ſuch, as hauing no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in their faith and word, doe iudge of others by their owne proceeding.</p>
            <p>The ſecond perſwaſion of the Partiſans of the
<pb facs="tcp:21798:10"/>
Emperour is to ſay, that he is Vnkle by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Queene; but they leaue out that the alliance of State, doth extend farther then any perſonall alliance; as they could well ſay when it was contracted, that marriages were but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular contracts, to take away all ſhadowes from diuers who did enter into ielouſies at that time: and now they would haue it cleane contrary, that particular pactions ſhould preiudice the publique right of State, ſo as it may ſerue for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But when this alliance it ſelfe was in queſtion, the ſtipulations, renunciations, and other clauſes which they themſelues cauſed to bee inſerted, without any other occaſion, then through the ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie which they beare againſt the State of France, and the feare which they had that it might haue been augmented by this alliance, doe ſufficiently exclude the Queene, particularly not to intereſt her ſelfe in the quarrells of State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two houſes.</p>
            <p>The third obiection, is taken from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of Kings, and from the ſupport which the afflicted doe requeſt; which is a cleane contrarie Style from that which they did endite, during the warre of <hi>Piemont,</hi> during which they did purſue as criminals thoſe who did aſſiſt the Duke of Sauoy, whoſe State the King of Spaine did inuade, without any more apparent ſubiect, then for the alliance which he had treated, with the late King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Fourth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21798:10"/>But theſe men doe now preach charitie for their owne profit, and yet doe they retaine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, of which they ſpoyled one of the Kings Anceſtors, who came to aſſiſt our King: nor will they yeeld vp the places which they vſurped du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the league which they ſtirred vp, &amp; entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as long as they could.</p>
            <p>But if this argument to ſuccour the afflicted be good, were it not more to purpoſe to aſſiſt the King of Bohemia, whoſe Predeceſſors haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted alliance with our Kings, and haue aſſiſted them with men and money againſt the League, and the houſe of the Emperour? who haue this word by writing, in many of his Letters; and the Acts and Regiſters of his owne Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, for proofe of their good deeds, and good offices towards our Kings and their States?</p>
            <p>Nor is it to any purpoſe here for them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the fourth place, the euill example of the reuolt of ſubiects againſt their Prince, who haue ſtirred vp and entertained the ſame amongſt vs, and who doe now receiue by the diuine chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for a lawfull ſubiect, the experience in their owne Countries, of the diſorders which they haue produced in the States of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And, on the other part, the Bohemians, both in regard of what is ſaid before, and of the reaſons layd downe in their Declaration, are ſufficiently iuſtified againſt this accuſation.</p>
            <p>Finally, To omit nothing which may carrie any ſpeciouſneſſe with it, there is propoſed the
<pb facs="tcp:21798:11"/>
feare, leſt the Turke may make vſe of this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But on which ſide hath he beene alreadie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited, but by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand?</hi> who hath not onely cauſed the King of Spaine to ſue to him for peace, but hath cauſed his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to make exceeding great inſtance foure ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times to the great Lord at his gate, to giue him ſuccour; which hauing beene refuſed him, he comes now to our King out of deſpaire of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance. But if this apprehenſion be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taken, it is that that ſhould inuite the other Princes of Chriſtendome, to leaue Bohemia in Peace, and to order the grieuances done vnto the Empire: and vs not to exaſperate againſt France in all the allies, kindred, and friends of the King of Bohemia, who are neither ſo few, nor ſo weake, but that they ought to be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>See here Sir, What is our iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this vndue requeſt made of ſuccour to our King, by his inueterated enemies, againſt the moſt certaine and vſefull allies of his Houſe and Crowne. Wherein we eſteeme that all his good and faithfull ſubiects will agree with vs, and that they will call to minde the meanes vpon which the State of France our common Countrey is founded, and hath ſubſiſted for ſo many yeares: not to permit that a new Counſail, which among the Ieſuites they call of Conſcience, ſhould not onely taxe all other Counſellers, as if they had no Conſcience, but vnder this pretence doth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb facs="tcp:21798:11"/>
all order, both diuine and humane. For (I pray) what would haue become of the State of France, during the warres of the League, when theſe Inducers of Counſels of Conſcience did rage againſt our Kings, &amp; did purſue their ruine? Let them remember that by ſuch Counſels and Counſellers, there hath hitherto arriued all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to thoſe Princes, which haue hearkned to them, and beene ſerued by them. The King of Poland for his part could tell, how hee came to loſe Swethland; ſo could the houſe of Auſtria it ſelfe ſpeake of the Low-Countries, many yeares ſince; and that which is now to be ſeene in reſpect of the realmes of Bohemia, and Prouinces incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, Hungarie and Auſtria. This is enough to cauſe other Princes to beware, at the leaſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward. And I pray God, with all other good French-men, to giue our King the grace both to teſtifie in the view of all Chriſtendome, which hath her eyes vpon him, the ſtedfaſtneſſe of his word to his good friends and allies againſt their common enemie, for their protection, and the repoſe of his ſubiects: and his iuſt indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who doe counſaile him to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. I am,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CHristian,</hi> Elector of Saxonie, greeteth you happily: We receiued your Letters (moſt illuſtrious King) dated at Vienna the 27. of September of this yeare preſent. Wherein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your accuſtomed manner of friendly imparting your ſelfe vnto vs by Letters, you giue vs to vnderſtand, that the happie euent of cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full homage yeelded vnto you by the States of Morauia, the twentieth of Auguſt, in the Citie of Prin; putting you in liuely hope of the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe from the people of the lower Auſtria: you haue notwithſtanding found the quite contrarie: that is to ſay, you finde, there is no preſſing the States of this Countrie to any oath of fidelitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their iuſt complaints be heard, and their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rites and priuiledges confirmed: although your Maieſtie had many times promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe their agrieuances, according to the equitie
<pb facs="tcp:21798:12"/>
of their cauſe, as the cuſtome in this caſe is. On which bare promiſe, the Inhabitants beyond the <hi>Ens</hi> would not relie, but perſeuered conſtantly in the former reſolution: And therfore you require, that wee would not giue credit to thoſe which go about to ſettle ſome ſiniſter opinion in our mind: but rather that we ſhould perſwade them to lay aſide their obſtinacie, and ſo to come vnder the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which they owe vnto you, with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of all that which is further comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſame Letters.</p>
            <p>Your Maieſtie certainely may be aſſured, that you are no waies deceiued in the good opinion you entertaine of our fidelitie towards you, in that from our firſt entrie made vpon the Elector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we may confidently auerre, without any vaine boaſting, that all our Counſels aimed at the preſeruation of the greatneſſe, reputation, and authoritie of the houſe of Auſtria, in maintaining the ſecuritie thereof againſt all their enemies. And therefore we cannot without ſingular diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment apprehend the diſcommoditie accrewing thereby to you, which daily augmenteth in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans ſight; and other affaires proceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with the ſame contrariety, ſeeme further to threaten you with worſer ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>And though it no waies beſeemeth vs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe you, vnleſſe of an happie and fortunate reigne: notwithſtanding, you manifeſting daily the great amitie and confidence you repoſe in vs,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:13"/>
we will not feare, to deliuer vnto you freely our opinion and aduice touching this matter, humbly intreating you to take it in good part: whereof we aſſure our ſelues, from your accuſtomed huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and clemencie.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, who knowes not how the houſe of Auſtria, hath hitherto beene eleuated aboue all other Princely Families vnder the ſacred Empire? with how many ſeuerall dignities it hath beene augmented to euerie mans ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, ſo that many perſons, both of high and meane calling, haue voluntarily come vnder her tutelage and protection, being verie well entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and with all wiſhed clemencie?</p>
            <p>But there is no man, how faint a louer of truth ſoeuer he be, which muſt not needs confeſſe, how your Family of long time hath met with no more violent aduerſaries then the Court of Rome, and Sect of Ieſuites, together with thoſe that adhere vnto them, with their turbulent and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Counſels, which the States of the Empire, neither could nor can any wayes ſupport. Your Serenitie otherwiſe conceiues, that no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mooued the ſo many goodly Prouinces of the Netherlands to ſhrinke from their hereditarie and naturall Lord, then theſe ſo intemperate and precipitant courſes, which haue planted ſuch irradicable defiance between Subiects and their Princes and Magiſtrates, that no Treaties can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue or ſupplant the ſame: As in verie truth,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:13"/>
all thoſe conſulted Treaties could neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme thoſe Eſtates in any ſetled peace. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, what hath ſo extenuated and diſhonoured ſo many renowned victories, obtained by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Imperiall Maieſtie againſt the Turke, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeuſe,</hi> by a ſecret inſtinct out of the Ieſuites Schooles? For the common enemie being ſeated in the nauell or center as it were of Hungarie, with mightie forces both of horſe &amp; foot; at that verie inſtant it was, when fire was giuen to the moſt outragious perſequutions: nay, and in ſo many ſeuerall places, that his ſaid Imperall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, by this means, loſt Strigonium, Tranſiluania, Hungarie, Valachia, and Moldauia: the recouery of which Prouinces, coſt our deare Germaine Countries many millions of men, and an infinite treaſure in Gold and Siluer. During this cruell warre, theſe tumultuous people were not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in partly diſhonouring, and making fruitleſſe the victories of his Imperiall Maieſtie: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, oppoſing and croſſing them; but the Ieſuites further, by all manner of wicked ſtratagems, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly perſeuered in their perſequutions, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia, Carmola, and Stiria, expoſing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Inhabitants of the ſaid Prouinces to cruell Proſcriptions, while the Turke, in the meane while, toooke in Camſa: For, what other cauſe was there, why the States of the Sacred Empire, after the laſt Dyet of Ratisbone, without any laudable effect, or any firme and mutuall recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:14"/>
ſeparated themſelues, but onely the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites and their importunities? who did nothing but exclaime, that the moſt pious Conſtitution of the peace of the Religion, was nothing but a meere delay, a truce, an Interim, or tolleration, ſcandalizing in this caſe, euen the Counſell of Trent; and this they divulged all ouer, in their writings. From which, and many other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuperfluous here to write, many complots and practiſes being vndertaken, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the houſe of Auſtria; your Highneſſe may euidently diſcerne the truth of what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; to wit, that your illuſtrious Family hath met with no more capitall and deadly enemies in all the world then the Court of Rome, the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and their Societie. I ſpeake nothing of ſo many pernicious practiſes, and diſaſtrous aſſaults, which the Ieſuites haue attempted againſt other Kings and Monarkes in France, England, Poland, Sweden, Venice, and other places, without all remorſe or ſhame; that if God had not euen by way of miracle, preuented their diabolicall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, they had turned entire Kingdomes topſie turvie, whole Countries with their Inhabitants, and had reduced them for euer to a finall and abſolute ruine. For whereſoeuer this Sect, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſect kind of Creatures plant, they bring with them all manner of diſaſters and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if by their Counſells and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:14"/>
which (I muſt tell you) are no wayes grounded vpon any true politike foundation: but rather as Spiders, wouen out of themſelues, their venemous paſſions, and Scholaſticall Dreames, they haue excited Subiects, yea, and the entyre Prouinces of ſome Princes, to mutinie and reuolt; they can create no new Inhabitants or Subiects, themſelues flye away into Italy, or ſomewhere elſe, leauing behind them a mortife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtinke, and the Impreſſions of an horrible, and vaſt deſolation.</p>
            <p>But admit your Maieſty, may haue beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by ſome, that you are in no ſort tyed to ratifie and confirme vnto your Subiects their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights, and Priuiledges; aboue others, thoſe that concerne the free exerciſe and practice of the Confeſſion of Auſpurg, which were granted to the people by the Emperours of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> for no ſmall ſummes of money: and therefore vpon no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall tearmes, but thoſe very burdenſome and chargeable; wee are willing to excuſe your Highneſſe innocence herein, and naked ſincerity: beleeuing rather that this was performed by the enemies formerly mentioned, who ſeeme to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect your Highneſſe ouerthrow, and to depriue you of your Prouinces: exciting, and drawing eyther by malice, or groſſe ſtupidity, the generall enemie of the Chriſtian name, into the heart of the Countrey, who, without any great difficulty,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:15"/>
is like to be Maſter of all theſe ſo renowned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, with whole Hungarie, the which (except preſent order bee taken to the contrarie) will bee enforced to come vnder the Turkiſh protection.</p>
            <p>For your Serenity knowes, that both the one and other Auſtria haue now contracted a verie firme League with the Kingdome of Hungarie, and other Prouinces: ſo as if you grant not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable permiſſions to the one, as well as to the other, they being equally intereſſed in the cauſe of offence, by vertue of the Confederation, by you approou'd; the other parts will yeeld them ayde and ſuccour. And though as Subiects, they are ready to expoſe their liues for their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, their bloud, yea, euen their ſecond drops which is their goods, and prodigally to caſt away whatſoeuer they haue in their power: yet what can be imagined more deplorable and miſerable, then to racke and torment their ſoules by ſuch an extraordinary, and ſeruile Tyranny? That ſame Apothegme of <hi>Stephen</hi> King of Poland, was very prayſe-worthy; who talking of ſome perſecutions begun in his Kingdome; ſaid: That he was King ouer a people, but not of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.

And your famous Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,

Princes that were endued with admirable experience and wiſdome, plainly perceiued, that thoſe Princes of Germany and Eſtates of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which neuer gaue way to this oppreſſion of conſcience, haue beene wonderfully belou'd and obſeru'd of their Subiects, for this only cauſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying hereby a moſt happie Reigne, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</p>
            <p>Our deuotion therefore, towards your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Family, being to euery one well knowne; and from whence this loyall &amp; ſimple admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeds: your Serenitie hauing not the leaſt ſurmiſe to thinke, that we were falſly aduertized by your Subiects: but on the contrarie let all the world duly obſerue, what hearts they carrie to you, and your thrice Illuſtrious Family, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate you to theſe prepoſterous courſes, which common experience, and the miſerable euent of preſent affaires, ſufficiently teſtifie. We therefore in all humble affection beſeech your Maieſtie, that conformable to the truſt you repoſe in vs, hauing peruſed theſe Letters to take them in good part, and according to the Lawes, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants both of the one and other Auſtria, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying thoſe Priuiledges which they haue deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought, you will permit them the free exerciſe of the Confeſſion of Ausburge, not putting hereafter their Conſciences to the Rack. And ſo relying on this Confirmation, as a member, and Elector of the Sacred Empire, beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:16"/>
we did more truely labour your owne, and the greatnes of your Family, then the whole bodie of the Ieſuites, and their Followers; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſufficient teſtimonie, hath beene giuen, during the ſixteene yeares of this Hungarian warre, and that your Illuſtrious Houſe, hath beene more ſincerely by vs affected then euer it either hath, or will be, by this peſtiferous Sect. Otherwiſe if you take this friendly aduertizement in good part, be ſure your Subiects will yeeld you abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience, neither ſparing their liues, nor goods, in your ſeruice; no wayes doubting of their fidelitie, or of any effect that can enſue. By this meanes you ſhall purchaſe immortall glorie, and endleſſe exaltations, both amongſt Strangers and the Princes of the Empire, obtayning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God all bleſſings both of bodie, and ſoule; and the ſame God will daily amplifie you with new dignities, and moſt wiſhed euents. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if you ſuffer the Ieſuites and their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, ſo to abuſe your bountie and clemencie, (which will not ſincke into our perſwaſion:) Let it ſuffice, that we innocently proteſt, that all our reiterated Admonitions aymed at no other end, but to preuent the Houſe of Auſtria from thoſe perils and dangers which threaten it: and any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accidents falling out to the contrarie, we are exempted herein from fault &amp; blame.

               <salute>Moſt gracious Lord:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT what time wee ſate in Counſell with our Princes and Nobilitie, moued by the vrgent occaſions of the renowned Kingdome of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, I did at once receiue one anſwer from your Maieſtie vnto both my Letters, ſent by the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Gentleman <hi>Stephen Haller</hi>; &amp; as my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (occaſions ſo requiring) were two, ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtained an anſwere which agreeable to the weight of the affaires conſiſted of two parts, the matter was maturely deliberated by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: and perceiuing preſent danger in delay, I would not deferre to ſollicite your Maieſtie the more earneſtly about the laſt declaration of your Highneſſe gracious pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And whereas I perceiue your Maieſtie doth ſimply and abſolutely vnderſtand my declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truce, in this ſenſe; that during the time of League no ayde may be ſent by the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the Bohemians, and the reſt of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates: the retexing of which queſtion will much illuſtrate both parts of the preſent anſwere: your Royall Maieſtie may pleaſe to vnderſtand the whole courſe of the matter in this ſenſe and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>In the Polonian Aſſembly there haue beene
<pb facs="tcp:21798:17"/>
three contracts made with me only: and in thoſe, many tranſactions (and that for diuers reſpects) confirmed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Truce and Conditions of Peace with your Imperiall Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, with the Bohemians and the other Confederate Prouinces.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, with the Peeres and States of the Illuſtrions Kingdome of Hungarie.</p>
            <p>And I confeſſe, that I ſeemed in the opinion of many ſo entangled by that parley (contrarie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and oppoſite in diuers paſſages vnto it ſelfe) that deſerued and promiſed equitie could not poſſibly bee obſerued towards both parties, but the one muſt either bee ſomething neglected or iniuried by me; which ſo ſiniſter conceit of mee that I may ſpeedily remooue from the mindes of men (eſpecially if your ſacred Maieſtie or Counſellors haue entertained it,) pleaſeth it you to be informed of the certaine truth and diuerſe concluſions.</p>
            <p>The Hungarian Nation hath confirmed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall league with the Bohemians: and we haue promiſed mutually by oath to liue and dye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in withſtanding all enemies: ſo as to make peace or warre with any, not aduertizing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is vnlawfull for either part. This agreement and couenant betwixt vs tooke place, when by notice giuen them, and their conſent, I ratified the peace which I now haue with your Maieſtie.
<pb facs="tcp:21798:18"/>
But ſince the ſecond Article, I being ſilent, doth oblige your Maieſtie expreſly to grant the ſame peace vpon demand, to our Complices and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, the Bohemians and the other Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which you haue granted vs; and that your Maieſtie is bound to harken after my motions, which doe but ſeeke that the ceſſation of Armes vpon iuſt and equall conditions, ſhould bee on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide granted; If I ſhall perceiue your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to ſatisfie in no part this ſolemne proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but contrarily with renewed forces to ſound the alarme and put your Souldiers in Armes to ſuppreſſe vs: if I obſerue your Maieſtie, as daily complaints informe, contrary to the hope and expectation of all good men, to ſwerue alreadie (which be farre from you) from this agreement; who can bee ignorant that my ſelfe is no longer, neither the Hungarian Nation obliged to you? Nay, if wee aide not without delay our friends, whoſe protection we vndertake, we ſhall vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily bee accuſed, by them of diſloyaltie. I doe therefore abundantly ſatisfie the Bohemians and others, in ſoliciting your Maieſtie for their truce like our owne: which, if I obtayne of you as due by couenant, or if I diſcerne their ſuſpected and dangerous eſtate by vaine lingrings and delayes; neither your Maieſtie, nor any other ſhall euer accuſe mee or the Hungarian Nation of promiſe breaking, if wee finde our moſt bitter enemies, whom obligation tyed to league and peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:21798:18"/>
Wherefore your Maieſtie is not otherwiſe to vnderſtand my declaration of the truce placed expreſſely in the ſecond Article, then the writing it ſelfe witneſſeth; that this our league with the Bohemians is not, neither can bee made ſimply common, as if together at the ſame time and in all kindes of league wee were tyed to each other. Neither are they ſo neglected and forſaken of vs that there is no profit procured vnto them by our confederacie. Moreouer I requiring it, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring iuſt and equall conditions, your Maieſty is by couenant bound to grant like truce vnto them as to vs; which if you doe not, we are no further to contend in the matter with words and pen. Let truth ouer ſway all things. Since I labour and ſweate now the third time in ſolliciting your Maieſtie in our Confederates and Friends cauſe, and that with obteſtation.</p>

               <head>Thus much concerning the Intreaties had with your Maiestie and the Confederate Princes.</head>
               <p>COncerning the Articles concluded in the Conſultations paſt at Polonia, the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is manifeſt enough in them both of the truce confirmed with your Maieſtie, and the league e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed and concluded by the Confederates. The inward adminiſtration and gouernment of the Subiects of the Kingdome, vntill the truce is
<pb facs="tcp:21798:19"/>
expired, or till the next following and proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med generall Aſſembly of State, howſoeuer preſcribed by the Princes and Lords, is (I ſuppoſe) ſo highly weighed that it ſhould not moleſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Maieſtie or others. Aſſuredly I thinke it fitter to giue place to ſo many complaints, and to mens diſturbed appetites in this ſtate of things, then hauing not yet laid hand vpon the toſſing bridle, diſcourage Subiects mindes a far off with too much ſecuritie; which hitherto, I confeſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, is ſo performed by your Maieſtie, that oppoſing by all means our ſtudies and endeuour, the induſtrie of the ſeditious hath more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed (more is the griefe) then theirs whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is imployed in compoſing controuerſies. But I am ignorant being a ſtranger in that adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where your Maieſties dignitie is impeached, or the libertie of the Kingdome ſo reſtrayned, ſince your Maieſtie in confirming the league did ſauourably conſent to my free and abſolute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Neither for my part is it vrged, in what eſteeme and regard theſe preſent Articles and publike Conſtitutions are of, in thoſe places which belong to your Dominion But I ſee the preſcribers of thoſe Lawes doe indeuour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my manner of Gouernment and Reigne to their owne pleaſure.</p>
               <p>From which it is manifeſt, that neither this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration according to the Articles, nor any thing elſe can violate the Peace and League with
<pb facs="tcp:21798:19"/>
your Maieſtie, and ſo with ſufficient diligence &amp; plaineneſſe I haue declared the three concluſions. Neither at this time will I vndertake any thing beſides an earneſt ſolliciting, vrging and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of your Maieſties pleaſure and reſolution, concerning this my third and laſt, and moſt iuſt demand in behalfe of our Confederates. And whereas your Maieſtie deſigneth long time for the deliberating of this matter, and hath ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee to intreat of it, doubtleſſe that cauſe will moue ſuſpicions in mens thoughts, not without ſome danger which cannot be remoued without certaine, reall, and deſired tydings of peace eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.

            <p>VVE doubt not but your Excellencie hath ſufficiently vnderſtood of the preſent troubles, and the ſucceſſe of them in the Noble Kingdome of Hungary: but concerning their cauſes and proper Reaſons, you haue not onely diuerſly and indirectly bin informed, but alſo our oppoſers haue delated vnto you vnmeet and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true rumours concerning both our purpoſes and perſon. Theſe we will in diſdaine paſſe by as the Fictions and Comments of giddie braines, rather then diſcouer them with tedious ambages. Your Grace ſhall now receiue the true deſcription of our deſignements. When as vnwittingly he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the perſon of the moſt ſacred Emperour, and Kingly Maieſtie of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> becauſe of the ancient perſecution of our Orthodox and ſound Religion, bearing it well in minde: So that
<pb facs="tcp:21798:21"/>
the Gouernment and Adminiſtration of his Maieſtie was not only ſuſpected but grudged at by all his Subiects, the couered and lurking fire in their minds beganne firſt in Bohemia to flame forth. Which in the beginning they might eaſily and with Clemencie (if they had ſo pleaſed) according to wiſedome and due office haue extinguiſhed, ere it had proceeded to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. But hauing now by many companies of people aggregated together from all the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of Europe, ſo ouer-ſpread and ouer-runne Bohemia &amp; Morauia, that the Inhabitants were almoſt conſtrayned to ſurrender to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie both life and goods, libertie and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they threatned with like tumultuous Armes and Forces, to inuade and oppreſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, publikely and reſolutely, Hungary and Tranſiluania, wee and the other Princes beeing vanquiſhed and ſurprized. Wherefore the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians and Bohemians with the Auſtrians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confederates, doe all of them proteſt vnto vs the perill of thoſe enſuing warres, and intreate vs by the right of our ancient league to ſuccour their afflicted and decaying State. Being therfore ſollicited by ſo many Kingdomes, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the authoritie of ancient league, we did (our condition ſo requiring) aide by counſell and approbation our Confederate friends: yet ſo as we determined neither to haue any forces of the Turke, neither to ſuppreſſe the Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
<pb facs="tcp:21798:22"/>
or any other Religion, the Ieſuiticall Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only excepted; but would maintayne the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Orthodoxe Faith, and free the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; impayred Eſtates of other Countries from violence and tyrannie. Wherefore our actions witneſſe that our intention hath bin no other hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foraſmuch as we haue confirmed a league with his Imperiall and Royall Maieſtie in the Kingdome of Hungarie, ſo that hee would pleaſe after ſufficient demand to grant the ſame Articles to the Bohemians &amp; the other our confederates, which wee haue not ceaſed by our Letters and Ambaſſages to ſolicite: to the intent the ruines of the Kingdomes, and the ſtreames of Chriſtian bloud might be diuerted. Moreouer, that Armes laid aſide, profitable intreaties and agreements might take place, and ſuch broyles might ceaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; peace bee obtayned by the attending of both parts to moſt iuſt and equal conditions. Our ſelues deſire rather to manifeſt our wiſhes to deſerue well and highly of all Chriſtian Princes and Kingdomes by practice rather then by wordes and Letters. Amongſt the which alſo attributing very much to your princely equanimitie in theſe troubleſome times of Chriſtian Kingdomes, doe commend with ſingular confidence our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, and our Confederates vnto you; the principall ſcope whereof, being no other then the eſtabliſhing of peace &amp; tranquillity, &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring vnto liberty our Countries, Lawes, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
