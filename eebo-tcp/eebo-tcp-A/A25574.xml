            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER To the AUTHOR of the LETTER TO A Member of the Convention.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur Name, your Quality, your Religion, and your Design in Publishing this Letter are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown to me, but the confident Assertion, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. ยง. 16. <hi>That you are sure it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Answered;</hi> sounds so like a Son, or rather a Father of the <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> that it has provoked me, if not to answer, yet at least to <hi>reflect</hi> upon some Passages in this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterial Composure.</p>
            <p>ยง. 2. <hi>Whatever becomes of other Arguments, Interest is most likely to prevail.</hi> You, Sir, suppose your Parliament Man, in these words, to be one who will regard no Arguments from Justice, Reason, Religion, or the Laws of God or Man; <hi>Interest</hi> is the only thing which is <hi>likely to prevail;</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Complement to a Parliament Man; but it goes higher yet, and takes in the Majority of the States, for no one Man shall ever determin these great things.</p>
            <p>ยง. 3. You tell him, that <hi>All the threatning Dangers of</hi> Popery <hi>were not a more formidable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to considering Men, than the present Distractions and Divisions.</hi> Now surely this is a very bold and daring stroke; but that I am certain these pensive thoughtful Men are not either very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or very considerable; otherwise, the few of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that are over-thoughtful in this Point, deserve much Compassion, because they disquiet themselves and others out of pure tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and an <hi>over-great Loyalty;</hi> but then there is no danger to be apprehended from them; and they will in time satisfie their own Scruples, and in the interim, I doubt not, infinitely more Men dread the <hi>Dangers of Popery,</hi> even to this day, than all the <hi>Common-wealth Men, Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ambitious and revengeful Wretches,</hi> which you have so artfully mustered up to fright the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Esquire</hi> with, can over-ballance. Strange it is in the mean time, that the <hi>Dangers of Popery,</hi> which last <hi>October</hi> appeared so formidable, should in so short a time vanish, or rather dwindle into nothing: But God, by the Ministry of the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> and his Friends, has brought this about. In the rest of that Section I agree with you, and approve of it.</p>
            <p>The two next Sections being only a representation of the different Parties of Men now upon the Stage, I leave as I find them.</p>
            <p>ยง. 6. <hi>Tho the opinion of those who are for sending to the King, and treating with him to return to his Government, under such legal restraints, as shall give security to the most jealous Persons for</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97023:2"/>
               <hi>the preservation of their Laws, Liberties, and Religion, is horribly decryed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against it is, because it is vain.</hi> Now Sir, that Reason is so very good, that it may perhaps justifie that dreadful Consequence you so shrink at; for tho I do not doubt but you are a wonderful <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> yet if Twenty wiser Men than you were joyned with you to <hi>frame these new Laws,</hi> yet let but a Popish Prince have the Supreme <hi>Executive Power</hi> and the <hi>Legal Prerogatives,</hi> and he will break through all your restrictions with wonderful facility, as we have seen by experience. But then if you leave him the Name and take away the Power of a King, you set up a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> immediately, which will not end with your Popish Prince, but there will be stickling to keep all things in the same State in the following Reign, of what Religion soever the Prince is, which was the Reason why the limitations offered by <hi>Charles</hi> II. in 1679. were rejected.</p>
            <p>Well, but we <hi>would have thought our selves very secure if the King would have called a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Yes Sir, if he would have call'd it <hi>Freely,</hi> so that it had been the production of his Will without Force; but, Sir, it is notorious, he was resolved the <hi>Parliament</hi> should either not be <hi>free</hi> or not <hi>meet,</hi> and if your Memory will not serve you to re-call the virulent <hi>Reflection on the humble Petition present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal the 17th of</hi> November <hi>last,</hi> in which the Author tells us, <hi>That the summoning a Parliament now, is so far from being the only way</hi> (<hi>to preserve his Majesty and the Kingdom</hi>) <hi>that it will be one of the principal causes of much Misery to the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. and nothing would do then, but driving the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> out of the Kingdom with Force and Arms. Now I say Sir, if you cannot remember this, you shall never be trusted to <hi>frame Laws,</hi> if I can help it.</p>
            <p>There is another and a better reason to refuse a Treaty, than the <hi>fearing the King should comply.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he should grant all that you can ask, bating <hi>White-hall, the Revenue, the Title of King, and the Right of calling Parliaments, and making Peace and War:</hi> What security have we that he will acquiesce in this low restrained Estate; Oaths, Laws, and Promises, we had before, but what did they signifie, who shall be Garantee, what shall we do if he break out again? In short <hi>quis custodiet Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</hi> So that the many who desire a Treaty, are desired to read the <hi>Enquiry into the present State of Affairs,</hi> that they may not come into the Discipline of the severe Lady, who has taught the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi> a Lesson which <hi>England</hi> too must have gone through with, if God and <hi>H. W. P. O.</hi> had not saved us.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Convention</hi> should refuse to treat, and <hi>Depose the King, it would act without a legal Power,</hi> ยง. 8. Why Sir, here is no occasion to talk of a <hi>Deposition,</hi> the King is gone of his own accord freely; and they are only to consider whether we shall perish in a State of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> recall him, and suffer over again all that is past, and all that was intended, but prevented; or whether they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize the next immediate Heir, and enquire who that is? Well, but the next Heir, it seems, shall have small joy of it, <hi>his whole Authority depending on a Convention that has no Authority:</hi> In good time! Will the Authority of this Prince, when acknowledged, depend on the Authority of the <hi>Convention?</hi> Did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or King <hi>Iames</hi> I. owe all their Authority to the Parliaments which recognized their respective Rights? <hi>But no Man will think himself bound in Conscience to obey this Heir;</hi> Have you, Sir, the keeping of all Mens Consciences, or the knowledg of their Thoughts? I can assure you mine is not in your custody.</p>
            <p>ยง. 9. <hi>All those who think themselves bound</hi> [still] <hi>by their Oath of Allegiance to defend the Kings Person, his Crown, and Dignity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>will be greatly discontented.</hi> Why Sir, then they may go over into <hi>France,</hi> and be admitted into his Guards, and perhaps the generous Allowance given him by the <hi>French</hi> King, will maintain them, if their <hi>Heresie</hi> do not over-ballance their Loyalty, and turn it into a Crime, as it happened to the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> Well, <hi>but they will never own any other whilst their own King lives:</hi> Assuredly this is a wonderful Man, if he could but as certainly inform us of the number, as he can of the Thoughts and future Actions of these <hi>Loyalists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but if they should happen to be <hi>Persons of known Prudence, Abilities, Integrity, Honesty, tho they were never so few and never so tame, it would give a terrible stroke to this tottering Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Why, Sir, all or the greatest part of such Men in the Nation, were a dreadful Body, tho they were and ever will be <hi>few;</hi> but Sir, there must be a considerable Body of such Men first sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the Convention, a number without Doors are already satisfied, and more will when the <hi>States</hi> have passed their <hi>Resolves;</hi> and the remainder of the Men of this <hi>High Character,</hi> who will still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main discontented, if they are any thing <hi>peaceable,</hi> though not over <hi>tame,</hi> will never be able to shock the most <hi>tottering Government</hi> in the World <hi>by their Examples,</hi> how well soever he thinks of them.</p>
            <p>Yet, ยง. 10. He endeavours to shew the number will not be small, because many who joyned with the <hi>Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>โข</desc>
                  </gap>ce are ashamed of what they have done, and ask God pardon for it, and are ready to undo</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97023:2"/>
               <hi>it as far as they can.</hi> Well, Sir, how many such do you know besides your self? A List of these Men were worth the having, and may perhaps be easily taken, if one knew how to separate them from the rest; however, I should not fear greatly the <hi>terrible Shock</hi> of these wonderful Men, till I had better information of their Numbers than you can possibly give us. <hi>They were not willing to part with the King, tho they were horribly afraid of Popery.</hi> Why, Sir, has the King changed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>France,</hi> or are these Gentlemen so fond of the King, that they would now be contented to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all that <hi>Popery threatned</hi> so lately? Or are they become as weary of their Delivery as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Popery? Or will they sacrifice their <hi>Laws, Religion, old Foundations,</hi> and <hi>Free Parliaments</hi> to their Allegiance to their King? If you say yes, I have done; if no, then you would have what was not to be had, and will not be contented with what may be had; and if the Number of these Men is great, farewel to the Liberties, Laws, Religion, and Priviledges of <hi>England,</hi> and its Wealth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants too, and what is left you may be pleased to divide amongst your Men of <hi>Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all this he assures us, ยง. 10. <hi>There will be a Thousand Occasions of discontent;</hi> just a <hi>Thousand,</hi> neither one more nor less; <hi>besides</hi> those springing from the <hi>Sense of Loyalty and Conscience:</hi> Strange, that these Two should be so troublesom, as to equal, if not exceed the whole <hi>Thousand</hi> that went before.</p>
            <p>He that had been before so liberal of his Information, now sets us to guess in the ยง. 10. <hi>How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will be discontented in the new Court for want of Preferment?</hi> Why, Sir, If you please to inform me how many days in <hi>February</hi> shall be clear, and how many shall be cloudy, I will fall a guessing how many in the new Court shall be pleased, and how many shall be dissatisfied; but when I have done, it will not be worth the while, because this ever happens, and Courtiers have an odd way of keeping these Malecontents in hope, till they fall off or gain what they desire; and so if there should happen to be a Thousand of them, they will not be able to shock the Government, if there is no other cause of Discontent than that.</p>
            <p>Well, but here <hi>Duty and Discontent will mix, because they are sensible of their Mistake when it is too late: For as they ought not to have fought for Popery, nor against the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Country; so neither ought they to have deserted the defence of the King's Person and Crown, but have brought the Prince to Terms as well as the King:</hi> Why, Sir, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia.</hi> The King was never brought to Terms, nor perhaps never will: So that if they had fought at all, it must have been for <hi>Popery,</hi> and against both our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi> Sir, shew when and where the King offered us or the Prince any <hi>Terms,</hi> and I will pass my word you shall be employed to <hi>frame Laws</hi> for the <hi>Convention,</hi> which is certainly a good Employ for one that is so expert at it as you pretend to be.</p>
            <p>Well, ยง. 13. <hi>A heavy Tax must be laid upon the Nation, to defray the Charge of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Why, Sir, Are you of the Privy Council to the Prince? Surely he will be able to find some other cause, or not make the Tax so very <hi>heavy. But Men will be very sorry to lose their King, and pay so dear for it too:</hi> Yes doubtless, a gracious King is a great Loss; but if he will be gone, and involve us in a War too, <hi>Taxes must be paid,</hi> yea, <hi>heavy Taxes</hi> to support the Charge of it, or <hi>Louis</hi> will in a short time teach us what the Prince's Expedition was worth, whatever it cost.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, we must <hi>part with our Church too,</hi> the <hi>crazy Title will require the giving the Church to the Dissenters,</hi> ยง. 14. The <hi>Dissenters</hi> have of late acted very well, and perhaps if a wise Man has the managing of them; and the <hi>Popish Emissaries</hi> be carefully looked after, we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Quarrel better cheap than the <hi>parting with our Church.</hi> Sir, I am well assured a great deal less will for the present content them, and the King is not immortal, and whenever he dies<g ref="char:punc">โช</g> the <hi>Crazy Title</hi> will be sodered again, if no body be to be blame for giving it another <hi>terrible Shock</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ยง. 15. <hi>Should the King be deposed, or any other ascend the Throne, it will be necessary to keep a standing Army to quell such Discontents.</hi> You may be a good <hi>Law-framer</hi> for ought I know, but I will swear you are no <hi>States-Man;</hi> this whole Section is meer Whimsey borrowed from the <hi>Dutch Design Anatomized,</hi> who had the folly to talk of Governing <hi>England</hi> by an Army of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> but why God knows, except it were because a few were brought over to deliver us, and cannot presently be returned back to <hi>Holland.</hi> The Prince is both a wise and a good Prince, and knows the Consequence of keeping those Forces long here, better than a Thousand such <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>โข</desc>
                  </gap>w-framers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppose the King should return with a Foreign Force to recover his Kingdom, how ready will the Men of</hi> Conscience <hi>be, and the Men of</hi> Discontent, <hi>to joyn with them, nay, to invite him home again.</hi> This looks so like a <hi>Roman Catholick Zeal,</hi> that if I were not assured he is a <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Man,</hi> I could not believe but it was a Disciple of S. <hi>Omers:</hi> But will the conscientious

Mea invite the King home again, with all his Apostolick Vicars, Jesuits, Ecclesiastical Judges, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing Power, and a round Army of <hi>French Dragoons</hi> to teach us the <hi>French</hi> Faith after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion? Are these the Men of <hi>Character, Prudence, Ability, Integrity,</hi> or of Conscience either? Would one of the Primitive Christians have talked thus, have stood for a <hi>Licinius</hi> against a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine?</hi> Well, if the King <hi>comes in a Conqueror, we shall wish we had treated:</hi> truly I shall not; I had rather be forced than deceived, for then I know what I shall have to trust to; and I would not willingly be accessary to my own Ruine.</p>
            <p>Well, suppose all this unanswerable stuff is over-voted, ยง. 17. <hi>We are to bring good proof the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>is an Imposture, or else we had better let it alone.</hi> Very good; the <hi>Negative</hi> is to be proved; we may guess by this what kind of Laws you, Sir, would frame. Well, but if this be not done, the <hi>discontented Men will have a plausible pretence to quarrel:</hi> what the conscientious Men will do we must guess, but in all probability they will not be better qualited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What if</hi> the Princess of <hi>Orange</hi> be a Lady of that <hi>eminent Virtue</hi> that she should scruple to sit upon <hi>her Fathers Throne</hi> whilst he lives? Well, his Majesty has deserted his Throne and Kingdom when he needed not, except he had pleased; and some body must sit upon his Throne, though he is yet alive: Now if it be her Right after his death, Why not now? Our Author is at his Prayers, that <hi>God would give her Grace to resist the Temptation;</hi> and I at mine, that the Author may never be one of her Chaplains till he is better inform'd. The rest of that Section is not unanswerable, but not worth answering.</p>
            <p>He has all along supposed the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Crown'd, yet in the 19th Section he proves he can have no Right to it, neither by <hi>Descent</hi> nor <hi>Gift;</hi> and truly I am of the same mind for many Reasons, and especially for the sake of the Three alledged by him, ยง. 20, 21, 22. and for some others too of as great weight, which may be found <hi>in the Lord</hi> Virulam's <hi>History of</hi> Henry VII. And yet our Cafe now before us has three Difficulties that had not, 1. A King living, 2. A Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> true or false, 3. A Nation divided in Religion; to which I might perhaps add the <hi>Excessive Power</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Excessive Zeal</hi> of this Generation to preserve the Descent of the Crown in the Right Line, and in the Legal Steps and Degrees. And this being done, I am persuaded nothing can divide the <hi>English</hi> Nation, or lessen their Zeal and Affection to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Crown if it were ours to give him.</p>
            <p>The Postscript, which is an <hi>Huy and Cry</hi> after the <hi>French League to cut our Throats,</hi> I leave to the <hi>Convention:</hi> and if I durst be so bold as to ask a favour of them, it should be to enquire what the <hi>Ro. Ca.</hi> meant by that Threat of theirs, so frequently printed and spoken by them, <hi>If fair means would not obtain the Repeal of our</hi> Penal Laws <hi>and</hi> Tests, <hi>foul should.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for a Conclusion, I would desire you, Sir, to propose your method of restoring the King and securing our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and it shall go hard but I will shew you it is impracticable, or impossible; that it will never be granted, or if it be, never observed: and if you please to bless the World with a receipt of an <hi>Obligation</hi> that will bind the Conscience of any <hi>Ro Ca.</hi> so fast that neither <hi>Iesuit</hi> nor <hi>Pope</hi> can break or untie it, I assure you I will joyn with you in a Petition to the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a Treaty forthwith, without any other terms to be proposed than the giving us that Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whatever it is. And in the Interim, I am,</p>
