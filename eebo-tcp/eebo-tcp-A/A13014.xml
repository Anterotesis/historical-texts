            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſerve the Church, in bringing forth this proviſion which is here preſented to you, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans coſt indeed, yet not without ſome labour and care of my own, to prepare the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſet things in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. I am the rather incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in it, becauſe I know that God can as well ſerve himſelf of my labour in this, as of the skill and ability of the learned Author: and if in this I may be a helper of the joy of Gods Church, I have wherein for to rejoyce.</p>
            <p>Theſe inſuing Sermons were firſt preached unto you, they were yours in the delivery, and are yours of Right, as conceived
<pb facs="tcp:231:5"/>
and brought forth for you; and I know not how you ſhould loſe your Right in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of them, but rather owe Patronage, Apology, Harbour and Recommendations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have made bold to prefix your Names before them, and ſo to publiſh them for the good of the Church; being well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that you will not grutch this communication, of your own right and intereſt in them, to others.</p>
            <p>For the Author, hee needs not my Candle to light his Sun, nor my Pen to make new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of honour and love in your hearts, who have ſo fully known his Doctrine, manner
<pb facs="tcp:231:5"/>
of Life, Purpoſe, Faith, Long-ſuffering, Charity, Patience, Humility, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I may ſay of this poſthume Birth, that the Author died, as <hi>Rachel,</hi> in travell with it; and it may well be called <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the ſon of his Right hand: whil'ſt he was a carrying of you up into the Mount, to ſhew you the land of Promiſe, God took him, and by Inviſible meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, caried him to the fruition of Eternall Bleſſedneſſe: he is taken out of your ſight, and if you deſire to finde him, you muſt aſpire unto the heavenly Paradiſe, by walking in that tract which he hath in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine here chalked out unto
<pb facs="tcp:231:6"/>
you; and in thoſe ſteps of his religious and zealous converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he hath walked in before you.</p>
            <p>But leſt you ſhould let theſe things ſlip; this booke may be your continuall <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> in this, hee being dead, yet ſpeaketh. But his labour will be loſt, and my undertaking fruitleſſe, except you be pleaſed to make the practiſe of theſe things your trade, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of them your Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſee wherein true happineſſe doth conſiſt: the right placing or miſplacing of happineſſe is the Ruder of a mans life, the fountaine of his
<pb facs="tcp:231:6"/>
well or ill doing; according to which, men take their marks, and ſhoot right or wrong, in all the actions of their lives: you will be miſtaken, if you ſeek it in theſe outward things, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in God; there is no other independant good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any other good that can be communicated to all the heirs of Bleſsing, but only God; that which all muſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, and that together, muſt needs be ſome infinite thing. It will then be worth your while, to call off your affections from the world, and to abate of your eager purſuit after the things of this life: you are not made for Riches, but they are made for
<pb facs="tcp:231:7"/>
you: the Bee will forſake the Flower that yeelds her no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the fruit that the World affords you, is but like that which grows upon the banks of the dead Sea, a fair apple, which under a red ſide, contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but duſt: it will be your wiſdom, not to cumber your ſelves about many things, when one thing is needfull: the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Roman Generall to the ſouldier that kept the tents, when he ſhould have bin fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the field, <hi>Non Amoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium diligentes,</hi> will be uſed of God, if when he cals us to ſeek after true Happineſſe, yet vve buſie our ſelves onely about things of an inferiour Alloy;
<pb facs="tcp:231:7"/>
God will not like ſuch buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies: our chiefeſt care and pains ſhould be beſtowed, in the attaining of that which is our chiefeſt Happineſſe; if you be induſtrious in this, your labour will not be in vain: you muſt think of Religion as of trading, which will bring no gain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diligently follovved and practiſed: Ariſe therfore, and be doing, and the Lord will be with you.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to tell you, firſt, that God hath done much for you, exalted you to heaven, in regard of the means: It is true, your eyes have ſeen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lights, ſhining in their life and Doctrine, and by death
<pb facs="tcp:231:8"/>
extinguiſhed; and yet your loſſe hath not been more bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented, than in a good meaſure graciouſly ſupplied; the cauſes of your hope and joy, have been in a good proportion equivalent to your grief and loſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, GOD looks for much from you; <hi>viz.</hi> an adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, and walking worthy of it, in a holy, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient converſation: ſuch favours beſtowed, muſt needs raiſe great expectations; and this expectation fruſtrated, doubles the judgment. But I hope better things of you, and ſuch as accompany ſalvation.</p>
            <p>You did receive the Author
<pb facs="tcp:231:8"/>
with ſo much love and honour, as that you cannot but counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this Poſthume Birth, which was firſt conceived, and brought forth for you; &amp; your ſelves being witneſſes, contains no other things, than what you have heard and learnt: and ſo, though others ſhould deny it, yet you muſt give unto it, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Intertainment. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have, in the name of the Widow of the Reverend Author, intitled you unto it. If it ſhall be approved uſefull to the Church, fruitfull to you, &amp; beneficial to any, I ſhall rejoyce; my prayers ſhal be for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and for your happineſſe.</p>

            <p>ACcept, I pray thee, from the hands of one of the meaneſt of the ſons of the Prophets, this inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe. I know, it might have been ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unto thee, by the hands of ſome more eminently learned, and better known in the Church, on whoſe judgment thou mighteſt more ſafely have repoſed thy ſelf; yet well knowing the worth of it to be ſuch, as that it will diſcover it ſelf, I rather chooſe to let my meanneſſe appear, than not to perform the debt I owe to the memory of the Reverend Author. I am not ignorant, that this undertaking of mine, together with the Sermons themſelves, will be expoſed to many cenſures; ſome there are, whom no Sermon pleaſeth, longer than it is in hearing, or otherwiſe than it is extant in their own broken notes: but theſe forget, that reſpect ſhould he had unto the publike good; there are many precious labours of godly men, that are not fit to vaniſh into the air, or to be buried in obſcurity. Others take offence at the imperfection of them, becauſe not left written by the Author, but onely taken from his mouth; I confeſſe, if the Author had publiſhed them himſelf, they would have come forth more refined, and better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted than now they do; yet the good they may thus do, prevails more for the ſending of them forth, than ſome imperfections (that uſually accompany the taking of other mens Sermons) may do to ſuppreſſe them. If my judgm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt fail me not, there is ſo much compleatneſſe in them, as that though the Author might have uttered <hi>Plura,</hi> more in lines; yet be could not have ſaid <hi>Plus,</hi> more in ſubſtance and effect, to any point that he hath
<pb facs="tcp:231:10"/>

The methodicall Analyſis, prefixed before the Sermons, was left under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors own hand, as it is here tendred unto thee: though he did for the moſt part write all in Latine, yet this Analyſis was left in Engliſh, which you have inſerted in the Margent, anſwerable to the ſeverall particulars treated on.</p>

ſhall hold a connexion together; to deliver, according to the words of the Text, and to my own intention, a <hi>form of ſound words</hi>; even the body of Divinity: and I ſhall chuſe out ſeverall Texts of Scripture for the ſeverall heads, and have now made choice of this Text of Scripture, to make entrance to the Diſcourſe; which contains an <hi>Injunction and Exhortation,</hi> from <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to take care of that; that <hi>he keep,</hi> or <hi>hold faſt a form of ſound, or wholſome words.</hi>

And ſo proceed to one main obſervation out of the words, paſſing by many others which would offer themſelves, but different from the ſcope which I drive at.</p>
               <p>1. To ſay but a word concerning the Epiſtle in generall, you may conſider both

               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:231:15"/>1. Concerning the perſons: in one word, it is an Epiſtle, written by <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> as moſt Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p>2. For the <hi>materiall circumſtances,</hi> which concerne <hi>the time:</hi> in one word alſo, the <hi>time</hi> was</p>
               <p>1. <hi>During the bands of Paul,</hi> while he was a priſoner for the Goſpels ſake; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be had in precious account, and ſo much the rather,</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe it was <hi>not long before his deſolution:</hi> which he foretels in this Epiſtle, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be (as it were) the laſt words, the laſt Dictates of a dying man, yea a dying Martyr.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>ſubſtantiall ſcope</hi> and drift of it, was to <hi>quicken,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen Timothy,</hi> in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſcharge of his Evangelicall Miniſtery, againſt all diſcouragements and hinderances that might any way abate his edge, and take off his vigour in it; as you may eaſily ſee in the whole courſe of the Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>2. But to paſſe by all other things, and only to give a generall draught, and delineation of this Chapter, to make way to the words wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I intend to ſtand.</p>
               <p>There be two things which are mainly and principally contained in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>1. We have the firſt <hi>entrance</hi> into the Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>continuation,</hi> or ſome part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the drift and ſcope of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:231:16"/>1. In the entrance (to omit the <hi>ſalutation,</hi> verſ. 1, 2. which is ordinary in all the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore I forbear to ſpeak any thing of it.)</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Introduction,</hi> by which the Apoſtle fals upon his ſcope, and upon his work that he hath to do with <hi>Timothy</hi> in this Epiſtle; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a ſweet expreſſion of the tender love and affection which <hi>Paul</hi> beareth to <hi>Timothy</hi>; and this he ſheweth
<list>
                     <item>1. To be a <hi>great love.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. To be a <hi>well grounded love.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. To be a <hi>growing and continuing love.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three circumſtances are ſpecially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable:</p>
               <p>He proveth, that it is great; and though it be great,</p>
               <p>He approves it to be well grounded.</p>
               <p>And in the laſt place, he doth improve it, and makes uſe of this love, to ſtir up <hi>Timothy</hi> to an improvement in all piety.</p>
               <p>1. The greatneſſe of the Apoſtles love is expreſſed, and proved, and demonſtrated by a double fruit of it.</p>
               <p>1. We have one fruit of this excellent love of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the third verſe, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the ſalutation contained in the two former: and it is <hi>an earneſt prayer</hi> for the good of <hi>Timothy,</hi> remembring of him in his abſence;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:231:16"/>
though he were diſtant far in place and perſon, yet there was a ſoder that held him to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that joyned him to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and made him to preſent him to God in his prayers continually: if you will reade the verſe, you have it very emphatically expreſſed in three very choice circumſtances; <hi>I thank God, whom I ſerve from mine Elders, with pure conſcience, that without ceaſing, I have remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He prayeth for him <hi>night and day,</hi> in the latter end of the verſe.</p>
               <p>2. Night and day, <hi>without ceaſing,</hi> without interruption or intermiſſion: and he doth it with ſo much ſtrength, and tenderneſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, (as <hi>Chryſostom</hi> upon that place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; it is a very hyperbolicall love which the Apoſtle ſheweth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in that he doth <hi>bleſſe God that he prayed for him; I thank God:</hi> and he bleſſeth God, which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of very ſweet love, and tender affection of his heart, working towards the good of <hi>Timothy,</hi> remembring him continually in his prayers.</p>
               <p>2. There is a ſecond fruit of this love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which the Apoſtle demonſtrates the greatneſs of his love, and that is in the fourth verſe, <hi>Deſiring to ſee thee:</hi> there is a ſtrong attractive between Chriſtian and Chriſtian, that do know one another, that draweth them ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, and prevaileth againſt all diſtance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:231:17"/>
of place; ſo as they do not only remember, but they do make out towards the injoyment one of anothers company: and this <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and it is expreſſed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, as though much of <hi>Pauls</hi> comfort, and much of the happineſſe and ſweetneſſe of his life, did depend on the injoyment of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, that I may be filled with joy</hi>: as if he ſhould ſay, he ſhould be full of joy in his preſence: and this is the firſt circumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatneſſe of his love, expreſſed by his prayers for him, and his deſire to ſee him.</p>
               <p>2. But then ſecondly, this is not an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love, a miſplaced love, or a meer naturall and carnall affection that <hi>Paul</hi> had to <hi>Timothy</hi>; but it is a ſpirituall, and ſubordinate love, which is grounded upon very great reaſon, which is (as you know) the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: now this he approves to be a well grounded love, which he bears towards <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> from a double conſideration:</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, his <hi>tender love to Paul,</hi> expreſſed in his <hi>tears,</hi> v. 4. <hi>Magnes amoris amor,</hi> love is the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of love; and therefore he ſaid right, <hi>ſi vis amari, ama</hi>: the moſt effectuall charm to draw love is, the ſence and experience of the love of an other towards us: He is of a very barbarous ſpirit that will not reciprocate and anſwer love with love: and thus the Apoſtle intimates as the firſt ground of his love, the tender love, and tender affection of Timothy towards Paul,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:231:17"/>
and therefore if it were for nothing elſe, but for his love towards him, he loves him and that is intimated in the 4 verſe <hi>remembring thy tears</hi>: I refer it for the preſent (and ſo I conceive it very reaſonable) to the laſt parting of Paul and Timothy, now to thoſe that are united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſtrong affection it is death to part: It is like a child that is to part with the nurſes breſt and muſt be weaned, there is a great deal of mourning, and pining and languiſhing away to think that he muſt bee weaned from his breaſt, from whence he hath ſucked ſo much ſweetneſſe and nouriſhment: Such an affection there ſeemed to be ſtirring in Timothy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Paul, at there parting: Now Timothy having long injoyed the ſweet, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble communion of Paul, and the happineſſe of his fellowſhip whence he had ſucked ſo many inſtructions, ſo much edification, ſo much of his eſtabliſhment, now upon the apprehenſion of parting with him, he apprehends he muſt be robbed of all this; the thought of this like a child made him breake forth into teares: ſo that is the firſt ground of Pauls love to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: Timothyes love to him.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>His true faith to God which was lineal, Cordiall</hi>; this is another ground, which the Apoſtle produceth to prove the groundedneſſe of his love, and that was Timothyes deſert, having that which was worthy to be beloved. There be two things ſay the Philoſophers that are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:231:18"/>
the fountaines of love; A man loves either

i. e. either becauſe the thing is his own; or elſe becauſe the thing is worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: a man loves his child, though it be not ſo faire, or ſo witty, or ſo commendable as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others are, yet he loves it, becauſe it is his owne; and thoſe that are our owne, that are made ours, are alſo made love worthy, for that is a good ground of love <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. i. e. worthines of love; and this ground of Timothyes worthineſſe, as the ground of Pauls love, the Apoſtle mentions in the 5 verſ. you ſhall find it there fully expreſſed: <hi>When I call to remembrance the unfained faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy granmother Lois &amp;c.</hi> The lineall and cordiall pietie of Timothy; the piety of Timothy which Paul knew, and was perſwaded of, and had experience of, was the great bond that tyed the heart of Paul to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy: and that is ſo much the more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable becauſe it was piety laid in the right line; he was deſcended from a pious family, from pious parents; he mentions his mother and his grandmother, which is a circumſtance that addes ſome beauty, ſome gloſſe: it is a ſweet thing to ſee the children, and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children of thoſe that have been in covenant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:231:18"/>
with God; of thoſe that have feared God, to ſee them tread in their parents ſteps, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their piety, that it doth not fall to the ground; but to perpetuate it, and carry it to another generation; it is a thing that much commends, it is a very great ſhame when it is not ſo, and a very ſweet thing when it is ſo: But all this were nothing, if he were deſcended from a Godly family and himſelf not ſo: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle commends him to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
i. e. <hi>of ſincere faith,</hi> of which he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded not only in reſpect of his relation to the religious family of which he was; but for the grace which was in himſelfe: being <hi>aſſured that it dwelled in him alſo</hi> which is the ſecond cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, it was a great love, and a well grounded love: It was a <hi>continuing,</hi> or rather <hi>a growing love</hi>: and therefore the Apoſtle infers upon this thing, this very love of his towards Timothy was the ground of his writing to him; and therefore what ever came from him now, it ariſed from his love, and was a fruit of it, and therefore might make it more welcome, and acceptable to him, and conſiderable by him, to whom it was written: and in that particular is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>whole ſcope</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle: and the ſume of it, wrote to him for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, out of his love: knowing his Godlineſſe &amp; piety, he takes occaſion to build him up, and incourage him more and more in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:231:19"/>
to <hi>put</hi> him in <hi>remembrance</hi> that he <hi>ſtir up the gift of God that was in him</hi> verſe 6:</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The reaſon of it</hi> in the 7 v. becauſe that he had not received <hi>the Spirit of fear,</hi> but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>of</hi> love, &amp; power: It was given him for that purpoſe to ſtirre it up; <hi>God beſtowes no grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any that it ſhould lye onely ſleeping in the aſhes, that he ſhould ſuffer it to be ſtifled, but all graces are given as tallents, to be imployed; and ſet aworke for our Maſters advantage:</hi> But I feare this is a little to farre off, and therefore I paſſe it. Thus farre we have the entrance into the Epiſtle: wherein the Apoſtle Paul layeth his foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his diſcourſe upon his love, to make all that ever he ſhould write to be more effectuall with Timothy, that it might work more upon him.</p>
               <p>2. The reſt now is the <hi>continuation of the materiall paſsages of the Epiſtle,</hi> and I will go no further in it, then it reacheth in this chapter: and in it, the remainder of it, hath theſe two things done by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>1. We have firſt of all a <hi>double admonition</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Timothy.</p>
               <p>2. A <hi>double provocation</hi> for the receiving and practiſing of this admonition.</p>
               <p>There is a double admonition.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A <hi>Negative</hi> Admonition.</item>
                  <item>2. An <hi>Affirmative</hi> Admonition.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Negative Admonition</hi> is expreſſed in the 8 verſe, and there be ſome particulars in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:231:19"/>
Admonition it ſelf, beſides the proſecution, which I will but touch.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the Admonition lieth in two things:</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould not be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> either <hi>of the teſtimony of the Lord,</hi> the witneſſe bearing to the truth of the Goſpel; nor <hi>of Paul,</hi> that was a <hi>priſoner</hi> for this: the bands of <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould not make <hi>Timothy</hi> to bluſh, or be aſhamed; but rather that he ſhould compoſe himſelf, and not be unwilling to ſuffer with <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſuffer with the Goſpel, yea to ſhare with him in his ſufferings. That is the ſum of the Admonition, and there be three branches of it,</p>
               <p>1. That he ſhould not be <hi>aſhamed of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> given to the Lord, to the truth, to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>2. That he ſhould not be aſhamed of it the more, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was in diſgrace for it, was a <hi>priſoner</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>3. And laſtly, that he ſhould take part and ſhare with him, even in his ſufferings; <hi>ſhould be partaker of the afflictions</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> vvas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, for the Goſpels ſake.</p>
               <p>And as there be theſe three branches of the Exhortation, ſo there be two Arguments which the Apoſtle doth preſſe for the ſeverall branches of this duty, proportionable to the difficulties of it.</p>
               <p>1. He had no reaſon to be aſhamed of the Goſpel; and the reaſon is expreſſed in the 9
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:231:20"/>
and 10 verſes. <hi>From the condition and nature of the Goſpel:</hi> it is the Goſpel which contains the treaſures of all truths, prepared long ago, but revealed to the ſervants of GOD in latter times; by which we are made partakers of the high, holy, and precious calling, by which all good, and all happineſſe is conveighed unto us: and therefore in regard of the nature of the Goſpel, little reaſon for any man, for <hi>Timothy,</hi> to be aſhamed of that, in which he ſhould glory, and in which was contained all the happineſſe that ever he, or any other was, or ſhall be made partaker of.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider the <hi>condition of Paul:</hi> there was no reaſon that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould be aſhamed of <hi>Paul,</hi> though he were a priſoner for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, under a cloud, and under diſgrace for it; that he ſhould not ſhrink from him in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and be loath to own him: and that is expreſſed,</p>
               <p>1. If we look upon <hi>the cauſe of his ſuffering.</hi> it is not ſuffering, but the cauſe of ſuffering, that caſts diſgrace or dirt upon a man, that makes him contemptible, becauſe he ſuffers, as the ſaying of old in this caſe was, <hi>Non paena ſed cauſa facit martyrem</hi>: nor 'tis not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the cauſe that makes a malefactour; and ſo makes a man liable to ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: if a man ſuffer for a <hi>good cauſe,</hi> it is <hi>honorificall,</hi> not ſhamefull and reproachfull; if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuffered as a <hi>malefactour,</hi> his friends
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:231:20"/>
might have hang'd down their heads, and hid their faces, and have counted it as a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the family of <hi>Paul,</hi> and all his friends and all thoſe that were in relation to him: But to ſuffer in a noble and good cauſe, not as a malefactor but as a martyr, for the Goſpels ſake, there was no reaſon that any followers of his ſhould be aſhamed of him; and the Apoſtle expreſſeth that in the 11 and 12 verſes: <hi>of which I am made a preacher, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle and teacher of the Gentiles; For the which cauſe I alſo ſuffer theſe things, but I am not aſhamed &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould ſay there is nothing can be caſt in my teeth, and however I be under a cloud and in diſgrace, yet there is nothing can be laid againſt me, but that I have brought this upon my ſelfe, by diſcharging my office faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, which is ſo far from being deſpicable that it is honorable.</p>
               <p>2. As his <hi>cauſe</hi> was good ſo was his <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> this is the other branch of the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not only not to be aſhamed, but even to be willing to ſuffer for the Goſpel, and to take ſhare and part with him in it, and this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſſeth in the 12 verſe, as his cauſe was good, ſo his carriage and confidence, his owne temper and diſpoſition in his ſuffering was ſuch, as that no man that well conſidered it, had reaſon to be aſhamed; <hi>I am not aſhamed</hi> my ſelf, and indeed, why ſhould any man be aſhamed of another that ſuffers for that thing,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:231:21"/>
of which he rather hath cauſe to glory, than be aſhamed. Nay he addes, <hi>I am perſwaded, and beleeve that he (viz.</hi> God) <hi>is able to keep that which I have committed to him,</hi> (that was his ſoul, though it is not expreſſed, yet it is ſuppoſed, intimating his belief, that God would keep his depoſitum, his ſoul, which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him) <hi>againſt that day:</hi> now in ſuch a caſe as this (as the ſaying was) <hi>it is a wrong to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, to pity him, or to weep for him,</hi> (I will not ſay, as ſome adde) <hi>to pray for him.</hi> It is a wrong to a martyr, to be aſhamed of him, or to mourn for him, eſpecially when the martyr himſelf is couragious, and glorious in his cauſe, and God hath ſo mightily ſupported his ſpirits, and ſet them ſo high, that he can feel nothing, but bear all eaſily: I ſay, when God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted his ſpirits, and elevated them thus, it is an incongruous thing for others to be caſt down, there is no congruity in it.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt of that double precept of Paul, verſe 2 the Negative precept, wherein he commandeth Timothy not to be aſhamed, which the Apoſtle propounds in the firſt place, leaſt that ſhould be a rub in the way; leaſt the conſideration that he was in priſon, in diſgrace, in bonds and afflictions, might make Timothy cold, and ſhrink away from him.</p>
               <p>2. He addes another to that, and that is an <hi>Affirmative</hi> one in the verſes which I have

read, and this precept too is double: <hi>hold faſt,</hi> in verſe 13, and <hi>keep</hi> in the 14 verſe.</p>
               <p>In a generality only I ſhall expreſſe thoſe things now (and reſerve particularity till I came to my point) But now in the generality, either of them both theſe three things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable.</p>
               <p>1. There is the <hi>act</hi> that is injoyned in one verſe, <hi>hold faſt,</hi> in the other <hi>keep:</hi> the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, though expreſſed variouſly.</p>
               <p>2. There is the <hi>object</hi> expreſſed in one verſ, <hi>a form of wholſome words,</hi> expreſſed in the other that good depoſitum, or <hi>that worthy thing</hi> which was committed to thee; which was the very ſame thing, that ſame form of wholſome Words, which was depoſited unto him.</p>
               <p>3. And there is the <hi>manner</hi> of performance of both theſe; in the former intimated, hold faſt <hi>in faith and love, which is in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> though I confeſſe and ſhall touch afterward, that it may admit of another interpretation, and that in a very good ſence, yet I thinke that is part of the Apoſtles meaning, to expreſſe the manner, how he ſhould hold faſt a form of ſound and wholſome Words verſe 2 <hi>in faith and love which is in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>: they are the two hold faſts) and the latter is expreſſed, but more deeper, and from a higher ground and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger head, and that is <hi>by the ſpirit of God which dwelleth in us</hi>; he muſt keep thoſe things that were committed to him by the ſpirit of God;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:231:22"/>
and indeed that is the ſpring and root: our grace doth immediatly lay faſt hold on theſe things that are committed to us from the word of God; but it is the ſpirit of God that breaths in us that grace whereby we lay hold, and which ſupports us, and enables us continually; and it muſt be his ſtrength that muſt enable us to hold ſtedfaſt, and conſtant, in any good thing.</p>
               <p>There remains now but one thing, and ſo I ſhall diſmiſſe the generall delineation of the chapter: you have heard the double Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; there is likewiſe in the latter end of the chapter, from thoſe verſes that I have read, to the end of the chapter,</p>
               <p>2. A double provocation, by which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth labour to preſſe and inforce <hi>Timothy</hi> upon this duty, and both of them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Examples.</p>
               <p>There are
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Evill Examples</hi>; and</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Good Examples</hi>:</item>
                  </list>
By both which the Apoſtle ſpurs <hi>Timothy</hi> on, and provokes him to this duty, by the <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the evill, and by the <hi>emulation</hi> of the good.</p>
               <p>1. The evill Examples are of <hi>inconſtant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors,</hi> expreſſed in the 15 verſe, <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that all that are in</hi> Aſia, <hi>have deſerted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:231:22"/>
me</hi>; declined me, turned away from me: which is no new thing for a man that comes to ſuffer for the cauſe of God, though he do it never ſo diſcreetly, though he do it with never ſo much conſtancie, nay though he do it never ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norifically, for the publike good, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like cauſe: I ſay it is no new thing, to have many turn their backs upon them then, to count a man for a fool, and ſo to leave him: it was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, he did meet with ſuch, <hi>all that were in</hi> Aſia, <hi>turned from him,</hi> and forſook him: as they that (it may be) <hi>cryed Hoſanna</hi> before, were ready now to cry out, <hi>Crucifige,</hi> crucifie him. Now he was under a cloud, and under a ſtorm, they were afraid of him, and now they would not look on him, they ſhrink back from him: and the Apoſtle preſſeth this conſideration on <hi>Timothy,</hi> not to diſhearten him, or to put him in the ſame courſe, but to oblige him ſo much the more to ſtick cloſe to him in the cauſe of Chriſt, becauſe of the neglect of it. There be ſo many that fall off from the ſervants of God, when they are in their afflictions, that thoſe who are ſincere, they had need to perform their duty ſo much the more cloſely and ſweetly, to keep to them, and recompence all the diſcomforts, and diſcouragements vvhich they do meet withall, from falſe friends, and falſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. There is a great neceſſity, and ſo a great obligation lieth upon godly perſons,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:231:23"/>
on thoſe that are truely ſuch, out of the conſideration of the treachery, and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe, and cowardiſe of the wicked, ſo much the more to ſhew themſelves, to ſtand by, and comfort the Saints of God in their ſufferings.</p>
               <p>2. The good examples are, of <hi>conſtant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerers</hi>: and there is one thing in it, which I ſhall note by the way; <hi>viz.</hi> the great difference of the Apoſtles propounding of the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and of the other; he propounds the bad example with a meere bare mention, <hi>all have forſaken me</hi>; without any paſſion, without any bitter harſhneſſe, or railing againſt theſe men, he forbears this, and paſſeth by all that, and covers it: but he cannot forbear, when he propounds the good example, but doth it with a great mixture of affection, and it is very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall, home, and full, omitting no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that might adde any commendation, or ſet any beauty, or gloſſe upon it. The good example is that, though there were many that forſaked <hi>Paul,</hi> deſerted him, even <hi>all that were in Aſia</hi>; yet there was one that durſt own him, when all the reſt left him, and that was <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>: and this example of <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds very emphatically;</p>
               <p>1. With a <hi>mixture of prayers</hi> to God for him, and by way of recompence (as it were) having ingaged God to be his pay-maſter.</p>
               <p>2. With a <hi>mixture of praiſe,</hi> and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:231:23"/>
in an ingenuous acknowledgment of his fidelity and conſtancie, in adhering to him; and you may finde this mixture in a double degree:</p>
               <p>1. In the firſt place, we have <hi>praying for him,</hi> that God ſhould be mercifull to his houſhold, <hi>The Lord be mercifull to the houſe of Oneſiphorus,</hi> in the 16 verſe. And with that is mingled,</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The praiſe,</hi> and commendation of the conſtancie and fidelity of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> in theſe circumſtances:</p>
               <p>1. His <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>mercie</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> in generall, in his conſtancie to him in afflictions, <hi>often refreſhing him,</hi> in ſweetning of his ſpirits, and cheering him; he did not do it at other times onely, but in his bonds, he was not aſhamed of his bonds.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, more than ſo, there was yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in ſpeciall; he did it more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cheerfully, yea and more carefully in his bonds, than he did before, when he was at liberty, when <hi>he was at Rome,</hi> (as it is in the 17 verſe) <hi>he ſought him out very diligently</hi>; he did not onely when <hi>Paul</hi> met him, when he did meet him (as it were) in his diſh, and then give him a cold complement, and ſalute him; but whereas he might have declined <hi>Paul, he ſought him out very diligently,</hi> very carefully, hazarding and ingaging himſelf in this cauſe for the comfort of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Then there is a ſecond ſetting of it out,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:231:24"/>
for the Apoſtle could never have done with this: but there is a ſecond mixture in the 18 verſe. There is again</p>
               <p>1. A <hi>repetition of prayer</hi> for <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> that had ſo carefully ſought him out, and never left till he found him; <hi>viz. That the Lord would grant unto him, that he might find mercie,</hi> when he ſought it, in the moſt needfull time, in the great day, in <hi>the day of the LORD.</hi> And withall,</p>
               <p>2. There is again a <hi>repetition of praiſe,</hi> for he cannot take off his hand, cannot ſay enough (as a thankfull ſpirit, and an ingenuous ſpirit will not let fall any good received, nor keep back any praiſe that is due to it:) and this <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth in the very laſt clauſe, and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe; he comes in there with a new ſupply of praiſe, <hi>What he did, in how many things he miniſtred to me at Epheſus, thou knoweſt very well:</hi> he remembred his <hi>ancient kindneſſe,</hi> and makes mention of it here to his praiſe. And if there were no other thing in the world (though a man had no other reward) it were enough to incourage a man, to ingage the <hi>prayers,</hi> and to deſerve the <hi>praiſes</hi> of a <hi>Paul</hi>; to be praiſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> and to have <hi>Paul</hi> as a Remembrancer at the Throne of Grace: to get the prayers of thoſe that are faithfull, and to deſerve the praiſes of thoſe that are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; were there no other recompence in the world, it were enough (&amp; they that would have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:231:24"/>
a ſhare in the reward of a martyr, muſt have a ſhare in the affliction of a martyr) however (if there were no other reward) it were (at leaſt) no contemptible thing, to be paid in prayers, to be paid in prayſes, eſpeciall from ſuch as are as Paul.</p>

               <p>I conceive it takes in all the whole ſubſtance and ſcope, of that which the Apoſtle doth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:231:25"/>
here commend to Timothy, and that which ſuits very well with the ſcope of the buſineſſe we have in hand:</p>

               <p>Which I might have taken, from the former words; but I rather take it in that place.<note place="margin">For the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of matter.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. There is a ſoundnes, and wholſomnes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:231:26"/>
of the ſubſtance of matter; which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth injoyn every man to take care of, eſpecially Miniſters, that the things which they deliver, be ſound and wholſome, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the matter; and that is the main thing, as I conceive.</p>
               <p>Now there be two things moſt principall, to make the matter of words that are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wholſome and ſound.</p>
               <p>1. The ſoundneſſe of <hi>truths,</hi> of holy truths.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Soundneſſe of Vſe.</note>2. The ſoundneſſe of <hi>uſe,</hi> and profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And they are here chiefly recommended to Miniſters, and in due place to all: to have a ſpeciall care of having, preſerving, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very charily ſuch ſound words, and truths, as that</p>
               <p>1. There may be no words, no Doctrines, no principles delivered in the Church of God; but ſuch as may be full of certain, and holy, and pious truths, ſuch as are agreeable with truth, according to the word of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the analogy of faith; that is the firſt, the ſoundneſſe of truth.</p>
               <p>2. But the other kinde of ſoundneſſe, or a ſecond branch of it, may be a ſoundneſſe of <hi>uſe,</hi> that their words may be ſuch as are fit for edification. There may be many things true, but there may be ſo little ſubſtantialneſſe, ſo little ſolidity, ſo little materialneſſe for any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:231:26"/>
uſe, ſo frivolous and ſo low, that there may be no great advantage, or benefit which can come to the Church, by hearing or receiving them: therefore the Apoſtle includes this, that as there ſhould be a care, that nothing but the ſound and wholſome truth of God ſhould be delivered, ſo that it might be ſuch ſolid and ſubſtantiall truth, as may be very conducible for the building up, and edifying of the Church of God; not frivolous, and vain, and curious diſputes and queſtions, which rather make men ſwell, and puff up, and rather make contention and jangling, but ſuch as are ſolid and ſubſtantiall, neceſſary and profitable truths for edification: that is another branch.</p>
               <p>2. But then beſides the ſoundneſſe of the matter, there is the <hi>ſoundneſſe of the manner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Soundneſſe of manner,</note> or <hi>form of words,</hi> in which theſe things are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; they muſt not be delivered in an affected language, in a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Apoſtle often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Epiſtle expreſſeth; not in a vain tinkling ſound of words, tickling the ear, to pleaſe mens fancies, and to draw mens carnall delight, in the hearing of the words that are delivered: but grave and ſober expreſſions, ſuch as may be ſubſervient to the matter, to conveigh ſubſtantial truths, in an edifying and profitable way, it muſt be ſuch a form of words: and indeed there may be a great fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a man may be to ſeek a language, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:231:27"/>
he will affect a curious, and neat contrivance of words; and having found it, it will be far from the gravity of the buſineſſe. And truly, if we were (as we ſhould be) rightly affected, when we come to the houſe of God, and have to deal with divine things, we would not look after the dreſſe of words, and the tyre of words; which is the pooreſt, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that can be, and ſcarce worthy to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, unleſſe it may be in a wholſome way, to conveigh wholſome words. It is a baſe and poor thing, to come in publike places, to gape and pry into this womans dreſſe, and the other womans toy; this faſhion, and t'other faſhion; and more baſely ſordid, in the houſe of God: and it is as baſe (in the kinde of it) for a man to come to Gods houſe, where he comes to ſeek food for his ſoul, and to hear the oracles of God, that God ſhould not be able to pleaſe him, unleſſe he ſpeak tinkling and tickling words, to fancie and humour him. Is it meet for God? or doth it become the majeſty of God, to ſpeak in ſuch a language as is not befitting him? Majeſticall language, noble language, ſublime language, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per language of GOD, to conveigh divine things. It may ſuit well with a Courtier, to affect ſome ſcrapings of language, but not with a King; for (as they uſe to obſerve) there is a difference between a pedantick ſtile, and a majeſtick ſtile: a boy that hath but his Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:231:27"/>
learning, he may in his orations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and it may be more tollerable for him, to affect pen and Inkhorn language, and (as they term it) to affect a flouriſhing ſound of words: but for a Prince, it is beſides his decorum (I ſay) for a Prince on his Throne of Majeſty, to ſpeak curiouſly, it becomes not the majeſty of the place; and much leſſe doth it become the majeſty of Gods ordinances, that there ſhould be any thing ſo curiouſly in the dreſſe of words, as to draw mens eyes and ears ſo, that they do not minde the things, but the words, and are carried away with petty phraſes: but I muſt not be large.</p>
               <p>There is another thing: <hi>words, and ſound and wholſome words,</hi> of truth and profitableneſſe; and wholſome, for the manner of delivery, in a grave and ſober manner, ſuch as becomes the oracles of God.</p>
               <p>3. But what is that ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">A form of ſound words.</note> that ſame <hi>form of ſound words?</hi> this one thing that the Apoſtle intimates. I ſhall afterward, when I come to the Application, expreſſe more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of it; but for the preſent I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all in theſe two things, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are enough.</p>
               <p>A form of ſound and wholſome words:<note place="margin">The matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> I conceive the Apoſtle means, <hi>the matter intirely collected</hi>; a collection of the principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the principles of Divinity; a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and intire collection, and drawing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:231:28"/>
and imbodying (as it were) of the neceſſary principles of Religion; which every Miniſter ſhould have a care to conveigh to the people, and every people, care to treaſure up. In the matter, I ſay, an intire and ſufficient collection; I know there be many degrees of it, but I ſhall touch that afterward; for the preſent, I expreſſe it onely in the generall, a ſufficient intire collection of the main truths, and principles of Religion, to take care to conveigh them very ſolicitouſly to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people.</p>
               <p>2. But then again (though this be the main in my apprehenſion) that the Apoſtle here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, yet I will not exclude another thing too, which ſeems to be included: <hi>viz. Method aptly digeſted.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Method aptly digeſted.</note> Some care muſt be of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as well as of the matter: that there might be a ſufficient collection of all funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall principles, &amp; that it might be <hi>digeſted</hi> (as well as <hi>collected</hi>) in ſome uſefull method: the word it ſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the genuine ſignification of it ſeems to aim at this, for it is no more but a generall delineation, or draught; and the truth is, it is impoſſible that where there is a multitude, but that multitude muſt be regulated by ſome order; if multitudes of principles be delivered without an order, it is without its beauty, and it will be a great prejudice and hindrance, both to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and attention of them; and to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:231:28"/>
memory, and retention of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſuppoſe this is here likewiſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; the words ſeem to import it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſay not that the Apoſtle fully intends this, becauſe it is but accidentall; yet I do not exclude it, but think that a fit method and order, for conveighance, is ſomwhat neceſſary.</p>
               <p>So that now we have in generall, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Apoſtles precept, which is, that there ſhould be a care had by <hi>Timothy,</hi> (and by ſuch as are as <hi>Timothy</hi>) to conveigh words, that is, divine truths, ſuch as may be ſound, ſound for the matter, ſound for the manner of conveighance of them; to conveigh them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely collected, (in a body, as it were) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in ſome artificiall and ſet order: and this is that of which we ſay, it is a matter of great concernment. Time hath prevented me, and therefore I ſhall but mention ſome things in a word.</p>
               <p>2. Here is a more <hi>ſpeciall circumſcription of this object</hi> (beſides this generall) in two things which I will but mention,<note place="margin">The ſpeciall circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> by way of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; as,</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſumme of them is Chriſt.</note>1. The <hi>ſum of all, is Chriſt: faith and love in Chriſt,</hi> is here ſhewed, that Chriſt is the very kernell of all; and in truth, all fundamentals of Religion, (Religion it ſelf being nothing elſe,<note place="margin">The parts are, faith and love.</note> but to bring us to God in Chriſt, and to reduce us home to our happineſſe that way) the whole work and foundation is nothing, but to bring us to God in Chriſt; a cleer and full conveighance of this, is all that is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally neceſſary.</p>

               <p>Many Expoſitors do apprehend, that this is the principall meaning of theſe words; not to import the manner, how we ſhould keep, but to import a circumſcription, wherein thoſe truths chiefly conſiſt; and that they conſiſt of theſe two, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> faith, in apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truths of God, and adhering to them; and love, in practiſing of theſe duties that do depend upon that.</p>

               <p>2. But then in the ſecond place there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing,<note place="margin">Keepe them.</note> and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>keepe them</hi>; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, which is the ſecond act.</p>
               <p>I ſhall expreſſe what is meant by that very briefly: There may ſeeme to bee intimated three particular duties in that, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the keeping and preſerving of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:231:31"/>
truthes: for though a man have them ſetled in him, in his underſtanding, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and affection, yet there is ſomething more required for the keeping and preſerving of them; and which addes ſomething to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which in theſe three things as I conceive (as I ſaid) may be comprehended.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, <hi>patronize and owne them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Patronize the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with</note> and <hi>defend theſe</hi> divine truths againſt all corruptions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all alterations, and all prevarications, which might pervert that forme of ſound and wholſome words: which muſt be done,</p>
               <p>1. With our <hi>beſt abilities and ſtudies couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi>; we muſt ſet our wits upon the tenters,<note place="margin">Beſt abilities couragiouſly,</note> raiſe them to the uttermoſt pitch, to maintaine, and uphold, and defend, and preſerve the ſound and wholſome words that are delivered to us from God.</p>
               <p>2. We are to uſe not only our beſt abilities, for ſo every private man muſt doe; but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique perſons,<note place="margin">Authority cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly,</note> they muſt <hi>ingage their authority charily,</hi> by cenſure of law, by fencing and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them with bounds, ſetting an hedge (as it were) about them, that none may pluck them up, or deface them, or play legerdemaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: That is the firſt, they are to be patronized, and owned, and defended againſt all oppoſitions, whether violent and by <hi>inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>; or cunning, and by <hi>ſubtilty</hi>; by wit and authority, even by our beſt abilities, and beſt authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:231:32"/>2. We muſt keep them, not only by patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing and defending them, for profeſſion may reach ſo farre: but alſo Chriſtians muſt labour to keepe theſe divine truths <hi>by practiſing of them</hi> ſincerely,<note place="margin">Practiſe them ſincerely, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</note> fruitfully, and conſtantly: I ſay by putting them in practice: For although wee have them (as I ſaid before) locked up in the treaſury of our memory, though we underſtand them, and have ſome kind of affection to them, all this will not be a ſafe cuſtody of them; The beſt way to preſerve ſpirituall gifts, and ſo ſpirituall truths, is to preſerve them by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them: and they that doe not conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly practiſe thoſe truths they know, are in the ready way to loſe the truths themſelves. It will not long hold out, that a man ſhould retaine his integrity of judgement, if he admit of any violation of thoſe truths, in a contrary practice: Corrupt practice will corrupt a mans judgement: though his judgement were ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and ſound, though he had them there, yet if he did not practiſe them, the nature of the thing is ſuch, that his judgement will reflect upon his practice, and ſo be ready to defend what he practiſeth, out of pride, and Gods juſt judgement: for when a man doth not love the truth, and ſhew the love of it in his practice, God giveth him up to errours, and ſo to loſe that truth, which otherwiſe they formerly maintained, and would otherwiſe have happily held and kept faſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:231:32"/>3. So farre as this injunction reacheth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſuch as he, and ſo farre as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes any other degree too, but eſpecially them; there is another thing too, another duty comprehended under this keeping: and that is to <hi>propagate them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Propagate them ſeriouſly, by planting, watering.</note> ſtudiouſly by planting and watering; I ſay propagate this truth: For as it is with corne, the beſt preſerving of it is to caſt it forth: You cannot preſerve it long, lay it where you will, it cannot be long preſerved in the fields to ſtand there; when you bring it home and houſe it, and put it up in the garner, it will not laſt for ever there; nay if you put it into your bellies, it will doe ſome ſervice for the preſent, but not alwaies be preſerved there: but if you take theſe graines, and caſt ſome of them as ſeed into the earth, then you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it alway by propagation. God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this in nature, that there is no creature in the world that of it ſelfe is perpetuall; but God hath given it an exiſtence and being, and not only ſo, but a way of propagating to every thing, and to mankind as well as to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to increaſe and to bring forth: the which though the particular bee Gods gift, yet the thing is propagated into forme (though not the thing it ſelfe) by the creature inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally: In this caſe there is ſome ſimilitude; the beſt way, the moſt ſafe way, yea the moſt gratefull and acceptable way to preſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths, is by an endeavour, ſtudiouſly and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:231:33"/>
carefully to propagate it, that I doe not hide my talent in a napkin, that I doe not bury any divine truths: <hi>aurum celare &amp; veritatem,</hi> are both alike: we muſt not conceale any truth, but manifeſt it, and propagate it to others, and ſo, as that though my ſelfe ſhould miſcarry, yet the truth of God might be preſerved.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the <hi>object</hi> which is ſpecified here, and the <hi>act</hi> of the duty: there remaines now,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Manner, as</note>3. The third thing is the <hi>manner</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty how it muſt be done: And in a word, we ſhould not ſleightly doe it, or careleſly, but with all diligence and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and watchfulneſſe, labour to get and to keepe divine truths: there is ſo much intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſecond ſtile that is given to thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths, they are called in the 13. verſe <hi>a forme of ſound,</hi> or wholſome <hi>words</hi>; and in the 14 verſe, <hi>that good thing,</hi> or that rich thing; in the original it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Now there be two things required to make us choice and chary of getting and keeping divine truths, and both may be taken out of the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A ſacred De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</note>1.

Out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> beſides this place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is punctually and fully expreſſed,<note place="margin">By Scripture,</note> and no wonder, becauſe the injunction belongs in a more eſpecial manner unto Miniſters, and there being not in many places this charge commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and particularly directed to them, but in this Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein it is principally ſet downe: but yet it is divers times repeated in Scripture.

               <p>1. The Apoſtles recommend this to us by <hi>their owne example.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Examples,</note> I will give but one generall inſtance in that kinde, and one particular.</p>
               <p>The generall inſtance of the duty is this: you ſhall finde that almoſt every Epiſtle of <hi>Paul,</hi> and in ſome proportion it is obſervable in all the reſt of the Epiſtles, I ſay almoſt in every Epiſtle there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. there is a delineating, a drawing of a <hi>platforme of wholſome words,</hi> according to the ſubſtance that is here mentioned; and according to this object <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> (For all matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are matters of faith, or matters of love, in the practice and exerciſe of faith) and this is commended to us in all the Epiſtles: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part and the greater part of all the Epiſtles is to deliver matters of faith, to rectifie mens judgements, and ſeaſon them rightly with the knowledge of divine truths neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the latter part of the Epiſtles, is, to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:231:35"/>
deſcend to practicall duties, to the fruits of faith in the matters of love, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of all Chriſtian duty: And amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that firſt Epiſtle of all is to this purpoſe; which was not placed firſt for order of time, becauſe firſt written, nor ſo much for the order of dignity, becauſe the Romanes were the principall people in the world, it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I ſay) placed firſt of all the Epiſtles; but becauſe it containes this more fully, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth a form of ſound and wholſome words; there, doctrines of faith, and duties of life, that iſſue and flow from faith, as fruits of it, are more cleerly diſtinguiſhed, and more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed than in any other, although it is in ſome ſort in all. Now beſides this generall inſtance, I ſhall give but one particular inſtance, and that is in Hebr. 6.1. <hi>Therefore leaving the doctrine of the beginning</hi> (or principles of the doctrine) <hi>of Chriſt, let us be led forward to perfection, not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe the foundation of repentance unto dead workes, and of faith towards God.</hi> There is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both what the principles are, and what that ſame forme of ſound or wholſome words is; the <hi>doctrine of Baptiſme,</hi> as in the next verſe, <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, reſurrection from the dead</hi>; There are ſome few heads repeated, which are as milke for babes, the forme of ſound words, which are (at leaſt) for beginners, in the firſt beginnings and rudiments of Chriſtianity, and thoſe that are the firſt points in religion: The
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:231:36"/>
Apoſtle gives for babes a form of catechiſing, a forme of ſound and wholſome words: And there is intimated in that place, that as there is a ſhorter and briefer forme of ſound and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words, for a manuduction or entrance to beginners; ſo there muſt bee a larger, fuller forme, and more compleat, that did extend farther, and comprehend more in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Religion, and the things that belong to it, for thoſe that are come to more perfection and ripeneſſe of yeares.</p>
               <p>2. But beſides theſe examples, there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>teſtimonies</hi> which ſeeme to ayme at the ſame thing;<note place="margin">Teſtimonies.</note> I will mention two or three.</p>
               <p>In Rom. 12.6. the Apoſtle there begins to direct every one for the diſcharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in their ſeverall places in the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right manner; and among the reſt the rule that is given for thoſe that are Miniſters, called there (in a generall ſenſe of the word) <hi>Prophets,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Let him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth, propheſie according to the analogy of faith:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: I know there may bee ſome diſputes what may be the true and exact meaning of the analogy of faith: For preſent I take that which is not contemptible, nor from a contemptible author, viz. <hi>Calvins</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which is, that by faith is meant there, <hi>the prime and fundamentall axioms of faith</hi>; the fundamentall truths of Religion, and all doctrines that are delivered in the Church
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:231:36"/>
muſt hold analogy, hold proportion with thoſe prime and fundamentall truths, which are the forme of ſound and wholſome words, by which al other muſt be regulated and ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they may hold analogy and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that. And in this ſame Epiſtle, the next Chap. 2.15. he ſaith, <hi>Study to approve thy ſelfe to God, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth:</hi> now this ſeems rather directly to ayme at, or at leaſt directly to ſuppoſe that there ſhould bee a forme of ſound, or wholſome words: in the delivery of which a man ſhould approve himſelfe ſo, as that he needs not to be aſhamed, and according to the analogy of which, he ſhould divide the word of God aright, holding proportion with it: though I confeſſe there may be another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation (though it ſeeme not ſo ſutable to that place) as, to be able to ſpeake a word properly to every one as it may concerne him, to the weake to ſtrengthen them, to the ſtrong to build them up farther and farther; to the tempted to arme them: ſo ſome would have the meaning of it to be: but this ſeemes not to me to be the right, for, <hi>the dividing of the word of truth aright,</hi> ſeemes rather to intimate a diſpenſing of it, in ſuch truths and ſoundnes as may agree with the forme of ſound, and wholſome words. And in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. the Apoſtle there requires, not only of Miniſters, that they ſhould have a forme of ſound and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:231:37"/>
wholſome words, and that they ſhould be able to deliver themſelves in that faſhion; but hee ſeemeth to require there ſo much of people, of Chriſtians, by that precept that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them there, that they might be able, or <hi>ready to give</hi> an account, or <hi>reaſon of their hope that is in them:</hi> that is, to be able to apologize for it, and to ſtand up in the defence and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of it: Now if a man be not well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a forme of ſound and wholſome words, if hee underſtand them not, remember them not, nor be verſed in them, he will never bee able to give a reaſon, an account of his faith and hope; much leſſe will he be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend it, againſt the hereticall and ſuperſtitious cavils and objections that will be raiſed againſt it, which every Chriſtian is bound in ſome degree to ayme to get an ability of: and indeed it will be the foundation of his ſtedfaſt ſtanding, for no man can be ſtedfaſt in that which he knowes not, nor feeles the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of. Therefore we ſhould bee verſed in the grounds of Religion, in a forme of ſound and wholſome words, that containes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of faith, and that we may be able to know what is our duty. And there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the ſame purpoſe in the Rom. 6.17. <hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart the forme of doctrine, which was delivered to you.</hi> But I ſhall omit that for the preſent, and I ſhall give the ground of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:231:37"/>2. The ground and reaſon of it, that which makes this appear to be a truth, and a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable truth, that we ſhould all labour to get,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> and hold faſt a form of ſound and wholſome words, even the ſum of religion; is becauſe</p>
               <p>1. There is a <hi>great neceſsity of it</hi>;<note place="margin">Neceſſity.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. Not only in regard of the Commiſſion and <hi>injunction</hi> that lieth upon us, &amp; the truſt that God hath committed to us (as I did intimate before) we are but <hi>depoſitors,</hi> and God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this to our care and charge; charged us with it, and expects our faithfull diſcharge in it: not only becauſe of this I ſay, but</p>
               <p>2. In regard of the manifold <hi>oppoſitions,</hi> and danger of corruptions of divine truths, by the ſubtilty of Sathan and his inſtruments, and their malice: If Chriſtians and the Church of God did not throughly acquaint themſelves with it, and bottome themſelves on it; they could never be able to juſtifie the wayes of God; and the truth of God, nor to vindicat that, from the many ſubtill windings, which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will uſe to corrupt and pervert the truth. I purpoſe not largely to expatiat, but only to give a hint of things, and therefore I ſhall but adde a ſecond:<note place="margin">Utility.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>It is of great utility,</hi> as there is a great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it, if we would not have the truth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, nor errors to be ſpread over, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrowne in the face of the Church: So there is an infinite benefit, and advantage, and utility
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:231:38"/>
that redounds to the Church of God by this courſe of having (both in general &amp; in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar by every Chriſtian) of a form of ſound and wholſome words: there is, I ſay, an infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and utility (beſides the neceſſity of it) that would redound to the Church of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and to every Chriſtian in particular by this; Let me name but ſome few, and but name them:</p>

               <p>And yee ſhall finde this by experience, I meane thoſe that are verſed in thoſe things, (I dare be bold to ſay it) if they will but conſider it, that the greateſt part of the controverſies that are among the godly and the learned, are not ſo much reall controverſies, where there is a keeping cloſe to a forme of ſound and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words (for that will keepe off thoſe) but they are verball controverſies: Now I ſay thoſe controverſies would be prevented, if a forme of ſound and wholſome words were had in the Church carefully, and ſo as that it might be publiquely and generally knowne; for then men know one anothers language, in what ſenſe they ſpeake, and how they uſe words: for the greateſt differences that are amongſt us, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that men underſtand not one another, the language of Babel is ſtill retained among us, ſo as we underſtand not one another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we differ: as about juſtification by faith, one takes it in one ſenſe and another in another ſenſe, and ſo it makes them differ and jangle one againſt another, when indeed it is but the difference of words: ſo that I ſay, who ever
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:231:39"/>
will take a view of the many controverſies that are, he ſhall finde, that the greateſt part by far are but miſtakes of words; which a forme of ſound and wholſome words eſtabliſhed and ſetled in the Church, and publiquely knowne, would exceedingly prevent: for that would determine and limit the uſe of words in which they are to be taken, and men ſhould be bound to uſe them that way (eſpecially when they ſpeake controverſially and exactly) and not in another way, which alone breeds diſſentions and controverſies.</p>
               <p>3. This would not onely be a band and a barre (as I have already ſhewed) but a <hi>key:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A key of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</note> It would be a very excellent <hi>key of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to increaſe and facilitate a mans apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and underſtanding of all particular truths. If a man were but well acquainted with a form of ſound and wholſome words for the maine truths, it would lead him (as it were) by the hand to the underſtanding of other truths more remote from the foundation; he might grow and arrive to the knowledge of them, being led (as it were) by a divine light, from that light hee hath by a forme of ſound and wholſome words, leading to the knowledge of things which are more obſcure and remote, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and wonderfully helping the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if there were nothing elſe: For it is in this caſe with truths as it is with coales: coales when they lye ſingle, they doe not glow or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:231:40"/>
ſhine and heat men; but when they lye toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the very lying together doth increaſe the life and light of every one of them: and ſo the body of ſound and wholeſome words, he that underſtandeth them, that very underſtanding and comprehending of them all together, it giveth light to other truths; whereas if men would take them ſingle, without that borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light it receives from another, they would be more obſcure. There is nothing doth more facilitate the underſtanding, than to have a forme; the very comprehending and having of them in a mans eye and memory, it will help him, and guide him to underſtand every other particular truth, hee having all of them in one forme, which would not be ſo cleare of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, as they are all together; and for all others that are deducible from them, but farther remote, it will facilitate a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them.</p>

               <p>2. Becauſe of the <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>ſympathy</hi> that one truth hath with another. It doth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully help the memory, if a man doth but catch any one thing for the whole, for by that hee hath a hold-faſt to catch alſo any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that he hath loſt; if his memory catch one particular, that will helpe to bring all the reſt. As for inſtance, if a man have a chaine of many linkes, though he let goe many of them, yet if he hold faſt any one of them, that will draw all the reſt up againe: ſo if a man hath gotten a form of divine truths linked together, aptly digeſted, if his memory let ſlip one link, and another linke, yet if he doe remember but any one particular, that one linke will helpe to draw in all the reſt againe.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:231:41"/>1. A man ſhall exceedingly much more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by others</hi> then he doth.<note place="margin">Profit by others.</note> Suppoſe a Chriſtian come to heare the word of God, heare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, this Miniſter or the other Miniſter, let us put the difference thus; there comes one that is a meere ſtranger to theſe truths, all that is ſpoken will be novelty to him: but there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other comes, who hath the grounds of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laid in him, that hath in his minde and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a forme of ſound and wholſome words; this man will be able to profit more by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, than the other that comes in a ſtranger upon a ſudden to it, having no former grounds: As before a dye that is perfect and durable there muſt be ſome preparative that makes the ground, (if you would have it a good colour) if you put your cloth to receive it at firſt, the firſt tincture (though it be that which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly give the dye) will not doe it, if that it be not prepared before: ſo it is in this caſe, if a man have not ſome forme of ſound and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words, if a man have not laid ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, all things will be like an Iland in the ſea, and he cannot come neer it to comprehend it: But if he have laid a ground-work before, he can reduce what he heares to that, and ſo by the helpe of it, ſtanding upon his forme as on his bottome, hee can come to reach and comprehend all other particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to others</note>2. It helpes a man (to mention no more) as to profit by others, ſo <hi>to be profitable to others:</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:231:41"/>
and this is a thing which concernes not onely Miniſters, whoſe office it is to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others; but it alſo concernes every one in their place, thou ſhalt <hi>teach thy children, and thy family,</hi> Deut. 11.19. There is ſome teaching and ſome conveyance which every Chriſtian is bound unto in their place. Now how ſhall any man teach, that hath not learned? He that never was in a ſhop, cannot ſet up at firſt upon the ſcore, but hee muſt have ſomething of his owne: and it is impoſſible for him to teach another well, that hath not himſelfe ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the platforme of ſound and wholſome words, that hath not taken ſome paines, and made ſome progreſſe in that, it will be impoſſible to teach, I ſay (at leaſt) judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or profitably to convey any thing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But this now if a man had, it would be a continuall treaſury, a ſtore-houſe to furniſh a man on all occaſions, to bee communicable profitably to others, and withall not make any diminution at all of his owne ſtore, but rather adde to and increaſe it.</p>
               <p>To come now to the <hi>Application.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There be two things that I intend to doe in the application of this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt to draw thoſe <hi>inferences</hi> out of it (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ordinary courſe of application) which naturally ariſe from the conſideration of the point: and that being done,</p>

For the <hi>inſtitution of children,</hi> babes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners in Chriſt, the firſt Catechiſme of the loweſt forme; which ſhould be ſuch as ſhould comprehend onely the plaine, and neceſſary, and ſaving truths, and goe no further, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare all medling with the knowledge of other truths. It is enough for them not to be over burthened; it is better if they ſucke but the milke that will nouriſh them to eternall life, they being capable but of milke, and being but babes in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

muſt have a more full forme, and patterne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending not only theſe things that are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> neceſſary to ſalvation, but ſuch as have a kinde of connexion with thoſe that are <hi>neceſsary</hi>; ſuch as are neere of kinne to them: and ſo to enlarge the bounds and pale of the Catechiſme, according as their capacities are enlarged.</p>
               <p>3.

               <p>2. And in the ſecond place (to paſſe from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:231:46"/>
our humble exhortation to the Church) <hi>for Miniſters,</hi> this might bee an exhortation to them,<note place="margin">Miniſters to</note> that as they ſhould take care of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Divinity, ſo they ſhould take care of this, to <hi>ground themſelves</hi> in, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>communicate to others, a forme of ſound and wholeſome Words</hi>: not words only, but whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words, and a form of wholeſome words, to load the people through the maine things, not one, but all: to deliver the whole truth of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, though in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a different ſence. Time hath prevented me: in a word therefore, there be three wayes of miniſteriall exerciſe, (as I humbly conceive) which might be moſt advantagious and uſefull if they were uſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Expound.</note>1. The firſt thing that I would have done, which might be exceedingly uſefull (though not ſo well regarded) is, a courſe of the meere and bare <hi>Expoſition of Scripture</hi>; to goe through a whole Chapter, or ſome part of it, and ſo to explicate it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the full ſumme: It would bee wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profitable and neceſſary, to acquaint the people with the whole Chapter, and the maine ſcope and principall things that are in it, and goe no further, not to deſcend into every particular in it, onely by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to make the people acquainted with the Scripture. This indeed is the loweſt degree.</p>
               <p>2. And then there is another thing which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:231:46"/>
I would have them to doe, to take another courſe like that of ours, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Expectation. Dogmaticall,</note> 
                  <hi>preaching upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall texts,</hi> and ſeverall points, but yet ſo as theſe ſeverall points might hold connexion, to be made up in a body of Divinity, for the comprehenſion of all things neceſſary to be knowne (which we now intend) and that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way.</p>
               <p>3. But then there comes in a third thing,<note place="margin">Hiſtoricall truths.</note> as the firſt ſhould comprehend the explanation of the Scriptures; and the ſecond ſhould be for all the doctrinals; ſo if there were a third thing added, which is a courſe to comprehend all the <hi>exemplary hiſtoricall parts of the Scripture,</hi> part by part, treating in them not of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of the Text, but of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable examples in them: As, how God hath governed and preſerved by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Church in all ages from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world till the flood, and from that till the promulgation of the Law; and from that till the building of the Temple; and ſo till the Nativity of Chriſt: and ſo carrying all along, this would be an admirable thing to ſtrengthen religion, by ſeeing how God in all ages hath managed his Church; how he hath gone along with it, and ſupported his truth, and ſhewed his goodnes and mercy in a ſweet and gracious way: and ſo in all the Scripture to marke out all the ſingular paſſages and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods providence. Theſe would be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:231:47"/>
beſt altogether, although every one of them be good in particular.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>To all private Christians:</hi> this may force them to their duty; the exhortation that I ſhould preſſe on them, ſhould bee in a word, that,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note>1. They would not thinke this to be a thing out of their ſpheare and walke, and therefore that they would labour, and aime not onely to have ſome ſcramblings and ſcrapings,<note place="margin">Force to duty.</note> ſome broken ends of knowledge; to harp upon this point, and that point; But to labour and ſtrive to come to the knowledg of a form of ſound and wholſome words, to the whole body and frame of Divinity (at leaſt) according to their capacities, every one according to their form: If he be a child in yeeres, and apprehenſion to have the loweſt kind, labour to come to the loweſt form: and ſo for yong men, and fathers to carry it along through all degrees: So that let no Chriſtian thinke this without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his duty, or unprofitable for him, for he ſhall gaine by it aboundance of benefit and profit: He may gaine all the benefit I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before; It will help his underſtanding, and his memory; and his performance of duty, make him receive more profit by others, and make him more profitable unto others, it will every way advantage him:</p>
               <p>

the learned; for beſides that ordinary bleſſing that God hath vouchſafed us in letting us have the Goſpel; he hath vouchſafed more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wayes of knowledg in our times, than in any other: As it is with trees, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſo laden with fruit, that they doe even bow downe to the ground againe, ſo as that a child may gather from them: God hath ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this age with knowledge, and ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouchſafed it, that it bowes downe, that it offers it ſelfe to us, and that ſo familiarly and facily, that none of ordinary capacity (it being in our owne language and tongue) but may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto it, even children: and withall the difficulty will be taken off, if we conſider, that it is not required in the higheſt degree, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree and capacity of every one; God doth not require the higheſt forme of thoſe that are of the loweſt; but onely the higheſt of the high, and the low of the low ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: And there is no Chriſtian, but in ſome form or other, at leaſt, is capable of it: It were worth the while therefore to ſet our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, to labour to attain the ſumme of divine truths, and to carry it as a rich treaſure about us; to make us exquiſite for every practiſe and diſcourſe.</p>

There remaines nothing now, but that which I promiſed to diſcharge; viz. to acquaint you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:231:48"/>
according to this rule, and my preſent ſcope, (it being my purpoſe to enter on a form of ſound and wholſome words, even to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole body of Divinity, at leaſt the ſubſtantiall and maine truths, that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be known and beleeved to ſalvation: but) before I enter into any particulars, which will be ſeverall and many, I will give you at firſt a proſpect of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a generall delineation of the whole compaſſe and courſe, which if God permit life, and liberty, I intend to go through: I was at a ſtay a long while with my ſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould do it or no, their ſeeming no beauty or profitableneſſe in a meer beholding of a bare Skeleton, a naked anatomy of the ſumme of Religion: But I conſider with my ſelfe that we ſpend many houres, houres after houres, week after week here in Gods houſe, and if we do ſpend this houre in this way, it will be <hi>opere pretium</hi> worth the while,<note place="margin">Premiſe.</note> as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for many reſpects which I will not now enter into but leave to the conſideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore as I promiſed to doe it,<note place="margin">Generalls</note> ſo I now intend it. I will only premiſe thoſe two things.</p>
               <p>1. I do not undertake,<note place="margin">Nothing.</note> nor you muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould preſume <hi>to deliver any thing that will be abſolutely perfect,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Perfect.</note> or that I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perfect;<note place="margin">For matter.</note> there being many done in this nature of this kind already; and the Church of God having aboundance of help and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:231:49"/>
this way; <hi>&amp; quot capita, tot ſententiae,</hi> ſo many men, ſo many minds, and ſo many formes:</p>
               <p>There be ſome different rankes of men, their being ſome <hi>leading men,</hi> and ſome <hi>followers</hi>: As in a flock there is a Ramme, or a Weather, that is as it were a leader among the reſt: ſome are leading, and ſome are following men; and there is ſcarce any man that hath any parts, (though not to be a leader, yet not to be a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower: a meer follower) but will digeſt his owne forme, and caſt it in his owne mould, and go his owne way: but I conceive there is no offence in regard of the thing, for any or every one to contribute what he hath in him to the publike good; and uſe his owne courſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his proportion, though there may be difference in the forms, and particulars, where there is a conſentaneous agreement in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and maine: this I premiſe in generall.</p>
               <p>2. But more particularly conſerning that forme I intend now to ſpeak of,<note place="margin">Or Method.</note> I ſhall deſire to acquaint you thus much.</p>
               <p>1. It is a frame that I digeſted many years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. The truth is, when I firſt entred on the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God in the courſe of the Miniſtery, it was one of the firſt things that I did bethink my ſelf on, ſuch a frame: and had digeſted and ordered for ſubſtance according to that, which I intend now to preſent, I thought to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken it from time to time, but ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:231:49"/>
of Gods Providence hindered me. And my intention was then, and is now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it,<note place="margin">But in away. Prudentially.</note> not in a way of <hi>artificiall method</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; but rather in a <hi>prudentiall way,</hi> ſuch as may be more beneficiall for uſe, though not ſo accurate for art: For I conſider with my ſelfe, that the greateſt part of men whom I have to deale withall in the tractation of it, are vulgar people, which are not ſuch as are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a moſt accurate form: nor cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of it, neither wil it ſuit with them: For this is the difference between an <hi>artifitiall method,</hi> and a <hi>prudentiall method</hi>; between a method of art, and a method of prudence, as the Maſters of Logick ſpeak in this caſe.</p>
               <p>An <hi>artificiall method</hi> propounds all <hi>homogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,</hi> nothing but that which is directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that art, or Doctrine that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and that intrinſecally and ſubſtantially to make it up: it propounds nothing but ſuch; admits of no <hi>hetterogenialls,</hi> nothing but that which is within the compaſſe of that doctrine: it cuts of all others, and withall keeps a down right order, a down right method, handling the moſt generall things firſt, and the moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things after, by a ſtraight line, cutting (as it were) by a threed. Now this I ſee might not altogether be ſo profitable, and ſo uſefull (at leaſt) for ordinary people, who are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, not being able to judge of hetteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialls and homogenialls, neither knowing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:231:50"/>
indeed what is form, or what not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I chooſe rather to goe in a <hi>prudentiall way:</hi> for I will not decline many hetterogenialls, though I will not mention many, (becauſe for mine owne part I do not think, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſo properly to Divinity or Theology in a rigged conſideration) but ſuch as are uſefull for Chriſtians to know (though they bee not ſo artificiall) and onely thoſe, though I ſay they make not ſo much for method and art, for I have not ſuch a deſire to keep ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to a perfect method; all that I ſhall aime at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, to propound things both for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them, in the particulars contained under them; and for the method of the things, in ſuch a uſefull way as Chriſtian prudence ſhall acknowledge to be ſo, and ſuch as may be profitable for the Church of God.</p>
               <p>2. I ſhall adde but another thing, which I deſire to give an account of; I ſhall propound it in ſuch a way, as may be accommodable to all thoſe ſeverall rankes, or formes, whether of <hi>teachers,</hi> or <hi>learners</hi>: that I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo that it may be either <hi>briefly contracted</hi> into a narrow compaſſe for children and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, who have but narrow capacities: or a little <hi>larger</hi> for young men: or <hi>more fully</hi> and <hi>compleatly</hi> for Fathers: as occaſion ſhall ſerve: I ſhall goe in a middle methodicall way; in ſuch a way, as may beſt agree to any of theſe formes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:231:50"/>3. Laſtly, this is all I will ſay concerning it, and all that I will premiſe concerning it, (though I can ſay no great matter) to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the form that I ſhall propound; and have no intention nor thought to preſſe it on any man, but let every man doe according to the nature of their apprehenſion in the degree of their education wherein they have been nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and to which they have beene brought up already. I will only give this generall rule,<note place="margin">Any forme is Tolerable, though Indifferent.</note> 
                  <hi>any forme is better than no forme:</hi> any tolerable forme, though indifferent, or defective in ſome materials, and in a methodicall way, yet if it keepe cloſe to any tolerable forme, it is better than no forme, and it may ſerve him in many things uſefully, though not altogether ſo well as if it were better:<note place="margin">this is Different.</note> This I will ſay concerning my owne in humility, that whoſoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it with judgement, ſhall finde thus much,<note place="margin">Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note> that it is more comprehenſive (as far as I know) than ever any yet that hath beene preſented; though I have ſeene and peruſed a great many, and that of the beſt note and worth that as yet the Church of God hath extent: and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if they doe view, and conſider, and take meaſure of the compaſſe of it, will finde that it containes more than any. I will inſtance only in one obſervation that may give ſome light to this: I have alwayes apprehended that it is a very good way (though it bee ſomewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective among the Proteſtant Writers, who
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:231:51"/>
have not comprehended divers of thoſe things of the Schoolmen that were great ſearchers in Divinity, however their faults and failings were, and however they were in the blindeſt and darkeſt times; and therefore I have nothing to ſay for the magnifying or juſtifying of them: yet I deſire to goe in a middle temper, which may not only comprehend thoſe things which ordinarily we know, but take in likewiſe thoſe things of the Schooles, (Scholaſticall things which are of uſe) which I ſay I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apprehended would be a very good way, and of very much uſe and purpoſe: Now you ſhall finde that all the doctrines belonging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpeculative Divinity, and to ſearching Divinity in the Schooles, or elſe to practiſe Divinity; I ſay you ſhall finde more of them as I conceive in this platform, that I ſhall now ſuggeſt, than in any that I yet ſaw: to which premiſing only one thing more, I ſhall come. I premiſe therefore, and I hope that no man will expect or thinke that I preſume I ſhall proſecute it, but only I deſire to diſcharge my duty according to that meaſure of ſtrength and life that the Lord ſhall vouchſafe me: which makes me doe that I now intend, <hi>viz.</hi> to give you a briefe delineation of all. But I deſire you not to expect that this can bee done with any mixture of pleaſure,<note place="margin">Not pleaſant,</note> or that it will be over eaſie or over facile to apprehend; only I ſhall now run briefly thorow the whole: as if a man
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:231:51"/>
ſhould preſent you with the Scelleton or body of a man, without either skin or fleſh, there is no beauty or pleaſantneſſe in ſuch a ſight, yet there are all the ſubſtantials whereof the body is made, there are the bones that are the very upholders of the fabricke of the body: or as it was in the caſe of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion, when he was carried into a field, where there was nothing but dry bones, there was no beauty in that ſight: but the beauty was afterward, when thoſe bones began to ſtir and move, and came every one to their place, and did cloſe up with the fleſh, and the ſpirit of life came on them, then it was a beautifull ſight. So now here, in the meere naked demonſtration of the thing, you muſt not looke (neither indeed is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with that apprehenſion) that it ſhould be very delightfull, or that there ſhould be any thing in it to move that way: but rather meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the profit of it: becauſe it may be a good guide for the comprehending, and going on with through all. As if a man be in a journey, and hath his compaſſe with him, by which he may know where he is; it is but only for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and therefore I hope men will beare with that, diſpenſe with the other, viz. <hi>pleaſantneſſe:</hi> though it ſeeme but rough to propound meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naked bones, without any beauty or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now briefly to preſent the frame that I am to goe through. I told you that long agoe I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:231:52"/>
made the frame, and then I intended to make the frame ſo, to order it ſo, as to bring it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of fifty two heads, that is one for every <hi>Lords day</hi> in the yeare: or if a man would make briefer diſpatch of it, hee might take two or foure heads at a time, and ſo goe through the whole in leſſe time. I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it the ſame way.</p>
               <p>There be but two things by which I ſhall make the diviſion of the modell or frame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Frontiſpice.</note>1. There is firſt of all a <hi>frontiſpice,</hi> or <hi>porch:</hi> and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is the fabricke it ſelfe, the whole pile and edifice.</p>
               <p>There be foure things which I deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in the very porch and frontiſpice, in the entrance into all the matters of Religion, and things to be knowne; becauſe they are of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall importance and uſe, as being the very firſt and moſt ſenſible inquiries that will bee made in the entry into this profeſſion. The two former of them lay downe to us the <hi>marke that we ſhould aime at:</hi> The two latter, the <hi>line or rule by which we muſt levell at that marke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Happineſſe.</note>1. The firſt inquiry will be concerning <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,</hi> which is the very end and ſcope to which all that we are taught in the matters of Divinity, even all the whole ſcope of Divinity tends: that whereas there be ſeverall arts and vocations in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the maintenance of this temporall life; <hi>Divinity</hi> is that art which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:231:52"/>
directs us in the way to get and attaine eternall life, and to the true happineſſe of a man: all the lines of Divinity meet in that center, and nothing is taught but for that: and therefore this will be the firſt inquiry, <hi>wherein the true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of a man lyes:</hi> And to omit the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that will be in that, the reſolution and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of that inquiry will come to this, (which will draw in the ſecond) that</p>
               <p>2. However mens thoughts wander about their happineſſe, yet all the world cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it; neither the <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of any, nor the <hi>concurrence</hi> of all theſe worldly things, can make a man a happy man: the only happineſſe that is true and reall, is only in our conjunction with God: which is attainable only by our knowing, worſhipping, and ſerving of God according to the true religion; which is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of this firſt inquirie, and leads to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond generall thing in the porch</p>
               <p>And that is the <hi>true Religion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">True Religion.</note> the firſt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is of the true happineſſe, the ſecond is of the true religion. But now there be many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in the world, I will briefly name them.</p>
               <p>There is the <hi>heathen religion,</hi> which doth not acknowledge the true God, but worſhip a falſe god. There is the <hi>Iewiſh religion,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the true God, (and therefore dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the heathen) but doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him in Chriſt. There is the <hi>Mahumetane religion,</hi> which acknowledgeth the true God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:231:53"/>
and acknowledgeth Chriſt too, but doth not acknowledge Chriſt as the Meſſias and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but ſubordinate to their Mahumet, and therefore falſe in that. And laſtly, there is the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi>; and ſo the upſhot of all, is, there is no other religion true, but the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion which is profeſſed in the true Church of God:</p>
               <p>3. And that leads mee to the third thing in the inquiry. The firſt was, wherein lyeth true happineſſe; the next, what is the true religion which will lead to this happineſſe; and becauſe that is ſaid to be in the Church of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next inquiry will be, which is the <hi>true Church of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">True Church.</note> There be many pretenders to the true Church, there is a <hi>Greeke Church,</hi> a great and large Church, that profeſſeth the doctrine of Chriſt: there is the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Chriſt: there be many other by-ſlips of Chriſtians, as <hi>Anabaptiſts, Separatiſts,</hi> and all kindes of ſects and ſchiſmes, which all profeſſe Chriſt. But it is none of theſe, not the <hi>Greeke Church,</hi> nor the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> nor any other ſect; but there is a Church of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and this will bee the upſhot of the inquiry, that the Church of God which are either <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> (though different in ſome opinions, yet) both of them are within the compaſſe of that which is to bee acknowledged the true Church of God: and the iſſue of this inquiry
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:231:53"/>
will be, How wee may underſtand and come to deſcerne which is the true Church: and the anſwer is, by their adherence to the <hi>Scriptures:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Which is the fourth head in the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. After the inquiry of the true happineſſe, wherein it lyeth; of the true Religion that will lead us to that happineſſe; of the true Church wherein we ſhall finde that Religion: we muſt inquire of that which muſt be the rule of all, which is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Scriptures.</note> that ſhall be the fourth.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſuch generall, and ſuch ſenſible inquiries, that I did thinke good in a pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall way, as I ſaid, to place them in the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice. The two former ſhew the marke wee muſt ayme at, viz. the <hi>true happineſſe,</hi> and the <hi>true religion.</hi> The two latter ſhew the line by which we ſhould levell, viz. the <hi>Churches ſteps</hi> in ſome meaſure, but abſolutely the <hi>oracles of the Scripture,</hi> the Word of God, which muſt be the meaſure of all things which are to be done or knowne in the whole compaſſe of Divinity.</p>
               <p>2. To come now from the frontiſpice and porch, to the <hi>building it ſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Edifice.</note> to the fabricke of the whole body of Divinity, I ſhall only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it in the nature of a building, becauſe I have mentioned the metaphor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I vvill not keepe cloſe to it, becauſe I vvill not ſpend time to be curious in vvords.</p>
               <p>The building I ſhall preſent, conſiſts of <hi>two ſtories,</hi> and no more; and in either of thoſe two
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:231:54"/>
ſtories, <hi>two roomes.</hi> I vvill mention no more.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſtory briefly I ſhall comprehend all the things that are to be <hi>knowne and beleeved</hi> in the courſe of Divinity.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſtory all things that are to be <hi>done and practiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all things in Divinity are either matters of <hi>faith,</hi> or matters of <hi>life.</hi> This is the generall therefore of the two ſtories. Matters of faith being as it vvere the loweſt ſtory, and matters of life being the ſuperſtructure on it: and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe have two ſeverall roomes.</p>
               <p>

the nature of vvhich, and the truth of vvhich are to bee cleared in the application of theſe heads. Theſe are the principles and the roots.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:231:57"/>There be other degrees, by which God doth carry us to the <hi>perfection of grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">From grace to glory</note> as well as to the ſtate of grace: as,</p>
               <p>Partly in the <hi>continuation of the grace of God,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, the worke of <hi>ſanctification,</hi>

Now theſe doe <hi>continue the worke of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But then for the <hi>conſummation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſummate.</note> there are two more: God continually ſanctifies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually governes, and manages a man, by his regiment, and the rule of his providence over his ſervants in an excellent way all our life. But then I ſay there be two other degrees that give the conſummation; which make up the other foure heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>the reſurrection:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reſurrection.</note> and therein I ſhall take along the <hi>laſt judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudgement.</note> for there is ſome difference, but not ſo much but they might goe together.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the excellent ſtate of <hi>glorification</hi>;<note place="margin">Glorification.</note> that ſuperexcellent ſtate of glory: wherein I

               <p>Theſe are briefly the heads of thoſe things that are to be knowne and beleeved.</p>

               <p>And twelve in particular according to the ſeverall ſtates of man, and acts of God.</p>
               <p>Now then the other things that follow, are things to be <hi>done and practiſed in matters of life:</hi>

               <p>And ſecond, I will adde ſome <hi>helpes</hi> that are to be uſed for the performance of thoſe duties.</p>
               <p>And ſo I ſhall comprehend all the practicall part of Divinity, adjoyning helpe to performe duties; whereby I ſhall give a more large form (as I ſaid firſt) then as yet we have had, for ought I know.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In thoſe generall duties I will do thus; I may comprehend all duties under the name of <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vertues,</hi> for ſo it will bee more briefe; wherefore I will ſo doe.<note place="margin">Primary and predominant in duties to God and man.</note>

               <p>There be,</p>

                  <note place="margin">Parts,</note>1. Vertues in regard of the <hi>parts</hi> of a mans life, they muſt be brought to the true rule of vertue, in the government of a mans life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Heart, Affections, Words, Actions.</note>Firſt, vertues to rule the <hi>heart and affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, vertues regulating a mans <hi>words and actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee muſt ſeeke how to governe theſe in a way of duty and vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conditions, in reſpect of</note>But then againe for our ſeverall conditions; I ſhall name two more, which will compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all that I deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sex, Age,</note>Firſt, <hi>vertues to regulate every age and ſex:</hi> the particulars are, <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women, young</hi> and <hi>old,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſex and age.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eſtate, Condition.</note>Secondly, <hi>vertues for the ordering of every ſtate and condition; rich</hi> or <hi>poore, learned</hi> or <hi>unlearned:</hi> and in proportion to order us in every ſeverall ſtate and condition, in affliction and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the ſecond branch of the firſt of thoſe ſpecials that are recommended: two
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:231:59"/>
ſpeciall vertues required in reſpect of our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conditions, as there were two before in reſpect of our ſeverall parts.</p>
               <p>But now in regard of our <hi>ſeverall ſtates and relations,</hi> in which men are,<note place="margin">States and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</note> there be foure more.</p>
               <p>The firſt two of which are to order us in a more <hi>private way.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">More private,</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond two to regulate us in a more <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As wee are <hi>ſingle perſons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In a ſingle and ſolitary life. Vertuess Ethicall,</note> living in a ſolitary life, there are <hi>morall ethicall vertues,</hi> which muſt order our converſation ſuitable to the rule of dutie.</p>
               <p>And then as we are <hi>publique perſons</hi> in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; theſe are <hi>oeconomicall vertues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">More publique in a family. Oeconomicall.</note> to order fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the particular relations thereof, <hi>husband, wife, parents, children, maſters, ſervants, gueſts,</hi> and <hi>hoaſts:</hi> There be <hi>ethicall vertues,</hi> and <hi>oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall vertues,</hi> for the ordering of a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way.</p>
               <p>And when we come more publique,<note place="margin">In a greater community,</note> to bee parts of a greater community, there muſt bee vertues for that.</p>
               <p>Now there may bee a double community which we may live in, and in which we ſhould have vertues to carry our ſelves as we ought to doe in ſuch places.</p>
               <p>There is a community <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſticall,</note> a <hi>Church</hi> ſociety and body.</p>
               <p>And there is a community <hi>Politicall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Politicall.</note> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:231:60"/>
and there are ſuitable vertues required, to carry our ſelves as members of theſe bodies either Eccleſiaſticall or Politicall.</p>
               <p>There remaines now only the ſecond branch of things to be done and practiſed,<note place="margin">Helps to be uſed in</note> viz. the <hi>helpes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have gone through the duties generall and particular: I ſhall in a word recommend in the laſt place thoſe things that I comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the name of helps to the performance of duty.</p>
               <p>And they are either,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Univerſall converſation.</note>
                  <hi>More generall</hi> and publique: or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>More particular</hi> and private.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Publique meanes,</note>The more publique helpes are the <hi>due and conſcientious uſe of the ordinances of God</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Hearing the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Receiving the Sacrament. Times,</note>Firſt, <hi>hearing of the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecond, <hi>receiving of the ſacrament:</hi> And the due <hi>obſervation of times inſtituted</hi> by God, and <hi>conſtituted</hi> by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sabbath,</note>Firſt, the obſervation of <hi>the Lords day,</hi> in its continuall courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Faſting,</note>Secondly, of <hi>Faſts</hi> in a Chriſtian way.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the more publique helpes; and yet there may be ſome relation to privateneſſe in theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Private,</note>But now more privately as a mans <hi>face is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God:</hi> or,</p>
               <p>As a mans <hi>face is towards the world</hi>; there are helpes for thoſe duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:231:60"/>As we muſt labour to converſe with God, or as we muſt converſe with men;<note place="margin">towards God.</note> which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we turne our faces, there may be, and are helps for the ordering of our life in both. Now the helpe in private,<note place="margin">Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</note> in regard of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, are,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reading, Meditation.</note> diligent <hi>reading and meditation</hi> upon the Word of God, and divine truths.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another part of our communion with God,<note place="margin">Prayer,</note> is the continuall exerciſe of <hi>prayer and thankſgiving.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thankſgiving.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then as wee ſtand in relation towards the world, and are converſant in the world,<note place="margin">Towards man,</note> there be two other helpes.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Active,</note> the conſcientious uſe and improvement of the <hi>communion of Saints.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Communion of Saints.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Second, our <hi>fidelity</hi> and conſcientious cariage in our <hi>particular vocations</hi>;<note place="margin">Particular vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</note> where there will be many other things.</p>
               <p>But in all thoſe the maine will be, how all theſe may be done, that they may be moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in the advancing of a moſt chriſtian courſe in the uſe of the Word and Sacrament, and Sabbaths, and faſtings, and reading, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and prayer, and thankſgiving, and the communion of Saints, and the conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a mans vocation: I ſay, how wee may doe all theſe, ſo as they may be moſt uſefull to further us in the way of duty.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the more generall helps.</p>
               <p>There are ſome more particular, according
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:231:61"/>
to the particular caſes of men: I will propound but foure maine caſes,<note place="margin">Particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</note> to which I will reduce all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome things to helpe a man in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe into the way of Religion.</hi> I am faine to make a word or two (for memories ſake.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the <hi>aggreſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the <hi>congreſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the <hi>progreſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſhall ſee more plainly what I meane by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In the ingreſſe,</note>There be helpes to bring a man that is not yet in a way of godlineſſe, to come into it. Wherein the principall thing will be, <hi>the due examination of what is the right way,</hi> and <hi>a mans owne eſtate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Examination, Reſolution.</note> whether he be in that way or no: and that being made cleare, we muſt conſider the <hi>helps</hi> that will put a man on to <hi>reſolve</hi> on the entry into that way, and to uſe the helpes that may ſet him upon it to enter it: which is the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe</hi> or entrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Aggreſſe.</note>Secondly, in the <hi>aggreſſe,</hi> or <hi>ſetting upon</hi> a Chriſtian courſe, there will come in <hi>helpes</hi> and directions how to <hi>lead a holy life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Holy life. Death.</note> and <hi>dye a holy death</hi>; how to <hi>order a mans time,</hi> and mannage his dayes and houres in Chriſtian and holy courſes, ſo that he may both in life and death, carry himſelfe as becomes a Chriſtian, and be in ſuch a ſtate as a Chriſtian may be: that is for the aggreſſe or ſetting upon the worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Congreſſe,</note>Then thirdly, in the <hi>congreſſe,</hi> wherein is to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:231:61"/>
be treated of our <hi>ſpirituall warfare:</hi> helps to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to carry our ſelves in time of <hi>diſtreſſe of conſcience,</hi> and in matter of <hi>Satans temptations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</note> which every Chriſtian more or leſſe will have, and meet withall.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in the <hi>progreſſe,</hi> helpe for <hi>perſeverance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Progreſſe, Perſeverance.</note> how to hold out in daily proficiency, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall perſeverance to the end.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all the heads: whereof,</p>
               <p>There are foure in the porch and frontiſpice; and foure times twelve in the pile and edifice, the reſt of the building.</p>
               <p>Twelve generals concerning things to bee knowne and beleeved of God and man in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p>And twelve concerning God and man in particular, according to their particular ſtates.</p>
               <p>And twelve for matters of life, duties to be performed.</p>
               <p>And twelve helps that are to be uſed to help us in the performance of thoſe duties.</p>
