            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the method of our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who must aggravate the difficulty of their Cure, to procure them the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
                  <p>Whereat, <hi>Themista</hi> smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, replied; Renowned Sir, Leave that Method to such novice Artists, who stand in need of a publique Cryer of their Cures; for your selfe, we dare avouch, that so much are you indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fame, or shee rather indeered to you, that you cannot be more highly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of opinion than you are. That fame of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> your

The universall opinion which all Nations retaine of you, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gathered, by those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17960:82"/>
Temples erected to your Honour, and entitled by your owne Name, the more to dilate your honour. What Statues have beene reared, what Shrines erected for you? and how severely have punishments beene inflicted on such as have either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractively inveyed against you, or sacrilegiously disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured you? Which might be instanced in the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>Dionysius;</hi> who, though he made a jeast of Sacriledge, and gave easie reines to all prophanenesse, yet his exile from the flowry
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17960:82"/>
boundiers of his Empire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him for his impious designes towards the Gods: amongst which, for the dishonour hee did unto you, <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> in cutting off your beard, and clozing up his Sacriledge with a jeere, saying, <hi>it was unfit, for you the Sonne to have a beard, and your Father</hi> Apollo <hi>to have none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, Lady, (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Aesculapius</hi>) just was the censure inflicted on <hi>Dionysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> but undeserved was his impiety towards mee, for those many favours which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17960:83"/>
his Countrey had received from me. Howsoever, you shall know (Madame) that I was never ambitious after fame; which, for the most part, is soonest procured, when it is least desired: for where <hi>vertue</hi> is the sole ground of our actions, it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drawes to her some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spectators to crown them with a deserving ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.

It is more than high time, that we now addresse our selfe to our Practise: wherein, though most of our surreptitious <hi>Empiricks,</hi> gaine them <hi>experience</hi> by the <hi>death</hi> of their <hi>Patients;</hi> our Patients (so heavens breath on our Endeavours) shall suffer no such fatall prejudice by our Experience.</p>
                  <p>Nor doe we feare it, <hi>Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius,</hi> (answered <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,</hi>) where Theory, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and Honesty meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Subject, the Cure cannot but promise successe; proceed then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

                     <hi>Metoxos,</hi> you have a foule body, full of vicious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humours, my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore (drawne from the seldome erring rule of judgement and practise) is this; that you first be <hi>purged,</hi> that your body may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>prepared.</hi> Secondly, you must be <hi>blooded,</hi> that all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, clotted and congealed blood may bee <hi>removed.</hi> Thirdly, you must have a <hi>vomit,</hi> that all crudities which lye rotting about your stomacke, may bee <hi>exhaled.</hi> The necessity of which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17960:85"/>
shall appeare (said <hi>Aesculapius</hi>) by the effects, which each of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For your <hi>Siege,</hi> the Lake <hi>Cocitus,</hi> or <hi>Stimphalus</hi> were odoriferous Bathes unto it. The whole History of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jax</hi> cannot show the like: for the luscious't nutriment ever renders the loath somst excrement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, for your <hi>blood,</hi> it is so thicke and corrupt, as <hi>Buls</hi> blood is of a pure, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and subtile quality in comparison of it: which may appeare by the standing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17960:85"/>
colour, or <hi>Iewish</hi> tincture you have in your face, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid on with an <hi>Aurum technicum,</hi> cannot blush.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, for the <hi>Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of your <hi>Stomacke;</hi> they are so numerous, and those so onerous, as they that see your <hi>Eiectments,</hi> will hold them meere deceptions of the Sight: for sometimes, you shall cast up a whole Oxe (equall for proportion to <hi>Milo</hi>'s Bull) which stucke so in your throat, as you could not speak, but brought you by meanes of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, in great danger of

a <hi>Squinancy;</hi> other times, a Massie Basen and Eure, all <hi>partiall-guilt;</hi> Now an hundred or two of Rixe dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; and in the end, when your stomacke is disgorged of these, you shall cast up a whole Covy of Partridge, Ducke and Mallard, Cram'd Capons, with much other both wilde fowle and tame; all which lay fluttering on your queasie stomacke, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted. And all this by the sorcery of your Curtezan <hi>Analeutheria.</hi>

Though Physicians have the body in cure, if the Patient second not their Cure with his care, the Cure is lost, and all those Receits they so artfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, reduc'd to nothing.
