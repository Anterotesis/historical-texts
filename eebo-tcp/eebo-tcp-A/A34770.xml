         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Tranſlation of this Book may
perhaps ſtand in as much need of
an Apology as another, to make ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for a great many Errors; but the
Tranſlator profeſſes, he has that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for it, that he had rather own
'em all, and leave it to the Readers
Diſcretion to damn or forgive 'em, as he
pleaſes, than trouble himſelf any more
about it.</p>
            <p>For one Excuſe, amongſt a thouſand
others us'd upon theſe occaſions, he might
ſay that the Tranſlation ſuffers extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for want of Leiſure, but he has not
the Face to pretend ſuch a thing, when
<pb facs="tcp:57806:3"/>
'tis but too apparent that it ſuffers indeed
for want of a little Application. This
Negligence is his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs, but too
late to be helpt now: Nay, what's worſe,
if it was to be done again, 'tis to be
fear'd he could not be prevaild on to
take the pains to reviſe it, for
the Reputation of Writing never ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.</p>
            <p>As for the Work it ſelf; the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
when he read it, fancy'd he found
ſomething more pleaſant and entertaining
in it than ordinary, and that engag'd
him to make it <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which when he
had once undertaken, he was no longer
at liberty to reject ſome other things that
to him appear'd trifling enough. To
make amends for which it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that thro the whole Book there is a
great Variety of very ſurpriſing Paſſages,
and that moſt of 'em are very diverting.
If any doubts the truth of them, he is
referr'd to the <hi>French Preface,</hi> which is
<pb facs="tcp:57806:3"/>
writ on purpoſe to juſtify the Author's
Sincerity. Tho after all, the paſſage about
his Birth is reckon'd by ſome not only a
doubtful Story, but an Impoſſibility:
But perhaps he might himſelf be impos'd
on in that; for 'tis no New Practice to
call ſuch Births Miraculous, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a little too ſoon for the Credit of
the Family.</p>
            <p>As for the Stile, if after what has
been ſaid the Reader will be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
as to expect the Language in
the Tranſlation to be very pure and juſt,
he muſt be inform'd, that the Original in
that reſpect is none of the moſt finiſht
pieces in its own Tongue. For tho the
Author was a perſon of Quality, and of
extraordinary Parts and Addreſs, yet
'twas his Misfortune, that his Education
was not only far from that of a Man of
Learning, but much inferior to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57806:4"/>
His Subject, is the Particularities of
his own Life, which requir'd no more
than a free, eaſy, and natural Style,
and that he has for the moſt part obſerv'd
well enough. 'Tis ſufficient then if the
Tranſlator has not miſtaken his Senſe,
and that 'tis hop'd he has not done, nor
in the main done him any great Injury.</p>

            <head>THE
French Publiſhers
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Count <hi>de Rochefort</hi> was a perſon ſo well
known, and dy'd ſo lately, that it ſeems almoſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to offer to juſtify any thing that he has menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
in his <hi>Memoirs.</hi> There is none of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who knew him either at Court, or in the Camp, but
know that in his Converſation, he was ſo averſe from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing
the Truth, or relating any thing fictitious, that it
can never be imagin'd he ſhould be guilty of writing a
Falſity, with a Deſign to impoſe upon the World. There has
not liv'd for theſe many Ages a Man of greater Honour than
he was, which I do not ſpeak, becauſe I have ever profeſt a
Friendſhip for him, but becauſe I am oblig'd to do him that
Juſtice. If therefore in the beginning of theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> he
relates ſomething of his Father, which is very ſurprizing, the
Reader is not immediately from thence to call his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in queſtion, as if it were not true. We are ſo us'd
every day to extraordinary Adventures, that none but thoſe
who are unacquainted with <hi>Paris,</hi> are any longer ſurpriz'd
at them. There is not a Year paſſes, but this great City af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
Subject of Sorrow to ſome, while others laugh at
<pb facs="tcp:57806:5"/>
their Expence. Yet is the Story of his Brother-in-law and
Siſter not ſo very uncommon. How many Husbands have
purſu'd their Wives, and courted them to a Reconcilement,
when the Separation has not been upon the account of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as in this caſe; but upon ſuch juſt and good
grounds, as extreme Weakneſs only could forget. I know
ſome, that have been at a great deal of Coſt and Pains to
have themſelves declar'd Cuckolds, and it has been done
very much to their Satisfaction; yet afterwards have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
as great Impatience to have the Dear Spouſe home
again, (tho a little faulty) as ever they ſhew'd Deſire
for a Divorce. This is no more than what I know my
ſelf to be true; or elſe it would appear more incredible,
than that a Man ſhould take his Wife again, whom he
never had any other reaſon but to eſteem. But perhaps it
may be objected, that the perſon who we are talking of,
was turn'd Prieſt, and after that ought not to have
taken his Wife again. But why not? Since the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
judg'd it lawful, and a Man of Honour has affirm'd
it; whoſe Sincerity too appears the more in this, that he
recounts thoſe things of his own Family, which a great
many others in his place would have induſtriouſly conceal'd.
And I will add this further proof of the Truth on't; that
happening t'other day to be in the Company of Monſieur,
the Preſident <hi>Bailleul,</hi> and my Mind running upon theſe
<hi>Memoirs,</hi> I askt him if he did not remember ſuch a
Proceſs, and ſome other particulars which the Count <hi>de
Rochefort</hi> had mention'd of him, and he told me, that
he remember'd it as perfectly well, as if the thing had been
done but that moment. After this can it poſſibly be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Monſieur <hi>de Bailleul</hi> being a perſon of that noted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
that his Teſtimony alone is enough to convince the
moſt incredulous? Yet I muſt confeſs I was an Infidel my
ſelf, with reſpect to what Monſieur the <hi>Count</hi> tells us
of the <hi>Swiſs:</hi> For who could ever imagine, there were
<pb facs="tcp:57806:5"/>
any people in Nature ſo ſimple, as to take Puppits for
young Devils? Yet is there nothing more certainly true
than this. For I was not content only with inquiring the
Truth of it from <hi>Biroche,</hi> but from Monſieut <hi>Du Mont</hi>
too, with whom I was very well acquainted. They both
own'd it to me, but in a different manner; for <hi>Biroche</hi>
made his Brags of it, as if he has ſhewn a great piece of
Wit; whereas <hi>Du Mont</hi> could not think of it without
flying out into ſuch a paſſion, as was a ſign he had not yet
forgot his Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>If then the Count <hi>de Rochefort</hi> is ſo juſt in a Story,
which has ſo much the Air of a Fiction, how ſincere muſt
we conclude him in his other Relations? In effect, where
lies the Difficulty of believing what he ſays of Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu?</hi> Are not all Miniſters of State myſterious, or
ſhould be ſo at leaſt, and was not that a quality which the
Cardinal affected above all things, as the Count <hi>de Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
takes very good notice? Is there any thing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
than what that Miniſter made <hi>Sauve</hi> to do; or is
there any thing more ſurprizing, than the Ambition of
that Man, who was content to ſacrifice his Wife to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Fortune? All which may ſerve for inſtructions
for our own Conduct, which is one of the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
we can gain from the reading of any Book. I am
perſwaded too, that the Count <hi>de Rochefort</hi> was not ſo
much induced to write out of vanity, to ſhew he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the private Intrigues of State, as out of a deſire to
render other People wiſer by his Example: And I am the
more confirm'd in this opinion, when I reflect how often
he reproaches himſelf for making ſo ill uſe of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Richlieu</hi>'s favour, and ſo ſeverely reprehends his
own Follies. However, ſhould theſe <hi>Memoirs</hi> not prove
ſo very profitable, I am confident they will be found to be
very curious, diſcovering a great many things which are
no where elſe to be met with. I believe too they will be
<pb facs="tcp:57806:6"/>
found to be very diverting, and that none will ever think
them tedious. But Friendſhip perhaps may be thought to
have a large ſhare in this Diſcourſe, and indeed the Author
of theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> and my ſelf, were ſuch dear Friends,
that I muſt confeſs I have a ſtrange Indulgence for any
thing of his; yet as I have not been the only perſon that
has read 'em, but others have been of my Taſt, I ſhall
venture to declare 'em once again, the moſt agreeable
of their kind.</p>
            <p>There is another thing too I muſt confeſs, but from that
I know not how I ſhall be abſolv'd; I publiſh here theſe
<hi>Memoirs</hi> againſt the Laſt Will and Intention of the
Author, who upon his Death, which happen'd in a month
or two after his Retirement, order'd me to ſuppreſs 'em. I
cannot imagine for what reaſon, except that being then
upon the point of leaving the World, he was willing to
ſpare ſome People, whom he had formerly had ſome differences
with, and whom he had no great cauſe to ſpeak well of.
But this did not appear to me a ſufficient reaſon to deprive
the Publick of a Work ſo curious; therefore ſuch as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it without either adding or diminiſhing, here 'tis at
the Readers Service.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS
OF
The Count de Rochefort, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEtween <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> on the Right hand
of <hi>Chaſtres,</hi> lies a Caſtle call'd <hi>Olinville,</hi> which
had formerly been one of the Kings Houſes,
but now belongs to the Family of <hi>Marillac.</hi>
My Father going once to pay a viſit there, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Monſieur <hi>De Marillac,</hi> took my Mother
along with him, who was big, and above four months
and an half gone with Child: As they went, they
call'd at one Monſieur <hi>Grigni</hi>'s, a Gentleman of the
Neighbourhood, where their Coachman having got
drunk, made bold to overturn the Coach at the very
gate of <hi>Olinville,</hi> tho the way was the ſmootheſt and
beſt in the World. By this accident, my Father,
inſtead of the diverſion he expected there, met with
an inexpreſſible affliction: For my Mother, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſome hurt, having brought me into the world
the next day, liv'd but two days after it; to the
grief of the whole family, who had a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for her. My Father was in ſuch a paſſion, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57806:7"/>
had it not been for Monſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> he had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
kill'd the Coachman: It was impoſſible tho
to perſwade him, but that he was guilty of the death
of my Mother, (as caſually indeed he was) ſo he had
his Proceſs made, but after two or three months Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
he was acquitted.</p>
            <p>No body imagining that I could live, they took
care to have me immediately Baptiz'd: Monſieur
<hi>De Marillac.</hi> and one Madam <hi>D' Arboville,</hi> who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to be in the houſe, perform'd the Offices for me
at the Font. I was call'd <hi>Charles Caeſar,</hi> which was
my Fathers Name, and given me to oblige him. They
took a Nurſe for me there, whom my Father ſent
with me to his Caſtle, which was at the entrance
into the Forreſt of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and having ſome buſineſs
at <hi>Paris,</hi> went himſelf thither. My Father having no
more Children, and every body believing (as I ſaid)
that I could hardly live, they all advis'd him to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and he who was ſtill young, and no hater of the
Sex, was eaſily prevail'd on. Several young Ladies
were propos'd to him of the beſt Families in <hi>Paris;</hi>
but being deſirous to ſee before he engag'd with any,
he found none that he lik'd; whether it was that none
of them were really fine Women, or that his Fate
had reſerv'd for him the accident I am now to relate;
and for me the worſt Mother-in-law that ever was
in the world. However it was that he ſeem'd ſo
difficult, a relation of his who was Curate of one of
the beſt Churches in <hi>Paris,</hi> and had the Character
of a very holy man, as indeed he was; came ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to tell him, that he had done his buſineſs for
him, in finding a young Lady, very well made, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
rich, vertuous, and of quality; in ſhort, a
Jewel for the age, that was ſo extremely corrupted.
Tho my Father knew 'twas a dangerous thing to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57806:7"/>
take a Woman on the word of a Prieſt, yet the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Curate ſatisfy'd him, as knowing, that there
was no general rule without exception; he made him
this anſwer, That he knew better than himſelf what
was fit for him; that he was extreamly oblig'd to
him for his kindneſs; and for the Lady, he would
make no enquiries of her, after the character he had
given her: The Curate return'd, That this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his was the cauſe that he had preferr'd him
to many of his other relations, whoſe fortunes
would have been made by ſuch a Match: That the
Lady would have an Eſtate of twenty thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
<hi>per annum:</hi> That ſhe was of the Family <hi>De la
Force,</hi> one of the moſt conſiderable houſes among
thoſe of the pretended Reform'd Religion; of
which ſhe had lately made her abjuration to him;
that as ſoon as he had marry'd her, he might get the
Eſtate of the Family into his hands, of which the
ſucceſſion was vacant; and for her Mother, he might
eaſily oblige her by his addreſs; that his Wife's
changing her Religion ſhould be no prejudice to him.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to ſay how this diſcourſe charm'd
my Father, he was impatient to ſee the Lady; and
the Curate having ſhow'd her to him at the Convent
where ſhe was retreated, he return'd ſo ſmitten that
he could not reſt till the affair was concluded: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as he was a Man not to be fool'd, or at leaſt
thought himſelf ſuch, he wrote to ſome Friends of
his at <hi>Agen,</hi> where the Ladies Eſtate was ſaid to be;
and they giving him an account that ſhe was a very
virtuous Lady, had a very good Fortune, and was
only retir'd to <hi>Paris</hi> to make her Abjuration; he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her, fancying himſelf the happieſt man in the
world: His happineſs continued about three weeks,
in which time, no young Lover could have careſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57806:8"/>
his Miſtriſs with more paſſion than he did his new
Bride: He carried her to the Ball, to the Play, to
the publick Walks, and in ſhort, when ever he was
oblig'd to be abſent from her but an hour or two, he
would return with ſuch eagerneſs as was almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
for a Husband; every body was ſurpriz'd
that enjoyment had not moderated his tranſports: but
he told all thoſe who hinted any ſuch thing to him,
that if it us'd to be ſo with reſpect to other Wives, it
was not ſo with him, ſince his had nothing in her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of diſguſting the Appetite.</p>
            <p>In all this hurry I was eaſily forgotten, and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I was ſpoken of, it was only to ask if I was not
yet dead; for my Father not doubting but he ſhould
ſoon have Children by his new Wife, and retaining
no more the remembrance of my Mother, began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to advance the ſentiments of tenderneſs that are
ſo common to thoſe of a ſecond Bed.</p>
            <p>He believ'd himſelf now at that pitch of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as to be exempt from the attacks of Fortune, and
dreamt of nothing but how to paſs away the time
till the Spring ſhould come on, when they reſolv'd
to make a ſhort Journey to view his Wives Eſtate;
in the mean time he preſented her with a very rich
Coach, and all things agreeable. But all this could
not divert her, ſtill there appear'd on her face an air
of Diſcontent, and a melancholly ſo deeply rooted as
extreamly afflicted my Father; he was every moment
preſſing her to tell him if ſhe wanted any thing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that ſhe needed but to ſpeak, ſince the man
whoſe heart ſhe ſo entirely poſſeſt could deny her
nothing; joyning to this obliging diſcourſe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt
Careſſes in the world: But one day as he was
treating her in this ſort, he perceiv'd ſomething more
than ordinary under her Shift upon her ſhoulder, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57806:8"/>
demands of her what it was: But ſhe inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
him ſtrove to get from him, which increaſing
his ſuſpicion, he took hold of her and would ſee what
it was, then ſhe us'd intreaties with him, told him it
was nothing, and tried again to get looſe from him,
but finding it in vain ſhe ſtruggl'd with him, nor was
it but with great difficulty that he pull'd down her
Shift, which diſcover'd to him a thing, that had he
not been in Bed had ſtrook him to the ground, he
ſaw (ſhall I dare to ſpeak it) the fair
impreſſion of a<note n="*" place="margin">The mark with which they brand Malefactors in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> Flower-de-luce,
which at once undeceiv'd him in the
good opinion he had had of her; ſhe
who had ſo often prov'd the force of
her Careſſes, attempted to calm him
by a kiſs, and he who was become inſenſible, ſuffer'd
her without the leaſt notice; but in a moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
himſelf, <hi>Go infamous Creature,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if I
cannot have ſo much juſtice as to have you hang'd, you
ſhall certainly die by my own hand:</hi> He got up in all haſte
and immediately finds out the Curate, and treats him
with the worſt Language that rage and deſpair could
inſpire him with; but ſeeing that all this was to no
pnrpoſe, he demands of him what remedy he would
pretend to apply to the Diſeaſe he had procur'd him.</p>
            <p>The poor Curate could not ſoon be perſwaded to
believe him, but being ſatisfi'd at laſt that it was but
too true, he threw himſelf at his feet begging his
pardon, and lifting up his eyes made a thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
upon the abominable wickedneſs of the
woman, who had under covert of Confeſſion made
him a party to her impoſtures. But my Father ſtill
continuing almoſt diſtracted, ſo that the people began
to croud about them, a Prieſt that had formerly
been an Advocate ſtept to him and told him, 'twas
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57806:9"/>
indeed a ſad Caſe but not altogether incurable, that
ſhe had counterfeited her Name, and therefore the
Marriage was void; that he had no more to do but
immediately to enter his Action, and tho he might
meet with ſome difficulty (the Parliament being
very nice in ſuch caſes) yet he muſt follow it cloſe,
and needed not to doubt the ſucceſs. As in a general
Shipwrack men catch at any thing that's likely to ſave
them, my Father embrac'd this advice as if it had
been ſent from Heaven, and running directly to the
<note n="*" place="margin">The Palace is in <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> is here the place for the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> Palace, he conſults with three of the
moſt able Councel, who all of them
were of the ſame opinion; but told him
withal that it would be needful for him
to make ſome Friends, eſpecially if he
found ſhe had any body to ſtand by
her; this diſturb'd my Father above all,
who was aſham'd to make uſe of his Friends about
ſuch a buſineſs as this, and 'twas ſeveral days before
he could be brought to it, till he found a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perſon engage in the affair for her, which oblig'd
him to do that which otherwiſe he would never have
done.</p>
            <p>But to his ſorrow he found that ſhe had out-witted
him there too, that ſhe had not chang'd her Name,
but was really call'd <hi>Madelain de Caumont,</hi> juſt as ſhe
had ſign'd the Contract, and had alſo given the true
names of her Father and Mother; and all the falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
they could fix upon her, was, that ſhe had dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd
her Father with the Title of Knight, and Lord
of ſeveral Mannors, and her Mother with that of a
very great Lady, inſtead of what they really were, a
Miller and the Millers Wife. The caſe being ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nice, they advis'd my Father to treat with the young
woman for a ſum of Money to conſent to a decree
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57806:9"/>
againſt the Marriage; but her Friend owing my
Father an ill turn on the account of an old quarrel,
and glad of this opportunity to pay it him, would
hearken to no accommodation; upon which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was advis'd to engage the Judge Advocate on
his ſide, and to proſecute her for an abuſe to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for indeed ſhe had made a publick Abjuration,
whereas ſhe was born a Catholick, and had always
been ſo; this trick of the Law put both her and her
friend to a ſtand: She abſconded immediately, and
ſet ſome Perſons to treat privately with my Father,
who by this means got clear of her for a thouſand
Crowns, whereas before he had offer'd her two
thouſand.</p>
            <p>My Relations, who ſaw plainly that this Match
would have ruin'd me, were not ſorry for his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
hoping that this would teach him ſome
wit; but he was hardly out of one error before he
had like to have fallen into another. He Lodg'd at
a rich Merchants at the entrance into St. <hi>Dennis-ſtreet,</hi>
for the convenience of being near the Palace, who
had in the houſe an only Daughter between Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and Twenty years of age, tollerably handſom,
but very well made; he had been extreamly pleas'd
with her Converſation, which very much diverted
him when he had moſt need of it: Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ended his buſineſs he thought he could not do
better than to take up with her, who was a Woman
of ſenſe, brought up under the eye of her Mother,
no wanton Coquet, that had an Eſtate, and who
would think her ſelf honour'd in marrying a Perſon
of Quality. Her Father and Mother had ſeveral
times taken occaſion to let him underſtand, that
having no more Children they ſhould be very
glad to ſee her well ſettled; and he believing that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57806:10"/>
this would be a perſon very fit for his turn, he breaks
it to the Girl, who was eaſily brought to be willing;
he was overjoyed to find her ſo favourably inclin'd,
and having now nothing to do but to gain her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, he mov'd it to them, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
their conſent.</p>
            <p>As he had before made more haſte than good
ſpeed, he now reſolved for once to take advice, and
Monſieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> being one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
of his Friends, he was firſt acquainted with
it. My Father took a great deal of pains to reconcile
him to a Match that ſeem'd diſhonourable to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and to that end fail'd not to magnifie the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his Miſtreſs, her Behaviour, her Breeding, her
Diſcretion, not forgeting her Eſtate, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
of her Parents; and in ſhort, omitted nothing
to remove any prejudice in his thoughts againſt it.
Monſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> who was a Man of Honour,
and vext to ſee his Kinſman going to match with a
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nick,</hi> told him, he wondred he would run
headlong upon ſuch an affair, in which he might
perhaps find ſomething to diſlike that he yet knew not
of; that 'twas not his wonder that the young Lady,
tho ſhe had a good Eſtate, was ſo willing, becauſe
young Girls are all willing enough to be married;
but that her Parents, who were Citizens, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
had a natural averſion to a Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſhould be ſo very forward, ſeem'd to him to
have ſome myſtery in it, that deſerved to be enquir'd
into; and ſaving his reſpect for him, (ſaid he) while
you think you are marrying a Maid, what if ſhe ſhould
chance to be a Widow? Had it been any body but
Mr. <hi>de Marillac,</hi> my Father would never have born
this diſcourſe with any patience; but having been
born, as it were, with a reſpect for him, he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57806:10"/>
that there was nothing to be fear'd of that
ſort, and that he would venture it. Monſieur <hi>de
Marillac</hi> told him ſmiling, That 'twas his own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and if he had ſaid any thing in it, 'twas purely
for that he thought himſelf oblig'd to it; not only
as he was his Relation, but alſo from the Friendſhip
which had always been between the two Families.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The matter reſted there, and my Father reſolved
to go through with it, notwithſtanding all this good
counſel. There was in the Country a Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his, a jolly old Fellow, a Batchelour, who
had never been ſo fond of marrying as he; and who
deſign'd to leave his Eſtate to our Family. My Father
ſends for him, and the Old Gentleman, before he
would appear, would needs have ſome fine Cloaths;
and talking to his Taylor about the occaſion of his
coming to Town, that it was to the Wedding of
his Couſin and Heir, who was to be married to the
Daughter of ſuch a Merchant.</hi> Bleſs me Sir! <hi>ſaid
the Taylor,</hi> What does he mean? Is there no other
Women in <hi>Paris? This ſtartled the Old Man, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him why he talkt at that rate?</hi> Why Sir, <hi>ſays he,</hi>
ſhe has had a Child by one of her Fathers Prentices; but
I ſhould not have ſpoke of it, Sir, for it was but One, and
I ſuppoſe ſhe is very honeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow. How! <hi>ſays the Old
Gentleman,</hi> why then 'tis nothing with you here at
<hi>Paris,</hi> for a Maid to have a Child? I don't ſay ſo, Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Taylor;</hi> and rather than a young Woman ſhould
loſe her Reputation, I was reſolv'd never to have ſpoke of it;
but that 'tis a thouſand pities, that an honest good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhould be cheated; for ſhe not only continues her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,
but 'tis come to that paſs, that there's hardly a
day comes over her head, but ſhe is to be ſeen at a certain
place, right againſt my Houſe; ſhe diſguiſes her ſelf ſo, that
ſhe fancies ſhe is not to be known, but ſhe forgets that I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57806:11"/>
have formerly dealt with her Father, and know her well
enough.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe, and the freedom and honeſty of
the Taylor, very much ſurpriz'd our Couſin; he ſent
preſently for my Father, and repeating this ſtory, askt
him what he meant, by medling with ſuch a creature.
My Father lookt upon it all as Malice and Lyes;
but the Old Man ſeeing him ſo reſolute, told him
in a rage, that for his part, he would not come to the
Wedding, and beſides that, would diſinherit him if
he proceeded any further in the matter. Yet my
Father ſlighting all his threatnings, comes the ſame
day, and brings the Contract of Marriage for him to
ſign; inſtead of which, he ſnatcht it out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarys
hands, and tore it in a thouſand pieces; and
not content with that, goes immediately to Monſieur
<hi>de Marillac,</hi> tells him the whole ſtory, and begs him
to interpoſe his Authority to prevent ſo ſcandalous a
thing. Monſieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> ſtepping with him into
his Coach, they came together to my Father, and
told him, That knowing how obſtinate he was, they
did not come to deſire him quite to break off the
match, but to perſuade him to inform himſelf of
the truth; that perhaps theſe reports might be falſe,
but he muſt own that they ought not to be neglected;
that they only deſign'd to open his Eyes, and if
they could not make the thing plain to him, he was
at his Liberty; that they deſired but one thing of him,
which was, that he would pretend extraordinary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
oblig'd him to go to his Houſe in the Country
for a few days, during which time, they offer'd to
diſcover the truth for him, or if not, they were
content he ſhould proceed.</p>
            <p>This was too reaſonable a requeſt to be denied,
ſo my Father having taken leave of his Miſtreſs for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57806:11"/>
eight days, upon his promiſe to return then without
fail, he went and lodg'd privately at the Taylors,
where he plac'd himſelf as Centinel, to watch for
what he hardly dar'd to ſee; 'twas but the next day
that he very fairly ſaw his Lady, muffled up in her
Scarf, going into the Bawdyhouſe; but not truſting
his Eyes at that diſtance, and through the Glaſs, he
goes down, and throwing his Cloak over his Face,
he ſtalks up and down in the ſtreet, till ſhe ſhould
come out; he knew her again well enough, but as
if he would fain believe it was not ſhe, he follow'd
her to her Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ers door, and confirm'd by her going
in there, he was ſtrangely confounded; but yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that poſſibly there might be ſome other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that houſe, he ſtill juſtify'd her in his thoughts,
till he ſhould be inform'd how it was: But the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
having ſatisfy'd him of the contrary, as alſo the
Taylor, he was reſolv'd not to be convinc'd unleſs he
could ſee even what ſhe did there with his own eyes:
To which purpoſe he goes himſelf to that honeſt
place, where he ſoon got acquaintance, and for his
Money they brought him a Girl; he would not ask
for another, for fear of giving ſuſpicion, but paid her
very generouſly, and ſo from that time paſt for one
of their beſt Cuſtomers. The next day he came
again, and having deſir'd them to ſhow him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was extraordinary, they brought him the
perſon he wiſht for, or fear'd rather; for at the ſight
of her he was ſo toucht, as made him cry like a Child;
and going out without ſpeaking one word to her,
took Horſe and rode home to his own houſe, without
ſeeing ſo much as Monſieur <hi>De Marillac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not ſo eaſie a thing to get out of the
hands of the <hi>Pariſians;</hi> and my Father having had
the diſcretion, notwithſtanding all that had been
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57806:12"/>
ſaid to him, to ſign the Contract, they fetcht him
back ſore againſt his will, to clear himſelf of the
Eccleſiaſtical Court, where they had obtain'd a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt him for two thouſand Franks, with
Damages and Intereſt. He never paid any thing in
his life with ſo ill a will, wherefore he made an
Appeal to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and conſulted with his
Lawyers, ſeeing he was like to be caſt, but all this
did but encreaſe both his ſorrow and his debt; for
the ſame trick that had helpt him before, undid him
now, and inſtead of his fine of two thouſand Franks,
he was forced to pay three thouſand.</p>
            <p>Tho he was incorrigible after the firſt miſchance,
every body thought that on the addition of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
he had done with the thoughts of marrying:
But it being decreed (as I ſaid) that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have a
Mother-in-law, and that one as bad as poſſible, he
married a Perſon of Quality in the Country, who ſo
maſter'd his temper, that ſhe was no ſooner come
home, but I was turn'd out of doors, and my Nurſe
too: I was carried back to <hi>Olinville,</hi> on purpoſe, as I
ſuppoſe, that as that place had been fatal to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it might be no better to me; I was kept there
a whole year before my Nurſe ever heard a word
from my Father, tho ſhe had writ ſeveral Letters to
him, and her Husband had gone himſelf to his
Houſe; but at laſt one of his Carters paſſing near
the Town, ſent to tell my Nurſe, that he had order
to leave with her about twelve Buſhels of Wheat:
As if that had been enough to ſatisfie her for my
keeping; and to avoid being askt for Money, they let
me lye there another whole year, without enquiring
whether I was alive or dead: The poor people with
whom I was, notwithſtanding all this, us'd me like
their own Child, whether taken with the little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57806:12"/>
of my behaviour, or becauſe they had no
Children themſelves, I know not, for they could
have no other reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>My Father in the mean time forgot me with leſs
difficulty, for that he had one Son already by my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
and ſhe was ready to lye down of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet he could not avoid being often askt by
the Neighbours what was become of me; my
Mother had her anſwer readier than my Father,
(who was ſomething puzzl'd with theſe queſtions)
and would reply briskly that I was well, but they
did not fetch me home becauſe I ſhould not bring the
memory of my Mother into his mind; none but
Sots could be wheedl'd with ſuch an anſwer, and
my Mothers Relations living above eighty Leagues
off, and having no body to regard me, I continu'd
three years longer with my Nurſe, and I believe
ſhould have been there ſtill had it not been for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Marillac;</hi> who ſeeing me at Maſs at <hi>Olinville,</hi>
asked notwithſtanding the poor plight I was in, if I
was not his Couſin <hi>R</hi>'s Son? I had always a good
heart, and when I found my Nurſe would not anſwer
for me, I ſpoke boldly to Monſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> and
told him that I was indeed the Son of Monſieur
<hi>L. C. De Rochefort,</hi> but that it had been my misfortune
never to have ſeen him that I remembred: my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
pleas'd him, tho it was nothing but what I had
learnt by hearing my Nurſe ſay ſo; however being
a brisk Boy, and if I may ſay it, genteel enough, he
made one of his Pages lead me to his Caſtle, where
he order'd me to be cloath'd ſuitable to my quality;
and having kept me there till he was oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſent his Steward with me to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom he writ, that I began now to be of
an age in which he ought to take more care of me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57806:13"/>
My Father receiv'd me becauſe he could not help
it, but much againſt his will I am ſure, for he uſed
me ſo roughly the very day I came to him, that as
young as I was, I could plainly ſee he did not much
care for me; if I had dar'd, I would have askt him
the reaſon of it, and leave alſo to return to my
Nurſe, where I had received quite contrary uſage;
but being afraid to open my mouth, I ſtood in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as if I had not belong'd to the Family, while
they careſt and fondled one of her Children, tho he
was as mangy and ſcabby as a Hound; this madded
me intolerably, for being now almoſt ſix years old,
and beginning to have ſome knowledge of matters,
I was ready to burſt with ſpleen. I liv'd thus how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
about a year and a half, eating with the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
having no countenance from any body but
from our Curate, who was a very good man; I
pray'd him to teach me to read, for they never
thought of putting me to School, and the Curate
was ſo pleas'd with my motion, coming from my
ſelf, that he took a great deal of pains with me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that in three or four months I could read
perfectly in any ſort of Books.</p>
            <p>Every day my Mother-in-law plagu'd me with
one thing or another, and not only did me all the
miſchief ſhe could, but told an hundred Lies of me
to my Father, to ſet him againſt me; and my Father,
who did not much care for me, believ'd all ſhe ſaid,
and would often beat me without knowing for what,
which made me ſo deſperate that I reſolved to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
my ſelf. There was a Weed in the Garden
which they had often told me was poiſon, I took
ſome of it; and after ſaying my Prayers I eat enough
to have kill'd me twice over, if I had not happily
wanted wit to know Hemlock from another Herb;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57806:13"/>
or, as I have often thought, that I was guided
even by a Miracle to miſtake, for I was ſo far from
having any ſymptoms of one that was poiſon'd, that
it never ſo much as made me ſick; I had newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to go to Confeſſion, and therefore could not
conceal it from the Curate, who chid me ſeverely,
laying before me the heinouſneſs of the ſin, and
charg'd me to ask God forgiveneſs, and made me
promiſe him never to do ſo any more without firſt
telling him of it.</p>
            <p>The cruelty of my Mother-in-law and the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my Father, not only continuing but encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
truly I ev'n reſolv'd to run away; and ſo wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for an opportunity, I told the Curate my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who told me I was fit for nothing at that age,
being but eight years old; and therefore perſwaded
me to bear a little longer, till I was fit to go into
the Army; but that being a long time, I told him
reſolutely that I neither could nor would endure it:
He finding that unleſs I was prevented I ſhould
quickly be gone, acquaints my Father with it, who
ſeeming not to believe it, told him he ſhould not
trouble him ſelf about me, but let me go if I would;
the Curate ſeeing him ſo unnatural could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
weeping, and taking me in his arms entreated
me once more to have a little patience; but finding
it impoſſible to ſhake my reſolution, he pull'd out of
his Pocket two Crowns and gave them to me, telling
me that he was ſenſible I ſhould want them, and was
ſorry he was not in a condition to aſſiſt me better;
ſo praying God to bleſs me, told me I was always to
remember that I was born a Gentleman, which
oblig'd me to ſuffer a thouſand deaths rather than
to do a baſe action, or any thing unworthy of my
quality. My deſign was to find out Monſieur <hi>de</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57806:14"/>
               <hi>Marillac,</hi> from whom I had already receiv'd ſo much
kindneſs; but there happening at that time to be a
Troop of Gypſies in our Village I fell in with them,
and asking them if they would take me with
them, they told me with all their hearts, if I were
able to travel.</p>
            <p>This was enough to make me one of the Gang,
and having left our houſe without taking leave of
any body, and ſoon forgetting the good advice of the
Curate, I began that very day, like a true Gypſie, to
ſteal all the Cocks and Hens I could lay my hands
on, not regarding that it was but at my Fathers door,
and that all the Farmers thereabouts were his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants:
Thus I went on without giving my ſelf leave
to think what I was doing; and every one having
got his booty they were to bring it to the Captain,
who ſeeing me have ſix or ſeven Fowls for my ſhare,
gave me a dram of the Bottle and told the reſt what
a hopeful beginning I had made, and that in time I
ſhould make a brave fellow: we feaſted that Night
at the expence of the Country, and as liberty is
ſweeteſt to thoſe who have been under conſtraint,
I thought my ſelf in Heaven in compariſon of the
life I liv'd before.</p>
            <p>I led this wretched ſort of Life almoſt five years,
in which time we traverſt not only all over <hi>France</hi>
but many other Countries; at laſt a ſmall misfortune
befalling us (only that ſome of our Society chanc'd
to be hang'd) we were forc'd to take refuge in our
Native Country; ſo we return'd into <hi>France</hi> through
the Province of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and taking the Road to
<hi>Dijon</hi> we came into the Country of <hi>Lyonne,</hi> and from
thence into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> till at
laſt we came to the County of <hi>Foix:</hi> Here we thought
our ſelves ſecure, for the Country being Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57806:14"/>
would the better ſhelter us we fancy'd from
the Peaſants, if we found them ſo uncivil as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
our Thieveries: but we had taken wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and they were too cunning for us, for the very
firſt Night, while we were all ſcatter'd here and
there, after our Game, they came upon us and
plundred our Baggage: this happen'd to us by the
neglect of thoſe we had left to look after it, who
fooliſhly running after ſome Fowls left on purpoſe
by the Peaſants to draw them from their charge,
they who had plac'd themſelves in Ambuſcade ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
our Camp and ruin'd our whole Army; and
to add to our misfortune they had penn'd up all their
Fowls, ſo that tho we came back very much fatigu'd,
we were forc'd to take up our Lodging on the hard
ground, and without our Supper.</p>
            <p>This Life began to grow irkſom to me at laſt,
tho I was pleas'd with it a while when I knew no
better; for as my underſtanding encreaſt I began to
be aſham'd of my ſelf, remembring my Birth and
what that requir'd of me; I cry'd often by my ſelf,
and finding no body to conſult with, I was ſenſible
of the want of good advice; at laſt calling to mind
what the Curate had ſaid to me at my coming away,
I ſeriouſly askt my ſelf, <hi>Is this the Life of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thought, which had not ſo much as once
came into my head before, made ſuch an impreſſion
upon me that I reſolv'd to deſert, and being ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
as uſual, I took that opportunity to get away;
ſo making to the Mountains of <hi>Capſi,</hi> I entred <hi>Rouſillon</hi>
by <hi>Ville Franche;</hi> as I went I ſaw on my right hand
<hi>Canigout,</hi> one of the higheſt of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> on the top
of which is a Lake, with abundance of very good
Fiſh; but that which is moſt ſtrange is, that if one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57806:15"/>
throw a ſtone into it, it preſently falls a raining: I
askt the people thereabouts the reaſon, but they
could not tell me.</p>
            <p>I had hitherto kept the Curates two Crowns in
my Pocket, and they did me ſpecial ſervice at this
juncture. My deſign was to liſt my ſelf in the firſt
Company of Souldiers I could meet with, and did
not queſtion but I ſhould be entertain'd, for they did
not meaſure Souldiers by inches in thoſe days. My
Gypſies complexion made me paſs among the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
for a Native of the Country; and tho we had
War with <hi>Spain</hi> at that time, yet they neither
ſtopt me at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> nor at <hi>Salſes;</hi> at laſt I got to
<hi>Locates,</hi> which was our Frontier on that ſide, and
liſted in the Governours Company, who was Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>De St. Aunais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was not a Party made out againſt the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of <hi>Salſes</hi> but I would be one, and having learnt
a little <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> I fancy'd that looking ſo like a <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
I might have an advantage one time or other to
do ſomething that might diſtinguiſh my ſelf: for I
muſt needs ſay I began to deſpiſe the life of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldier, and Ambition was ſo got into my
Crown, tho but 15 years old, that I could not ſleep
quietly for dreaming of great things: I askt leave
however of Monſieur <hi>De St. Aunais,</hi> and he gave it
me, but ſeeing me come home always and nothing
done, <hi>Souldier,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you don't do well, a Man ſhould
rather loſe his Ears than do as you do; we may ſee our
Enemies when we will, but he that asks leave to ſee them
muſt go near them. I have been near enough, Sir,</hi> return'd I,
<hi>but we were too many of us, and I don't intend to ſhare the
honour I ſhall get with a whole Company. Why, how many
were you?</hi> ſaid he: <hi>We were eleven, Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>and that
was too many by nine; but if you pleaſe to let me go again</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57806:15"/>
               <hi>to morrow with only my Comrade, you ſhall have no cauſe
to reproach me. Won't you run away then?</hi> ſaid the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour:
<hi>If I had a mind to run away, Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I
would never come to ask leave: I have been twice up to the
Enemies Palliſades, and if I had intended to have gone
over, no body could have hindred me.</hi> This boldneſs
pleas'd him, and he ask'd me who I was? I told
him if I ſucceeded in my deſign I would give him
an account, but if not I would wait for a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opportunity: This anſwer pleas'd him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtill, and concluding by my diſcourſe that I was
ſome body more than ordinary, he lov'd me from
that moment, and 'twas not long before he gave me
proofs of it.</p>
            <p>Having leave to go out the next day, and being
come within two Muſquet ſhot of <hi>Salſes,</hi> I made my
Comrade lie down in a Ditch while I advanc'd a
little nearer, and having obſerv'd when I was out
before that an Officer of the Garriſon, who had an
intrigue with a Wench, us'd to meet her in the
Ruines of an old houſe, I thought to have hid my
ſelf in the ſame houſe, but I had obſerv'd too that he
always ſent a Souldier a little before him to ſee if the
Coaſt was clear, and I was loth to run the hazard
of failing in my Enterprize; but having pitcht upon
a place for my Ambuſcade, I made as if I was
waſhing of Clothes; ſtill keeping an Eye upon the
place; at laſt out comes the Souldier, and having ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in every corner, he had no ſooner made his report,
but I perceiv'd <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> coming one way, and
<hi>Mr. Officer</hi> another; but while they were warm at it, I
ruſht in with a Piſtol in each hand, and in this ſurprize
he ſuffer'd me to diſarm him as tamely as a Lamb:
after which <hi>I</hi> bid him walk before me, and told him,
if he offer'd to ſpeak a word, I would ſhoot him into
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57806:16"/>
the Guts: He did not think fit to try if I was a
man of my word, and I thinking it proper to bring
his Miſtriſs along with me, if 'twere only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
her giving the Alarm, I brought them to the
place where I had poſted my Comrade, who
having joyn'd me, and thereby taken from them all
hopes of eſcape, they were very diſconſolate; but
for my part I was ſo tranſported, that I hardly knew
what I did: we marcht in this figure a long hour,
till my Comrade, who took a fancy to the Girl, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we were out of danger of the Enemy, would
go no further, till he had had a touch with her; I
askt him if he was mad, but he only laughing at
me, was very fairly going to work with her. This put
me into a paſſion, but finding he was reſolv'd upon
his deſign, I threatned to ſhoot him. He told me he
was ready for me, and preſented his Piſtol at me, I
was not ſtartled at all, but coming boldly up to him
with my Priſoner in one hand, and my Piſtol in the
other, the Brute fir'd at me, but miſſing me, and
expecting my return, made all the haſte he could to
get away: I did not much care to follow him, but
made the beſt of my way, for all my fear was he
would run over to the Garriſon of <hi>Salſes,</hi> and give
an account of the matter; and my ſafety was wholly
owing to this ſpeed, for juſt as I imagin'd it fell out;
I was hardly got under the Walls of the Town,
when appear'd three Officers well mounted who had
purſu'd me; but ſeeing me juſt at the Gates they
thought not fit to advance any further. I entred
<hi>Locates</hi> in triumph, every one running out into the
ſtreet to ſee a Boy of ſixteen years old bring in two
Priſoners, and I was well guarded to the Governours
Houſe. As ſoon as I ſaw him, <hi>Now, Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>you
ſee I have been near enough to the Enemy, I told you a</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57806:16"/>
               <hi>great number would not do the buſineſs, for tho we were
but two, we were too many by one.</hi> He askt me what I
meant by that? whereupon I told him in ſhort the
Adventure with my Comrade. He was pleas'd to
ſpeak very much in my praiſe, and to magnify the
Action much more than it deſerv'd, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
giving me a Colours in the Regiment of <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi>
which was wholly at his diſpoſal, as well as
all the Vacancies of the Garriſon; he very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
told me, he ſhould not ſtop there, but would
take particular care of my fortune.</p>
            <p>But that which made the moſt noiſe was, that
the Priſoner I had taken happen'd to be a Lieutenant
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>De St. Aunais</hi>
having ſent word of it to Court, and the particulars
of the action, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> writ to him to ſend
me forthwith to <hi>Paris,</hi> and order'd me a hundred
Piſtoles for the charges of my Journey. I leave you
to imagine the inexpreſſible Joy I was in; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given Monſieur <hi>De St. Aunais</hi> all imaginable
thanks, whom I acknowledg'd to be my Benefactor,
he deſired me before I went, to tell him who I
was: ſo I gave him a brief account of all my little
Adventures: He told me, that tho Virtue was to
be valu'd where ever it was found, yet he was glad
to hear I was a Gentleman, becauſe it always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Luſtre from a Perſon of Quality. <hi>Go,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>and wait on the Cardinal, he loves a bold man, and is
very fond of engaging ſuch in his Service, and if I am not
miſtaken, he intends to do ſomething conſiderable for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I left <hi>Locates</hi> with a great deal of ſatisfaction,
having bought a couple of Horſes, and got me a Man
to wait on me; and that Pride which is ſo natural
to youth, being gotten into my head, nothing would
ſerve me, but I muſt go ſhow my ſelf in this figure
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57806:17"/>
in my own Country; and never conſidering the loſs
of my time, I turn'd out of the great Road at <hi>Briare,</hi>
and came that night to the Houſe of my old Friend
the Curate. He was ſurpriz'd, and overjoy'd to ſee
me, and after I had told him my adventures, and
whether I was bound, I gave him a great many
thanks for his former kindneſſes, and preſenting him
with ten Piſtoles, I aſſur'd him, that if ever I made
my fortune, I would not be unmindful of him: He
told me I ſhould find my Fathers Family much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt,
that he had ſeven Children, not reckoning me
into the number; that his affairs alſo were in no
very good condition, having lately met with a very
great loſs, which he believ'd was a judgment upon him
for his cruelty to me; whereupon he gave me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a very ſtrange accident which befel him, as
you ſhall hear. There was one <hi>Courtilz,</hi> a Kinſman of
ours, a Perſon of Quality, and related to moſt of the
Gentry of that Province, but had the misfortune not to
have an Eſtate anſwerable to his Birth, and to the
figure he made, for he was one of the genteeleſt Men
in the Kingdom; as he was waiting for ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
his buſineſs lay moſtly at <hi>Paris,</hi> and whether
he was ſupply'd by ſome of the Sex, or had a lucky
hand at Play, he always liv'd high, and kept the beſt
Company; he falling in Love with a young Widow,
that had a very good Eſtate, courted her in hopes to
carry her by his Gallantry, and that obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which was ſo peculiar to himſelf; but the Lady,
who either had no inclination for him, or which was
moſt likely, had oblig'd her ſelf to a religious Life,
deſir'd him in ſhort to trouble her no further: The
difficulty encreaſt his Paſſion, he haunted her every
where, and tho ſhe had forbid him her Houſe, he
contriv'd his buſineſs ſo well, that he ſaw her every
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57806:17"/>
day, either at Church, or at ſome friends houſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but ſhe, to be rid of him for good and all, retir'd
her ſelf into a Convent; this madded him ſo, that
he threatned to fire the houſe; and ſhe, for fear he
ſhould be as good as his word, was fain to remove:
But finding that ſhe continu'd reſolute not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him, he contriv'd to ſteal her; of which having
ſome intimation, ſhe prevented him by going pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
out of Town, and having told no body of
her going but one particular friend, nor taken any
of her ſervants with her, her relations were in a
fright for her, and having not heard of her in ſeveral
days, they concluded <hi>Courtilz</hi> had carry'd her away,
as he had been heard to ſay he would do; ſo they
complain'd to the Court of Juſtice againſt him, and
upon the hearing of their Witneſſes they obtain'd an
Arreſt againſt him. Any man but <hi>Courtilz</hi> would
have prevented all this, for he being innocent had
nothing to fear; but whether he was otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
or thought it not worth his while, he wholly
neglected it, till at laſt he was fain to take Sanctuary at
my Fathers, and finding himſelf diſcover'd there, was
forc'd to remove from thence too. It happen'd juſt
at that time my Father had receiv'd a conſiderable
ſum of Money, about twenty thouſand Crowns:
Some Rogues having notice of all this, they dreſt
themſelves up like Pourſuivants, and pretending to
ſearch the houſe for <hi>Courtilz,</hi> they ſeiz'd upon my
Father, and clapping a Piſtol to his throat, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
where was his Money? which he, having no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to dye, was oblig'd to diſcover to them; with
which they loaded one of his own Horſes, and he
had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing them make their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
over the Foreſt, from one of the Turrets of
the Caſtle, where they had lockt up both him, and all
the Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57806:18"/>
This was a great loſs for a Gentleman of but
twenty thouſand Livres a year Eſtate, and eight Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
ſo not doubting but he was very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
I did not know whether I had beſt ſee him
or not, for my company being never very agreeable
to him, I thought now it might encreaſe his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but thinking alſo he might reflect upon me if I
was wanting in my Duty, I went to wait on him,
and was received by him not a jot better than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
for my Mother-in-Law ſuppoſing I was
come to dwell with them again, and leſt I ſhould
pretend to be one of the Family, forbid the Servants
giving my Horſes either Oats or Hay. My man
giving me an account of this, I ſent hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for ſome to
the Curate; and my Father happening to be in the
Stable, ſaw it all, without giving orders to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
Tho this did not at all agree with me, and I
was ready to burſt with anger, yet being reſolv'd to
go away the next morning, I took no notice of it,
but went up to my Chamber earlier than ordinary;
and as I was juſt going into Bed, up comes my Father,
and my Mother-in-Law, and askt me in a ſort of
rallying, if I was going to wait upon the Cardinal by
his order; as my Man it ſeems had ſaid among the
Servants. I plainly ſaw the bottom of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that 'twas only to ſtand fair with me, in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe I ſhould chance to meet with any thing, and
therefore anſwer'd very coldly, that it was true;
my Father told me he was very glad I was like to
come to preferment; and with that word my Mother-in-Law
invited me to ſtay, and told me I ſhould be
welcome, and hop'd, ſhe ſaid, that when I had made
my own Fortune, I would not be unmindful of my
Brothers: I anſwer'd her in the ſame tone of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that 'twas not yet a thing done; but if I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57806:18"/>
ſhould be ſo fortunate as perhaps I might, I ſhould
always return Good for Evil.</p>
            <p>This ſort of diſcourſe gave me light into her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and I dare ſay was the occaſion, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make excuſes for her behaviour to me, and
particularly for refuſing Hay to my Horſes; ſhe told
me 'twas becauſe the Groom did not know me, and
they had charg'd him ever ſince their late misfortune
to give none to Strangers; but ſhe would take care
to prevent it for the future. I knew well enough
what I thought of this; but diſcretion and reſpect
obliging me to conceal my reſentment, I told them
that it was but a ſmall matter, and not worth taking
notice of. My Father then began to enquire what
had become of me all this while, and gave me a
ſmall reprimand for never letting him hear from me,
and begun to talk to me a little like a Father.</p>
            <p>After a thouſand other queſtions, they left me to
go to Bed; and having told them I muſt go away
the next day, I found in the Morning a Breakfaſt
prepar'd as if there had been a Wedding. They ſent
two hours before day to all our Relations, that were
any thing near, with a ſort of a circular Letter, to
acquaint them of the occaſion of my going to
Court, and to invite them all to come and take
their leave of me: Away they come, ſome on Foot,
ſome on Horſeback; and I was ſmother'd with
Compliments from a matter of ten or twelve Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
as if I had been already ſome great Perſon,
and in a condition to make all their fortunes. To
deliver my ſelf from this Farce, which was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
to me, I begg'd my Father to permit me to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
for I had loſt too much time already; and the
Cardinal who expected People ſhould be punctual,
would perhaps think me long: That I had come two
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57806:19"/>
days Journey out of my way, on purpoſe to pay my
duty to him, but I hop'd he would not deſire me to
prejudice my ſelf. My Mother-in-Law, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at this Compliment, no ſooner heard it, but
ſhe goes her ſelf into the Kitchen, and never ſtirr'd
thence till Dinner was ſerv'd up.</p>
            <p>This which I ſaw at my Fathers, was but the
very ſame which I afterwards found to be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
at Court. Aſſoon as I was arriv'd there, and it
was known that I was the Cadet of <hi>Locates,</hi> every
one made their Compliments to me; and I was
ſtrangely ſurpriz'd to ſee thoſe People, whom I
ſhould have thought it honour enough to have
ſpoken to once a week, wait upon me to beg my
friendſhip. The Captain of the Guard to his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
to whom I had addreſt my ſelf, having told
him that I was in the Antichamber, I was order'd
to be call'd in: Who ſeeing that I was but a Beardleſs
Boy, and very ſhort too of my age, he turn'd to four
or five great Lords that were with him, and ſaid ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
St. Aunais <hi>ſurely has put a trick upon us: Why?
This is but a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>ſaid I, making a profound Reverence,</hi>
I know not what Mr. <hi>de St. Aunais</hi> may have inform'd
your Eminence, but if it was only that I took the King's
Lieutenant of <hi>Salſes,</hi> and his Mistriſs, I can aſſure you
'tis nothing but the Truth. Ay, but he has told us more
than that, <hi>reply'd the Cardinal:</hi> We have a long Story
here, how you prevented the Souldier that wou'd have kiſt
the Girl; and how you attackt him, and he fir'd his Piſtol
at you; notwithſtanding which, you drove him away and
brought off your Priſoners. 'Tis all very true, my Lord,
<hi>ſaid I,</hi> but theſe are but ſmall matters: I hope if I may
be ſo happy as to find an opportunity, I ſhall perform much
greater, for the Service of the King and of your Eminence.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57806:19"/>
He is a bold Lad, <hi>ſaid the Cardinal to the Lords again,</hi>
but he is but a Boy ſtill; and 'tis pitty to expoſe him ſo
young, and as it were to force nature. <hi>This diſcourſe
put me in great fear he would do nothing for me,
wherefore I return'd preſently,</hi> I am more capable, my
Lord, than you may think me, and your Eminence may
find me ſo, if you pleaſe to command me any thing for
your Service. <hi>He made me no anſwer, but ſpeaking
ſoftly to the Captain of his Guards, bad him enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
me with the Gentlemen, and to inform himſelf
who I was, and ſo retir'd into his Cloſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This both
ſurpriz'd and afflicted me; for I expected that I
ſhould no ſooner have appear'd before him, but
I ſhould have had ſome great matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Captain of the Guard not failing to do as he
was directed, and having given the Cardinal an
account that I was a Gentleman, after Dinner I was
call'd into the Cloſet, where his Eminence told me
he had, as a mark of his favour, reſolv'd to entertain
me in his Service; that I ſhould be wiſe and faithful,
and I ſhould have no cauſe to repent me. I made
him a low Reverence in token of my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſtill expecting ſome very conſiderable Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or Office to be beſtow'd upon me; but I was
ſurpriz'd to find all my preferment ſum'd up in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and that at laſt I ſhould have come ſo far to
be the Cardinals Footboy. I was not ſo much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of my paſſion, but that he perceiv'd it in my
countenance: <hi>Let not this trouble you,</hi> ſaid he, with a
ſweetneſs that reconcil'd all things, <hi>'Tis becauſe I would
have you always near me; time may be, I ſhall be perhaps
but too kind to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The obliging way with which he ſpoke this, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
all the diſcontent that, as I ſaid, appear'd in my
face, and having made him again a moſt profound
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57806:20"/>
reverence, I expected preſently to go and change my
figure, or at leaſt that ſome body ſhould be order'd
to take meaſure of me for my Cloaths. But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Pages told me, I muſt write to my
Father to ſend me four hundred Crowns for my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and Trimming, and Preſents that I muſt make,
and that nothing would be done before. I was in a
great confuſion at this, I knew well enough to how
little purpoſe 'twould be for me to write to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I was content to ſell my Horſes, but that
would not raiſe my Stock above fifty Piſtoles, which
was not half the Sum he talkt of: To ask my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I thought very improper, ſince they all thought
my fortune was made, and expected great things from
me. I ſlept not a wink that night for thinking what
method I ſhould take to get over this affair, I reſolv'd
at laſt to try Monſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> which was all the
hopes I had left; but having been diſorder'd all night,
'twas too late e're I got up to go to him till after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
And in the mean time to ſhow my ſelf aſſiduous,
I went to wait on the Cardinal, who no ſooner ſaw
me, but he askt me why I had not my Livery on? <hi>My
Lord,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>'tis truly for want of Money; and our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
tells me, I muſt bring him four hundred Crowns
firſt, and that then it ſhall be diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cht. What an exacting
Rogue is this,</hi> ſaid he, to thoſe that were about him,
ſhrinking up his ſhoulders, and turning to me, <hi>Go,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>and tell him from me, if he offers to take one Farthing of you,
I ſhall turn him out of doors immediately; and further, that
if it be not done by to morrow morning without fail, he
ſhould pleaſe to ſeek out a new Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may eaſily imagin I was very well pleas'd
with this errand, and knowing I was well backt, I
did not leave out a word of the meſſage, but told it
with all the advantage I could, for his mortification;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57806:20"/>
however he obſerv'd the order punctually, and I laid
out only ten or twelve Piſtoles to buy ſome little
neceſſaries which he gave me not: and this the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
not only paid me, but made them give me three
times that ſum for my reimburſement.</p>
            <p>Tho I was to be but a Page, yet I fail'd not to be
the Favourite, for his Eminence had none ſo agreeable
to him as my ſelf; he would have me do every
thing, and I to ſhow my ſenſe of his favour, was
conſtantly at his Elbow, ready to receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
at Table, 'twas I ſtill that ſerv'd him the
Wine, not for want of others readineſs, for they
envy'd me for it, but he would call me by my name,
as if there had been no body elſe there, to prevent
their diligence. When he went to Madam <hi>D' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guillon</hi>
'twas the ſame thing, there was no body but I
went with him, where he plac'd me in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
into which no body came, but if he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſpeak with any body, I was ſent to them, and
brought them in, and let them out, by a private
Stair-caſe, that 'twas impoſſible for any body to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them.</p>
            <p>I know 'twas reported he was in Love with that
Lady, who was his Niece, I do not ſay it was not
ſo, ſhe was handſome enough to tempt as great a
man as he; but this I am ſure of, that for my part I
ſhould have been tranſported to have had but the
eſteem of ſo fine a creature, tho I had been a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
my ſelf. And this I think my ſelf oblig'd to
ſay to undeceive poſterity, that he went to ſee her
many times upon other buſineſs than his diverſion,
where he lockt himſelf up with perſons that he could
ſee in no other place without ſuſpicion, eſpecially
Strangers, ſometimes diſguis'd like Monks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like other Eccleſiaſtics, and ſometimes like Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57806:21"/>
It fell out once, that after one of theſe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
he order'd me to take a Bag, I know not
what was in it, but 'twas very heavy, and to go
along the road to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> telling me at the entrance
into a Village called <hi>Sanois,</hi> I ſhould find a Capuchin
aſleep, with his Coul or Hood hanging down behind
him; that I ſhould ſay ne're a word to him, but put
the Bag into the Coul, and come away: I found
every thing juſt as he had told me, and executed his
orders punctually.</p>
            <p>But before he employ'd me in ſuch ſecret things
as theſe, he made tryal of me by a paſſage that was
very particular. He had a Man call'd <hi>Sauvé,</hi> whom
he us'd to employ about ſuch matters, and had ſent him
two or three times into <hi>Spain,</hi> to diſcover ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
that were carrying on there againſt his intereſt.
This man had a very handſome Wife, and being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by the Cardinal to try my fidelity, he ſets his
Wife to work, with whom he ſuffer'd me to uſe ſuch
liberty, that one might ſwear for him he was not
jealous. His Wife was at firſt ſight very free with
me, and the deſign being to entrap me, by the moſt
infallible ſnare in the world, eſpecially to a young
man, ſhe began to be pleaſanter than ordinary. But
having, by I know not what means, oblig'd her,
ſhe told me down-right the whole cheat, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
me to have a care; after this ſhe gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to her Husband juſt as I directed her, and the
Cardinal being inform'd from him (who to gain his
favour, told him ingeniouſly he had ſacrific'd his
Wife, and would not ſtick to ſacrifice himſelf for
his ſervice) he had from that time ſuch confidence in
me, that I was always employ'd in affairs of the
the greateſt conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57806:21"/>
A few days after this he order'd me to put off my
Livery, and go into the Horſe Market, to a certain
houſe which he directed me to; that I ſhould go up
four pair of ſtairs, and if I found a Croſs made with
Chalk on a Chamber Door I ſhould come down, and
ſtay below till <hi>Sauvé</hi> came to me. I found juſt as he
had ſaid, and having plac'd my ſelf at the Street
Door, with my Cloak thrown over my face, <hi>Sauvé</hi>
came to me, and askt me how it was? I told him I
had found that which his Eminence deſir'd; then he
askt me if I had not ſeen two men go out, one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
like a Prieſt, and the other with a ſhort Cloak
like an Abbot; I told him No: he bid me look out
ſharp, and if they ſhould appear, I ſhould walk along
before them, till I came to the Hoſpital <hi>de la Pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>é;</hi>
and if not, I ſhould ſtand Centinel there till he came
again. It was an hour and half before he came again,
but 'twas in good company when he did come, for
he brought a Squadron of the Guards with him, of
whom a Party beſet the houſe, and the reſt went up
ſtairs, where they found in the Chamber, the two
men deſcrib'd to me, who they took and carry'd to
the <hi>Baſtile:</hi> But there was but one of them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the other was let go, and I carry'd him the next
day ten thouſand Crowns in Gold, which was the
recompence they had promis'd him, for betraying
and ſelling his Companion.</p>
            <p>Finding my ſelf employ'd in ſuch ſecret affairs, I
heartily wiſht my ſelf a year or two older; for I
fancy'd the Cardinal would find me other buſineſs,
when I was a little too old for a Page, and I long'd to
be in the Wars, to which I had a particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the mean time my Father, and my Mother-in-law,
having inform'd themſelves that all my hopes
were ended in a Livery, were ſorry for thoſe little
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57806:22"/>
civilities they had done me; but this hindred me not
from thinking, if I could poſſible, to do ſomething
for my younger Brothers, who had need enough;
and to give them aſſurance of my good will, I wrote
to them all to give me notice, if any Benefice ſhould
preſent in their Country: but they ſent me word, that
I needed not to ſhow my ſelf ſo vain, for they knew
well enough what intereſt I had, and were content I
ſhould make uſe of it for whom I pleas'd.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have taken this as a great affront from any
body elſe, and ſo I did from them too; and the
Cardinal being pleas'd a little after that, to enquire
of me about my Family, I told him not only this
paſſage, but what uſage I had receiv'd when I was
but a Child; he was extreamly taken with all my
freedom, and finding he delighted to hear me relate
the little adventures of my life, I took occaſion to
tell him of the kindneſs I had receiv'd from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
magnifying the obligation I thought my ſelf
under to him as much as I could: He told me he
was glad to ſee me ſo grateful; but at the ſame time,
as I happen'd to ſpeak of the Meſſieurs <hi>de Marillac,</hi>
he askt me if they knew I was with him, and if I
had ſeen any of them lately? I told him No, but I
intended to wait on them with the firſt conveniency:
to which he anſwer'd, that I muſt not do ſo, if I
thought of continuing in his favour. I durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to ſo poſitive a command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and he perceiving
that I was not only ſurpriz'd, but aſtoniſht; <hi>At leaſt,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>if you ſhould meet with any of them, never open
your Lips of what I have ſaid to you; and be aſſur'd if
you ever ſhould, you have nothing more to hope for from
me.</hi> I told him, 'twas enough for me to know his
Pleaſure, and that I ſhould know neither Friend nor
Relation, when his Eminence's Service was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57806:22"/>
He was very well ſatisfy'd with my anſwer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
to employ me as freely as before; among the
reſt he ſent me one time with a great Bag full of Gold,
and order'd me to lay it under a broad Freeſtone, which
I ſhould find upon a heap of other Stones, a little
beyond <hi>Montfaucon,</hi> on the Road to <hi>St. Denis;</hi> and
withal I was not to come back the ſame way, that I
might not ſee, I ſuppoſe, who ſhould come to fetch
it: Another time I carried ſuch a like Cargo to
<hi>Noſtre Dame,</hi> to a Man whom he told me I ſhould
find leaning againſt a Tree, with his head on one
hand, and the other hand behind him, juſt for all the
world in ſuch a poſture, as <hi>Moliere</hi> acts the covetous
Phyſician; I was to put the Money into that hand
which he held behind him, but not to ſee his face at
all, and ſo to come my way; I thought there was more
myſtery in all this than there was occaſion for, and that
it was only to make proof of my Fidelity, or to render
his management of affairs more valuable for its ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
However it was, I ſpent two years in ſuch ſort of
buſineſſes, in which time there were many Plots at
Court to remove him from the Miniſtry, but all to
no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the mean time, having writ to the Curate as
well as to my Father, to inform me if any thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in their Country that I might beg for him,
there came now an Expreſs to me from him, to tell
me that a ſmall Abbey of about four thouſand Franks</hi>
per annum <hi>was become vacant, I immediately begg'd it
of the Cardinal, and he granted it me at the firſt word,
but wou'd needs know who it was, I begg'd it for.</hi>
My Lord, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> for our Curate, who taught me to read,
and to whom I told your Eminence I had ſo many obligations.
And why not for one of your Brothers, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I think you
told me you had ſeveral, and they needy enough? 'Tis true,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57806:23"/>
my Lord, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> but as Providence has done by me, I am
oblig'd to prefer my Gratitude before even my natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
thus your Eminence can judge, if after all the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I have to you, I ought not to ſerve you above all the
world. We ſhall ſee that, <hi>reply'd the Cardinal ſmiling,</hi>
and may chance to put you to the tryal ſooner than you
think of.</p>
            <p>I was juſt going to anſwer him again, when the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> came into the room, which made me
ſpoil my Compliment to help him to a Chair: He
made but a ſhort viſit, and the Cardinal waiting on
him to the Chamber-door, ſpy'd Monſieur <hi>De Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſt,</hi>
who was but an inconſiderable perſon then,
but one who we have ſeen ſince Captain of the <hi>Guards
du Corps,</hi> Governour of <hi>Calais,</hi> Duke, and Peer of
<hi>France:</hi> The Cardinal had a mortal averſion to him,
ſo that he was no ſooner ſtept back into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but he order'd me to call the Captain of his
Guard, whom he gave a ſtrict charge, at any rate to
rid him of that piece of Impertinence, and that he
ſhould order the Guards to deny him entrance: The
Captain of the Guard askt him if he ſhould turn him
out of the Anti-chamber? <hi>I don't ſay ſo,</hi> ſays the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<hi>but that you ſhould keep him out for the future.</hi>
This Order being known all over the houſe in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
every body turn'd their backs upon the poor
Gentleman, and were as ſhye of him as if he had
had the Plague: I know not whether he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
any thing, but he took no notice of it, and
ſtaid three long hours in the Antichamber. The
Cardinal, who had a mind to go out, ſent me to ſee
if he was there ſtill, and having told him that he
was, he choſe rather to ſtay in his Chamber, than
expoſe himſelf to his Compliment. The next day
<hi>Charroſt</hi> came to the door again, and offering to come
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57806:23"/>
in as uſual, the Guards thruſt him away; and he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſpeak with their Captain, the Captain order'd
them to tell him he was not within; he beſieg'd the
houſe thus two days, before he could ſee the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
but on the third day he put himſelf juſt in his
way, as he went to Maſs: The Guards routed him
again, and would let him ſtand quietly no where;
whereupon he leapt up into a Nich, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to ſet a Statue in; and when the Cardinal
came by, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>your Guards have refus'd
me entrance at your Gate; but if you ſhut me out at your
Door, I'll come in at the Window.</hi> The Cardinal could
not forbear laughing to ſee him ſtand ſo like an
Image; and finding him ſo very zealous to him, he
was ever after very kind to him. Monſieur <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſt</hi>
having thus gain'd admiſſion, continu'd to make
his court to him very diligently, without asking any
thing, tho he had need enough; the Cardinal was
oblig'd the more at that, for he was always pleas'd if
he ſaw himſelf lov'd without a principle of Intereſt;
and would do the more for any perſon for not being
importun'd. In the mean while an opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
ſo happily for him, that now was his time to
make uſe of the Cardinals favour: wherefore wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to find him in a good humour, he comes briskly
to him one day; <hi>If I durſt, my Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I would
ask your Eminence to help me to 200000 Crowns, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one farthing charge, either to the King or your ſelf.
How then, Charroſt?</hi> reply'd the Cardinal ſmiling. <hi>To
Marry me, my Lord, with your own hand,</hi> return'd <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſt;
I have found out a Fortune, and if your Eminence will
but ſpeak a word for me, my buſineſs is done. If it ſtops
only there,</hi> ſaid the Cardinal, <hi>you may reckon it done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
He threw himſelf at his feet, and embrac'd
his knees, in token of thankfulneſs; telling him, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57806:24"/>
all he deſir'd of him, was to ſend and demand <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle
Leſcalopier</hi> for him. The Cardinal did it,
to the aſtoniſhment of all people, who knew that he
never car'd to meddle in ſuch ſort of things. The
Relations of the Lady could not refuſe a man of his
Authority; ſo <hi>Charroſt</hi> having got ſuch a Fortune,
was in a condition to buy ſome conſiderable place,
and the Cardinal, who never ſuffer'd any body to be
near the King but ſuch as were his own Creatures,
and wholly at his ſervice, treated for him to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the <hi>Guards du Corps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I got my little Abbey, as I ſaid
before, and ſent the Bulls all Perfum'd to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
which wrought theſe two different effects,
that he was like to dye with Joy, and my Father
and Mother-in-law with ſorrow: They came all to
<hi>Paris,</hi> the Curate to give me thanks, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my kindneſs, and they to load me with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
reproaches: They askt me, If I was not aſham'd
to provide for ſtrangers, when my own Brothers had
ſo much occaſion; but at laſt, when they had vented
their paſſion, they began to talk at another rate, and
ſell to perſwading me to beg another Abbey of the
Cardinal; I told them it was not my fault they had
not this; but this was not the way at Court, for 'twas
not always a fit time to ask, and the certain way to
get nothing was to be always begging: That if the
Cardinal had been ſo kind to me, being but his Page,
I hop'd to be more in his favour, when I was in a
better condition to ſerve him; that I was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
natural affections, tho I had no great reaſon for it;
but that I ſhould always conſider what my honour
oblig'd me to, without calling to mind any of my juſt
reſentments; and with theſe ſort of hopes I appeas'd
them. I had no ſooner clear'd my hands of them,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57806:24"/>
but I had all our Province about me, thinking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I had gotten this Abbey for our Curate, I
could not but be very prodigal of my favours to
them all; ſome of them came from the very further
end of <hi>Berry,</hi> whom I had never ſeen nor heard of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me every hour with their Genealogy, making
it out very plainly, that they were my Couſins in
the third degree, and therefore hop'd I would uſe
my Intereſt to procure them ſome preferment. I made
ſhort with them, and told them, I had as good a
will to ſerve them as any man in the world, but it
was not in my power, which they might eaſily ſee,
for that I had got nothing yet for my Brothers, who
being in the firſt degree, 'twas but reaſonable ſhould
be firſt regarded; and that then I had ſome Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the ſecond Degree, who pretended to ſome
priviledge before them; that when I had preferr'd
them all, then they might depend upon me, that I
ſhould do them all the ſervice I could: They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
me well enough, and ſo getting rid of them
they left me in quiet.</p>
            <p>At laſt the happy hour was come, which I had ſo
long wiſht for, when I ſhould lay down the office of
a Page, with which I was never very well pleas'd;
the Cardinal gave me two hundred Piſtoles to buy
me Clothes, and told me I ſhould be one of his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.
I had hopes now he would have done ſome
great thing for me; however I did not continue long
idle, but went over into <hi>England,</hi> and into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
with Letters written in Cyphers; and thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
being in Arms, I was ſeiz'd by a Party of the
King of <hi>England</hi>'s Army, whom I was as much afraid
of, as of thoſe of the Parliaments: They immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſearcht me, but found nothing about me, for I
had put my Letters into my Poſt-horſes Saddle; the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57806:25"/>
Plates of which I had made on purpoſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of double Iron, contriv'd to hold the Letters in
the inſide, and unleſs they broke them, they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
They ranſackt the very Pummels of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
but to no purpoſe, for they could not find my
Packet: Then they askt me whence I came? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was going? and a thouſand impertinent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions;
and I anſwer'd them all as I found proper,
being prepar'd to meet with ſuch like interruptions;
telling them, I was a young Gentleman that was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling:
But this gave them the more ſuſpicion, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Equipage did not agree with the Character I
gave my ſelf, ſo they ſtopt me four or five days, at
which I was very uneaſie, for I carry'd along with me
(if I am not very much miſtaken) buſineſs of no
ſmall conſequence; ſuch as if I ſhould be diſcovered
with, I knew my fate: but what comforted me was,
that my Letters were perfect Magick, and written in
ſuch a character, that the Devil could not have read
them. They had no regular Alphabet, as is cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
in ſuch caſes, but the ſame ſtroke or daſh would
ſignify twenty different words, that it was impoſſible
but for them that had the key, to make any thing of
it: as for example, you muſt know it was agreed,
that one ſtroke ſhould ſignify an entire word of a
Line in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and to know which it was, the
figure of the Page was put under the ſtroke, and the
number of the line, and the number of the word in
the line, and to make it the plainer, the mark or
ſtroke was to be the firſt letter of the word. As to
explain it; ſuppoſe the word was <hi>Have,</hi> and that this
word was to be found in the 10th Page of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
the 10th line, the 5th word in the line, the cypher

This being ſo contriv'd, I leave any one to judge,
if 'twas poſſible, without conjuring, to have found
out my Errand, and yet I trembled every joynt of
me; for I knew if they found out my Letters, the
more difficulty they had in diſcovering the Contents,
the worſe I might expect to be handled by them.
But it being my good fortune not only to ſecure my
Packet, but alſo that they believ'd me too young to
be capable of ſuch ſort of Negotiations, they let me
go, and I deliver'd my diſpatches, and return'd ſafe
with an anſwer. I was very well paid for this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
for I had an order to the <hi>Financier</hi> for two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns, and one of the Pay-maſters demanding
a conſideration of me for prompt payment, was turn'd
out of his place upon my complaint to the Cardinal.
I know not whether the Genius of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Subject to take up Arms on every light occaſion, or
this Voyage of mine wrought the effects that follow'd,
but thoſe three Kingdoms, who, as I ſaid, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
before, immediately upon this broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
confuſion, inſomuch that the King of <hi>England,</hi>
who had given us no great marks of his good will in
ſeveral caſes, found his hands ſo full at home, that
there was no great fear of his being troubleſom to
us.</p>
            <p>And what makes me think we had a deeper hand
in this affair than others, is ſomething that happen'd
to me three months after my return; being one
morning, as I ſeldom miſt, at the Cardinals <hi>Leve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
he whiſper'd me, and bid me go to the <hi>Fauxbourg St.
Marceau,</hi> over againſt the Conduit, to the ſign of a
<hi>Woman without a Head,</hi> and to go up two pair of
ſtairs, where I ſhould find a man lying on a Bed
with yellow Curtains, whom I ſhould order to be at
Madam <hi>D' Eguillons,</hi> at Eleven a Clock at night
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57806:26"/>
without fail. I deliver'd my meſſage immediately,
and being not forbidden to ſee this mans face, as in
other caſes, I call'd to mind that I had ſeen him in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and I believe he knew me too, for I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
that he lookt earneſtly at me, as if he would
have recollected who I was; we neither of us ſaid
any thing of what we thought, only that he told me
he would not fail the appointment. At the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
I was order'd to ſtay for him at the door, to
introduce him into the Cardinals Cloſet; he came
diſguis'd like one that crys Wafers in the Streets, and
I, hearing a man cry Wafers, was far enough from
imagining that 'twas he; but he knowing me, and
diſcovering himſelf, I brought him to the Cardinal,
with whom he was ſhut up till four a clock the next
morning; all the Cardinals men had orders to go
home, which gave further occaſion to the talk that
was made of him, and of his Neice Madam <hi>D. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guillon;</hi>
no body imagining he had any buſineſs
to keep him there all night, but to lye with her; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
they had taken out the Keys, that they might
go out when they pleas'd, and this made the Ladys
Servants be as forward as any in the report: I don't
ſay this to affirm that there was no privacies between
them, but to ſhew, as I ſaid, that all the times he
ſtaid there were not the effects of an Amour.</p>
            <p>The conference being over, my Wafer-merchant
comes out of the Cloſet, at the door whereof I
had waited by the Cardinals order; his Eminence
made me lend him my Cloak, for 'twas no time of
night to cry Wafers, and order'd me at the ſame
time to go with him two Streets on his way. Two
days after he call'd me to him again, and bid me go
to Monſieur <hi>de Bullion,</hi> Superintendant of the <hi>Finances,</hi>
to order him from him to deliver me that parcel
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57806:26"/>
which he had made up, and then to carry it into the
<hi>Rue de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a Huchette,</hi> to the ſame perſon I have been
mentioning, whom I ſhould find at his Lodgings, at
the Sign of the <hi>Sow and Pigs,</hi> at the further end of
the Court, up one pair of ſtairs; I found the parcel
ready, but it was ſo heavy that it had more need of
a Cart to carry it, which Mr. <hi>de Bullion</hi> knowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had provided one, and having put it into the
Cart, he gave me a Note that contain'd the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of what was in it; telling me I muſt take that,
and give it to the perſon I was to go to. Being come
to the <hi>Sow and Pigs,</hi> I found my Gentleman walking
up and down the Chamber, and having given him
the Note, and told him the Goods were at the door,
he lookt upon the Bill and gave it me again, telling
me I was miſtaken, that I was to go to ſome
other perſon, for it did not belong to him. I told
him that I was not miſtaken, for he was ſenſible
that I knew him, and that my order was for him;
but he throwing away with a ſort of diſcontent,
walks about the Chamber again, and at laſt ſaid to
me, <hi>Sir, It is not for me, and you have no more to do but
to return with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had taken a great deal of pains to perſwade
him to receive it, but found 'twas all to no purpoſe,
I e'en took his counſel, and carry'd it back to M. <hi>de
Bullion,</hi> and ſo went to give an account to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
he askt me if I had the Note about me, I
told him I had, which he looking upon, it put him
into a violent paſſion at <hi>Bullion,</hi> ſaying, he would
teach him another time to obſerve his orders; and
ſending for him at the ſame time, askt him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why he ſent but five hundred thouſand Franks,
when his order was for ſix hundred thouſand: <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>
reply'd, that he underſtood his Emine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57806:27"/>
told him, but two days ago, that they ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
that affair to get it as cheap as they could; that
he did not queſtion but the other would have been
content with what he ſent him, but ſeeing he was
not, he would go and ſend him the reſt.</p>
            <p>By what I could underſtand of this, for I was
preſent at their diſcourſe, it ſeem'd to me, that Mr.
<hi>de Bullion</hi> had a mind to put a hundred thouſand
Franks in his own Pocket, tho he pretended only
good husbandry for the public: in the mean time,
while the other hundred thouſand Franks was telling,
his Eminence ſent me to find out the man again, to
tell him he ſhould have content, and that 'twas only
the fault of the Superintendant; and order'd me to
acquaint him, that I had ſeen him reprove <hi>de Bullion</hi>
for it. I found him making up his Baggage, as if he
was to be gone, and ſeeming ſurpriz'd to ſee me, he
ſtept up to me, and askt me, if I had any thing to
ſay to him; I told him my buſineſs, at which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indifferent. <hi>There is no Faith in man,</hi> ſaid he, with
a ſurly ſort of tone, <hi>and I cannot underſtand it, that
after having ſo poſitive a promiſe, it ſhould be forgotten in
two days.</hi> I went back immediately to Mr. <hi>de Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and fetching the ſix hundred thouſand Franks, I
brought them all to him, and return'd to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
who was very uneaſie till he knew what was
done in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Tho this ſort of employment was not my ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I had much rather have been in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
yet having ſo much the favour of my Maſter, it
was the pleaſanter to me. Having one time ask'd
me if I had yet ſeen Mr. <hi>de Marillac,</hi> whoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was now in great favour, for he was not only
made a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> but had marry'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Queen Mothers; I anſwer'd, that I
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57806:27"/>
remembred better than ſo, what his Eminence had
commanded me; and that I had already told him, I
ſhould know no Relations when his Service was the
queſtion, and that my greateſt grief was, that I could
give him no better proof of it yet. He told me with
a voice that ſeem'd as if he were pleas'd, that it was
well enough; and indeed if he had not been very
confident of my fidelity, he would certainly never
have truſted me in a thing of ſuch a nature, as he
did about a month after. In which, to diſcover
what temper he was of, 'twill be neceſſary to look
back a little to the beginning of the ſtory.</p>
            <p>The King was of a very mild and eaſy diſpoſition,
came to the Crown very young, and left the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all things to the Queen Mother, a Princeſs
of a vaſt ambition, but not belov'd by the <hi>French;</hi>
not only from a natural averſion as ſhe was an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
but alſo becauſe ſhe made a Favourite of one of
that Nation, whoſe Merit was as mean as his Birth:
As Governments are ſupported by fear ſometimes,
as well as by other methods, ſo this man had made
himſelf a terror, even to the Princes of the Blood;
and his Wife (which was more intollerable than
t'other) was come to that degree of Inſolence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
on the Queens Favour, whom ſhe entirely
manag'd, that ſhe trampled all the world, as it were,
under her feet. It being however neceſſary for her
to make ſome Creatures of her own, to reſiſt ſo
many Enemies, the Queen Mother had gain'd ſome
already, and among them the two Brothers <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi>
of whom one was a Stateſman, the other a
Souldier, and both very honeſt Gentlemen, and
worthy of the great Places they enjoy'd; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all her forecaſt, the number of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
party was ſo great, that ſhe could not ſave her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57806:28"/>
Favourite from their hands. <hi>De Luines,</hi> whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
could not bear the inſolence of this <hi>Italian,</hi>
inſinuated to the King, that his Mother rendred him
contemptible to the people, leaving the Government
to be manag'd by Strangers. It is not certainly
known, whether he accus'd her of Incontinence or
not, and of making away the King his Father, but
however it was, he knew well enough how to
work upon the King, into whoſe favour he had
wrought himſelf, by gratifying him in his little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and diverting him in ſuch manner as he found
moſt ſuitable to his inclination; he got a private
order, to find out ſome body to kill this Favourite,
which was accordingly executed by <hi>Vitri,</hi> Captain of
the <hi>Guards du Corps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence forward <hi>de Luines</hi> endeavour'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all the advantages of his Authority with the
King to the prejudice of the Queen Mother; but as
his ſhoulders were too weak for ſuch a burthen, and
on the other hand the Queens Party being jealous of
his Miniſtry, and united againſt him, he was forc'd
to yield to the ſtrongeſt ſide. Thoſe who were in
her intereſts, and had abſconded for fear they ſhould
fall in the ſame diſgrace with her Favourite, were
immediately recall'd to Court, and as the Meſſieurs
<hi>de Marillac</hi> were the chief of theſe, ſo they had the
greateſt marks of her reſpect; he of the long Robe
aim'd at no leſs than the Miniſtry, and ſeem'd ſo well
qualify'd for it, that all people thought he deſerv'd
it: but the Queen Mother having taken into her
ſervice the Biſhop of <hi>Luçon,</hi> afterwards Cardinal <hi>de
Richelieu,</hi> this Genius did ſo in all things excel Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Marillac,</hi> and ſhone with ſuch luſtre, that the
other was quite obſcur'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57806:28"/>
The greater <hi>Marillac</hi>'s ambition was, the more
impatience he ſhew'd at the advancement of <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
whoſe deſigns were at leaſt as great as his; and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
being as ſubject to jealouſy as love, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a hatred ſo inveterate, that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
one another; and the death of <hi>Luines</hi> making
way for a more unlimited Miniſtry, very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt
it: But <hi>Richelieu</hi> ſoon got above, not him
only, but even the Queen Mother her ſelf. This
Princeſs reſented it extremely, and muſter'd up all
her Friends to joyn with her in pulling down this
New Miniſter, before he was ſettled too faſt. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Marillac</hi> and his Brother, having more reaſon
than any body to deſire his fall, entirely embarkt in
the deſign with the Queen; they laid an infinite
number of plots againſt him, and any thing, but ſuch
a Genius as his, muſt have ſunk under the power
of ſo many Enemies; but as he never willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
an injury, ſo as ſoon as he had ſettled himſelf
in his new Authority, he ſet himſelf to ſuppreſs
every one whom he had the leaſt reaſon to fear; and
not content to have forc'd the Queen Mother, who
had been his Benefactreſs, to fly the Kingdom, he
reſolv'd the deſtruction of the two <hi>Marillac</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the reaſon of his asking me ſo often, if I
had ſeen them; but to make an effectual proof of my
fidelity, and withal to take off the</hi> odium <hi>from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of apprehending the Mareſchal, who was a man
generally belov'd; he ſaid to me one day,</hi> You have
often aſſur'd me, that you would know no Relations, nor
Friends, when my Service requir'd it, I ſhall now put you to
the tryal. Here is an Order, <hi>ſaid he, giving me a Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi>
to apprehend the Mareſchal <hi>de Marillac;</hi> You ſee I
am very willing you ſhould know what it is, go and carry it
as directed, and remember, my Confidence in you merits very
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57806:29"/>
well your Fidelity to me. <hi>This I'll aſſure you extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplext me, and taking it,</hi> My Lord, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> if
your Eminence would be content with this proof of my fidelity,
that I know how to keep your ſecrets, I ſhould have been
very much oblig'd to you. I do not refuſe to obey you in this,
but I beg you to conſider, that if you ſhould employ another in
ſuch a Meſſage as this, againſt one of my neareſt Relations,
I ſhould not be leſs oblig'd to your Eminence. Go, I tell
you, <hi>return'd the Cardinal,</hi> and take heed I don't do as
you deſire me.</p>
            <p>I had nothing left me but to obey after ſo ſevere
a command, tho I never got to Horſeback with ſo
much regret, and was often tempted to go and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
Monſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> who was at <hi>Paris,</hi> of the
misfortune that was coming upon the Mareſchal his
Brother. I fancy'd ſometimes the Cardinal, who
was always ſo very ſecret in his affairs, had put this
into my hands on purpoſe to make me run away;
but at laſt my duty carry'd it againſt all the obligations
I had to others, and I made ſuch haſte to ſhow my
zeal for my Maſter, that I deliver'd my Packet ſix
hours before they imagin'd I could be there.</p>
            <p>The Impriſonment of this great man made noiſe
enough; every one accus'd the Cardinal of cruelty
and injuſtice, ſo that daring not yet to bring things to
the laſt extremity, he ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the courſe of Juſtice for
a time, which was diſpos'd to do any thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd.
And I, after I had thus punctually obey'd
him, thought he would have been generous enough
to permit me to interceed for him, and the more too,
becauſe what I ſhould ask of him would but ſhow
him that I had a principle of honour, more than in
hopes to effect any thing, where there was ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
an Accuſer; but I had no ſooner diſcover'd my
intention, but I plainly ſaw, that great men are not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57806:29"/>
without their failings. He told me, all in a paſſion,
that he was glad with all his heart, that one of his
own Domeſticks was againſt him, and withal caſt
ſuch a look at me, as made me tremble from head
to foot; and I may ſay I was as much afraid, as if I
had been in the Trenches, or in a ſet Battle.</p>
            <p>I durſt not come near him any more that day, but
attending next morning at his Levee, he made as if
he did not ſee me, and ſo took no notice of me at all:
As I had enemies enough in the houſe, my diſgrace was
preſently publiſht, eſpecially becauſe one or other of
them heard my Compliment, and the Cardinals an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
The Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> who was an enemy to
the Cardinal, and had a mind to ſerve him a trick,
made this an opportunity of offering to entertain me
in his ſervice; but tho he was a Prince of the Blood,
and propos'd to me great advantages, I return'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That I was too much oblig'd to the Cardinal,
to think of changing my Maſter. Another perhaps
would have acquainted his Eminence of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal;
indeed he could not endure to have any thing
hid from him, eſpecially where his ſervice was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
but conſidering the terms I ſtood in with him,
he might think, I fancy'd, that I did it to ingratiate
my ſelf again, ſo I never troubled his head with it.</p>
            <p>La Ferté, <hi>the Father of him whom we have ſince
ſeen Mareſchal of</hi> France, <hi>belong'd to this Count, but
was a very treacherous Servant to his Maſter; for he
was a perfect Spy upon him for the Cardinal; and
having diſcover'd, I know not how, that I had been
ſpoken to, the Cardinal heard of it from him, and
from that time reckon'd me a Traytor; and looking
on me ſtill with an evil eye, he askt me one day if I
had nothing to acquaint him of? and I anſwer'd him
No, that he had lockt up my mouth by the anſwer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57806:30"/>
he had given me.</hi> Have not I lockt up your heart too,
<hi>reply'd he,</hi> ſince that, and have you not had a mind to be
reveng'd of me? Of you, my Lord! <hi>ſaid I, ſurpriz'd
with his words (for I ſaw by his air and diſcourſe,
that he had ſomething extraordinary that mov'd
him)</hi> How is it poſſible for ſuch a thought to enter into my
head? You, who have been ſuch a Maſter, and who has
made me what I am. I know all that well enough, <hi>reply'd he;</hi>
but in ſhort what buſineſs have you with the Count <hi>de
Soiſſons?</hi> and what are you two plotting together? <hi>I ſaw
by theſe words, I was betraid, and that nothing but
telling the truth could ſave me.</hi> My Lord, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> if
I did not give you an account of that, it was not to make a
ſecret of it; but your Eminence having chid me, I thought
'twas enongh to do my duty, without making my court to you
from the merit of my anſwer to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons;</hi> he
ſent to me indeed to entertain me in his ſervice; but if
thoſe who told your Emin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce that ſtory, had alſo told you
what return I made, 'twould have been ſo much to my
advantage, as would effectually have re-eſtabliſht me in
your favour. I know all, <hi>ſays the Cardinal, to me
haſtily, to terrify me,</hi> and if you would have me to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
you, you muſt confeſs the whole matter freely. I ask
no Pardon, my Lord, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> but to do me Juſtice only. I
told him that I had too good a Maſter to think of changing
him, and I will always ſay ſo, as long as your Eminence will
pleaſe to accept of my ſervice. Then you have nothing elſe
to ſay, <hi>return'd the Cardinal very ſeriouſly;</hi> Well,
take heed, you will repent it before it be long.</p>
            <p>I ſaid to him all that an innocent man could ſay;
but as he ſtill doubted the truth of it, he continu'd
eight whole days without taking any notice of me;
in which time he employ'd <hi>La Fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>é</hi> to diſcover how
it was. <hi>La Ferté</hi> did all he could, but underſtanding
'twas one <hi>Mezieres</hi> had ſpoke to me, who was a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57806:30"/>
man very faithful to his Maſter, and from whom he
had no hopes to learn the ſecret; he try'd if he could
pump it out of the Prince himſelf; he told him that
I was a gallant Fellow, and behav'd my ſelf ſo at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi>
and had been very faithful ever ſince I belong'd
to the Cardinal, but that the Cardinal had us'd me
very ill, and I had reaſon for ſome reſentment; that
this was the time for him to gain over ſuch a man
into his ſervice, who was worth having, and if he
pleas'd he would attempt it. The Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi>
who was a man without artifice or diſguiſe, told him
'twould be in vain, that <hi>Mezieres</hi> had ſpoke to me
already, but there was nothing to be done with me.</p>
            <p>This reſtor'd me to the Cardinals good opinion,
but not to any capacity to relieve Mr. <hi>de Marillac;</hi>
on the other hand the Cardinal was reſolv'd to cut
him off, the more to deſpight the Queen Mother,
who was always forming Parties againſt him; and
whereas the pretences on which he apprehended him
were too weak, he came upon him for falſe Muſters,
a fault that every Captain in the Army is more or
leſs guilty of. And indeed what General can be ſafe,
if he is anſwerable for all the actions of his Subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns?
'Twas on ſuch a ſlight matter as this, that the
Cardinal begun the ruine of ſo great a perſon; and
having gotten a Court Martial of his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they queſtion'd him on a thouſand trifling ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that as a very worthy Gentleman ſaid, if they
had been all true, were not crimes ſufficient to have
whipt a Page, and he anſwer'd them Article by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
ſo readily, and ſo directly, as puzzled all his
Judges: But the Cardinal, who ſaw them wavering,
ſending them word they ſhould take heed what they
did, the fear they had upon them of his diſpleaſure,
made them paſs the ſentence he deſired, for they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57806:31"/>
condemn'd him to have his Head cut off; which was
executed the ſame Afternoon, in the <hi>Placé de Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves.</hi>
Knowing the nicety of his humour, I askt his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
if he would give me leave to put my ſelf into
Mourning; he told me I might do what I would,
which I underſtood too well to venture upon it.</p>
            <p>A month or two after this, a match was propos'd
to me, which ſeem'd to be much for my intereſt;
the Cardinal alſo was very much for it, but not for
any reaſon he ſaw in the thing, ſo much as for the
averſion he had to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons;</hi> and the
Lady was Niece, and Heir, to the Baron <hi>de Coupet,</hi> a
ſworn Enemy to that Family. Indeed that Prince,
who carry'd it very high, had ſent the Captain of his
Guards one day to abuſe a Baron in his own houſe, on
pretence that he had ſpoken diſhonourably of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lady whom he had a reſpect for: This occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
a great deal of diſturbance, all the Gentry who
thought themſelves toucht in ſuch an affront to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quality, were got together, an account of it
being ſent to them by the Baron <hi>de Coupet,</hi> and they
all agreed that his Dignity ſecur'd him from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment;
but yet they reſolv'd that from that time
forward they would univerſally ſlight him, and not
one of them come into his company; and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was that ſhould break this agreement ſhould
not be lookt upon as a perſon of honour. This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was exactly obſerv'd, and the Prince, who had
ſome friends, and ſome creatures, found himſelf at
once abandon'd by them all; he did all he could to
regain the good opinion of the Nobility, but finding
that not one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſu'd for the Command of the Army, and the Enemy
being at that time advanc'd as far as <hi>Corbie,</hi> the <hi>Ban</hi>

be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fit occaſion for his purpoſe. He was prodigious
extravagant, keeping twelve Tables of five and
twenty Diſhes for all come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, careſſing every body,
offering Money to ſeveral, and ſending it to others,
whom he believ'd in want: By which means he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Friendſhip of moſt of them. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Friends of the Baron <hi>de Coupet</hi> would never
forgive him, and as they breath'd out nothing but
revenge, or at leaſt pretended it, they caſt their eyes
upon me, in the propoſal of this Marriage, hoping
by that means to be protected by the Cardinal;
they obtain'd it at firſt word, and the Cardinal told
me I could not do better: I was ſurpriz'd at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I that had neither Eſtate nor Employment, at
leaſt conſiderable enough to expect a fortune, and at
the ſame time miſtruſting ſomething in the bottom;
the ſad example of my Father made me reſolve to go
fair and ſoftly: In the mean time I ſaw the young
Lady, who was really very agreeable, but a little too
free, for the very ſecond time I ſaw her, ſhe was
pleas'd to tell me, that being already as it were Man
and Wife, if ſhe did give me thoſe little liberties I
might deſire, I ſhould not conſtrue it to her prejudice:
This was enough for me, I could underſtand the reſt,
and theſe words made me examine her more nearly,
and I fancy'd ſhe lookt a little big, upon which I grew
cold in my Courtſhip all of a ſudden. It ſeems I
was not deceiv'd, for it was even ſo; and as her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were much in the right to get her a Husband
with all ſpeed, they took it mighty ill that I ſhould
draw back, inſomuch that the Baron <hi>de Coupet</hi>
thought himſelf ſo much affronted, as to fight me;
and to ruine me effectually, they poſſeſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that 'twas the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> that had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
me from this match, and that I had taken
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57806:32"/>
his part ſo violently, that they believ'd I had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd
with their Kinſman upon that account, for
that neither of us were to be found. They might
well tell him this circumſtance, for 'twas themſelves
who ſet us together by the ears. Nevertheleſs the
Cardinal believing every word of the ſtory, had
privately reſolv'd my ruine, which appear'd plainly
enough, for at my return he order'd me to be clapt up
in Priſon, without hearing me ſpeak for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I apply'd my ſelf to <hi>La Houdiniere,</hi> the Captain of
his Guards, who was my Friend, and having ſent to
beg him to come and ſee me, I told him I was a loſt
man, unleſs he would ſpeak for me; that my Enemies
muſt have prejudic'd the Cardinal againſt me, or he
could never have been brought to uſe ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with a man he had been pleas'd to truſt in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conſiderable affairs; one of his Domeſticks, and
one who could never have ſo offended him, as to be
deny'd the liberty to vindicate himſelf. I begg'd him
to ask the Cardinal what it was I ſtood charg'd
with, and if I was guilty, he ſhould need no Judges
to give ſentence upon me; that my own hand ſhould
do the Office of the Executioner, and that I could
not outlive the loſs of his preſence and favour. <hi>La
Houdiniere</hi> promis'd me all that I deſir'd, and coming
to ſee me again the next day, he told me he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he had nothing but bad news to bring me; That
the Cardinal was in ſuch a rage at me, that he ſwore
he would have my throat cut; that he had nouriſht
a Serpent in his boſom; that I kept correſpondence
with the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whoſe inſtigation I had
not only refus'd to marry the Niece of the Baron <hi>de
Coupet,</hi> but had fought with the ſaid Baron to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Count. I could not forbear ſmiling at this
Accuſation, and after having told him that great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57806:32"/>
men were miſtaken ſometimes as well as others, I
deſir'd him to tell the Cardinal from me, that I
would not only be contented to have my throat cut,
if it could be prov'd, I had either ſeen, or heard from
the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> ſince the buſineſs he knew of,
but to be broken alive upon the Wheel; That I
would not indeed marry the Baron <hi>de Coupet</hi>'s Niece,
that is, I would not marry a Maid with Child, and
none of my own getting neither; that ſhe was at
leaſt four months gone, and that his Eminence did
not uſe to require thoſe ſort of baſeneſſes from his
Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Houdiniere</hi> carry'd this ſtory word for word to
the Cardinal, and he was perfectly aſtoniſht when
he underſtood this creature was with Child; and
fixing his Eyes upon him, without ſpeaking a word
for a good while, at laſt he cry'd out, <hi>Is it poſſible,</hi> La
Houdiniere, <hi>that I ſhould be taken for a Fool? and that
theſe little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtarts ſhould have the Impudence to impoſe
upon me? La Houdiniere</hi> anſwer'd, that ever ſince he
had known me, he had obſerv'd me to be cautious
enough, and ſince I had affirm'd it, there muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be ſomething in it, but that he had thought of
a way for his Eminence to find out the truth, which
was either to ſend for the Girl before him, or to
order a Midwife to be ſent to ſearch her. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
laught at this propoſal, but at the ſame time
ſending for the Baron <hi>de Coupet,</hi> who was at liberty,
tho I was in Priſon; he told him he ſhould have
a care of telling him a lye; that he was upon his life;
that the queſtion was, whether his Niece was with
Child or not? whether it was the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi>
who had broken off the Match? and whether he had
any way been the occaſion of our fighting? Such a
queſtion as this perplext the poor Baron, who would
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57806:33"/>
fain have avoided giving a direct anſwer; but the
Cardinal beginning to thunder at him again, he threw
himſelf at his feet, and begg'd his pardon; upon
which the Cardinal ſent him immediately to Priſon,
and ſent for me out. Aſſoon as I came into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
he gave me his hand to kiſs, telling me he
would repair the injury he had done me. I kiſt it
very reſpectfully, and ſubmiſſively thankt him for
his goodneſs to me, begging him to believe, that I
was wholly incapable of Treaſon againſt him.</p>
            <p>Being thus in favour again, the Cardinal bad me
a few days after go and liquor my Boots, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for a little Journey he had for me: the deſign was
to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> whether Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> was fled;
ſhe had pretended to manage the Queen Regent, and
had made a thouſand Plots in the State, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
had a ſuſpicion, that ſhe ſtill correſponded with
ſome of the Grandees, and I was inſtructed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it. In the mean time, that it might not be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
I was dreſt up like a <hi>Capuchin;</hi> and to make
a little Brother, that was to be my Companion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it was really ſo, I wore the habit ſeveral
days before I went; and beſides, I was admitted to
lodge at the Convent of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> in the <hi>Rue St.
Hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if I had been of ſome Convent in the
Country. The Superior receiv'd me as one of the
Religious, being before inſtructed about it by Father
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Cardinals Favourite; and I receiv'd alſo
my orders from the ſame Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was a
man that minded other buſineſs ſometimes than tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Beads. Thus I parted for <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> purely
from a principle of Paſſive Obedience, but otherwiſe
very unfit to take ſo long a Journey on foot; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'twas a caſe of neceſſity, for fear I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the young Monk how little I was of a <hi>Capuchin.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57806:33"/>
But being not able to bear ſuch fatigues, nor us'd to
beg my ſubſiſtance for God's ſake, I curſt this Voyage
a thouſand times, and wiſht as often that I had not
been ſo far engag'd in the intrigue; I arriv'd how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
after fifteen days travel, and tho 'twas thought
an ill thing in the Convent, I lay a bed two whole
days after it, for I was all cut and gall'd with thoſe
hard Beds upon the Road, having been always us'd
to other ſort of Lodging; and to compleat my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
I was call'd upon to officiate at the Church,
ſo that I thought the Cardinal had ſent me into <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this time I ſcrap'd acquaintance with ſome
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> that us'd to come to our Convent, and
making as if I did not know a certain man I ſaw of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in the Cloiſter, I askt them who it was, they
told me it was the Marqueſs <hi>de Laicques,</hi> who was the
very man I wanted. He had been Madam <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſe</hi>'s
humble Servant a great many years, but at laſt,
ſhe being reſolv'd to take him upon honour, ſhe had
now exchang'd the ceremony of a Gallant, for the
familiarity of a Husband, and treated him as the late
Mr. <hi>de Chevreuſe.</hi> I was inſtructed in all this at <hi>Paris,</hi>
and that this Gentleman was the Arch-Dukes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
but the Cardinals deſign was to draw him
off from the intereſts of the Archduke, or if that
fail'd, I was to order it ſo, that I might inform the
Archduke, and make him jealous that his Favourite
held correſpondence with the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Laicques,</hi> who I long'd to be talking with, gave
me a very fair opportunity, by coming directly up
to me, and asking me ſeveral things concerning the
Convent; I fail'd not to lay hold of the occaſion, I
entertain'd him with diſcourſe, and making as if I
ſpoke broken <hi>French,</hi> I made my excuſe that my
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57806:34"/>
Mother was a <hi>Walloon,</hi> and that my Father had had
ſeveral misfortunes, and receiv'd ſome wrongs, and
the like; he was very much pleas'd with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and came very often into our Convent to
ſee me; till now, I durſt not diſcover my ſelf not to
be a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> but he prevented me of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
by asking me if I would venture to carry ſome
Letters of conſequence into <hi>France?</hi> I told him I
ſhould be very glad to ſerve him, but in this caſe the
danger was ſo great I durſt not; he did what he
could to encourage me, but I always excus'd my ſelf,
that he might be the more eager, and withal to avoid
all manner of ſuſpicion; he preſt me again, telling
me I ſhould do a ſervice to my Country, for which
I had expreſt ſo much inclination, that is to ſay on
account of my Mother, who I had told them was a
<hi>Fleming.</hi> I ſtill made excuſes, and to colour them
the more, told him, that if I ſhould promiſe him to
do it, it was not in my power, being under the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of Governours, and beſides what pretenſions
could I make for going into <hi>France;</hi> which they all
knew I hated. This was the very argument he
watcht for; he told me then, if that was all the
difficulty, they would remove it without giving me
any trouble, that I had nothing to do but to give
them my word, and he would take care of the reſt.</p>
            <p>It was a long time before I could be perſwaded,
and ſeeming then to be prevail'd with by his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
they ſpoke to the Superior, who being alſo
ſollicited by the Archduke himſelf, could not refuſe
it; it was reſolv'd then, that I ſhould pretend to go
and drink the Waters at <hi>Forges,</hi> and that I ſhould
ſend notice to the perſons they would write to, to
fetch their Letters there; in the mean time they
gave me a Brother of the Habit to go with me, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57806:34"/>
away we went to <hi>Forges,</hi> when we came about half
way thither, I met a Courier which I had writ to
the Cardinal to ſend me, to whom I deliver'd the
Pacquet I receiv'd from <hi>de Laicques.</hi> The Cardinal
after he had taken an account of the contents, ſeal'd
it up again very exactly, return'd it to me, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to give notice to the perſon for whom
it was directed, that I was come; this was one <hi>la
Pierre</hi> an Advocate, who liv'd in a blind Alley near
the <hi>Place Maubert.</hi> He left <hi>Paris</hi> alſo at the ſame
time to meet me there, but before I ſaw him, I had
a man ready to watch him, that we might know
whither he went. He miſtruſting nothing, at his
return to <hi>Paris,</hi> went directly to the Count <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi>
Grand Maſter of the Wardrobe, which was
ſufficient to make us conclude, that the Pacquet was
for him; and what was more, it was alſo diſcover'd,
that this <hi>la Pierre,</hi> had been one of his Domeſticks;
but we needed none of theſe remote circumſtances,
for the Count <hi>de Chalais</hi> wrote an anſwer himſelf,
which I having ſent to the Cardinal, his Eminence
knew it immediately to be his own hand; he was
very much ſurpriz'd at the contents, where they talkt
of taking off the King, marrying the Queen to the
Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and for himſelf, his death ſhould
finiſh the Tragedy, to make way for the ſucceſs of
the Conſpiracy. This was but too much to bring
<hi>Chalais</hi> to the Block, and the King would have had
him apprehended immediately, but the Cardinal
being willing to diſcover all the Conſpirators, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with the King to delay it, on condition they
ſhould keep a ſtrict eye upon him, leſt he ſhould
get away: In the mean time, to draw him from
<hi>Paris,</hi> they made a pretence to take a progreſs into
<hi>Bretagne,</hi> and I return'd with my diſpatches to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57806:35"/>
The Count <hi>de Chalais,</hi> who was far enough
from the leaſt ſuſpicion of the misfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>une which
attended him, had ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> purſuant to the
concert of matters in the Letters deliver'd him by <hi>la
Pierre,</hi> which was to finiſh the Treaty they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and of which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had
been inform'd by an Expreſs from the Queen, who
had a hand in the Conſpiracy, that is, ſo far as it
concern'd the Deſtruction of the Cardinal, whom
ſhe hated, but of all the reſt ſhe was innocent; and
was ſo far from the thoughts of marrying the Duke
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that ſhe did all ſhe could to marry him
to her Siſter the Infanta of <hi>Spain.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi>
granted <hi>Chalais</hi> all that he deſir'd, but he had no
further enjoyment of it but in hopes, for his Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was ſeiz'd upon at his return, and the Cardinal
having now ſufficient to convict him, delay'd no
longer his Execution.</p>
            <p>When this happen'd I was at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well enough what a hand I had in it, I was not
without ſome apprehenſions of being ſerv'd in the
ſame kind, if I ſhould chance to be diſcover'd; and
any body may judge how it far'd with me in the
Convent, where I receiv'd from time to time my
orders from the Cardinal. The Marquis <hi>de Laicques</hi>
was ſtill very intimate with me, but told me not a
word of what his intrigue had come to, being loth to
diſcourage me, by telling me of the ill ſucceſs of
their contrivances; for he had a deſign of making
further uſe of me about a young Lady, whom he
often ſpoke to me of, and expreſt an extraordinary
kindneſs for: if I had not in appearance embarkt
my ſelf ſo far in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſt, 'twould have
been a very fair opportunity to have ſpoken to him
about reconciling himſelf to the Cardinal, but I durſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57806:35"/>
not do it, conſidering what had happen'd, for 'twould
have been too plain a diſcovery that I had a mind to
deceive him. To ſpeak of it to Madam <hi>De Chevreuſe</hi>
or to her Gallant was to expoſe my ſelf alſo to an
apparent danger, for they did nothing without one
another; ſo finding I could not be any more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in thoſe parts, I earneſtly ſollicited the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
to be recall'd; but he knowing that moſt of
the Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es were diſcontented, and expecting they
would all have their recourſe to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court,
oblig'd me to continue there, that I might if poſſible
diſcover it.</p>
            <p>I liv'd therefore in this faſhion two whole years,
tho I curſt my Employment a thouſand times a day:
Here I was forc'd always to play the Hypocrite, and
to talk in Diſguiſe, a profeſſion very unpleaſant to
me; here I was forc'd to go a begging, work in the
Garden, and to go with many a hungry belly: I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
reflected upon my leaving Monſieur <hi>de St. Aunais,</hi>
to come to Court; it would not have been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhould have been a Captain there, and now I
knew neither what I was, nor what I was like to be;
but that which troubled me moſt was, that I heard
frequent conſultations about the Wars, the thing my
inclinations led me moſt to, which made my preſent
condition the more intolerable.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I went frequently to Monſieur
<hi>De Laicques,</hi> and was as well known there and at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>De Chevre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe</hi>'s, as I was at the Cardinals: One
day as I was coming out of the door, there came
two or three Gentlemen, and one of them ſtopping
to look full at me, <hi>In good faith 'tis</hi> Rochefort <hi>himſelf,</hi>
ſaid he to thoſe with him, <hi>I am very certain of it.</hi> I
no ſooner heard my name, but without looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, I began to mend my pace, and turn'd down
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57806:36"/>
the next ſtreet I came at, where, having my Begging
Wallet at my back, I threw it in at a door, and going
directly to a Brokers, I whiſper'd him in the Ear, and
told him that if he would ſell me Suit of Clothes,
I would give him his own price; for I always had a
ſmall Purſe about me, which was well provided,
and in that I only differ'd from a <hi>Capuchin:</hi> The ſight
of my Money conquer'd the Conſcience of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
who for a ſhare of my Gold made no ſcruple to
aſſiſt a <hi>Capuchin</hi> to make his eſcape; for he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that I was only a Monk that had a mind to
caſt my Frock, upon which account the Rogue askt
me three times the value of the things. I pitcht up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Suit of Clothes of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> mode, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
me with a Shirt, and a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>evat; and went out
to fetch me a Perriwig, a Sword, and a pair of Boots,
which compleated my accoutrements. In this equipage
I hir'd Poſt-horſes, and riding on before the Poſt-boy,
I got out of the Town as faſt as poſſible; fear gave
me wings, and hope gave me new vigour and life
beyond what I ever experienc'd before; and tho for
not having been often on Horſeback I could not bear
it ſo well, yet I rid at ſuch a rate that I left the Poſt-boy
to come after me; I never ſtopt till I got out of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> where by this time they were making ſearch
for me, for that perſon who knew me again, happen'd
to be the late Count <hi>de Chalais</hi> Gentleman, who was
come to ſhelter himſelf at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> not that he was
concern'd in the deſign with his Maſter, but fearing
to be apprehended on ſuſpicion, he choſe to abſent
himſelf for a while; he knew me, as we ſay, as well
as a Beggar knows his Diſh; and being ſurpriz'd to
ſee me ſo ſtrangely diſguis'd, he would have run after
me, to ask me how long I had been a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> who
was never ſuſpected to have any inclination to turn
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57806:36"/>
religious; but ſeeing that I, as it were ran from him,
he began to doubt there was ſome Roguery in the
caſe, and knowing well enough that I belong'd to
the Cardinal, he thought himſelf oblig'd to tell this
adventure to the Marquis <hi>de Laicques.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
told him he was mad, but he who knew well
enough what he ſaid, juſtify'd it with ſo much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
that the Marquis <hi>de Laicques</hi> run immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Convent, expecting to find me, where
being told that I was not yet come in, but they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
I would not be long, he asked to ſpeak with
the Superior, and told him, that as ſoon as I ſhould
ſet my foot within the Convent, he ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
for my forth-coming; and that in the mean
time he was going to acquaint the Archduke of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that concern'd the State. In ſhort, going to
the Archduke with the Count <hi>de Chalais</hi>'s Gentleman,
he ſurpriz'd him alſo with the relation of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
he ſent the Captain of his Guards to confirm
the order from him, which the Marquis <hi>de Laicques</hi>
had given to the Superior; and to make all ſure,
caus'd the Gates of the Town to be ſhut, that I
ſhould not be able to make my eſcape.</p>
            <p>He made ſtrict ſearch after me, and my diſguiſe
being ſo well order'd that no body perceiv'd me, they
all perſwaded the Archduke that I was ſtill in the
City: theſe delays were my ſecurity, and they found
at night, ſeeing I did not come home, that I had
miſtruſted ſomething, but ſtill they fancy'd I was hid
ſomewhere in the Town, and ſo they ſent out a
Proclamation for apprehending me, with a great
Penalty to any that ſhould conceal me; but finding
nothing come of it, they purſu'd me, when 'twas
too late.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57806:37"/>
The Cardinal was very much ſurpriz'd when he
ſaw me, eſpecially returning without his order, and
ſuppoſing I came away only becauſe I was weary of
my employment, he began to chide me in a furious
manner, but when I told him the danger I had been
in, and how narrowly I eſcapt, he chang'd his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and told me I had done very well; and he
himſelf a little after gave me an account of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
I have related, and of the trouble the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
was in, that he could not find me out; and
he told me alſo, that my Companion was clapt up in
Priſon, and was ſtill there, and he believ'd was not
like to get out, till they had put him to the torture.</p>
            <p>I found at my arrival ſeveral changes at Court;
the Marquis <hi>d' Humiers,</hi> Father of him who is now
Governour of the new Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> had receiv'd orders to quit his
place of firſt Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, and
came every day to ſollicit the Cardinal to endeavour
the recovery of it; but the Cardinal told him, he
muſt addreſs himſelf to the King, from whoſe mouth
he had receiv'd the ſentence. His diſgrace was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
by a very ſlight matter, and he had this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
at leaſt, that it was not from any default of
his: He was red-hair'd, and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riwigs were not ſo
commonly wore in thoſe days; wherefore he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the King hated the ſight, comb'd his hair
with a Comb made of black lead, which colour'd
his hair as if it had been dy'd, ſo that the King knew
nothing but that 'twas naturally black; till one day,
as they were a hunting, there fell ſo much rain that
waſht out the artificial colour, and diſcover'd the
cheat; this was enough for the King to command
him, as I mention'd, to lay down his Office, and all
the Friends he could make, could not prevail with the
King to re-admit him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57806:37"/>
I receiv'd a great deal of kindneſs from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
after I had ſhown him the neceſſity there was for
my return; but whether it was that he lov'd to have
me always about him, or that he intended me no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
he contented himſelf with gratifying me
from time to time, without thinking of any ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for me: I had 2000 <hi>Louis d'ors</hi> given me at my
return, which was a conſideration noble enough, but
I was not of a humour to be rich, and therefore laid
up ne're a Groat: For I liv'd ſo extravagantly, that if I
had had a hundred thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> I
ſhould have ballanc'd the account at the years end;
I knew well enough 'twas a fooliſh way, yet I could
not tell how to help it: That I might therefore have
ſomewhat to truſt to, I askt the Cardinal to beſtow
upon me a Company in the Guards, there happening
a vacancy at that time; but he told me I knew not
what I askt, for there was ne're a Captain in the
Guards, but would change Poſts with me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that he had ſomewhat for me to do. Now
was I to think my ſelf oblig'd, and to thank him for
the favour of his refuſal, tho I did not think it ſuch
an obligation, as he was pleas'd to account it: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he gave me another Abbey of ſix thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
<hi>per annum,</hi> and I beſtow'd it upon one of my
Brothers, at the very time when my Mother-in-law
was telling every body, that I had no intereſt in the
Cardinal, and that he had ſo little value for me, that
I had lain two years in Priſon for debt.</p>
            <p>She meant my Journey to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> when ſhe talkt
thus, which ſhe underſtood nothing of, but tho I
heard this from ſeveral, yet it did not at all hinder
me from doing what I thought my duty; there was
a great many in his condition who would have thankt
me for this; but when I came to propoſe, that ſhe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57806:38"/>
ſhonld give me a little conſideration, as is uſual in
ſuch caſes, ſhe flew out againſt me like a mad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
ſhe not only made a noiſe of the difference I
had made between my Brother and the Curate, whoſe
Benefice I had given him <hi>gratis,</hi> but that I made my
Brother pay more than 'twas worth; ſo away ſhe
goes to <hi>Orleans,</hi> to conſult the Caſuiſts, makes it a
Caſe of Conſcience, and deſires to be inform'd, if
ſhe ſhould not be guilty of Symony, in accepting this
Abbey for her Son.</p>
            <p>All this did not hinder me from doing my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for another of her Sons; knowing the eldeſt of
them did but loſe his time in a Country Village, I
got him into the Academy, where I paid for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
and at laſt brought him to the Cardinal,
and askt him how he would pleaſe to have me diſpoſe
of him. My deſign was to enter him among the
grand Muſqueteers, but knowing that the Cardinal
was not very well with <hi>Treville</hi> who commanded
them, I would not do it without acquainting him
with it; I found I took the beſt way too, for he told
me, I ſhould have a care of doing ſo, and ſhould rather
let him carry a Muſquet in ſome other Regiment;
upon which I plac't him in the Guards, and in about
ſix months time, the Cardinal procur'd me a Colours
for him, and he told me, when he gave it me, that
I might ſee what difference he made between thoſe
who were in his favour and others, for to thoſe he
gave leave to ſerve him if they pleas'd, but theſe he
took care to bind to him by obligations beyond their
merit.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſtopt the mouth of my Mother-in-law
for the preſent, and ſhe was indeed afraid to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me ſo openly, for fear people ſhould throw ſtones
at her; but my Brother being unhappily kill'd the firſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57806:38"/>
Campagne he made, at the Siege of a Town in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> ſhe begun to open louder than before, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about, that ſhe knew me better than others; that
I had made away my Brother, that I might get the
Eſtate, and that 'twas for the ſame deſign I had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
two more of her Children to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had
put them into the Academy, and if I had indeed got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a Benefice for another, 'twas only that he might
be oblig'd not to marry. Every one advis'd me to
let her alone for a mad woman, (if I may ſo call her)
and do no more for them; but what I did being for
my own ſake more than hers, I never let the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
reſt, till he had given me the Colours my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left, who was kill'd, to the eldeſt of the two
that were in the Academy: In the mean time, when
he came to march, I was fain to be at the charge of
all his Equipage, ſo that I may truly ſay, that I had
the trouble and charge of Children, without having
had the pleaſure of getting them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, together with my extravagant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
empty'd my ſtock, which made me often tell the
Cardinal in jeſt, that I was a Basket without a bottom,
but that he was like to pay for it all. So when ever
I was out of pocket, I would come to him and cry,
<hi>Good my Lord, have pity upon a poor Father who has ſix
Children.</hi> 'Tis true I knew my time when 'twas fit to
make theſe ſort of compliments, I took him when
he was in a humour to laugh, and he ſeldom deny'd
me any thing; in ſhort I got about fifteen thouſand
Livres a year of him in this manner, one year with
another, beſides the two Abbeys, and the two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
in the Guards; he plac'd alſo one of my Siſters
in the Nunnery <hi>de Monmartre,</hi> without coſting me a
Farthing; all which made me lookt upon to be not
a little in his favour, and yet I was ſtill very much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57806:39"/>
diſcontented with my condition, for 'twas a daily
mortification to me to think that I had nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and if the Cardinal ſhould dye, I knew not
where to hide my head. He was about this time
building the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and waiting on him once thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>if I might but one time or other
come to have a Chamber here, with a Doctors allowance, I
ſhould think my ſelf a very happy Fellow. Thou art never
ſatisfy'd,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou costest me more than any four of
my Servants, and yet thou art always grumbling. God
forbid, my Lord,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>but I am young now, and am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of wanting when I grow old. Why art thou ſuch an
ill husband then,</hi> reply'd he. <hi>Ah my Lord,</hi> return'd I,
<hi>your Eminence knows very well what a charge of Children I
have, and that I never ask you till I am in great neceſſity, and
that notwithſtanding all your bounty, I have not a penny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand.
I know your meaning,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you would have
ſomething ſettled on you in caſe I ſhould dye; well, I will
think of it.</hi> I thankt him very heartily, for thoſe
words comforted me exceedingly; 'twas above a
fortnight after this, before his Eminence took any
more notice of it; and thinking it not proper to
importune him every day, I gave my attendance
conſtantly without ſpeaking a word more to him of it;
but at laſt he took me into his Cloſet, and opening
a little Cabinet, <hi>Thou askest, me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and 'tis but reaſonable thou ſhouldſt have it;</hi> ſo pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out a ſmall Parchment ty'd with little Ribbons
he put it into my hands. <hi>Here,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there is a
thouſand Crowns a year upon the Bank of</hi> Lions, <hi>I think
thou art ſo ill a Husband that thou art not fit to be truſted
with it, but as it comes in annually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may eaſily gueſs how overjoy'd I was at this
noble preſent, I was better pleas'd with it than if he
had given me twenty thouſand Crowns, for in ſhort
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57806:39"/>
I knew my own humour, and was not ignorant, tho
I could not help it, that I was not capable of laying
up a penny. This created me a great deal of envy in
the Family, when it was known how generous his
Eminence had been to me; and the other Servants
mutter'd at it, that all the kindneſs was ſhown to
the new comers, while the old ſtanders were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
but all this was nothing to the noiſe and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys
of my Mother-in-law: She told about, that it
was in vain to think to throw duſt in her eyes, that
my ill nature would appear too plain, whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
I put upon it, but that it had never appear'd
better than on this occaſion, when I pretended to
have receiv'd a Preſent from the Cardinal, to colour
my deſign of cheating my lawful Heirs: That I had
put the Money into the Bank my ſelf, and that I ſo
conceal'd whatever I got with the ſame deſign. My
Father coming up to <hi>Paris,</hi> I complain'd to him of
this conduct of hers, but he poor man was ſo weak,
and ſo cow'd by his Wife, that 'twas to no more
purpoſe to ſpeak to him, than to run ones head againſt
the Wall.</p>
            <p>We were very much at <hi>Ruel,</hi> where the Cardinal
had a moſt delicious Seat, and it being a very fine
Country for ſport, which I extreamly lov'd, I never
thought the time long we ſpent there. There was
one <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who they nick-nam'd the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the
Captain of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> and we being intimate friends
he us'd to call me out often to hunt with him; and
one day among the reſt, having run down a Deer
in the Forreſt, after the Sport was over, he would
needs have me with him to ſee a little piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
that he kept at a by-houſe, out of the road;
I excus'd my ſelf for that time, and having left him,
he went all alone, without ſo much as a Valet; as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57806:40"/>
he came back, he meets a Country Gentlemans man
with a Fuſee on his ſhoulder, and having askt him,
if he did not know that that was forbidden; the
Fellow ſeeing him all alone anſwer'd, Yes that he
did, but he had a mind to kill a Hare, and what
then? <hi>Beaumont,</hi> a little ſtirr'd with this anſwer, askt
him if he knew who he ſpoke to. <hi>Know you?</hi> ſaid
the Rogue inſolently, <hi>Yes, very well, you are markt
plain enough, any body may know you. Beaumont</hi> you
muſt underſtand had but one Eye, and therefore was
toucht to the quick with this impudent anſwer; but
ſeeing the fellow upon his guard, he blew his Horn,
that if any body had been near him, they might
come to his aſſiſtance; upon which the fellow, who
was no Fool, retir'd immediately, and got away ſafe
to his Maſters houſe, where I happen'd to be juſt
at that time; he told us not a word of what had
happen'd to him, if he had, we could have made it
up at firſt with a word ſpeaking, but as we were at
Table, and he newly gone down into the Kitchin,
we heard a noiſe in the Court, which made us riſe
to ſee what was the matter; I was ſurpriz'd as well as
the Maſter of the Houſe, to ſee the Yard full of
Blue Coats, being a party of the Guards, that <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
had ſent. The fellow ignorantly came out to
them himſelf, and askt them their buſineſs, who not
knowing his face, enquir'd for him by his own name,
which was enough to tell him their errand: So he
took no notice at all, but told them, he would go
in and call him. Inſtead of which he went and laid
himſelf all along upon a beam, which was but that
morning put up in a houſe his Maſter was building,
and he lay ſo, that 'twas impoſſible to ſee him; in
the mean time, the Gentleman taking this for a great
affront, that theſe men ſhould come thus into his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57806:40"/>
houſe, was juſt going to diſcharge a Fuſee at them,
if I had not ſtopt him gravely, by telling him, that
the leſs paſſion, the leſs miſchief always, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
up to the Guards, who all knew me, I askt
them what was the matter, they told me the whole
ſtory as I have related it; ſo having deſir'd them not
to preſs into the houſe, till I came to them again, I
went and told the Maſter, and propos'd that he
would let one of the Guards go in with me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them that the Servant was not in the houſe, I
had a great deal of difficulty to bring him to this, but
having told him the conſequences of a refuſal, he
was prevail'd on; in the mean time, the Guards
having beſet the houſe, ſo that they were ſure he
could no way eſcape, they were for ſearching every
corner, and there was not a nook, nor a hole, but
they pry'd into; but finding 'twas all in vain, and
the fellow was not to be found, they concluded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs, than that he was beholding to the Devil
to convey him away. The Gentleman knew no
more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what was become of him than they, till a
good while after they were all gone, and the coaſt
clear, that he ſaw him creeping down from the
beam.</p>
            <p>When the fellow underſtood the danger he had
been in, he did not think it convenient to truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
any longer there, but askt leave of his Maſter to
go home to his own friends, who liv'd ten or twelve
Leagues beyond <hi>Paris;</hi> when he came home he
found his Father ſick of a violent Feaver, but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a great deal of joy to ſee his Son before his death.
The old man being poor, was but meanly lookt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his illneſs, and being as it were left alone, he
call'd his Son to give him ſome drink, which the
fellow did once or twice, but the old man calling
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57806:41"/>
very often, and he being too lazy to attend him, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
brings the Pitcher, and ſetting it by him, bad him
help himſelf; this was a heart-breaking to the poor
dying man, and reproaching him for his unnatural
behaviour, this Raſcal takes up the Pitcher, and
pours it all upon his Father, telling him he might
drink his belly full if he was ſo thirſty.</p>
            <p>After ſo barbarous an action, he runs away to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and going the next day to the Palace, he
knocks before he was aware, at the Preſident <hi>Seg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
which rudeneſs put the Preſident into ſuch a
paſſion, that he order'd his Officers to put him in
Priſon, and it being the cuſtom to examine ſuch as
are committed for any inſolences in the ſtreets, they
began to ask him the uſual queſtions in ſuch caſes,
when finding him faltring in his diſcourſe, and giving
but a lame account of himſelf; and whether he had a
hanging look, or which is moſt likely, the Vengeance
of Heaven purſu'd him for the horrid crime he had
committed, the Judges order'd enquiry to be
made at the Town where he ſaid he was born; the
Officer who was ſent, found his Father dead, but he
had told ſo many People of the inhuman action of
his Son, that the whole Town came in againſt him;
the Officer having made this report, and due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
being made thereon, they ſentenc'd him to
be hang'd; he confeſt at the Gallows ſeveral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of crimes, which had they been known before,
he would have been broken alive upon the wheel.</p>
            <p>This was without doubt a good leſſon to all thoſe,
who flatter themſelves with hopes of eſcaping divine
vengeance, which tho it had permitted this man to
go unpuniſht for many great crimes, brought him at
laſt to publick ſhame for a trifle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:57806:41"/>
I had, as I ſaid, obtain'd an Enſign in the Guards
for my Brother, who had been at two or three
Sieges which had been made that Campagne; and
the Cardinal, being deſirous to know how he had
behav'd himſelf, enquir'd of the Mareſchal <hi>de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
who came one morning to make his Court to
him; the <hi>Valet,</hi> who was in waiting at that time,
told me of it, and that the Mareſchal made anſwer,
that he was a very brisk young fellow. I took my
meaſures from this, to do ſomething yet better for
him, but being aſham'd to be always asking, I went
this way to work: we had yet a Brother whom the
Cardinal had not ſeen, who began now to be of age fit
to go into the Army, and was a very compleat young
Lad; I preſented him to the Cardinal, and askt
him, as I us'd to do of the others, how his Eminence
pleas'd I ſhould diſpoſe of him? the Cardinal charm'd
with the ſight of him, told me I ought to be very
well ſatisfy'd to have a Brother of his ſhape and
meen. <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid I, at the ſame time, <hi>an Enſign
of the Guards would ſit very well on ſuch a Gentleman as he
is like to make, and a Lieutenancy on his Brother; and
ſince it happens that there is ſuch a Vacancy now in the ſame
Company, if your Eminence would pleaſe to beſtow it on
him, I would ſay, if I durſt, that he will not be wanting
in his Duty, or Courage for the Kings Service, when there
ſhall be opportunity.</hi> He conſider'd a while of what I
ſaid, and then return'd upon me, <hi>You have a mind
to bring me, and Monſieur</hi> d' Eſpernon <hi>together by the
Ears; don't you know he will let no body encroach upon his
Office, and that t'other day he would needs quarrel with the
King, for but offering to give away a Company in the Guards
which belong'd to him. My Lord,</hi> ſaid I ſmiling, <hi>if he
quarrels with your Eminence, here is three Brothers of us
will be your Seconds; and the reſt, as they grow up, ſhall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57806:42"/>
all engage on your ſide. Thou ſpaekeſt fair,</hi> ſays the
Cardinal, <hi>but go to him from me, and tell him, he will
oblige me in gratifying you.</hi> I did not fail to return
him thanks for ſo conſiderable a favour, and going
immediately to Monſieur <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> he was pleas'd
to tell me, that I needed not his Eminences Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
for ſo ſmall a matter, which I ſhould
have commanded from him at a word from my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Certainly the bounty of my Maſter, the Cardinal,
was without example, and all my trouble was, that
I was not able to make any ſuitable return for ſo
many obligations; I ſought however, as much as
it was poſſible, for opportunities to expreſs my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
and being one day drinking with ſeveral
Gentlemen, one of them, that was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi>
began to reflect upon the Cardinal, whether it was
that the Wine was gotten into his head, and ſo
talkt he knew not what, or that he had ſome private
malice againſt him, I know not, but I deſir'd him
very civilly to ſpeak in other language of my Maſter,
unleſs he reſolv'd to diſoblige me; but he talking the
more reproachfully for my taking notice of it, I loſt
all patience at that, and taking up a Plate I threw
it at his head; he was preſently for drawing out his
Sword, but I was ready for him, ſo he loſt his deſign,
which was to have ſurpriz'd me before I could have
drawn; our Friends ſtepping in, prevented our fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that time, and endeavour'd to reconcile us,
but it was impoſſible to bring him to any thing, for
going out he made a motion to me to wait upon him.
Every one of the Company offer'd me their ſervice,
but I thankt them, and told them I ſaw no occaſion
to fear, however two of them would not leave me
till they ſaw me at my Lodgings, that if we had met
him, who had alſo two friends, who went out with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57806:42"/>
him, we might have been upon equal terms, but we
ſaw no body, tho we went the direct way on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The next morning before I was up, my <hi>Valet de
Chambre</hi> came and told me, there was one wanted to
ſpeak with me; I preſently imagin'd it was from the
Gentleman, and bid him let him in, and deſir'd him
to ſit down by my bed ſide. I knew him immediately
to be one of thoſe two perſons, that went out with
him; ſo making a ſign to him to ſay nothing of his
buſineſs, till I had ſent my man out of the way, I
held him in diſcourſe of one thing or another, as if
we had been very well acquainted, till I made
an errand to ſend away my man, and then he made
me his compliment, which was thus, That I had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
his Friend, who was a Perſon of Quality,
and that nothing but my life could repair the injury I
had offer'd him: That he waited for me with one of
his friends, not reckoning himſelf, ſo that I muſt
bring two of mine along with me to entertain them.</p>
            <p>There was nothing in all his compliment which
troubled me, but that I ſhould involve any body in
my quarrel; I could not tell who to think on a good
while, but immediately recollecting that I had two
Brothers, who had ſome right to the quarrel, as
having ſo greatly ſhar'd of the Cardinals bounty, I
reſolv'd to ſeek no further; ſo I ſent for them, and
taking them with me towards the <hi>Bois de Boulogne,</hi>
which was the place appointed, where we found our
Adverſaries ready; we immediately drew, and fell
to it. My younger Brother was wounded the firſt
Paſs, and tho it was a very dangerous thruſt, yet he
at the ſame time diſarm'd and wounded his man; I
had done the ſame with mine, and going together to
aſſiſt our eldeſt Brother, his Adverſary at that very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57806:43"/>
moment made a Paſs through his body, with which
he fell dead at his feet: This was a ſight enough to
have mov'd any Brother to revenge; beſides the
blood which flow'd from his wound who was left,
had arguments in it to urge me to refuſe him quarter;
but he begging his life upon our preſſing him very
hard, I thought it would not be for our honour to
refuſe him.</p>
            <p>We brought off three Swords, a ſmall Trophy
compar'd to the loſs of our Brother, whom we left
dead upon the ſpot; and yet this was not all, for the
wound my younger Brother receiv'd, having pierc'd
his Vitals, tho the ſtrength of his conſtitution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd
it for ſome days, I was aſtoniſht to ſee him
give up the ghoſt in my arms; I was never ſo griev'd
in my life, ſeeing my ſelf the cauſe of the ruine of
two ſuch hopeful youths, whom I had, as it were,
led to be ſlaughter'd on my account: 'Tis eaſy to be
imagin'd the clamour of my Mother-in-law at this
news, ſhe ſaid againſt me all that rage and fury could
put into her mouth, which I knew not what to ſay
to, only that if I had known what would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
I ſhould have been more cautious of afflicting
her. I might have ſaid ſomething more for my juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but I thought 'twas more proper to let
others ſpeak for me, and I flatter'd my ſelf that there
was none but were ſenſible of the innocence of my
intention; but among all theſe troubles which were
not ſmall, you will ſay, I had yet another which
rackt me night and day, for tho the Cardinals ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had been the cauſe of our quarrel, yet Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
being ſo ſtrictly forbidden, he would not ſee
me, and I was oblig'd to abſcond as if I had been a
Murtherer; they told me at the ſame time, that he
had order'd ſearch to be made for me, in order to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57806:43"/>
deliver me over to the Judges, and that he had ſent
for the <hi>Procurator General</hi> about it. <hi>La Houdiniere,</hi>
who was always my Friend, was the firſt that advis'd
me to keep out of the way, telling me the Cardinal
was in ſuch a paſſion, that he durſt not expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſpeak in my behalf; I durſt not deſire him to
do it neither, for fear his Eminence ſhould ſuſpect
he had ſeen me, and I thought he would be more
ſerviceable to me, if without taking notice of any
thing, he ſhould endeavour to ſound the intention of
the Cardinal. Things continu'd thus three months,
which was a long while for a man to lye incognito,
and if I had any Enemies, this was their time to
ruine me, and 'tis impoſſible to reckon how many
ſtories they told of me to the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Maulevriere</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> was one
of theſe, tho I had laid ſeveral obligations on him,
and therefore always lookt upon him as my friend;
for 'twas thro my means that he got to be an Enſign
in the Guards, which he had been refuſed; and ſince
that I had introduc'd him to the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi>
to go with him to the Army; and I may truly ſay,
that he ſhow'd him a great deal of favour on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
This man, who was of a Family of the long
Robe, and ſuch a one as there were a thouſand bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in that Province, was always cracking, and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf upon his Nobility, in ſuch manner, that
to hear him talk, one would not queſtion but he
could derive his Pedigree from <hi>St. Lewis:</hi> I had told
him my opinion of this fooliſh way of his a little
freely, which he pretended to take very friendly;
but my diſgrace coming upon this, he prov'd the
greateſt Enemy I had; in ſhort, I was told by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that he never had any opportunity to diſcourſe
with the Cardinal, but he us'd it to my diſadvantage;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57806:44"/>
which I reſented ſo ill, that though I was reduc'd to
this condition for fighting, I deſir'd to be at liberty
for nothing more than to demand ſatisfaction of
him. <hi>La Houdiniere</hi> was one of thoſe that gave me
account of this, and coming to ſee me one day told
me, I ſhould lay aſide all thoſe thoughts, for the
Cardinal himſelf had ſufficiently reveng'd me of this
<hi>Norman.</hi> I no ſooner heard that word, but I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to know the Hiſtory of it, which was thus.
That he being come to his Eminence, and beginning
to reflect upon me as he us'd to do, the Cardinal told
him, 'twas a trick of a Raſcal to abuſe one who was
abſent, and could not anſwer for himſelf; that he
had known me longer than he had done, but that
it was not my practice to ſpeak ill of any body; that
I was a fellow who had behav'd my ſelf well, but
was no boaſter of my own actions, and that perhaps
my misfortunes would not laſt always. I could not
believe this was a diſcourſe likely to come from the
man that proſecuted me; however I took it as a good
Omen, and it encourag'd me to have patience, till
time ſhould produce ſomething to my advantage.</p>
            <p>'Twas a whole month before I had the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to hope, but at laſt, when I began to deſpair,
<hi>La Houdiniere</hi> came to me from the Cardinal to tell
me, that I ſhould ſurrender my ſelf to Priſon, and
fear nothing; he told me alſo, that his Eminence
askt very kindly after me, telling him, that he knew
him to be my conſtant Friend, and further ſays <hi>La
Houdiniere, I am miſtaken if you have not as great a ſhare
in the Cardinals favour as ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not ſay, that I was very ſenſible of the
kindneſs he expreſt, and that I deſir'd <hi>La Houdiniere</hi>
to aſſure his Eminence, that I had all imaginable ſence
of his goodneſs; ſo I preſently ſurrender'd my ſelf to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57806:44"/>
Priſon, without requiring any aſſurance of my ſafety,
more than the Cardinals word. Thoſe who heard
what I had done, but knew nothing of what had
paſt between the Cardinal and me, thought I was
out of my wits, and pitty'd my folly: Others, who
wiſht me ill enough, took this occaſion to ſollicit
againſt me, and tho, as the Cardinal did me the
juſtice to ſay, I never did any man any wrong, yet
I found a thouſand that were glad of the opportunity
they thought they had to ruine me, and the worſt
Enemy I had, was the Count <hi>de Maulevriere,</hi> who
had married to his ſecond Wife, a Relation of the
Preſident <hi>de Bailleul,</hi> and he employ'd her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to engage her Unkle againſt me; and if that
Magiſtrate had not been an honeſter man than he, I
had been in great danger; but I found the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt me ſo favourable, that if I had drawn it
up my ſelf, I could not have contriv'd it better. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of aggravating the matter, or indeed of telling
the very matter of fact, as I have here done, there
was a relation, how the man not only abus'd me at
Table, but lay in wait for me at the <hi>Bois de Boulogue,</hi>
as I was returning from <hi>Verſailles</hi> with my two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
that <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> I was oblig'd to draw as
well as thoſe that were with me, and that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I had firſt endeavour'd to tell him, the regard he
ought to have had to the Kings Edicts, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of diſobeying in ſuch caſes as this; and being fill'd
with a great deal of ſuch ſtuff, and having ſo much
care taken of me, without my help, my juſtification
was both ſhort and eaſy.</p>
            <p>I was ſtill ignorant to whom I ow'd this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tho I ſometimes fancy'd it muſt be the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
yet I could not think ſo long, when I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that a man who had ſo much kindneſs for me,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57806:45"/>
ſhould let me lye ſo long neglected in my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
and would rather have told me how it was,
than ſend me a bare meſſage not to fear: Being
however got out of Priſon, I went to throw my ſelf
at his Eminence's feet, whom I told I would deal
more ſincerely with, than I had done with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
that I would honeſtly confeſs to him, that
I had broken the Kings Order, but if I had been to
be a Vagabond twice as long as I had been, or to
have loſt my head upon a Scaffold, I could never
bear to hear him abus'd. <hi>Have a care who hears you,</hi>
ſaid he, taking me up, <hi>'tis I that have brought you out of
this buſineſs, tho no body knows of it; and whereas I did
ſend indeed for the Procurator General to make your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
it was only with deſign to ſave you; if I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you as much,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>'twas becauſe I make no
man Maſter of my ſecrets:</hi> Bouteville <hi>and</hi> de Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,
<hi>were executed but t'other day for the ſame thing,
and what would they have ſaid of me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if I had
ſav'd one of my own Servants, when I but juſt before had
taken off a Relation of one of the firſt Princes of the blood,
and two Gentlemen allied to the chief Families in</hi> France.</p>
            <p>So obliging a diſcourſe as this made me throw
my ſelf again at his feet, and embracing his knees,
<hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>when ſhall I be ſo happy, as to dye for
ſo good a Maſter; I muſt have liberty to ſight againſt all
that declare themſelves his Enemies.</hi> He was extreamly
pleas'd to ſee me ſo zealous, and he took ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in hearing me expreſs my ſelf in this manner,
that he thought not of raiſing me from his foot.</p>
            <p>What he had told me of <hi>Bouteville</hi> and <hi>de Chappelle</hi>
was very true, but he did not tell me how he grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
his private grudge in executing the rigour of the
Law upon them. <hi>Bouteville</hi> being Father to the
preſent Mareſchal <hi>de Luxemburgh,</hi> was Couſin to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57806:45"/>
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as he told me, but to ſpeak ſtrictly
to the Princeſs his Wife; but that honour was ſold
him very dear: You muſt know that the Duke
<hi>D' Enguien,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> having
marry'd Madamoiſelle <hi>de Breſſe,</hi> the Cardinal's Niece,
and his Father having been forc't, againſt his Will,
to conſent to that Match purely to ſave his life, or at
leaſt his liberty, his Son, who knew how he was
impos'd upon, lookt upon his Marriage as a mark of
his bondage to the Cardinals tyranny; and from
thence deſpiſing both the Relation and the Wife, he
reproacht her daily with a thouſand reflections, and
not altogether without cauſe; her Birth was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and ſhe came of a very Ancient Family;
but the Duke <hi>D' Enguien,</hi> having employ'd a man
verſt in Heraldry to ſearch out the Original of her
Family, and he, after turning it from ſide to ſide,
made his report, whether 'twas true or no, that the
Houſe <hi>de Maille,</hi> of which ſhe was deſcended, came
by Baſterdy from an Archbiſhop of <hi>Tours;</hi> this was
enough for that Duke, not only to inſult his Wife,
but alſo to be very ſharp in reproaching the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and nothing being done but he had his Emiſſaries
to inform him of it, he was ſo mov'd at this, that he
only waited for an opportunity to ſhow his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and 'twas not long before had one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Bouteville,</hi>
who happen'd to fight a Duel, not only againſt the
Kings Edict, but againſt a particular order to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
was ſo cloſely purſued, that he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
before he could reach into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the
Count <hi>de Chappelle</hi> his Couſin, who was his Second,
and ſled along with him, was alſo taken; and it
being to do a deſpight to the Houſe of <hi>Conde,</hi> the
Cardinal caus'd them to be executed by the Hands
of the Common Hangman, under pretence of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57806:46"/>
Juſtice, but indeed to ſatisfy his private revenge.</p>
            <p>After I was thus reſtor'd into favour, the Cardinal,
who lov'd me more than ever, made me ſeveral gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
and askt me, If I had ne'r another Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prefer? I told him I had two, one to whom
I had given the laſt Abbey, which his Eminence was
pleas'd to beſtow on me; but that for the other, I
did not deſire to concern my ſelf for him, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the misfortune to be accus'd of the death of
three others, I was unwilling to expoſe my ſelf to
the like reproach: I told him however I had a Siſter
that paſt in the world, for ſomething handſome,
and intended to marry her to one of my Friends,
a Gentleman of <hi>Brettany,</hi> and that I only waited for
my Father and Mother-in-law's anſwer. He heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to all this with a ſingular goodneſs; and a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
falling near us, which was in his Gift, he gave
it me without asking, and I preſented it as freely to
my Brother, who was already in Orders; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
the mouth of my Mother-in-law afreſh, who
complain'd now that one muſt have all and t'other
none; and that I ought rather to have given it to
him that had nothing. I e'n let her ſay what ſhe
wou'd, and only waited for an anſwer to the buſineſs
about my Siſter, which it was three months before
they wou'd vouchſafe to grant me; at laſt, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
having a ſuit at Law that brought him to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and being glad to make uſe of ſome friends of mine
to ſollicit for him, he ſent me a Note where I might
find him; I went to him immediately, and after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him my reſpects, I askt him how it came about
that I had not heard from him all this while? <hi>'Tis
long of your Mother,</hi> anſwer'd he very ingenuouſly,
<hi>who believes you have a deſign to deceive us: But Sir,</hi> ſaid
I, <hi>what do you believe of it? In troth,</hi> ſaid he, with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57806:46"/>
ſame freedom, <hi>I know not what to think of it, for when
the Debate lyes between a Wife that a Man loves, and a
Son who has oblig'd him, one has a difficult task to decide
it. You have no Obligation at all, Sir, to me,</hi> ſaid I,
<hi>but methinks you ought at leaſt to do me a little more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not care to urge it any farther out of reſpect
to him: His Cauſe was againſt Monſieur <hi>de la Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
a Man from whom we have ſeen a great many
Dukes and Governours of Provinces, and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
deſcended; ſo that it was, as I may ſay, the
Earthen Pot floating by the Iron Pot, which made me
doubtful of the Event, and I told my Father 'twould
be beſt for him to accommodate the matter; he
told me he was willing to do ſo, upon which I
ſpake to the Cardinal, who had done ſo many things
for me, that he would pleaſe to concern himſelf in
this. His Eminence ſpoke of it that very day to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Vieuville.</hi> But he, who thought that upon
the account of his powerful intereſt, he was able to
cruſh my Father, as I hinted before; or at leaſt that
he ſhould tire him out, anſwer'd the Cardinal, that
he would do any thing he deſir'd him, but intreated
him rather to leave their Controverſy to the deciſion
of the Law; the Cardinal could not well inſiſt upon
it after that, ſo he told me, that my Father muſt
not expect any accommodation, for Mr. <hi>De la Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
would not hearken to it; but that for my ſake
he would eſpouſe the Cauſe himſelf for my Father:
I carried this great news to my Father, which at firſt
he could hardly believe. So the Proceſs began, and
my Father having ſet forth in his Bill of Complaint,
that Monſieur <hi>de la Vieuville</hi> had committed ſeveral
Waſts, in a Village that we had near <hi>Nogent L' Arth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi>
which belong'd to him; he had not only the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57806:47"/>
impudence in his Anſwer to give him the Lye, but
run on in ſuch ill language againſt our Family, as if
we had not been ſo much as Gentlemen. As no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
can offend but what is grounded on truth, ſo
nothing vext me in this but the Lye, tho I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſatisfy'd afterwards, when the Lawyers told me,
that theſe were but words of courſe, which they
always put into their Pleas, without any deſign of
particular affront; and withal being ſtrictly charg'd
by the Cardinal not to demand any other ſatisfaction,
I reſolv'd to uſe the ſame Arms againſt them, and the
next day return'd them the Lye, and prov'd our
Nobility. At night the Cardinal askt me how our
Cauſe went on, and I having told him what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
he wonder'd he ſaid, that Monſieur <hi>de la Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
ſhould ſtand ſo much upon that Nicety, his
Nobility being not ſo much above ours, and if I knew
what <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had ſaid one time to his Father, I
might have been ſufficiently even with him upon
that ſcore.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner ſaid thus, but I begg'd his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to tell me what it was, which he made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to do, but told me, that the Father of this <hi>de
la Vieuville</hi> belong'd to the Duke <hi>de Nevers,</hi> who to
recompence him for ſome ſervices which he had
done him, ſo often importun'd <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth to
make him Knight of the Order, that he could not
put him off; and it being the Cuſtom, that when the
King puts on the Coller of the Order, the Knight
kneeling down ſays, <hi>Domine non ſum dignus;</hi> Monſieur
<hi>de la Vieuville</hi> repeating the ſame words, the King
reply'd aloud, <hi>I know that well enough, but I muſt give
it you, or my Couſin</hi> de Nevers <hi>won't let me be quiet.</hi> The
Cardinal could not have pleas'd me ſo well, if he
had given me a hundred thouſand Crowns, as he did
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57806:47"/>
with telling me this ſtory which I carry'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Lawyers, and making them put it into
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir own language in our reply, it was a ſingular
mortification to our Adverſary.</p>
            <p>This was good ſport for the Judges, who are glad
to have ſomething of any ſide to laugh at, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into the bargain, I had my fill of it, and my
Father too, and that which was moſt ſtrange, Mr. <hi>de
la Vieuville</hi> could not forbear laughing himſelf. The
Hiſtory of <hi>Domine non ſum dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> brought him a
little to reaſon, fearing leſt thoſe that were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with circumſtances ſo very particular, ſhould alſo
ranſack his Genealogy, and diſpute his Original
which was from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and began to be ſorry that
he had refus'd the Cardinals Mediation. In ſhort, there
being ſeveral other things which he was loth we
ſhould enquire into, he came to the Cardinals, and
meeting me at the door told me, that he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at what he had heard juſt now, for he had never
known before, that his Adverſary was my Father,
which if he had been inform'd of ſooner he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have diſputed it. I knew well enough what this
meant, and being not of a humour to flatter him, I
told him, I had reaſon to value my ſelf extreamly,
ſince he was pleas'd to grant that to me which he
had deny'd to the Cardinal; and tho my Father had
been at great charges in the Suit, yet I was ready to
move him to an accommodation; and that if he
pleas'd to acquaint me with the conditions, I would
bring him an anſwer; this diſcourſe vext him, and
telling me, that I did not accept his civility as I ought;
he flung away without ſaying a word more.</p>
            <p>So our Proceedings went on ſtill, but finding that
he treated us with better language, we alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
reproaching him; our Proceſs was to be heard
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57806:48"/>
before two Judges, Monſieur <hi>Turcan</hi> was one, a
man who having been firſt divorced on pretence of
Impotence, choſe rather to be thought ſo, than to
live with his Wife who was an infamous Woman;
he was entirely our Friend, but the Preſident, who
was the other, was not; ſo that when he came to
ſum up the matter, as he read a clauſe that was in our
favour, the Preſident askt him, if that ſentence he
read was in the writing; <hi>Turcan</hi> who was very hot,
whatever complaints his Wife might make of the
contrary, and the Tryal being in the Evening, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two great Wax Candles by his Seat on the
Bench, he took one of them and threw it at his head,
ſaying, That a Man who ſuſpected ſuch a thing as
that was a Raſcal, and ought to be us'd accordingly.
The Preſident by ſtooping down his head avoided
the blow, but asking him what he meant, and at
the ſame time catching up the other threw it at him,
and ſtruck him on the head; this diſorder put a ſtop
to the Cauſe which was juſt upon deciding. The
Preſident went out to make his complaint, and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
went home to his own houſe, where he receiv'd
an Order to lay down his Office.</p>
            <p>Our Cauſe by this means lay aſleep, and out
Friends on both ſides took that opportunity to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
an accommodation, and we being both pretty
well tir'd with the Law were the more eaſily brought
to compliance; they agreed that all reflexions on either
part ſhould be abſolutely forgotten, and indeed
'twas the beſt courſe they could take, for 'twas not
poſſible to enter into the diſcourſe without recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
on each other. So the matter being concluded
my Father return'd home; but before he went away,
I deſir'd him to conſider of what I had propos'd to
him about my Siſter, which was ſo much his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57806:48"/>
to effect; he promis'd to ſpeak to my
Mother-in-law about it, and two days after he came
home, he ſent me word, that they would give their
conſents to what I propos'd, provided I would do it
without their disburſing any Money; I admir'd, or
rather pity'd the ſordid ſtupidity of theſe people,
who having no more Children, as one might ſay,
ſhould venture the loſs of ſuch an opportunity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their Daughter, rather than part with about
twenty thouſand Franks, purely from Covetuouſneſs,
to ſay no worſe of it, for they wanted no Money;
the Cardinal having for my ſake, to pacifie my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
for the death of my two Brothers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
her to ſell the Commiſſion of the eldeſt,
which he had not diſpos'd of, thinking I had another
Brother to whom he would have given it, by which
ſhe got a good ſum of Money, and more than would
have paid the Portion for my Siſter: However a little
after I receiv'd another Letter which explain'd the
former; in which they told me, that ſince I thought
this ſo good a Match, they deſir'd me that I would
not let it ſlip for want of a little of my aſſiſtance;
that I was in a condition able to do it, and it would
be but a ſmall matter to me, and for which my
Siſter would be eternally oblig'd to me.</p>
            <p>I was damnably vext at this, and ſo I gave them
to underſtand, and my paſſion appear'd ſo in my
countenance, that notwithſtanding all the care I
took to conceal it, the Cardinal eaſily diſcover'd it,
and askt me what the reaſon of it was, but fearing he
ſhould think it was only an artifice of mine to draw
more Money from him I beg'd him to excuſe me tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him 'twas nothing but ſome of my private affairs,
not worth diſturbing his Eminence with; he was
not ſatisfy'd with theſe reaſons, but thinking I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57806:49"/>
equivocated with him, he told me, that he would
have me tell him poſitively the buſineſs, I defended
my ſelf ſtill with the ſame pretence, but the more he
ſaw me unwilling to diſcover my ſelf, the more he
preſt me, ſo I was forc't to tell him, but at the ſame
time told him my fears, leſt he ſhould think I had a
deſign upon him. <hi>I thought,</hi> ſaid he preſently, <hi>'twas
ſome buſineſs of vaſt conſequence, and is this all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Go,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>I give this alſo for your ſake,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut upon condition that you ſhan't call them your Children
any more, for methinks they are mine rather, confidering
what they coſt me every day,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could with all my ſoul have run into the fire for
him if there had been occaſion, I had ſuch a fence of
his bounty and many favours to me, but it being my
misfortune to be only a poor uſeleſs fellow, I content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf to expreſs my paſſion by my zeal for his
ſervice. Thus my Siſter was marry'd at laſt to the
perſon that I had propos'd, and liv'd ſeveral years
with the greateſt happineſs in the world, only that it
pleas'd God ſhe had no Children; but about ſix
years after, her Husband was taken with a fit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and ſhe, who made it a pleaſure to her to
ſuit herſelf to his temper, liv'd with him ſo piouſly,
that ſhe became an example to the whole Province
of <hi>Brettagne;</hi> but both of them growing zealous to
exceſs, he turns Prieſt, and ſhe became a Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary;
and while he was a kind of a Miſſionary in his own
Country, ſhe retir'd into a Convent near <hi>Meulan,</hi> to
which ſhe had been a Benefactrice.</p>
            <p>A few days after the Cardinal had done this laſt
favour for me, he was ſeiz'd with ſo deep a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
that one could not know him almoſt to be
the ſame perſon; I could not forbear expreſſing to
him my trouble for the condition I ſaw him in, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57806:49"/>
the ſatisfaction which it would be to me, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to his recovery; he ſpoke ſlightingly of
it, but yet I could perceive plainly enough, there
was ſomething more than ordinary in it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the pains he took to conceal it from me,
for I had ſtudy'd his humour ſo well, in that long
time I had the honour to have belong'd to him, that
I knew his temper as perfectly as if I had been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
however after ſuch an anſwer 'twas my Duty
to be ſilent, tho I was ſenſibly afflicted to ſee that
his diſcontent rather encreaſt every day. To paſs
away theſe troubleſom hours, which held for two
months at leaſt, I us'd to go to <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> to divert
my ſelf with a Lady, who very well deſerv'd my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and that I might not bring any ſcandal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, I always left my men at the Market Gate, and
went alone on foot to her Houſe. One night as I
came back to my Servants, I ſaw a man go out at
the Gate, who I preſently remember'd to have ſeen
at <hi>Bruffels,</hi> being a perſon whom I knew was employ'd
in Intreigues of State; the unſeaſonable hour of the
night, for 'twas paſt two a clock, made me imagine,
that a man of his character would not be ſo late
abroad for nothing: I preſently acquainted the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
who told me I was mightily to blame I did
not follow him, I told him I had a good mind to
have done it, but that he perceiv'd I knew him, and
I was loth to increaſe his ſuſpicion; he told me I
had done well, and pauſing a while, he askt me
what manner of man he was, enquiring of his age, his
ſtatute, his complexion and the like; I gave him the
beſt deſcription of him I could, and he immediately
gave orders to all the Poſts, Carriers and Coaches,
to take notice if any ſuch like man offer'd to go out of
Town, and laid men upon all the Roads, if poſſible,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57806:50"/>
to apprehend him if he travell'd any other way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>I gueſt by all this, that this very man was the
cauſe of the Cardinals diſturbance; and ſeeing he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to place a Centinel near <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> I told
him there was no body could be ſo proper for that
Poſt as my ſelf, for that I knew him, and he ſhould
not eſcape me; he told me that was true, but on the
other hand he might know me too, and ſo might
miſtruſt ſomething and avoid me; to remove this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and the thoughts of employing any other
perſon, I told him no body could know him ſo well
by the bare deſcription I had given of him, as I could
do with my own Eyes, and therefore any other
might ſuffer him to paſs and not know him, whereas
in a diſguiſe I had in my head, I would defy him to
know me, let him be as cunning as he would; he
askt how I had contriv'd to diſguiſe my ſelf? I told
him I would dreſs my ſelf up like a Beggar-man, and
laying my ſelf down in the ſtreet like a poor Cripple,
I ſhould have the advantage of looking every one
that came by in the face; he lik'd my project very
well, and would needs have a view of me in my
Robes; ſo I bought very privately a pair of old
Crutches, a patch'd ragged Coat, and in ſhort all the
neceſſary accoutrements of an arrant Beggar; and I
plaid my part as well, as if I had been Apprentice to
the Trade: The Cardinal bid me go, and told me,
that if I ſucceeded, I ſhould do him the greateſt
piece of ſervice that ever I did in my life.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to excite me to do my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
ſo having taken my poſt at the corner of the
<hi>Rue de Tournon,</hi> I begun to ſcrew up my countenance
and make a hideous noiſe, as if I had been in great
pain, beſides my poverty; a good many charitable
people gave me Money, but ſeveral Coaches hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57806:50"/>
to come by together, I was afraid my man
ſhould paſs by in the hurry, ſo I plac'd my ſelf as near
the Gate as I could get: The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> that kept guard
there were ſo diſturbed with the noiſe I made, that
they would have driven me away, but that I was fain
to promiſe them to be more quiet; I lay in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
three days and three nights without making
any diſcovery, which made me fancy he might go in
and out by the Port <hi>des Carmes,</hi> ſo I chang'd my
Poſt, and that very night I ſaw him, to my no little
joy, come with a Key in his hand, and open'd the
Gate himſelf: The Cardinal had plac'd a man that
came almoſt every minute to me, to enquire if I had
ſeen any thing, and beſides that there was men poſted
from ſtreet to ſtreet to relieve one another, if there
ſhould be occaſion to follow him; things being thus
diſpos'd they watch'd for his coming out; about an
hour after this, I ſaw another man who came and
open'd the Gate juſt as the t'other had done before, he
was wrapt up in a Cloak ſo that I could not know
him; but order'd the people I mention'd, who attended
for that purpoſe, that they ſhould not fail to dog him
when he came out again, which they did ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly,
that he never had the leaſt ſuſpicion of
them, but went ſtrait to his lodging, without ſo much
as offering to look behind him.</p>
            <p>This effectually diſcover'd the man, who prov'd
to be no leſs a perſon than Monſieur <hi>de Cinqmars,</hi>
Grand Querry of <hi>France,</hi> Son of the Mareſchal
<hi>d' Effiat;</hi> and the Cardinal no ſooner knew it, but
he told me he was an ungrateful man, and he ſhould
dye for it, or he would know why not. Indeed it
was the Cardinal that had advanc'd him at Court,
and to requite him he was plotting his ruine, with
the Duke <hi>d' Orleans,</hi> who after having form'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57806:51"/>
Intreigues againſt the Cardinal, which always
prov'd fatal to thoſe that engag'd in them, was now
hatching another, that was not like to meet with
much better ſucceſs; for the other man was dogg'd in
like manner, and the Cardinal being inform'd, that
he lodg'd at the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germain,</hi> in the <hi>Rue de
Canetes,</hi> he was ſo well obſerv'd, that he could not
ſtir a foot but he knew it; they diſcover'd ſeveral of
their haunts, where one <hi>Fontrailles,</hi> a little crooked,
but very cunning fellow, us'd to be with them: I
preſt the Cardinal to apprehend the Conſpirators,
for it was in his power, and it was needful too, that
he might prevent any deſign that they might have
againſt his perſon; but as all he yet knew of the
buſineſs was but circumſtantial, he waited for plainer
proofs to convict them; he ſent me to lye on the
Road to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> as a Guide to ſuch as rode Poſt, that
I might obſerve all ſuch as went to or return'd from
<hi>Spain;</hi> in the mean time they kept a ſtrict eye upon
the Conſpirators, and the Cardinal having caus'd
<hi>Fontrailles,</hi> to be follow'd to <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> he took poſt
there, with deſign as was thought, to go into <hi>Spain;</hi>
the other man of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> follow'd him a few days
after, and I ſent the Cardinal word they were gone,
and I had conducted them as far as <hi>Bayonne:</hi> 'twas a
very ſimple thing of theſe people to go two of them
the ſame way, but God, who infatuates thoſe who
lye in wait for blood, not only blinded their eyes in
this, but ſuffer'd the <hi>Fleming</hi> to come back the very
ſame way, where I had orders to apprehend him;
he was very much ſurpriz'd, and knowing he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
enough about him to prove him guilty, and
would endanger his life, for he was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
whereas I thought he had been a <hi>Fleming,</hi> he poiſon'd
himſelf with ſomewhat he carry'd about him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57806:51"/>
my perceiving it, which was ſo ſtrong, that he
ſwell'd in leſs than two hours time; I did what I
could to ſave him, but having no ſuſpicion of it, and
no help at hand, the Poiſon had wrought its effect
before a Phyſitian could be had.</p>
            <p>I found quilted in his Boots, the Original Treaty
which <hi>Fontrailles</hi> had been negotiating with the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the name of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
the Duke <hi>de Bouillon</hi> and <hi>de Cinqmars;</hi> and taking
poſt at the ſame time to bring it to his Eminence,
and give him an account of what I had done, I took
the Road to <hi>Languedoc</hi> whether he was gone, with
the King, who was going to the Siege of <hi>Perpignan;</hi> I
found him diſtemper'd both in body and mind, but
chiefly the latter; for <hi>Cinqmars</hi> had prepoſſeſt the
King againſt him, and his friends had juſt given him
notice that he was ruin'd with the King, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to quit <hi>Narbonne,</hi> to be nearer <hi>Provence</hi> and
<hi>Dauphine,</hi> the Governors whereof were at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Cinqmars</hi> had taken upon him to aſſaſſinate
him in that Journey, and they ſay he had promis'd
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to do it, who hated him mortally,
but having ſlipt an opportunity which he had one
day, being alone with him at leaſt a quarter of an
hour, he could never get the like afterwards. His
Eminence receiv'd me as if I had been his good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;
and being not at all concern'd that the man was
dead, ſince I had got the Treaty, he ſent me with it
to the King, after he had taken a Copy of it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Having made me the Confident of his preſent
trouble, I took the liberty to adviſe him to keep
the Original by him, and ſend only the Copy to the
King, ſince no body could be anſwerable for what
might happen, and if they ſhould chance to get it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57806:52"/>
from me, he would be at a loſs to make out what he
pretended; but he told me in the condition things
were, there was a neceſſity to undeceive the King
immediately, and that if he did not ſend him the
Original, perhaps he would not believe the Copy:
Upon this anſwer I went away immediately; and
the Count <hi>de Charoſt</hi> who was in waiting, very civilly
introduc'd me to the Kings preſence. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone I ſurpriz'd him extreamly with the preſent I
made him, he communicated it to no body, and askt
very kindly how the Cardinal did: I told him, as I
was inſtructed, that he was very ill, which was the
reaſon that he had not waited upon his Majeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his order; for I forgot to tell one thing
that was very particular, which was, that before
the Cardinal came to <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> he had ſent to tell the
King he was coming to Court, and that the King
had anſwer'd, he ſhould not give himſelf that trouble,
but might ſtay in the Country for the recovery of
his health.</p>
            <p>This was the reaſon why they told him he was
undone, and alſo why he retreated towards <hi>Provence</hi>
and <hi>Dauphine:</hi> In the mean time, as he was the
greateſt Politician of the age, he knew there was no
way ſo likely to recover him in the Kings favour, as to
reduce the King to ſome want of him; for the King,
who was a timorous irreſolute Prince, was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of directing himſelf in the leaſt difficulties:
The Mareſchal <hi>de Grammont,</hi> who was wholly devoted
to the Cardinal, play'd this card for him, and ſuffering
himſelf to be beaten on purpoſe by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in
the battle of <hi>Honnecourt,</hi> he left by that means all the
Frontier Country of <hi>Picardy</hi> open to the Enemy; the
King upon this news immediately has recourſe to the
Cardinal, and he having made a fair pretence not to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57806:52"/>
come to Court, was now not only order'd to come
away with all ſpeed, but the King goes part of the
way himſelf to meet him, ſuppoſing he was not able
to make haſte enough; ſo the Siege of <hi>Perpignan</hi> was
broken off.</p>
            <p>'Twas in this interim that I brought the King the
Treaty that I mention'd; he bid me go back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and let no body know that I had been with
him; I met the Cardinal on the way, who was not
ſo ſick but he could follow me, and being come to
the King, Monſieur <hi>de Cinqmars</hi> was immediately
apprehended, and Monſieur <hi>de Thou</hi> to whom he had
committed the ſecret. The King careſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
moſt paſſionately at their meeting; but this great
man had conceiv'd ſo much indignation in his mind,
at the Kings uſage of him after ſo many ſervices,
that he fell into a diſtemper call'd the Hemorrhoides,
which tormented him extreamly; all this however
did not eclipſe the vigour of his mind, which was
not to be equall'd tho under the languiſhment of a
cruel diſtemper; he made them pull down the ſides
of the door to bring him in as he lay in ſtate upon the
Bed; and he was carry'd all the way on mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards moſt commonly performing
that ſervice.</p>
            <p>I was extreamly caſt down to ſee my Maſter in this
condition, while the Court generally rejoyc'd at it;
for he had ruin'd the fortunes of a great many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, tho he had rais'd the Glory of the
King, ſo that every one would have been glad to
have ſeen him dead, in hopes to recover themſelves
again, which the weakneſs of the Kings capacity
gave them reaſon to think would be eaſy if he were
out of the way. The King, like a moſt Chriſtian
Prince, ſhut himſelf up often in his Cloſet to pray,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57806:53"/>
but as Prayers without Endeavours are fruitleſs, the
Court was full of caballings in prejudice of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
In the mean time they enter'd proceſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Monſieur <hi>de Cinqmars,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Thou,</hi>
whom they had ſent to <hi>Lyonn,</hi> and committed to the
Caſtle <hi>de Pierre-Enciſe.</hi> The Youth of one, for
Monſieur <hi>de Cinqmars</hi> was not above two and twenty,
and the Reputation of the other, made them to be
univerſally pity'd, and open'd the mouths of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
againſt the Cardinal, for he was not very
well belov'd by the Populace, who exclaim'd at his
Cruelty, not regarding the Juſtice he had now on
his ſide, nor conſidering the crimes they were guilty
of; they cry'd out he was mercileſs and blood-thirſty,
and ript up the ſtory of the Mareſchal <hi>de Marillac.</hi>
His Eminence being told of this, for he lov'd to be
told whatever was ſaid of him, would ſay to me
ſometimes, that he was very unhappy, that 'twas
allow'd to private men to purſue even to death, one
that attempts to aſſaſſinate them; but that for him,
he muſt not be allow'd, beſides the particular attempts
upon his own life, to take notice of thoſe made upon
the Royal Authority, but Envy would cenſure all his
proceedings as ſo many acts of Injuſtice. I have ſeen
him ſo affected, when he has been talking to me of
theſe kind of matters, that he could hardly refrain
weeping, and when I would reply to him, that he
ought not to regard publick fame, which oftentimes
ſaid it knew not what; he reply'd, that 'twas that
nevertheleſs which made a man immortal, and 'twas
hard to take ſo much pains for that ſort of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and yet at laſt leave the world with the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>He ſpoke theſe things with ſuch ſenſible accents of
ſorrow, that ſufficiently teſtify'd the greatneſs of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57806:53"/>
his Soul. In the mean time they cut off the heads of
Monſieur <hi>de Cinqmars,</hi> and of Monſieur <hi>de Thou;</hi> and
Monſieur <hi>de Bouillon</hi> had run the ſame fate, having
been ſeiz'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> had he not bought his life with
the loſs of his Principality of <hi>Sedan.</hi> People admir'd the
Cardinal ſhould ſpare him, having had ſeveral Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his ill will, for this was not the firſt time,
that he had attempted to embroil the Kingdom, and
eſpecially to ſide in all occaſions againſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
in ſhort, 'twas but t'other day that he had been
pardon'd for being concern'd in the Rebellion of the
Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> whom he had not only ſhelter'd in
his Houſe, but had taken up Arms for him; but all
that can be ſaid to this is, that the Cardinal could
forget injuries to himſelf, when the Honour of the
King and Kingdom requir'd it.</p>
            <p>Let them ſay what they will, this was the man
born to lay the Foundations of the preſent greatneſs
of <hi>France,</hi> and whom all good <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ought to
have wiſht had been immortal; but God, who puts
an end to all things, having determin'd him to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
limits, which he could not out-live, took him
from hence, and he dy'd, to the inexpreſſible grief of
all his Servants. I had foreſeen it two or three
months before, for his diſtemper was attended with
viſible tokens of death from the beginning, and I
was troubled extreamly to ſee moſt people rejoyce at
it: The King himſelf was doubtful of his recovery,
tho he had thoſe about him that inſinutated a notion
into him, that the Death of the Cardinal would
be his happineſs: This was ſomething ſtrange, if we
reflect, that this great Miniſter, who found things in
ſuch a ſorry condition when he firſt came to the
Helm of the Government, had reduc'd the rebellious
<hi>Hugonots,</hi> had humbled the Houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57806:54"/>
taking from it the Kingdoms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi>
and the greateſt part of <hi>Alſace;</hi> ſav'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and in
ſhort had done ſo many wonders, that Poſterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
already to acknowledge, that a man who did
ſuch great things, muſt have ſomething in him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
He told me as he lay a dying, that he had
always lov'd me above any of his Servants, and that
he was ſorry he had done no more for me; that if the
King would take his advice, it ſhould be to employ
me in affairs of the greateſt conſequence, for that I
had all the Conduct, Courage and Wit that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to accompliſh any deſign, all which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
in ſeveral caſes.</p>
            <p>If I had ever been ſenſible of the marks of his
eſteem in his life time, I was much more ſo now, all
his paſt favours came at once into my mind, and
thinking what I was going to loſe, and that in a
moment, this man who had made all <hi>Europe</hi> temble,
ſhould be no more, I was ſo afflicted, that I am ſure
if the preſent ſence of it had continu'd but two days,
I ſhould have been diſtracted. His Eyes were no
ſooner clos'd, but the King made it appear that he
diſlik'd all he had done, for he immediately recall'd
all thoſe who had fled for fear of the Cardinals pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
this gave me ſuch an averſion to the Court, that
I reſolv'd not to continue in it a quarter of an hour
longer: Several Perſons of Quality invited me to
their Service; the Duke <hi>d' Orleans</hi> ſpoke to me by
<hi>Egremont</hi> one of his Gentlemen, who to prevail with
me, told me, I needed look no farther for my Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
than to him, who had made his fortune in
the ſervice of that Prince, that he had gotten two
hundred thouſand Crowns, and that if he ſhould live
but to be fifty years old, he did not queſtion but to
get twice as much, but he did not tell me that he had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57806:54"/>
got all this by ways that I ſhould not care to practice;
he plaid at Tables with his Maſter, and having a
parcel of Sharpers that went halves with him, they
made ſport for the Duke to laugh at, which caus'd
him to commit ſeveral errors in play, and gave him
opportunity to play falſe, or to ſet up a Game or two
more than there was: Thus, as I ſaid, he came to
get ſo much Money, but as ſuch gains ſeldom proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
he grew ſo litigious, that he ſpent all that in
Law which he had gotten at play.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> alſo ſpoke to me by the Duke
<hi>de Rochefoucaut,</hi> who began now to appear at Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t,
from whence he had been a long time baniſht with
the reſt; but tho he was a Prince of the greateſt
Politics, he did not ſhow it in this, to ſend a perſon
to me that was one of the greateſt Enemies my Maſter
had. I was juſt going to retire my ſelf when the
Queen Mother did me the honour to ſend me word,
that ſhe would have me go to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to do her a
ſmall piece of ſervice there; I was amaz'd at this
propoſal, from one who I knew could not love any
of the Creatures of my Maſter, from whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
ſhe had received ſo much mortification; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
other things, he remov'd all her Friends from
her by one means or another; and had ſo little reſpect
for her, or rather ſo much zeal for the public ſervice,
that upon information that ſhe had receiv'd Letters
from <hi>Spain,</hi> he had caus'd her to be ſearch'd, without
any regard to modeſty, or the reſpect due to her Sex:
This was an inſolence ſhe would never forgive him,
and which I thought alſo ſhould make her extend her
reſentment to any thing that belong'd to his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
I believ'd too, that this was only propos'd to
me, that they might have an opportunity to take me
off, and that Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> having inform'd them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57806:55"/>
of my eſcape out of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> intended, if ſhe could
get me thither, to beſtow that upon me which
eſcap'd before; being poſſeſt with this opinion,
return'd her Majeſty thanks for the honour ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
me; but being not contented with my
excuſes, I was fain to ſhift it off with telling her, that
I was employ'd in the Cardinals time in that Court,
where I was ſo well known, that the way to have an
affair effectually miſcarry, was to put it into my
hands.</p>
            <p>Thus I conceal'd my fear, and dextrouſly put her
off with excuſes; but the Queen, who had, juſt as I
gueſt, been inform'd by Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> of
what had happen'd to me in that Country, told
me, that I ſhould not trouble my ſelf, for ſhe knew
what I meant, but that going from her I ſhould be
ſafe, and that ſhe would give me her royal word for
my ſecurity: Such a continu'd importunity, in ſpight of
all I could ſay, made me ſuſpect her the more, ſo I
thankt her Majeſty again, and begg'd her pardon; and
ſhe ſent in my room <hi>Morville,</hi> one the Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
helpt her to, who ſince the death of my Maſter
was become Chief Miniſter of State. This errand
was to diſcourſe with <hi>la Porte,</hi> the Dutcheſs <hi>de
Chevreuſe</hi>'s Confident, and to know from his own
mouth, if 'twas poſſible to gain the Count <hi>de</hi> ..... who
was the Archdukes Favourite; that in caſe of
the Kings death, which 'twas thought could not be
far off, there might be an Army ready upon the
frontier to aſſure the Regency to the Queen; ſhe
made no queſtion of gaining this Favourite by the
help of Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe:</hi> But Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi>
who knew already what power ſhe had with the
Queen, and was loth ſhe ſhould increaſe it by a new
ſervice ſo conſiderable as this, too readily inſinuated
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57806:55"/>
into her, that <hi>la Porte</hi> would manage this matter by
himſelf with leſs noiſe and more ſafety; and the
Queen who had not ſo much affection for Madam <hi>de
Chevreuſe</hi> as ſhe had formerly, was eaſily perſwaded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morville</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> eaſily gain'd <hi>la
Porte,</hi> with the hopes of being made firſt Page to the
King, he charg'd him whatever he did, not to reveal
it to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Chevreuſe;</hi> and he, who ow'd
his fortune to her, who from a Mechanic Taylor,
which was his Trade, had been rais'd by her, even
to her Bed, readily conſented to betray his Miſtriſs
and Benefactrice, in hopes of further advancement.
The Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... was more in favour with
Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> than <hi>la Porte</hi> thought of; for ſhe
being an amorous Lady had given him unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proofs of her eſteem, ſo that <hi>la Porte</hi> had no
ſooner broken the ſecret to him, but he diſcover'd it all
to his Miſtriſs; 'tis impoſſible to expreſs the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes
reſentment, ſhe flew out in all the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
language ſhe could think of to <hi>la Porte;</hi> but he
who was a fellow of a very ſharp wit, imagining
that ſo great a confidence of the Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... could
not proceed but from an affection that had met with
ſome ſoft returns from her; inſtead of appearing ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at what ſhe ſaid, return'd her reproaches upon
her ſelf for her Inconſtancy; telling her, ſhe had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
this diſcovery at the price of her honour, and
that a man who was abus'd in ſo ſenſible a part as
his Love, ought to revenge himſelf by all poſſible
methods. The Dutcheſs, tho ſhe was nettled at
this ſort of return, eſpecially from him, and was
going to caſheer him, yet on ſecond thoughts ſhe
durſt not venture to do ſo, for fear he ſhould return
into <hi>France,</hi> and give the Queen an account what a
life ſhe led, and of a thouſand intreagues ſhe had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57806:56"/>
been concern'd in againſt her Majeſty; and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
too, that he would ſacrifice her to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>de Schomberg</hi>'s Lady, who after having reſiſted
ſollicitations from the King himſelf, yet as report
went, did not ſtick to admit to her arms ſo pitiful a
Fellow as this.</p>
            <p>The Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... who was jealous of <hi>la Porte,</hi>
was ſurpriz'd that after all this, the Dutcheſs ſtill
carry'd it but coldly to him, and did not throw off <hi>la
Porte</hi> as he expected, and to free himſelf from a Rival
was reſolv'd to poiſon him; but <hi>la Porte,</hi> who knew
not only the humour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but was alſo
ſenſible of the reſentment of the Dutcheſs, kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon his Guard, and would not eat or drink but
at his own houſe, and continu'd to do thus till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into <hi>France;</hi> which caution of his, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
was the ſaving of his life.</p>
            <p>During all theſe Intreagues the King declin'd ſo in
his health, that 'twas plain to all the world he could
not live long, and Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> having ſo
much influence upon the Queen, attended with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
for the news of his death, not only that ſhe
might be recall'd to Court, but not queſtioning the
raiſing of her fortune; wherefore to oblige the Queen,
and fix her ſelf in her Majeſtys opinion, ſhe reſolv'd
to effect that by her own intereſt, which the Queen
had attempted to do by an underhand treaty with <hi>la
Porte;</hi> but fearing that as long as <hi>la Porte</hi> was with
her, the Comte <hi>de</hi> ..... would never heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in her deſign, ſhe concerted matters with <hi>la
Porte,</hi> and agreed with him that he ſhould return into
<hi>France</hi> to manage her part with the Queen; by
which means, tho not without regret, he conſented
to leave her to his Rival, in hopes of advancing his
Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57806:56"/>
Indeed, the promiſe they had made him of being
Page to the King, had ſo gain'd upon him, that he
ſlighted every thing for it; ſo that as ſoon as ever he
came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he went away to the Queen, whom
he told, that not being able to ſucceed in his negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for her Service, Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
it, and would doubtleſs perform it better
than he could have done. The Queen, who had
ſuch confidence in the Cardinal, as we before noted,
having acquainted him with this, inſtead of approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, he was exceedingly troubled at it, and told
the Queen ſhe was going to ruine her ſelf, for if the
King ſhould come to diſcover what had paſt ſhe was
undone; his averſion to Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> being
invincible, that 'twas well enough to entertain <hi>la Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
becauſe he was lookt upon as a Perſon out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and therefore would not be ſuſpected, and
might ſome time or other be of uſe to them; but
for Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe,</hi> it was neither ſafe to hold
any correſpondence with her, nor could ſhe be any
way ſerviceable at this time.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who knew this to be very true, was the
eaſier to be perſwaded, ſo they ſent Madam <hi>de Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſe</hi>
word, that they were very much oblig'd to
her for the pains ſhe had taken, but that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
poſture of affairs, they did not think fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in thoſe meaſures any further: In the mean
time, the Cardinal ſet <hi>la Porte</hi> at work upon the
Queen, to leſſen her eſteem for Madam <hi>de Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuſe,</hi>
and made that ſervice the further condition of
the preferment they had promiſed him; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
they delay'd till after the Kings death,
and then gave it him as if it had been at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe,</hi> who as cunning a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as ſhe might be otherways, was made a property
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57806:57"/>
in this caſe, to take that for a favour done on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that was the reward of his Treaſon in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, 'twas a Maſter-piece of Policy
in the Cardinal, after having put by the Queen,
from thoſe methods ſhe had taken ſo much to her
advantage, to find out other ways to ſecure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
to her. He fear'd Monſieur <hi>Deſnoirs</hi> moſt,
who was Secretary for the War, and would have
been very glad to have him remov'd, and yet
made uſe of him to make the propoſal to the King,
and he had two deſigns in ſo doing: firſt, if the King
conſented to make the Queen Regent, then he had
effectually oblig'd her, as being the firſt contriver
of it; but if the King ſhould reſent it ill and fly ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
into a paſſion at it, then 'twould diſgrace his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary:
Monſieur <hi>Deſnoirs</hi> was ſuch a Fool, as to
be prevail'd on to engage in this affair; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that 'twould be a difficult thing, he ſet upon the
Kings weak ſide, that is, he engag'd his Confeſſor
in the matter; who repreſented to him, that having
in probability not long to live, he ought to think of
ſettling his Conſcience; that nothing was ſo much
requir'd of us at our going out of this World, as
forgiving our Enemies, and that he ought now to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all the diſcontent, that had been between him
and the Queen; that he had already recall'd to Court
thoſe whom he had ſuſpected on her account, that
nothing remain'd now, but to give her ſome Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of his reconciliation to her: that the preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
offerr'd him one; which was to make her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of her Children, a thing ſo naturally her right, that
the Law excluded all other Relations from pretending
to it: That if he did otherwiſe, 'twould look as if
he had ſtill ſome reſerve on his mind, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57806:57"/>
was ſo dangerous, as to equivocate with his
Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Confeſſor was very ready to go upon this
fooliſh Errand, whether that he thought himſelf
oblig'd to it by his Office, or that he thought to
do a piece of Service to Monſieur <hi>Deſnoirs;</hi> but he
was immediately caſheer'd for his pains; and the
King coming to know afterwards, that this came
from Monſieur <hi>Deſnoirs,</hi> he ſerv'd him in the ſame
manner, giving his Office of Secretary to Monſieur
<hi>le Tellier,</hi> who is now Chancellour of <hi>France.</hi> The
Fortune of this Monſieur <hi>le Tellier</hi> and the Marquis
<hi>de Louvois</hi> his Son, being ſo ſtrangely great, that they
ſeem to equal that of Soveraign Princes, if not to
exceed them. I ſhall ſpeak a word to it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that where Merit is really the foundation,
there is no ſtructur can be too great to build upon it.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>le Tellier</hi>'s Father was one of the Long
Robe, and brought up his Son in the ſame Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and having made him capable of buſineſs, he
had a mind to get him the Office of the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curet
<hi>de Chatelet,</hi> which is a thing independent from
any of the other Courts, and very conſiderable. He
that ſold it having ſeveral Cuſtomers about it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
him to them all, on condition he ſhould pay
the Money down at a certain time, which was very
ſhort. But wanting 10000 Crowns to make up the
ſum, he had like to have loſt it, when Monſieur
<hi>de Pelletier,</hi> who had an Office in the ſame Court,
lent him the Money; ſo that all obſtacles being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
he entred upon the place, and behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with ſo much reputation, that he was lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a Man, that had not his fellow for wiſdom;
but all this did not prevent a very odd accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling
him. Being one day riding thro the Town,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57806:58"/>
there happen'd ſome Tumult in the Streets, and his
Office (being a Magiſtrate) obliging him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it: The Grooms of the Kings Horſes laid
hold of his Bridle, and not knowing who he was,
they carry'd him with them into the Great Stable,
but the Querrys who knew him well enough made
their excuſe, and made the Grooms ask his Pardon;
he was ſo good humour'd, that he made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of this violence; which if he had, might
have brought them into a great deal of trouble. In
the mean time, Monſieur <hi>de Bouillon</hi> having ſome
publick buſineſs with him, and finding him to be a
Man of a prodigious capacity, he perſwaded him to
reſign his Office, and to come into the Council.</p>
            <p>'Twas by doing this, that he began to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
known to my Maſter, whom I have often heard
ſpeak of him, very much to his advantage; when
he appear'd at the Bar, he met with all the marks
of eſteem that uſe to be given to Perſons of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and at laſt was preferr'd to be Secretary of State,
as I have mentioned before: but it was upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nevertheleſs, that he ſhould pay Monſieur
<hi>Deſnoirs</hi> 400000 Franks, which he ſent to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
but he refus'd them, expecting that if
any ſudden Change ſhould happen at Court, he
might get into his place again: So Monſieur <hi>de Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
had his Money again, and Monſieur <hi>Deſnoirs</hi>
dying quickly after, the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> with the
conſent of the Queen Mother, gave him this ſum,
excluding the Heirs of <hi>Deſnoirs;</hi> this and ſuch like
Obligations fixt him in their Intereſts, and he gave
good marks of his Ability in the nice occaſions, which
happen'd about that time; the Civil War being juſt
then broke out, in all which he continu'd firm in
the Intereſt of the Queen Mother and Cardinal
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57806:58"/>
               <hi>Mazarin,</hi> whom he always look'd upon as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.</p>
            <p>After the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Death, he ſo gain'd
upon the young King, who had wit enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
who ſerv'd him faithfully and who not;
that the ſame reaſons, which oblig'd him to value
Monſieur <hi>de Tellier,</hi> oblig'd him at the ſame time,
to apprehend Monſieur <hi>de Ponquet.</hi> There had been
ſome difference between theſe two, which made
People think, that Monſieur <hi>de Tellier</hi> did contribute
underhand to his diſgrace; but to let the world ſee
how they were miſtaken, he never ſo much as ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the King or meddled with the proceſs; either
of which, if he had done, the other had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
been loſt.</p>
            <p>The King had no prime Miniſter at all after the
Death of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but if any body could
pretend to that place, it was without doubt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Tellier,</hi> he had two Sons and one Daughter.
The Daughter is married to the Marquis <hi>de Villequier:</hi>
who is now <hi>Duke d' Aumont;</hi> for his Sons, he
bred up the Eldeſt, who is the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi>
to Buſineſs, and the youngeſt to the Church, and
who is now Coadjutor to the Arch-biſhoprick of
<hi>Rhiems,</hi> under Cardinal <hi>Antoine;</hi> by which means he
is certain to be, one time or other, Duke and Peer
of <hi>France;</hi> and the other had the aſſurance of being
Secretary of State after his Father. His great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
are ſo freſh in the memory of all Men, that
'tis needleſs to mention them; all the great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of <hi>Europe</hi> were form'd in his head, and he
manages the place at this day, with as much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as my Maſter did in his time, which is enough
for any man to ſay in his Commendation; only I
muſt be allow'd to make this difference, between
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57806:59"/>
the preſent time, and the days paſt, that my Maſter
was ſo far from being ſeconded, by a vigorous young
King, that he had none oppos'd his directions,
more than him who he endeavour'd to ſerve moſt;
whereas his preſent Majeſty, is the firſt a Horſeback,
to execute thoſe Deſigns, that have been projected
in his Cabinet.</p>
            <p>However it was, the Services both of the Father
and the Son, could not be better rewarded than
they are now. The Father is Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi>
the greateſt honour that can be conferr'd upon the
Gown, and who is the leading Man, both at Court
and on the Bench: The Son is Secretary of State,
chief Miniſter, and in a word, the Perſon on whom
the King relies, in matters of the greateſt moment,
whether for Peace or War. In the mean time, I
muſt not forget one Circumſtance, which proves the
gratitude of both the Father and the Son. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Colbert,</hi> who had the Adminiſtration of the
Finances, being dead about two or three years ago,
they procur'd his place, for the Son of Mr. <hi>Pellitier,</hi>
whom we have ſpoken of, as a recompence for
the favour they had receiv'd from his Father.</p>
            <p>I have been a little larger than ordinary upon the
riſe and fortune of the Chancellor, and the Marquis
<hi>de Louvois</hi> his Son; 'twill be acknowledg'd not to
be ſo remote as may be thought, being to relate in
what follows, many great Actions, which have paſt
under their Miniſtry, and I ought to give an Idea of
thoſe, which manag'd the Government, to ſhew
that ſuch Maſter-pieces of Policy, could not proceed
from any Perſons, but ſuch as were perfectly verſt
in the niceſt affairs of State.</p>
            <p>But to return to my own Caſe, ever ſince I refus'd
the Negotiation at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> I was frown'd upon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57806:59"/>
every where, and was ſo ſlighted by the Queen and
the Miniſter, that I reſolv'd to retire. The King
in the mean time, having exil'd Monſieur <hi>Deſnoirs,</hi>
for having but offer'd to ſpeak in favour of the
Queen, did not however proceed with the ſame vigor
againſt Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> nor <hi>Chavigny</hi> who had
eſpous'd her Intereſts: 'Tis true, they did it genteely,
and inſtead of propoſing it downright to the King,
to make her Regent, they only advis'd him while he
was in a condition to do it, to ſettle his Affairs as he
pleas'd they ſhould be manag'd after his Death; that
the Infancy of his Children requir'd this at his hands;
at leaſt he would have this ſatisfaction at his Death,
to know what ſhould become of them; whereas, if
he omitted it, they would be expos'd to ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen
Accidents.</p>
            <p>The King could not deny, but what they ſaid was
highly reaſonable, but he met with a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
difficulties, aſſoon as ever he went about this
ſettlement; he could think of no body to leave the
Government of his Children to, but the Queen or the
D. of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Brother; but the latter appear'd to
him, to be of too unſettled and unquiet Spirit, and
the other too much of a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> ſo he took the
middle of theſe Extreams and joyn'd them both in
the Adminiſtration, hoping they would temper one
another, and perform the duty of ſo great a Charge
the better: It happen'd to this Contrivance, as it
does to a State that continues Neuter, while its
Neighbours are fighting out their Quarrel, neither
one nor t'other were pleas'd with what the King had
done for them, and new Plots were ſet at work on
both ſides, to make him alter his reſolution; the
Courtiers obſerv'd the Contrivances of both Parties,
but none knew which would prevail, or who ſhould
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57806:60"/>
govern the Queen, if ſhe ſhould happen to get the
Power abſolutely into her hands, for ſhe carry'd it ſo
fair to all ſides, that ſhe had every day new favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> did his utmoſt to incline
the Scale on his ſide; and to the end that the
Queen might be prevail'd on, by his zeal to her
Service, he improv'd every moment of the Kings
Life, to endeavour to gain him to do ſomething
more in her favour: He laid it before him, how a
Mother had natural Obligations, and would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinguiſh the Intereſt of her own Children,
from that of the neareſt Relations; that 'twas not
the ſame thing with reſpect to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
for he who durſt ſeveral times take up Arms againſt
his Majeſty himſelf, would make no ſcruple to do
the like againſt a Child; that in the moſt flouriſhing
condition of the State, his Birth occaſion'd that a
Multitude of the Nobility made their Court to him,
which they would have more reaſon to do, when
joyn'd with ſo great an Authority. The King was
not mov'd with all this, but anſwer'd that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care of all, by the form of Government,
that he had ſettled in his Declaration; and ſo dy'd
without making any alteration.</p>
            <p>I had been ſo us'd to the Court, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the reſolution I had taken to retreat from
it, I could not bring my ſelf to do it. I follow'd
the fortune of the Duke <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> who was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to whom my Maſter had bequeath'd both his
Eſtate and his Title; ſome ſay he was his Son by
Madam <hi>d' Eguillon,</hi> but he had not wit enough to
be the Son of ſo great a Man, which makes me give
no credit to that report: However it was, finding he
did nothing worthy of that Name, I took my leave of
the Court, without giving him any reaſons for it, being
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57806:60"/>
very melancholly at parting from a place, which I
thought was the moſt charming in the world. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to engage in the War, which was very hot on
all ſides on our Frontiers; for tho I had loſt a great
deal of time, yet I found my ſelf able and vigorous
enough, as I thought, for the hardſhip of the Service.
This oblig'd me to make my court to Mr. <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tellier,</hi>
to whom I was particularly enough known, to give
me ground to hope for ſomething from him: But as
he was all policy, he ſpoke to the Cardinal of me,
who forbid him giving me any Employment: I
knew immediately that he muſt have receiv'd ſome
ſuch order as this, for Monſieur <hi>le Tellier</hi> did not
ſpeak to me as he us'd to do, and inſtead of giving
me poſitive aſſurances, as he had done before, that
I ſhould have what I demanded, he put me off now
with telling me, he ſhould be very glad to do me any
Service; This was a word ſo cuſtomary with him,
when he intended to do nothing at all, that I e'ne took
it forgranted: In the mean time, I was vext that he
had held me in ſuſpence ſo long, and Monſieur <hi>de la
Chaſtres</hi> having obſerv'd, that I was grumbling and
fretting, as I came out of his Office, he told me that
if I pleas'd he would find me out a Maſter, who
would make up all my loſſes and ſorrow for my old
one: I told him I ſhould be glad of it, provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, that it ſhould not be the Duke <hi>d' Orleans,</hi>
and he naming to me at the ſame time, the Duke
<hi>de Beaufort,</hi> I anſwer'd him I had always a great
eſteem for him, but he being engag'd in Intereſts
contrary to the late Cardinal my Maſter, he could
not put any Confidence in me; nor indeed could I
ſerve him heartily: he askt me if I thought I did
wiſely, in talking at that rate, and that after having
liv'd ſo long at Court, I had made ſo little advantage
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57806:61"/>
of what I had ſeen, as not to know that nothing but
Intereſt rules opinion: that as long as Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>
was alive, I did well not to engage with any of
his Enemies; but now at this time when I was ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the preſent Miniſter, I ought to joyn my ſelf
to the Intereſt and Friendſhip, of thoſe who had
cauſe to hate him, and if any one was on thoſe terms
with him, 'twas certainly the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who
had been robb'd by him of the Queen Mothers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
when but for him, he might by his power
with her, have done any thing for his Friends; that
he was a brisk bold Prince, and knew how to value
a man of worth, and one, in ſhort, whoſe Service he
was very glad he had entred into; that if I pleas'd
he would ſpeak to him for me, and 'twould be
enough to eſtabliſh his Confidence in me, but to
tell him the averſion I had to the Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difficulty I had to quit the Court, and the
eager deſire I had alſo to revenge my ſelf of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
made me the readier to accept this offer; ſo
he ſpoke to Monſieur <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who expreſt a
very extraordinary deſire to have me. And having
told him that I ſhould find him at <hi>Anet,</hi> whether
he was going, I parted from <hi>Paris</hi> with one of my

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57806:61"/>
the Leads of the Houſe, who nodded their heads at
him, and thinking they had been Women, <hi>Morbleu,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>they laugh at us;</hi> as he was ſaying this, they
hollow'd and threw ſtones at us again; and now we
could eaſily diſcern, that they were not Women as
we thought, but Men, who did not conceal themſelves,
but began to Jeer at us and Banter us, and to over
do it too, ſo as 'twas not to be born: So my Friend
drew a Piſtol, and a Stone coming at him, and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him on the Arm, he made no more ado but
fir'd, and narrowly miſt killing the perſon that he
ſhot at; and was going to draw his other Piſtol, when
the people of the place told us, that it was the
Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who was there with all his Court.
This advice came too late. We took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we ſhould be immediately purſu'd; and having
no way left, but to ride for it, we ſet Spurs to our
Horſes, and made off as faſt as we could: We were
hardly got to the top of <hi>La Montagne de bons hommes,</hi>
when 5 or 6 Horſemen ſhew'd themſelves coming
full ſpeed after us; and tho our Horſes were all in a
foam, we ſpurr'd on amain, without giving them
breath: They had need have been good Horſes, to
have ſecur'd us from theſe purſuers, for they came
on as if they had flown, and were almoſt up with
us, before we got to the <hi>Bois de Bologne;</hi> ſo that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no way to eſcape, we reſolv'd to face them;
and my Friend who wanted no Courage, was going
to fire the Piſtol he had left, when one of his Friends
being of the Party, and knowing him, call'd him by
his Name, and told him ſince 'twas he, all was well,
and he might put up his Piſtol again, at the ſame
time running to him, he embrac'd him; ſo the reſt
put up their Piſtols alſo: we very civilly told them,
that if we had known it had been the Duke <hi>de Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57806:62"/>
we ſhould not have behav'd our ſelves as we
did; and they aſſur'd us on the other hand, that if
they had known it had been us, they ſhould have
us'd us better: But I queſtion whether they would
or not; for a man that would go a Sharping, and
catching Cloaks off Peoples backs in the Night, on
the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> us'd to do,
would not have been eaſily prevail'd on, to be civil
to us.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel being thus ended, nothing would
ſerve them, but we muſt go back with them, which
I oppos'd with all my Power; as well for that I
would willingly be punctual at the place I was going
to, as alſo becauſe I knew I ſhould be ſuſpected in
that Company: but all I could ſay was to no purpoſe,
ſo I was oblig'd to go with them. We found the
Duke <hi>d' Orleans,</hi> with five or ſix others engag'd in
a Debauch; he never took notice that I had liv'd
with Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> or that I had refus'd his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but ſet us down at the Table, where having
drank exceſſive hard, he had a mind to ſhow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Prince; that is, to have a Frolick, that ſhould
have ſomething in it extraordinary. There was the
Collonel of the Regiment of <hi>Languedoc</hi> there, whoſe
Name was <hi>Wallon,</hi> a prodigious fat fellow, and took
ſo little heed to his ſhape, that inſtead of Dyetting
himſelf for it, all his delight was in cramming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with good Cheer: This Collonel was to lye
down flat upon his back, and the Duke was to eat
an Omelette of Eggs upon his Belly; <hi>Wallon</hi> lay
down very readily, and expos'd his bare Belly for
their Table, and the Cook clapt the Omelette out
of the Pan upon it; while he was ſo drunk that
either he did not feel it burn him, or elſe in point of
honour he would not confeſs it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57806:62"/>
After every one had eaten of this Ragout, and
expreſt their ſatisfaction with it, both the Duke and
all his Company, they muſt needs go all to <hi>Paris,</hi> to
Madam <hi>la Neveu,</hi> a Lady who was very well known:
let my buſineſs be what it would, I was fain to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them in ſpight of my Teeth; They did there
all they were capable of doing in the condition they
were in, till the woman of the Houſe, being enrag'd
at their uſage of her, and ſome other Whores they had
ſent for: The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to pacify her, told
her he would make her ſome ſport; ſo he ſent for a
Commiſſaire, under pretence of ſome diſturbance
in the Houſe: The Commiſſaire came well guarded,
and the Duke <hi>d' Orleans</hi> having hid us in a Chamber
out of ſight, there was no body appear'd, but he and
<hi>Wallon</hi> the Collonel; they were both lying on the
Bed, with Madam <hi>Neveu</hi> in the middle; and the
Commiſſaire thinking now he had catcht them in
the fact, and not knowing who they were, bid
them get up, but they refuſing, he bid his followers
pull them out by force; and they beginning to lay
hands on them, they were ſurpriz'd to ſee us ſally
out of our Hole, and the more, for that we did not
come on as if we intended to attack them, but with
our Hats in our hands, making our Reſpects to the
perſon they were a going to lug out of the Bed;
they were further ſurpriz'd when they ſaw the Rich
Habit, that was brought to the Duke, when he
went to dreſs him; but when they ſaw the Blue
Ribbon, they were Thunder-ſtruck and perfectly
aſtoniſht: The Commiſſaire began then to ſee his
Error, and threw himſelf at the Dukes Feet to beg
his Mercy; the Duke bid him fear nothing, and he
ſhould come off cheap enough: We did not know
what he would do, but he was not long a contriving:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57806:63"/>
he call'd down the other Women, who had not yet
appear'd, and ſet them on the Bed-ſide in a row, and
taking one at a time, he made the Commiſſaire and
all his Attendants naked in their Shirts, with a wax
Candle in their hands, come and do homage to
ſomething he ſhow'd them. thereby to make, as he
call'd it, an honourable ſatisfaction to the Ladies.</p>
            <p>After this, we had every one Liberty to go whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we pleaſ'd, and having loſt a great deal of time,
I was afraid that Monſienr <hi>de Beaufort</hi> would be got
to <hi>Anet</hi> before me, ſo I Travell'd all night, for fear
he ſhould think I would diſappoint him; but when I
came there I found he was not yet arriv'd, which I
was very glad of; But two days being paſt, and not
a word of him to be heard, I could not tell what to
make of it; Being very impatient and not knowing
how to diſpoſe of my ſelf, I took my Horſe and
went out upon the great Road, to ſee if I could meet
with any body, at laſt I ſaw a man come galopping
along, and immediately concluding that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
from him, I would have ſtopt him to have
askt what news he brought; but he taking no notice
of me, rode on, and went into the Caſtle: as ſoon
as he was in they ſhut up the Gates, at which I was
ſurprized, for it wanted a good deal of night; I came,
and knockt at the gate to get in but all to no purpoſe,
tho I waited above an hour; at laſt, as I was juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, I heard a great many Dole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul crys within,
and at the ſame time ſaw them let down the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
I went in, and found that this affliction was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by that perſon who brought them the News,
that the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> was apprehended at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince had been much in favour with the
Queen Mother, who had given him ſo many marks
of her eſteem, as left it without queſtion; for one day
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57806:63"/>
when they thought the King was juſt a dying ſhe put
her children into his hands, which was the cauſe that
all the Princes of the Blood were Jealous of him: if the
Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> had manag'd himſelf wiſely after
this, there was all the appearance in the world that
he would have been made Chief Miniſter, at leaſt
he would have been the Favorite: But having plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> and others to ruin the Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> he no ſooner ſaw himſelf ſettled above
their Power to ſhake him, but he diſpers'd the whole
Faction, cauſing ſome to be apprehended, and others
to fly the Kingdom: tho' I knew nothing of all the
intrigue, yet I was it ſeems involv'd in the miſchiefs
of it; for ſome body having told <hi>Mazarin</hi> that I had
been ſeen talking with Monſieur <hi>de la Chaſtres,</hi> he put
me down in the black Roll of thoſe he intended to
ſecure, and was ſurpriz'd with a witneſs when at
my return from <hi>Anet</hi> I ſaw my ſelf very decently ſent
to the <hi>Baſtile; de la Chartres</hi> came off better than I,
but was fain to Surrender his Commiſſion of
Collonel General of the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> to purchaſe his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>He did not continue ſo long in Priſon as I
did, for having none of thoſe powerful friends that
he had, I was forgotten in my miſery, and had not
ſo much as the poor comfort of being Viſited; my
Father and my Mother in Law, ſeeing me embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſtate affairs, would not expoſe themſelves to
the diſpleaſure of the Miniſter; and for fear my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhould be kinder, they forbid them coming at
me. I cannot expreſs how much I was afflicted at the
beginning of my Confinement, but as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo harſh but grows familiar by cuſtom, I made
a virtue of Neceſſity, and bore it very patiently ſix
whole years without any diverſion, but that of a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57806:64"/>
few books, which they gave me liberty to ſend for:
in the mean time the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> made his
eſcape from <hi>Vinciennes,</hi> where he had been confin'd;
and finding all ſorts of people diſſatisfied with the
management of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he began his
intrigue anew, but with a little better ſucceſs than
before; I had been ſo long in priſon, that I began
to think that all the world had forgot me or thought
I was dead: but when I dreamt of it leaſt of all, I
ſaw a man come into my Chamber whom I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to have belong'd to the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he
told me that he came to offer me my liberty, if I
would promiſe him that after I had recover'd it, I
would honeſtly accquaint him with all that I knew of
the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi>'s deſigns; I made no pauſe
upon his words, but anſwer'd him immediately, that
I never underſtood till now, why I was committed,
which it ſeems was upon ſuſpicion that I ſhould hold
intelligence with that Prince, which God knew was
no ſuch matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but tho' I had no concern in the leaſt
with him, nothing was capable of making me accuſe
a man by whom I was but ſuppos'd to be eſteem'd;
he would have ſaid ſeveral things to have made me
alter my mind, but giving him no anſwer, but that
I ſcorn'd to be a ſpy for any man, he left me as he
found me; and went to carry his ſtory to his maſter.</p>
            <p>I preſently concluded from hence, the Duke <hi>de
Beaufort</hi> had made his eſcape, and that they were
afraid of him, and I long'd now to be at liberty to
joyn with him in his Reſentment, and after thinking
ſeriouſly how I might effect it, I found that there was
but one way, and I reſolv'd upon that; I brib'd
the fellow that brought books to me, who coming
ſo often was not miſtruſted, and he brought me at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, Rope enough to reach down from my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57806:64"/>
Chamber window to the Ditch; how great ſoever the
danger ſeem'd, yet I ventur'd one very dark night, and
having gotten down with ſome difficulty, I made
a ſhift to get through the Ditch, having before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
exact notice of every ſtep I was to make; ſo I
got off and came into <hi>Paris,</hi> at the <hi>Porte de St. Martin:</hi>
I lay under a Stall all that Night, it being too late to
diſturb any of my Friends; but at break of day I
went into the <hi>Fauxburgh de St. Germaine,</hi> where I
got me a Lodging: I enquir'd there what News was
ſtirring, and was told that all the Town was in
Combuſtion, upon the account of an Edict which
the Cardinal had publiſh'd, by which be Taxt all
the Soveraign Courts. The Hatred I bore him,
made me forget the Love I bear to my Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which was threatned with great Revolutions;
in ſhort, the Parliament, whom it principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
gave at the ſame time a decree againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin;</hi>
and ſome of the Members were ſo violent
againſt him, that if the reſt would have follow'd
their Councel, they would have ventur'd once to
revenge thoſe many attempts, he had made upon
their Liberties and Laws, with the price of his
Blood.</p>
            <p>The People, who ſaw themſelves ruin'd with
Edicts one upon the neck of another, joyn'd with
the Parliament, and all things ſeem'd to be in a
poſture for a revolt: but that which compleated all
was, that the Queen Mother clapt ſome of their
Body up into a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſon, which ſerv'd like a ſignal for
all the reſt to take up Arms. In a Moment the
Chains were drawn croſs the Streets, and all the Lanes
and Paſſages barricadoed, and the Citizens left
their Shops and Employment, and form'd themſelves
into Regiments for the War: So great was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57806:65"/>
Hatred againſt the Cardinal. The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought to appeaſe this Tumult with good
words, but finding it to no purpoſe, ſhe brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſome of the Guards, which ſerv'd indeed but
to enrage the People. I thought now I might ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out without danger, and a Boy that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
liv'd with me, knowing me cried out, Here,
Here was one would be ſure to ſide with them, for he
had ſuffer'd deeply by the Tyranny of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and
coming up to me at the ſame time ſaluted me; but
I was ſo vext to ſee he had diſcover'd me, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of accepting his Compliment, I fell to repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him ſeverely; but the Croud hearing what
he ſaid, flockt about me, and asking me a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
queſtions, which I anſwer'd as well as I could.
They made me go with them to the Main Guard,
telling me I ſhould be their Captain, if they met
with any reſiſtance, for I lookt like a Souldier.</p>
            <p>This diſturbance would have run further, if the
Queen Mother, who had before refus'd to ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
thoſe ſhe had made Priſoners, had not now
been better advis'd; but ſhe releaſt them, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one went home quickly. I was afraid however,
that this matter would be a new Cauſe of Quarrel
at me; and in ſhort I made no queſtion, having been
ſo rudely handled by him already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me now of having been a Ringleader in the
public Tumult; and tho the Queen had promis'd to
forget all that was done, yet knowing very well they
never wanted pretences, when they had a mind to
ruin a man, I thought it my beſt way to get ſome
Protection; that of the Parliament was the ſecureſt
as things then ſtood, for they had not only the love
of the People, who fooliſhly thought all this had
been done on their account, but had alſo engag'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57806:65"/>
Provinces in the Quarrel, who had no leſs
good will to pull down <hi>Mazarin.</hi> The Parliament
received my Petition, which was preſented by the
Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who was a perſon very agreeable
to the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> principally becauſe they thought him
irreconcilable to <hi>Mazarin,</hi> ſo my requeſt was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and being then ſafe enough, I adher'd to the
Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi>'s Party, who all of them hated the
Cardinal. If I ſhould mention all the Intrigues
and Contrivances laid againſt him, 'twould ſwell
theſe Memoirs into many Volumes: but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſpeak of nothing but what I had a hand
in my ſelf, I ſhall content my ſelf with telling you
that the Parliament having done all they could againſt
him, he reſolv'd to humble them; but 'twas impoſſible
to bring it about, without reducing <hi>Paris</hi> to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
who having taken part againſt him with ſo
much heat, and being ſtill ready to break out into
Arms again, upon the leaſt occaſion, the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
did not only ſeem difficult, but above his
ſtrength. There was above a Hundred Thouſand
fighting Men in the City, to whom the Kings
Troops were as good as nothing: Nevertheleſs the
Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> who was now Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> by
the Death of his Father, being return'd from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and having promis'd him to eſpouſe his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
he drew his Army out of their Quarters; and
the Court being withdrawn from <hi>Paris,</hi> the City
was as it were blockt up. <hi>Paris</hi> being certainly the
moſt Populous City in the World, the Paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtopt up, brought them into great diſtreſs: every
one ſaid 'twas a ſhame they ſhould be ſtarv'd ſo, by
a handful of People; ſo they appointed a day for a
general Muſter. The Forces being all come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Captains who were all Counſellors (for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57806:66"/>
the whole was an Army of Burghers) were for
drawing them up in Battalia, that the General
might take a view of them, but no body knew
which way to go about it; This was ſo pitiful a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
that it made thoſe People laugh, that knew
no more how to do it than they: at laſt out
ſteps a fellow from the Ranks all in a heat, and
bluſtring about, ſaid aloud, that this was not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rules of Diſcipline; that he had been ſix
Months a Soldier in the Guards, and he was very
much deceiv'd, if he could not do it better himſelf;
every body was overjoy'd that they had gotten a
<hi>Man of Experience</hi> among them, and having delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him the Command by a great ſhout of <hi>God bleſs
the Parliament, and our New Officer:</hi> he was made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General of the Infantry, and as the mark of his
Office, he receiv'd the Truncheon, from the hands
of <hi>Videau de Grammont</hi> Counſellor <hi>aux Enquites;
Grammont</hi> was juſt a going to give him his Corſlet,
but being afraid of bringing a diſgrace upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
who had the Reputation of being of a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
diſpoſition, he caus'd them to procure him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
His Son is as chary of his Corſlet, to this
day, as he is of his Beard, and wears it in Carneval
time, which makes him look like an old Corporal,
diſguis'd like a Counſellor.</p>
            <p>This new Major was a little out in ordring his
Battalia: However all people admir'd what he had
done, and the Officers of the Regiment carried
him home to Dinner with them in Ceremony, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him the upper end of the Table; there they
conſulted of the means to raiſe the Blockade of the
Town, and all that the Major ſaid was receiv'd like
an Oracle; but all this did not hinder the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> from attacking <hi>Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nton,</hi> where the <hi>Pariſians</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57806:66"/>
had poſted three thouſand Men under Command of
one <hi>Claucleu,</hi> and this Poſt being of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
they detach'd a Party of twenty Thouſand
Men to relieve it; I went among the reſt, and had
the honour to be one of the Principal Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Cavalry, which was order'd to ſupport
the Infantry; we left them them to take the Front
when we went out, but they were not ambitious
for that which they they thought was not their due.
The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> appearing with three or four
Hundred Horſe, they were very deſirous to take the
Rear-Guard, but the order of Battle being diſpos'd
otherwiſe, we would not allow it, and continu'd
to give them the honour of the Van, by retiring
our ſelves full ſpeed back into the Town: they call'd
this a Flight, tho we ſay, 'twas but our obedience
to the Command that order'd us to keep in the Rear;
however 'twas, if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had pleas'd, he
might have cut off all our Infantry, but he content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf with taking <hi>Charenton,</hi> where he loſt the
Duke <hi>De Chatillon,</hi> his Kinſman.</p>
            <p>I was aſham'd to go into the Town again after
ſuch an action as this, for though, perhaps I was
none of the firſt that fled, yet it was enough diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
but to have been in ſuch bad Company; we
would ſeveral times after that try our Fortunes with
the Enemy, but being always beaten, though we
were ten to one, I ſaw plainly I ſhould get but little
Honour by fighting at the Head of ſuch a Militia; in
the mean time the Parliament abated nothing of their
hatred to the Cardinal, but in their condition the
old Proverb would not hold good, <hi>Arma cedunt Togae,</hi>
ſo they thought of an Accommodation, and the more
too, becauſe all the People of Quality, though at
firſt they took part with them, began to hold Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57806:67"/>
with the Court; 'twas however, oppos'd
by a great many, who were for demanding aſſiſtance
of the Arch Duke, and the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who
was declared <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Party, was of this
opinion, ſo they nominated the Marqueſs <hi>De Noir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouſtier</hi>
and <hi>Laicques</hi> to go thither, I was alſo of this
number, not in the quality of a Plenipotenciary,
as they were, but in that of a ſubaltern Miniſter,
who was to follow their Orders.</p>
            <p>I was not affraid now to ſhow my ſelf there, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſo good a Character, and did not doubt but
we ſhould be well receiv'd; in ſhort, the Arch-Duke
promis'd us to march his Army to remove our
Blockade, and I was left with him, to put him in
mind of his Promiſe; but I was not there above
eight days, but I perceiv'd that the Count <hi>De</hi>—who
was ſtill his Favourite, countermin'd all our
Deſigns. He did not care to have a Man ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighted
as I to dive into his matters, and ſent word
to <hi>De Laieques,</hi> who was his Friend, that they ſhould
recal me immediately; and all that I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
from this Conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, that Madam <hi>De
Chevreuſe,</hi> who ſeem'd to deſire the ruin of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
was always well with that Count, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to hinder theſe Troops entring into the
Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make a more advantageous Treaty for
herſelf; our Journey had diſturb'd the Court, ſo that
ſhe was oblig'd to meet them half way to make
up the the Peace, and as the Arch-Duke was too
ſlow in his Marches, and the Parliament beginning
now to repent of having call'd in Foreign Aid, the
thing was immediately concluded.</p>
            <p>Every one was for making his advantage in this
Accommodation; ſome agreed for Money, and others
for Places, whilſt poor I was the only perſon that got
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57806:67"/>
nothing, though the chief of the Party had all along
promis'd to take care of my Fortune. I was then ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
how little confidence was to be repoſed in the
aſſurances of Great Men, who promiſe largely when
we can be ſerviceable to them, but fail not to forget
us when we ceaſe to be ſo any longer. In ſhort,
I had been reduc'd to very mean Circumſtances,
but for my yearly Income at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which was
all I had now to truſt to, after I had maintain'd my
Brothers all this time at my own Charge. 'Twas
not for me then to ſet up for Quality, yet was it
ſufficient to maintain me, with good Husbandry,
which at laſt I practiſed, having never another
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to whom I could have recourſe
for what I wanted, and ſo reduc'd my attendance to
a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and a Foot-boy, whereas in the
Cardinal's days, I never kept leſs than ſix or ſeven
Servants in Family. This ſeem'd ſomething odd
to me, becauſe I had ever liv'd great, but I knew
not yet what it was to be neceſſitous, though it
was not long before I did to ſome purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who hated me mortally, as well for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my Eſcape out of Priſon, as for ſiding againſt
him in the late diſturbances, caus'd my Revenue
at <hi>Lyons</hi> to be ſtopt, and ſeveral Attachments to be
made on it under borrow'd Names, though I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of it till I went to receive the Money,
and then I was ſurpriz'd indeed to find my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to People I never knew; but making light
of it at firſt, I went to my Attorney, who told me
the ſame ſtory, and that I muſt ſign a grant of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
to them, till the Cauſe ſhould be decided.
In the mean time he ask'd me for the Attachments,
but I was not ſo prudent to take them up, and ſo
was forc'd to go back to the perſon that us'd to pay
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57806:68"/>
me, and who put me off till the next day; the next
Morning I went to his Houſe, but they told me
there that he was gone to a Siſter's of his, who lay
a Dying, about ten Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas with this Excuſe they held me in ſuſpence
for a Fortnight at leaſt, yet in all this time I never
dreamt of this Fellow's holding Correſpondence
with <hi>Mazarin;</hi> at laſt one told me he had ſeen him
in the ſtreet, whereupon, with abundance of Joy
for his Return, I went to enquire for him; but when
I ſaw they us'd the ſame Pretence as before, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
then, there was ſome trick in it. I told them
roundly that I was inform'd of his being in Town
by ſeveral People, who had ſeen him, and vow'd I
would not ſtir till I had ſpoke with him. He was
not very far off it ſeems, for hearing what I ſaid,
he cried out at a diſtance, that all was well enough,
and they ſhould let me in. He made me then
a thouſand Excuſes for going out of Town without
giving me the things I required, telling me, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but juſt come to Town, as I ſaw, he muſt have
one Night to look amongſt his Papers, and the next
day I ſhould certainly have them at my own Hour.
I was ſuch a Fool as to believe him again, and came
next Morning by break of Day, when feigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Sick, he told me in the condition that he was,
he could not poſſibly be as good as his word, and
endeavour'd to put me off another day. But my Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was quite worn out with waiting, ſo I directed
my Attorney to draw me up an Order to make him
deliver the things. He no ſooner heard what I had
done, but never talking any more of the Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he return'd anſwer that I muſt make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to thoſe at <hi>Lyons,</hi> his Commiſſion being at an
end, and to prove what he ſaid, he ſhew'd me the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57806:68"/>
Sham Copy of an Order to recal it. This was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with a Vengeance; however, being oblig'd
to write to <hi>Lyons,</hi> I ſent my Contract by the Poſt,
to the end, that the Perſon whom I writ to about
this Affair, might as ſoon as he receiv'd it, proceed
with all Expedition. I expected two or three Poſts
to hear from him, but all in vain, for my Contract
was loſt it ſeems, and another Man, to whom I had
got one of my Friends to write, ſends me this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>I loſt a great deal of Time in this manner, but
'twas longer yet before I could procure a rough
draught of my Contract; at laſt they ſent me word
from <hi>Lyons,</hi> that the Pay-maſter, who was formerly
there, was reſtor'd to that Office, and that I muſt
addreſs my ſelf to him. Accordingly I ſent another
Summons, to which he anſwer'd, That he had the
Attachments in his Hands 'twas true, but I could
not oblige him to deliver them till they were copy'd:
I order'd him then to ſend me the Copies, which he
was content to do, ſo he gave me in the Names of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of my Creditors, whom, as I ſaid, I never had ſo
much as heard of in my Life: I deſired them to
appoint what Court they would proceed in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had appear'd by their Attorney, there was
three of them who declin'd the Juriſdiction of <hi>Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</hi>
One of them was for removing the Tryal to
the <hi>Requeſts du Palais,</hi> another to the <hi>de L' Hotel,</hi>
and the third to the Grand Council, where all his
Buſineſs was done, as he pretended At laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after our
Cauſe had depended above three Months, and when
it was juſt going to be decided, they brought it into
the Privy-Council for the ſake of that Judge's Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
'Twas my ill luck to have a Sollicitor who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
hated to take Pains, ſo that I thought our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57806:69"/>
was delay'd more out of his Lazineſs than Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
but I was miſtaken, for having gain'd one of
his Servants with a little Money, the Fellow told
me as a Secret, that in ſhort, 'twas to no purpoſe
for me to wait for any concluſion to my Affair, for
his Maſter was expreſly order'd to the contrary. I
ask'd him how he came to know that, and he told
me, there was a certain Man who came often to his
Maſter from the Cardinal on this Errand, and by
the Deſcription he gave me of him, I knew it could
be no other than <hi>Bellinzani,</hi> the worthy Servant to
ſuch a Maſter.</p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible to expreſs the Rage I was in when
I heard this: I ſpoke of it with ſome Paſſion to the
Maſter of Requeſts, but finding I was not likely to
get any Satisfaction from him, I went to make my
complaint to the Chancellour <hi>Seguier,</hi> who promis'd
to do me Juſtice. He continued but three days in
that Mind, for after <hi>Mazarin</hi> had ſpoke to him, he
never regarded his Word, and though I gave my
conſtant Attendance on him every day, I made no
Progreſs in my Buſineſs. In the mean time Money
began to grow ſcarce, and I was forc'd to borrow
of thoſe Friends who were inclin'd to pity my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
My Father I had often writ to on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but receiv'd no anſwer, and might have
ſtarv'd, if all the World had been like him. I
was advis'd to Petition the Queen-Mother, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of a very compaſſionate Nature, and who only
was not belov'd by the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> becauſe they did
not know her. I begg'd her therefore that ſhe would
be pleas'd to order the Chancellor and Sollicitor
to do me Juſtice, and to haſten the Tryal of my
Cauſe, but 'twas my misfortune that that Princeſs
committed all things to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57806:69"/>
whom you may be ſure, as he was a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
I had little reaſon to expect any Favour.</p>
            <p>It far'd with me at that time as with all in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
I was forſaken by thoſe I had the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on, and after I had two or three Months
longer ſollicited in vain, I was reduced to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Poverty that I was aſhamed of my ſelf, and
knowing not where to hide my head, my laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
was to go to my Father's, in hopes after
what I had done for his Family, he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me ſome ſmall Relief, when he ſhould ſee me
ſuing for it in another manner than what I had
done in my Letters. I ſcarce had wherewithal to
carry me down, and 'twould certainly have mov'd
any one to ſee a Man who was lately in ſuch
Splendor, forc'd to ſtarve himſelf for fear of want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Money on the Road. When I light at the
Door, the old Servants of the Family, who had
ſeen my Grandeur, and ſaw me now, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their own Eyes, but my Father and Mother-in-Law
could not help knowing me, or they were
willing enough elſe to forget me; for though I found
them at Table when I came in, they hardly had the
civility to make me ſit down, and when I did, the
moſt of my Entertainment at Supper was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
they made me for my extravagance, which
had brought me into this condition. How ſtrange
a thing is this Miſery, that the Mind as well as the
Body ſhould ſink under its oppreſſion! I was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that I knew not what to ſay for my ſelf, and
but I that ſigh'd at every word they ſpoke, I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have loſt both Life and Sence.</p>
            <p>After this Welcome the firſt day, I would not
have ſtay'd another in the Houſe, if I had known
whither to have gone; for alas, my old Friend the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57806:70"/>
Curate had been dead above two Years, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it ſelf ſeem'd to conſpire to load me with Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
Tho I bore them all, as well as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and endeavouring to bring my Father to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I ſounded him to find how he ſtood affected
to lend me ſome ſmall matter to carry me back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>Paris.</hi> I told him mine was a plain caſe, that
they could not always deny me Juſtice, and 'twould
not be long before Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> would be
weary, and ceaſe perſecuting me, if it were only
to be free from the Complaints I ſhould make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. I told him abundance of other things,
to make him ſenſible that his Money would not
be thrown away, and that I intended to repay him;
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e all in a Fury, interrupting me, <hi>Why ſurely
then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you take me for one that is eaſily to be bubbled,
but you are miſtaken Sir, go banter ſomebody elſe with your
ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Stories, I know the reaſon well enough why your Money
is ſtopt, and pity the poor Creditors you rail at, as they are
not only like to loſe their Due, but as they have to do with
a Fellow of ſuch wicked Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words made me ſo deſperate, but that I
reflected on the Sin I was going to commit, I had
certainly ſtabb'd my ſelf at the very inſtant; yet I
could not forbear uſing a thouſand Reproaches, and
though I knew well enough what my Reſpect
oblig'd me to, yet I did, and ſaid many things which
were not ſo decent to be done to ones Father.
He took occaſion from this ('twas either he,
or my Mother-in-Law) to forbid me their Table:
and to put me out of all doubt, there comes
up one of the Servants about Ten in the Morning,
and ſpreads me a Napkin on the Table in my own
Chamber, and acquaints me with their Pleaſure;
tho' the Cloth was laid ſo early, it was not till after
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57806:70"/>
they had din'd that I had any thing brought me to
eat, and then I had the honour to ſhare in their
Scraps, with the Servants. But what madded me
above all was, to ſee how great my Brothers liv'd,
particularly the Abbot who grew ſo wealthy, there
was none in all the Country, as he fancied, that could
compare with him. He kept two or three packs of
Dogs, two Huntſmen, five or ſix good Horſes,
and yet never was the Man that once invited me
to hunt with him, though he ow'd all his Greatneſs
to my means.</p>
            <p>'Tis but meer Railery to ſay that any one dies
of Grief, for if 'twere true, I could never have
outliv'd mine. At laſt, after I had liv'd there
three Months in this manner, and not being able to
endure the ill treatment I met with, I reſolved to
return to <hi>Paris.</hi> Much ado I had to ſqueeze from
my Father Money enough to bear the Charges of
my Journey; but I was not got above two Leagues
on my way, before he that was his preſent Curate
overtook me, and brought me ten Piſtoles, telling
me that he had a good while intended to preſent
me with them, but being in the Hands of one
of his Friends, he could not have them before,
adding, that his Predeceſſor was oblig'd to me, as
he had been to his Predeceſſor; ſo begg'd me
to accept of them, and wiſh'd he could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
more for my ſake.</p>
            <p>I had receiv'd in my Life many conſiderable
Summs from the Cardinal, but I profeſs I never
was ſo ſenſible of his Liberalities, as of the kindneſs
of this poor Curate; I told him therefore that I
heartily accepted of his Preſent, and if Heaven
ſhould favour me with an opportunity, I would give
him proof of my Gratitude; for not to diſſemble
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57806:71"/>
with him, but to tell him plainly how things ſtood,
I was in ſuch neceſſity, that without this ſeaſonable
relief of his, I muſt have certainly ſtarv'd. After
a great many Compliments on both ſides we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I kept on my way to <hi>Paris:</hi> When I came
there, I found the Civil War ready to break out
again. The Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> was gone to St. <hi>Maur,</hi>
upon a falſe Alarm, with a Troop of Attendants
little inferior to the Kings. This Prince, who had
done Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> ſo much Service, as I have
mention'd, was in requital confin'd to a ſevere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
out of which being eſcap'd by meer
good fortune, he continu'd ſo apprehenſive of the like
uſage, that he never reſted from the thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of War, being inſtigated by a great many
People that hated <hi>Mazarin:</hi> If I had been in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
I cou'd have wiſht my ſelf, 'twou'd not
have been long before I wou'd have waited on him,
and offer'd him my humble Service; but being now
in a condition, ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r different from what I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in, I was forc'd to content my ſelf, only with
making Prayers and Wiſhes for the ſucceſs of his
Deſigns.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Parliament began again to
make Decrees againſt <hi>Mazarin,</hi> ſo that he was forc'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to fly the Kingdom to avoid the fury of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, who all cry'd out to have him remov'd.
Obſerving therefore ſo favourable an opportunity,
I preſented my Petition to the Court of Judicature,
in which I declar'd the ſtate of my Caſe, and what
injuſtice I had ſuffer'd for a long while; and I had
this relief by it, that notwithſtanding the Cauſe was
depending in the Council, my Adverſaries were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be heard before this Court. Upon this, no
body appear'd, and I obtain'd a Judgment againſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57806:71"/>
the Pay-maſter General, who was oblig'd to disburſt
me the Money, which he had before taken for his
own, with giving him a full diſcharge for it: He
durſt do no otherwiſe, for fear I ſhould have ſet an
ill name upon him, and have made him paſs for
another <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which was a Character at that
time, ſufficient to have a mans brains knockt out,
eſpecially at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Populace hated the
very Name of him. I receiv'd then all at once a
good Sum, which I had no ſooner done, but I ſent
twenty Piſtoles of it to our Curate, ten for the
Principal, and as many more for the Intereſt. The
removal of the Cardinal, was all this while nothing
but a ſham to amuſe the People; for he had ſtill as
much authority in the Council, as if he had been
preſent there. Every one was diſturb'd at this, but
eſpecially the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> who had a ſtrong
Party in the Parliament, and was favour'd by the
People. For his Reputation, that was founded on
ſo many Glorious Victories which he had obtain'd,
gain'd him thoſe who had only heard of them, as
well as thoſe who had been witneſſes of ſuch great
Actions. He pretended, as I ſaid, fear of the like
uſage which he had met with; but the real motive
was to advance his own Greatneſs, as was evident
by his Conduct: For at the ſame time that he
appear'd irreconcileable to <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he treated
with him under hand; and if he cou'd have brought
him to his Demands, he wou'd not only have ſuffer'd
the Cardinal to return, but wou'd have been ready
to offer him his Friendſhip. 'Tis not known cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
what broke off the Treaty, unleſs 'twas, that
the Ambition of that Prince tormenting him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
he made new Demands every day, ſtill as the
other granted the old ones. But this I am inform'd
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57806:72"/>
from good hands, that the Cardinal ſent often to
tell him, that he ſhou'd have whatever he requir'd,
and that the Troubles which happen'd preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
were purely owing to the Prince <hi>de Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I were diſpos'd to give a particular account of
all the Actions of the War, I cou'd do it as well as
another; but that being the buſineſs of an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
more than of one that writes Memoirs, I ſhall
content my ſelf with telling you only this, that after a
great many Meſſages backwards and forwards to no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
they both had recourſe to Arms. The Prince <hi>de
Conde,</hi> who had ſeveral places of ſtrength in his hands,
ſent ſome of his Creatures to all of them, to provide
all things neceſſary in caſe of a Seige, and eſpecially to
<hi>Montrond,</hi> which was in the Heart of <hi>France,</hi> and at
that time held to be impregnable. My reſentment
wou'd not let me ſtand Neuter in this War, ſo
I joyn'd my ſelf to the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> who was
now reconcil'd to the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> thro the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> after ſo violent an
Enmity, that nothing would ſerve their turns, but
the immediate death of one or the other. Now you
muſt know that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was wholly
rul'd by the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Rohan</hi>
and Monſieur <hi>Chavigny,</hi> and theſe three perſons having
their ſeveral Intereſts to recommend, they had
often hinder'd the Peace from being concluded, when
the Duke himſelf might have done it as he pleas'd,
ſince the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> who had declar'd for him,
durſt not have oppos'd him. Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who
was come to Court again, ſeeing himſelf on the brink
of ſo many Troubles, was reſolv'd to make his laſt
effort to prevent them, to give the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
and the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> all the ſatisfaction they cou'd
deſire, provided they did not inſiſt too much on the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57806:72"/>
Terms of their Adherents. He deſir'd the
Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> to ſend him one of his Friends
whom he had a confidence in, but that he ſhou'd be
one who was never known to have been employ'd
in any of their former Negotiations, that their Treaty
might not be ſuſpected, by them whoſe Intereſt it
was that they ſhould not agree. The Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>
choſe out one of his own Gentlemen to ſend on this
Errand, to whom he deliver'd his Demands in writing,
with order to tell the Cardinal, that it wou'd be to
no purpoſe to conſider a longer time on them, for
he wou'd never be brought to any lower conditions.
This was a hard Chapter for the Cardinal, who had
nothing now to chooſe but Peace or War; but one
ſeeming much more eligible than the other, he
ſign'd the Treaty, telling the Gentleman, that there
being ſeveral things in it which requir'd ſome time
before they cou'd be perform'd; he begg'd the Prince
<hi>de Conde</hi> to deſire the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> (whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
was not forgotten) to conceal them from his
Lady, becauſe the Cardinal <hi>de Retis,</hi> the Duke
<hi>de Rohan</hi> and <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who had ſo great an influence
over her, wou'd certainly hear of it, and never reſt
till they had broke the Treaty.</p>
            <p>If the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> had follow'd this advice, he
had without doubt prevented abundance of miſchief;
but fancying the Cardinal ſtarted this ſcruple, only
to appear more myſterious in his Conduct, he comes
publickly with an exceſs of Joy and Gaity, crying
aloud at a good diſtance to the Duke of <hi>Orleans; We
have trapp'd the old Fox at laſt, and have got him faſt in a
Nooſe. Here, my Lord,</hi> ſays he, delivering him the
Treaty, <hi>is your Demands, and for what concerns me in it,
I am very well content.</hi> The Duke ſhewing it to
his Lady, ſhe immediately communicates it to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57806:73"/>
Cardinal <hi>de Rets,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Rohan</hi> and to <hi>Chavigny.</hi>
They all in a ſurprize come to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
and ask him what in the Name of God he deſign'd
to do, to ſign ſuch an Agreement; telling him, that
all the advantage was on the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'s ſide,
who had not only been addreſt to, to negotiate with,
but to whom here were the greateſt Conceſſions made:
That he was already poſſeſt of Offices enough in the
Kingdom, without ſuffering him thus to ingroſs all.
That his Ambition was inſatiate, tho he endeavour'd
to palliate it: That the care he took of the Inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt
of his Creatures, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oceeded not out of any good
Nature he had to oblige them, but out of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
which he foreſaw, he might one day or other
have of their Service: That he himſelf was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
more than any one, to hinder this increaſe of
the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'s power, for after himſelf he was
next Heir to the Crown: That if he took not ſome
ſpeedy courſe to ſuppreſs his greatneſs, 'twou'd be
ſoon too late. In ſhort, That they pray'd him to
conſider, that on the concluding or breaking off of
this Treaty, depended the Proſperity of the State, the
Safety of his own Perſon and of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>But it was in other Terms that they ſpoke of this
Treaty to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans.</hi> They repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her, that the deſign of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was
to poſſeſs himſelf of the Crown; that in the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he was with the People for his Victories, his
Uſurpation would be leſs odious, if not altogether
agreeable; that after which, her Husband would
certainly be confin'd to a Cloiſter, if he were not
kept a Priſoner all his Life in ſome other place; that
for her ſelf, ſhe was not to expect a better fare than
to live all her days in a Convent, and it would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſcape 'em, but they would diſpute the legitimacy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57806:73"/>
of her Children, becauſe her Marriage had never
been approv'd of but by force: That the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
ſhe had to prevent all theſe misfortunes, was
to break off the Treaty, while they on their part did
all that lay in their power, to diſengage the Duke
her Husband from a perſon he had ſo much reaſon
to ſuſpect: That ſhe was particularly concern'd to
take this care of him, becauſe he lov'd her tenderly,
of which he had given her ſufficient proofs: That
they would not pretend to give her Inſtructions, but
if they might urge it without violating their reſpect
to her, they would then ſay, that ſhe ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all her Charms to accompliſh this deſign: That
the Bed was the moſt proper place to ſet upon one
of her Husbands diſpoſition; that they had nothing
more to ſay, but to with her to make uſe of it, as
they were ſenſible ſhe could do with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion theſe arguments wrought but too
effectually on both of them. They were hardly ever in
private together that they had any other diſcourſe, and
the Dutcheſs perceiving her Husband inclinable to
receive all the imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſions, with which ſhe had been
prepoſſeſt, puſht on the affair to that extremity,
that the Treaty was broke off, without ſo much as
any tolerable reaſon given by the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> than ſaw his Error in not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Cardinals advice, but ſince 'twas now
too late for any remedy, he reſolv'd on other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and rais'd new Troops to begin a ſecond Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War. The Cardinal having a mind to diſpoſſeſs
him of <hi>Montrond,</hi> caus'd ſome Troops to march that
way, every one being in great expectation of what
would be the event between the two Parties. They
were not long without Skirmiſhes, and a Collonel
of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Troops, call'd <hi>Concreſſant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57806:74"/>
taken Priſoner by the Count <hi>de Bougi,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in <hi>Bourges;</hi> they were in a diſpute how to
treat him, whether as a Rebel or as a Priſoner of
War. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who was in
<hi>Montrond,</hi> fearing leſt they ſhould uſe him as the
latter, writ to the Count <hi>de Bougi</hi> about it; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
receiv'd an anſwer as civil as could be deſir'd, it
was a very great encouragement to the Officers of
both ſides to expoſe themſelves, who before were
in no ſmall apprehenſions on that account. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this was no law to the Cardinal, for he order'd
another Officer that was taken to be hang'd; but
the <hi>Prince</hi> ſerving ſome of his in the ſame manner, he
forbore to uſe any more ſuch Severity.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> for all the jealouſy he
had entertain'd of the Prince, did not yet ſeparate
from his Intereſts, to which he was retain'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conſiderations: he had rais'd ſome Troops as well
as he, and gave them to the Command of the Duke
<hi>de Beaufort.</hi> I ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him in the quality of <hi>Aide de
Camp</hi> all the Campaign, and ſo conſtantly attended
him, that no body can be better acquainted with all
that happen'd to him than my ſelf. He had been ſo
perſecuted by the new Miniſter, that the <hi>Pariſians</hi>
lookt on him as irreconcileable, and this reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of his Sentiments with their own, join'd
with ſome popular ways, which he had made him
ſo agreeable to them, that they ſeem'd not content to
love him, but ſomething more, even to adore him.
The <hi>Fiſh-Wives</hi> above all were thoſe that made the
moſt ſhew of their kindneſs for him. Theſe every
day were making him Preſents, and upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were the firſt to run to get a ſight of him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
Upon this he was call'd in deriſion <hi>the King
of the Mobb.</hi> But all their kindneſs was nothing to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57806:74"/>
that of one of thoſe honeſt Women I am going to
tell you of; ſhe comes to him one morning, and
brings with her a young Girl of about Seventeen or
Eighteen, a ſweet pretty Creature, and told him
that having no more Children in the World,
ſhe ſhould think her ſelf the happieſt body that could
be, if his Grace would do her Daughter the
honour not only to lye with her, but to get her with
Child. The Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> was not like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was thought to be a greater lover of Men
than of Women: So he told her very pleaſantly
that he was mighty glad to oblige her, and
would engage for the one, tho he could not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the other, yet he would do his beſt to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
her in that too; and at the ſame time to ſhew her
that he deſign'd to be as good as his word, he took
and led her Daughter into his Chamber, where after
he had lain with her, he ſent them both home very
well pleas'd with their Entertainment.</p>
            <p>This Prince had a Siſter married to the Duke <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> a Perſon of a thouſand good Qualities,
with never a bad one. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having
occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that call'd him into the Province of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
which had declar'd in his Favour, gave the
Duke <hi>de Nemours</hi> the Command of his Troops, with
orders to act in Concert with thoſe of the Duke
<hi>de Beaufort.</hi> If the Relation of Brothers-in-law
could have been ſufficient, as one would have
thought it ſhould, to have united two Tempers
ſo vaſtly different as theſe two, then the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> did not commit ſuch a great miſtake, to
leave 'em together, and go into <hi>Guienne:</hi> But
not foreſeeing that his abſence would beget a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
hatred, between theſe two Princes, who had
been before at variance; he ran the greateſt riſque
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57806:75"/>
that he ever did in his Life; for hearing on all
hands, that their enmity was not only arriv'd to
that pitch, that they were ready every moment to
cut one anothers Throats, but that all affairs were
like to be ruin'd by it; he made a deſperate Journey
to them from <hi>Agen,</hi> by his preſence to rectify this
diſorder. The Prince was to paſs the <hi>Loire,</hi> and
tho he took all poſſible care to conceal his departure,
by giving out that he was gone to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> upon
ſome ſpecial occaſions, yet the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi>
who Commanded the Kings Army on this ſide of
the River, had notice of it, and preſently detach'd
a number of ſmall Parties, to poſſeſs themſelves of
all the Paſſes both by Land and Water: but he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
them, notwithſtanding their extream Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
for travelling Night and Day, he was
gone by, before they could come up to the Paſſes.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Marquiſs <hi>de Levi,</hi> one of
the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'s Party, had procur'd of the Count
<hi>de Harcourt</hi> a Paſport to retire to his own Houſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to a deſign of the Prince's, under the favour of
this Paſport, to wait on him diſguis'd like one of
his Retinue. The Marquis ſtav'd for the Prince till
he came at <hi>Langres,</hi> and from thence they both took
the Road of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> the greateſt part of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs's
Eſtate lying thereabouts. While they were
there refreſhing themſelves, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who
was ſenſible t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Cardinal had lin'd the River with
his Souldiers, ſent to <hi>Buſſi Rabutin,</hi> who was in <hi>la
Charite,</hi> and obtain'd a promiſe from him that he
would favour his paſſage; and he was as good as his
word, for he drew off the Guard that ſtood right
againſt the Ferry of <hi>Allier,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
at the ſame time coming up to that place, paſs'd over
without any manner of oppoſition. After this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57806:75"/>
eſcape he made the beſt of his way, tho the length
of the Journey and the badneſs of the Roads had ſo
tir'd their Horſes, that they could not make all the
haſte they deſir'd. The King, who was on the ſide
of <hi>Angers,</hi> came marching up the <hi>Loire;</hi> and had
ſent out Expreſſes to all places, with orders that they
ſhould apprehend the Prince, and ſecure him alive or
dead. There was one of theſe Scouts came ſo near
him, as to know his Favorite <hi>Guitaut,</hi> and ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Prince himſelf was not far of, inquir'd
for him of a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> who ſtay'd a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind:
If they had had the leaſt preſence of Mind in
the World, they would have certainly kill'd that Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
upon the ſpot; the Duke <hi>de la Rochefaucaut</hi> thought
of it a moment after, but then the Fellow was gone.</p>
            <p>The King, as well as the Cardinal, was inform'd
of this Adventure, and immediately detach'd a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Horſe after him; who taking the Road of
<hi>Chatillon</hi> upon <hi>Loin,</hi> ſo cloſely perſu'd him, that he very
narrowly eſcap'd falling into their hands: But his
good Fortune deliver'd him, and having reach'd <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon,</hi>
he paſs'd on to <hi>Lori,</hi> where his Army than lay.
At his arrival there, he found matters infinitely in a
worſe condition, than what they had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him. The Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi>
were at open defiance one with another, for they
could not diſſemble any longer their reſentment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the occaſion I am going to tell you of. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Gergeau,</hi> (a Town belonging in <hi>Apanage,</hi>
to the Duke of <hi>Orleans)</hi> had promis'd the Duke <hi>de
Nemours</hi> to give him notice of the approach of the
Kings Army, that ſo he might have time enough to
ſend them a Garriſon. This they did not fail to do,
and he accordingly drew out of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s
Troops five or ſix hundred men for that purpoſe.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57806:76"/>
But the Officer that commanded them having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
falſe intelligence by the way, that the King
had already enter'd the Town, proceeded no further,
but came directly back again: Upon which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Gergeau</hi> ſent another Expreſs, to let them
know that if they neglected them in this manner,
they ſhould be oblig'd to open their Gates to the
firſt that appear'd. Whereupon the ſame Troops
were remanded thither, but then 'twas too late, and
they return'd juſt as they had done once before.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Nemours</hi> was mightily incens'd at this
accident, and whether he really did ſuſpect ſome
Treachery in it, or that he was glad of that pretence
to vent his Spleen againſt the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> is
uncertain, but he did not ſtick publickly to accuſe
him of holding Correſpondence with the Enemy.
The Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> gave him the Lye, and had
not the whole Army interpos'd to perſwade the
Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> to ſuſpend his reſentment, there
would have follow'd ſome ſtrange diſorder upon it.
A few days after this had happen'd the Prince <hi>de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>
arriv'd, who preſently undertook to mediate an
Accommodation, but the Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi> would
by no means hearken to it; yet out of his reſpect
to the Prince, and the Intereſt of their affairs which
would not permit him to attempt any thing at that
time, he was content to conſtrain himſelf (he ſaid)
but that afterwards, all the World ſhould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him when he ſaw his convenient time. The
matter being thus made up for the preſent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deferr'd, he march'd againſt the Kings Army,
commanded by the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>de Hoequincourt,</hi> who took their Quarter ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
one from the other; but the Mareſchal lying
more expos'd, he attackt him, and took four of his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57806:76"/>
men Priſoners, before the reſt could be brought to
their Arms. The Mareſchal loſt all his Cavalry in
this Encounter; and if his Infantry had not ſav'd
themſelves by flying at the very beginning, he could
not have been more intirely routed. The Viſcount
<hi>de Turenne</hi> provided a little better for his ſecurity,
for poſſeſſing himſelf of a conſiderable Poſt, he not
only made head againſt the victorious Troops of the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but put them to a ſtand; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Night coming on, retir'd to <hi>Gien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Gentlemen happen'd
to be taken Priſoner ſome time before this, and it
being publickly known that this Mareſchal was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on at Court upon the account of the late
Action, the miſcarriage of which they attributed
to his neglect; the Prince found a way to let him
know, that if he would engage in his Intereſts, he
ſhould meet with more gratitude from him.
<hi>Hocquincourt,</hi> who was acquainted of this by ſome
of his Friends, askt this Gentleman of the Prince's,
what advantage it was that he might expect from his
Maſter, and he engag'd to procure him a hundred
thouſand Crowns, provided he brought over with him
ſome of thoſe Troops which were at his Command.
<hi>Hocquincourt</hi> joyn'd with the Propoſal, and told the
Gentleman, that if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had Money
enough to purchaſe them, there was the Count <hi>de
Grandpre</hi> and two or three <hi>German</hi> Collonels more at
his Service. And indeed they all gave him their
words, but the Prince had not a Fund ſufficient to
do it, and ſo the buſineſs dropt; which if it had
taken effect, would have been of the laſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Party.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> after ſo glorious an Action,
was reſolv'd to take a turn to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57806:77"/>
receiv'd with an univerſal applauſe. But the Ladies
were thoſe that expreſt the moſt eſteem for him,
ſome of them being ſo forward as to wiſh they might
prove, whether he could acquit himſelf as well in an
Amorous Engagement, as he had done in the late
Battel. Mada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Pie,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Concreſſaut</hi> whom I
have mention'd, was one of theſe longing Ladies:
She writ to him, to tell him, that ſhe had ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
with him, of that importance that ſhe durſt not
confide 'em to any, but begg'd that he would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the trouble to let her ſee him, and he ſhould then
judge if they were not of conſequence. The Letter
was writ in terms too preſſing to admit of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe;
ſo he waited on her; when inſtead of ſome
mighty matter in relation to the State, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
ſhe made him a Confeſſion of her weakneſs,
but begg'd him to make uſe of it like a Gentleman,
and a Man of Honor. The good Prince was toucht with
com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſſion, and prepar'd inſtantly to give her the moſt
ſenſible proof; of it; but being at that time in her
Cloſet, where unfortunately there was no Bed, he
was put to his thifts, yet by taking the Cuſhions and
placing them one upon another, he did his beſt to
ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ige her. I came to <hi>Paris</hi> the very ſame day of
this Adventure and having a Letter for him from the
D. <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> I found him at his own Houſe, the <hi>Hoſtel
de Conde,</hi> he would needs make me ſtay Supper; and
while we were at Table, who ſhould come in but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſaut:</hi>
He told <hi>Concreſſaut</hi> what a rare Adventure he
had had that a certain very fine Lady, tho ſomething
of the talleſt and biggeſt ſize, had ſent that morning
to deſire to ſpeak with him; that waiting on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
he paſt thro Apartments very ſtately
furniſh'd to her Cloſet, which was very rich and
magnificent, and hung all round with Looking-glaſſes;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57806:77"/>
that the Lady refus'd him nothing, and that
in ſhort, he was extreamly well pleas'd with the
Adventure, but for one thing. <hi>Concreſſaut</hi> askt him
what that could be. He ſaid, it was becauſe he had
found all the parts of that Lady's body to bear an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
proportion with her Shapes, and by that bid him
gueſs if he could, who it was. There needed no
more to make <hi>Concreſſaut</hi> jealous of the truth, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he did not ſtick to ſay, he believ'd it was his
Siſter; but was the firſt of the Company that fell a
laughing, and ſo prevented the raillery of the reſt,
who were prepar'd to fall on him. For all that, the
Prince, for fear we ſhould not believe it, and to put
it out of all manner of doubt, drew the Letter out
of his Pocket, and ſhew'd it to every one that had
had the curioſity to ſee it.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was then in the Vigor of his
Youth, and had a great many little fellows about
him that were call'd Maſters: Theſe were moſt of
them lewd and debauch'd, and led him into abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Extravagancies, which not only ruin'd his
Health, but his Affairs. For ſome time after this,
that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had enter'd <hi>France,</hi> and
that the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was inclos'd between
his Troops, thoſe of the Princes, and thoſe of the
Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> the Court Party being in
that diſtreſs, that they knew not which way to turn
themſelves, if their Army was routed, at that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
I ſay, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was retain'd at
<hi>Paris,</hi> by a diſtemper which it is not decency to
mention, but which had nothing of a Fever in it, but
the name; by which means he loſt his Advantage,
and could not diſcover the Intelligence which was
held between the Court and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi>
for that Duke having receiv'd a conſiderable Sum
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57806:78"/>
of Money on that account, ſuffer'd the Viſcount <hi>de
Turenne</hi> to retire to <hi>Melun,</hi> which had been impoſſible
for him to do, if the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had been with
his Army.</p>
            <p>Tho the War ſeem'd to be carry'd on by both
Parties with great vigour, yet there were ſeveral
Treaties ſet on foot, and manag'd under-hand. I
was twice or thrice at <hi>St. Germains</hi> upon ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
from the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> whom <hi>Mazarin</hi>
had offer'd to make Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and to pay
him down two hundred thouſand Crowns, if he
wou'd leave the Princes party, and bring over with
him the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> on whom it was known,
that he had a great Influence. My Fortune was to
be made effectually too, and I was to have a Company
in the Guards for my pains in this affair; the Duke
was willing enough to accept of the propoſals, and
was not wanting in his endeavours on his part, but
all our meaſures were broke by the means of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domoiſelle
<hi>de Mompenſier,</hi> who being ſtark mad
to be marry'd, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had amus'd
with the hopes of having his Son, the Duke <hi>d' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army lying juſt at the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> we
were every day in the City, and there I met with
my Siſter, who to avoid the effects of the publick
diſturbances, had left her Convent and was come to
<hi>Paris.</hi> I was ſurpriz'd to ſee ſhe had quitted the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Habit, but was much more ſo, to underſtand that
ſhe was return'd to her Husband. She, it ſeems,
had met with him when ſhe leaſt of all expected it,
and as true Love is encreas'd by abſence, he no ſooner
ſaw her, but was tempted to forget the Obligation
he lay under by the holy Orders, he had too raſhly
taken; nor was ſhe behind hand with him, but laid
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57806:78"/>
aſide all her thoughts of Devotion. What happen'd
on this was ſomething extraordinary: She, who in
five or ſix years that they had liv'd together before,
had never been with Child, was become in a few
months as big as ſhe could tumble. I expreſt my
ſurprize at theſe proceedings, but all the ſatisfaction I
could get from her was this, that ſhe was bound to
obey her Husband, and being join'd together by the
Holy Sacrament of Marriage, were to be ſeparated by
nothing but Death.</p>
            <p>To relate this Affair, which made a great noiſe
in <hi>Paris,</hi> without breaking off the thread of my
diſcourſe, I muſt tell you that my Siſter was brought
to bed of a Son, in her due time, and that they
liv'd together three or four years after, at the end
of which my Brother in-law dy'd. My Siſter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter on the Eſtate, which was very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
met with oppoſition from his Relations,
who us'd this as a pretence, that her Son was Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.
Upon which a great Law Suit was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd,
which the pretended Heirs had a mind to
carry to be try'd in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> becauſe ſome part of
the Eſtate lay there; but they having caus'd the
Goods which were at <hi>Paris</hi> to be ſeiz'd, and the
Contract of Marriage being made there, theſe two
things brought them within the Juriſdiction of the
Juſtice of the place; beſides that, it ſolely belongs
to the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to take cognizance of all
things relating to the Validity of Marriages.</p>
            <p>The pretended Heirs being now oblig'd to come
to a Trial here, committed their Cauſe to one of
the ableſt Councel to manage, and he in his Plea
forgot nothing that the moſt artificial Rhetorick
could urge, when it intends moſt to perſwade.
He exaggerated what a Reflection it would be on
Religion, to tolerate ſuch an abuſe as this, which
was the very way to authorize what the <hi>Hugonots</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57806:79"/>
maintain, that 'tis lawful for a Prieſt to marry; that
not only the Child ought to be declar'd illegitimate,
but the Mother ought to be puniſht for ſo black a
crime, ſo h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrid a Sacrilege: That nothing had
forc'd the marry'd Couple to a Separation; but
when once they had done ſo, to devote themſelves
to God, it was a Vow of that nature, from which
none but the Pope himſelf could diſpence 'em:
That the preſent Caſe was ſtill different; here was a
Man who had not ſimply promis'd to devote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to God, but one who was conſecrated by all that
is moſt Holy in Religion: In a word, a Prieſt,
one who had a thouſand times offer'd the Sacrifice,
by which we all hope for Salvation: One who had
receiv'd an infinite Number of Souls to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Pennance; had given the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and in ſhort, who had done all that ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and ſacred a Character could intitle him to
do: That it ought to be conſider'd what would be
the conſequences of allowing ſuch a Sacrilege; how
many Confeſſions, and how many Sacraments would
be render'd ineffectual, and conſequently how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Souls eternally damn'd.</p>
            <p>'Twould be too tedious to recite all his Plea at
length, in which he was not ſparing of Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
againſt my Siſter, who being preſent, could
not hear them without an extreme Confuſion. At
laſt her Councel began to ſpeak, upon which every
one was ſilent, and he ſaid, That he could not but
admire, an Action ſhould be repreſented ſo foul and
criminal, which was only a Slip of Weakneſs, or
Humane Frailty: That he did not conceive the
fault lay ſo much in his Clients living with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
after a Separation of 5 or 6 years, as in the
ſuffering him in a fooliſh fit of zeal to turn Prieſt.
That God had expreſly forbid to ſeparate thoſe
who were thus join'd, how then could they ſuffer
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57806:79"/>
one, who had ſworn Fidelity to his Wiſe, to violate
an Oath he had taken in the Face of the Church?
and Marriage being a Sacrament, the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was ſubſequent, could not diſſolve
the firſt; That the Child had nothing to do with
the Indiſcretions of his Father; that his Legitimacy
was confirm'd by his Fathers Contract with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by the Marriage Benediction he receiv'd.
In ſhort, if the Parliament, as they had often, in
uncertain Caſes, adjudg'd the juſt Intention of a
Marriage ſufficient to legitimate the Children; how
much more reaſon had he to hope for the ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
in a Cauſe where the Honour of the Mother
was ſo far from being call'd in queſtion, that it was
never ſo much as ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The Judges were a long time in ſuſpence, during
which 'tis no hard matter to imagine mine and my
Siſters Fears. I was but juſt come in, as the laſt
man had done his Plea. The People that ſtood by,
but did not know me, told me the ſubſtance of
the other Councels Plea, and ſome of them were ſo
prejudic'd by his reaſons, as to tell us our Deſtiny;
but we were happy, that they were not our Judges.
They were miſtaken in their opinion, as it prov'd, for
we unanimouſly carry'd our Cauſe, and our Adverſaries
were condemn'd to all the Coſts &amp; Charges of the Suit.</p>
            <p>This Affair however was the occaſion that ſome
time after, Monſieur <hi>de Villemontee,</hi> being nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
to the Biſhoprick of <hi>St. Malo,</hi> was refus'd his
Bulls, becauſe he was parted from his Wife; but
on another account than that of my Brother. The
truth of which was, he had diſcover'd ſome Intrigues
of hers, when he was Intendant of Juſtice, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Requeſts; and that with the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
put him ſo out of conceit with the World,
that after he had made her retire to a Convent, he
gave himſelf wholly up to Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57806:80"/>
This buſineſs of my Siſter's having caus'd me to
make ſome digreſſion, 'twill be convenient now to
return, and reſume my diſcourſe of thoſe matters I
was upon before. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the Treaty (I mention'd formerly) purely by
his own fault, was reſolv'd to puſh things to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
rather than not compaſs what he drove at.
The other Princes were no leſs forward, and met eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day at <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> to conſult how they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Queen to relinquiſh the Cardinal, and to give
them a larger ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e in the government of affairs,
which was the cauſe of all their diſcontent. In the
me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n time, the Dukes of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> were
ſeveral times ready to quarrel about precedency; which
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to prevent, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>judg'd the firſt place to him, who
came firſt to the Council. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>
complain'd of this regulation; the Baſtards of <hi>France</hi>
having this Previledge in the Kingdom, to take place
of all Foreign Princes; but he was anſwer'd that it
could not be recall'd, and all his redreſs would be
now, to conſtrain himſelf a little to come ſomething
the ſooner. And he did not fail to do ſo, inſomuch
that 'twas taken notice of, and ſaid, that he ſtood
Centinel there every day, to watch till the door
ſhould be open'd.</p>
            <p>At length, after they had fully reſolv'd the ruine
of the Cardinal, and the means to accompliſh it, the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> left <hi>Paris</hi> to go to the aſſiſtance of
his Tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ps, which were in no ſmall apprehenſions of
thoſe of the King, exceeding them much in number.
His Preſence, with ſome other precautions he us'd,
made the Count <hi>de Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſens,</hi> who was advanc'd on
the ſide of St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> to retire, but not content with
that, he turn'd his Forces againſt St <hi>Denis;</hi> in which
there was a Royal Garriſon. The place being of no
ſtrength was eaſily carry'd, and for the ſame reaſon
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57806:80"/>
could not be kept for any time. The Prince, who
had experienc'd what kind of Souldiers the <hi>Pariſians</hi>
were, when he had to do with them near <hi>Charen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on,</hi>
found them not more brave now they fought for
him, for they deſerted him before St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and if
he had not had thoſe who ſtood by him, he had
been baffl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d before a little paltry Town.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was come back to <hi>Paris,</hi> but
in a few days return'd to his Army, perceiving the Kings
had taken the Field, on purpoſe to diſlodge his,
which by the means of the Bridge of <hi>St. Cloud,</hi> was
often cover'd by the river of <hi>Scine,</hi> ſo as to avoid
coming to a Battle. He found the Enemy had made a
Bridge of Boats ready on the ſide of <hi>St. Denis,</hi> to
paſs over part of their Army, while the other marcht
on this ſide of the River. Being therefore afraid to be
inclos'd, he decamp'd, and intended to retire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Charenton</hi> and <hi>Ville neuve St. Georges,</hi> where he
hop'd the rivers of <hi>Marne</hi> and <hi>Scine</hi> would ſerve him
for a good Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>renchment. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi>
whom he had to deal with, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etrating into his
deſign, fell upon him from the riſing grounds of the
<hi>Fauxbourg St. Martin,</hi> and furiouſly charg'd his Rear:
The Prince ſeeing himſelf ſo hotly preſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
of gaining the Bridge of <hi>Charenton,</hi> which he
could not paſs neither without defiling, reſolv'd to
fight, ſince he was forc'd to it, and commanded his
Van-guard to halt. They were come up as far as the
Entrance of the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Antoine,</hi> where he found
ſeveral Retrenchments, the <hi>Pariſians</hi> had caſt up, to
cover themſelves from the Spoil of the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had ravag'd the Countries all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
The Prince, as he had the greateſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Military Affairs of any man in his Age,
immediately concluded, that nothing could have
happen'd more advantageous, than what Fortune
herſelf here offer'd him; ſo he drew his Troops into
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57806:81"/>
theſe Retrenchments, and lodg'd them as faſt as they
came up.</p>
            <p>The Kings Army was ſtronger by half than the
Princes; but the Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferte</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a part of 'em, being ſtill on the other ſide of the
<hi>Seine,</hi> their Forces were pretty equal. The King,
who did not imagine that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could
eſcape him, poſted himſelf on the riſing grounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Menilmontunt,</hi> from whence being out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he might ſee all that paſt. He propos'd two
advantages to himſelf in doing this, one was, by his
preſence to animate the Souldiers; and the other,
that it would hinder the City of <hi>Paris</hi> from giving the
Prince a retreat. And indeed it had this effect, that
they did refuſe to let his Baggage come in, which was
for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'t to be left upon the Bulwark.</p>
            <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de la Ferte</hi> hearing the Viſcount <hi>de
Turenne</hi> was going to engage the Prince, made all
the haſte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e could to repaſs the <hi>Seine;</hi> but that was a
thing not to be done in a moment, ſo the Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
without him. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the entrance of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> made a vigorous
attack upon it, while at the ſame time he ſent ſome
of his Troops, to my to enter ſome other part of the
City.</p>
            <p>I had always till now, a good opinion of the
Courage of the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> and thought the
Reflections made on him by the Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
proceeded rather from the hatred that was between
them, than from any juſt occaſion; but I ſaw now
that he did all he could to get into the Town, upon
pretence of declaring for the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but
indeed, as I thought I had good reaſon to believe, to
avoid fighting. For the reſt, having told you the
zeal of the common people, in aſſiſting ſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
of his, I ought alſo to tell you how it came to
paſs, that they had now an other Opinion of him;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57806:81"/>
you muſt know, that he not only grew weary
of the War, but complain'd his Troops were
expos'd to all the Hardſhips of an Enemy, which the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could not help, having not Money
to pay them, that ſo they might have been kept in
Diſcipline; however the fight being begun, as I have
juſt now ſaid, was maintain'd on both ſides with
ſuch Reſolution, that 'twas not known for a good
while who would have the better of it; but the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> knowing that the Mareſchal <hi>de la
Ferte</hi> was marching with all ſpeed poſſibly to join
him, made ſuch efforts that he diſappointed his hopes
of ſharing with him in the Victory. The <hi>Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi>
were forc'd in two places, and tho the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> diſputed their paſſage with an incredible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
he was in great danger of having all his men
cut off. If Madamoiſelle <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
his Friend, had not done him a great piece of
Service. She ſeiz'd upon the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> a Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>reſs at the
Gate <hi>de St. Antoine,</hi> and letting fly the Cannon among
the Kings Troops, not regarding that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
himſelf, oblig'd him to make a precipitate Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treat,
and alſo to order <hi>Turenne</hi> to do the like.</p>
            <p>I had not been in very many actions, ſo I could
not ſay this was hotter than uſual, but I heard ſeveral
old Officers ſay 'twas, and I know very well, ſome
Squadrons charg'd five times; and tho they had been
often broke to pieces, yet they rally'd again as often;
here was abundance of men kill'd and wounded, and
the Duke <hi>de la Rochefaucaut</hi> was among the latter; he
receiv'd a hurt under his Eye, by which he loſt his ſight
for the preſent, but he has recover'd it again ſince;
they carry'd him into <hi>Paris,</hi> which Madamoiſelle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
at laſt to declare it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thro which the Prince
<hi>de Conde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> marcht his Army. The Duke <hi>de la Rouchefau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi>
thinking his Wound had been mortal, ſent for a
Prieſt to be confeſt, who told him 'twas to no purpoſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57806:82"/>
unleſs he would count this for one crime, his taking
up Arms againſt his King, and would promiſe never
to continue in it. 'Twould have been very well if all
the Confeſſors would have acquitted themſelves as
this fellow did, the diſorders would ſoon have been
ended; but they were not all ſo honeſt: And the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

others as a Cardinal, and Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> was ſo far
from that, that he was one of the firſt in the Revolt.</p>
            <p>It pleas'd God to preſerve me in this action, tho I
fought in a Tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p of which above half were kill'd
upon the place; but ſeeing the Duke <hi>de Beaufort</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himſelf, as I have noted, it very much leſſen'd
my eſteem for him, and I reſolv'd to leave him; which
I did, three days before he fought the Duel with the
Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi> in which the latter was kill'd. If the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had thought it worth his while he
might have prevented this misfortune; but he was
not ſorry that he was thus rid of this Prince, who was
his Rival in the Dutcheſs <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and as he
thought, better receiv'd there than himſelf; ſo that
when they told him he was kill'd, he hardly behav'd
himſelf decently; for ſhutting himſelf up with his
Favourites, he gave himſelf ſuch a liberty, that he
was heard to laugh ſo loud, that the People could
not but take notice of it.</p>
            <p>When I left Monſieur <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> I reſolv'd to
have no more Maſters but the King, that is to ſerve in
the Army, if he would entertain me; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>irs was ſuch, that I did not find it ſo
difficult a thing as formerly. I got a Troop of Horſe,
and orders to wait on the Cardinal; he askt me aſſoon
as ever he ſaw me, if he might truſt me, and anſwering
him readily, that he needed not to doubt me in the
leaſt, he ſent me to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to endeavour to bring
over the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> from his Brothers Party. I
addreſt my ſelf to <hi>Saraſin,</hi> the ſame whoſe Works
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57806:82"/>
have been publiſht ſince his Death; and <hi>Saraſin</hi>
having caution'd me to take care of being diſcover'd
by the Count <hi>de Marſin,</hi> or by any other Creatures of
the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> he gave ear to my Propoſitions,
which were more advantageous to himſelf than to
his Maſter; for they promis'd him 20000 Crowns
ready Money, whereas they offer'd the Prince nothing
but a Wife with ſome Penſions from the Court: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
his own condition not pleaſing him, he
was willing enough to change it, and agreed with
me to marry Madamoiſelle <hi>Martinotſi,</hi> the Cardinals
Niece. To conceal my ſelf the better in the Town, I
took the Habit of a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> being order'd to confer
with one Father <hi>Faure</hi> at the Convent of the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi>
who was one of the Cardinals Friends, being
truſted with a ſecret of no leſs value than the reducing
the City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to obedience; which he was
to do by fomenting certain diviſions reigning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Chief of the Town. He was a famous
Preacher, which made him very much reſpected every
where; beſides tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he was Confeſſor to the principal
Families in the City, ſo that employing both his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
to bring to paſs his deſigns, he had the eaſier
ſucceſs; for which ſervice he was preferr'd to the
Biſhoprick of <hi>Amiens,</hi> which he enjoys at this time.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>de Conti</hi> according to our Treaty deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

nobly jointur'd his Lady in a Clap. He reſign'd all
his Benefices to the Cardinal, under the name of one
<hi>Montreuil,</hi> and his Eminence, who made no ſcruple of the
Symony, gave him inſtead thereof a very large Penſion:
As for <hi>Saraſin,</hi> they laught at him when the buſineſs
was done, and inſtead of the 20000 Crowns they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him, they put him off with a ſmall Benefice; he
curſt and ſtorm'd at the Ingratitude of <hi>Mazarin;</hi> but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57806:83"/>
he needed not to have been ſo concern'd for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
having but a ſhort while to enjoy it. The Prince

dy'd in a few days after.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal behav'd himſelf very well to me after
this ſucceſs, but not like my old Maſter Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>
their maxims being far different; this carry'd it ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
to none but his own friends, and that behav'd it
alike to all. I went then into the Army which was in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> were we made ſome Conqueſts, which had
been greater, but for the diviſion that happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de

an affection to me, that he could ſcarce live without
me. My fortune caſting me upon him as it were, I
thought my ſelf oblig'd to ſhow him more reſpect than
the other, tho my eſteem was not equal for them both.

certain perſon that us'd to viſit her very often in his
abſence, and 'twas reported it was on ſuch an account;
when I underſtood what he meant, I took no notice
at all, as if I knew nothing, and tho he often run over
the ſame Chapter, I always turn'd the deaf ear, till at laſt
he was forc'd to explain himſelf, and told me, that he
took me to be ſo much his Friend, that I would
keep a ſecret; that his Wife kept company with a
perſon he did not like, who it ſeems was of my
acquaintance; that I ſhould give him a caution of it,
and that 'twas dangerous to give but an umbrage to
ſuch a man as he; that a Letter might miſcarry, and
therefore he choſe to have me go my ſelf; that I
ſhould alſo go to his Wife, and tell her as much; and
if ſhe took it unkindly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſuſpected her, I ſhould
tell her that he took it more unkindly ſhe ſhould
give him cauſe.</p>
            <p>It was ſtrange methought that I ſhould be the
perſon pick'd out for ſo great a confidence, and I
could not forbear telling him ſo; to which he return'd,
that he had known me a long time, and was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the many important affairs I had manag'd for
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and therefore concluded I was fit to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57806:84"/>
keep a ſecret, and he hop'd I would do it for him, and
promis'd in requital to uſe his intereſt to get me a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
which he thought the Cardinal would not
refuſe him.</p>
            <p>My fate threw me always upon ſuch Negotiations
as theſe, and I was forc'd to obey it, ſo I came to <hi>Paris;</hi>
where I ſaw my friend, who told me the Mareſchal
was mad; that he had ſeen his Wife indeed, but 'twas
as he ſaw all the reſt of the Sex, without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
than to paſs away the time, and if her Husband
would return him all the Money he had loſt at play to
her, he would go to a Notary, and bind himſelf never
to come near her any more, but till he had his revenge,
he would not promiſe him. I thought this anſwer very
weak, and made only to put me off; I told him I
wondred he would deal in this manner with a friend;
I knew nothing of his Intreague, being never cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to inform my ſelf of things that did not concern
me, but that this buſineſs muſt have made ſome noiſe,
becauſe it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is the laſt inform'd of ſuch things as thoſe; that
ſometimes indeed 'twas not ſo great a misfortune,
all Husbands being not of a humour to publiſh their
infamy, but if I was not miſtaken, the Mareſchal was
none of them; for I had heard ſay, that he kill'd
his firſt Lady upon a bare ſuſpicion. I pray'd him
to conſider what I told him, that he had to do
with a violent paſſionate man, and one beſides who
was in great favour at Court; that I meant by this,
he was able to oppreſs him without any relief on
his part, of which I could ſhow him daily examples;

            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:57806:84"/>
               <hi>He heard me quite out with a great deal of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and then return'd,</hi> I thought, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that you had been
one of my Friends, and I am very ſorry to find my ſelf deceiv'd.
Suppoſe I had lov'd Madam <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> I made no queſtion but
you would have been the readieſt man in the world to have
aſſiſted me; for you know 'tis a thing that we always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
freely for one another, but 'tis enough, that you give me
the ſame liberty you take your ſelf: However I'll tell you one
thing as a Friend, that Monſieur the Mareſchal is jealous
without cauſe; I have had no concern with his Wife, but at
Play, and I will have one opportunity more to recover my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
again, and will come no more at her as long as I live.</p>
            <p>I ſaw however there was more Intrigue in this
than he would have known, but I reckon'd I had
diſcharg'd my ſelf as a Friend, ſo I went to diſcourſe
with Madam <hi>La Ferte,</hi> who knew me well enough,
but not ſo well as to imagin I was truſted with ſuch
an Errand; for when ſhe underſtood it ſhe was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd: She told me ſhe was not much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at the proceedings of the Mareſchal, that he
went to pick a quarrel with her that he might have a
pretence to make her away as he had done his other
Wife, but ſhe had ſome Friends would revenge it if
he did; that if ſhe had given him any occaſion to do
thus, why had he not told her of it, for he had not
ſaid a word to her of any ſuch thing; that it was no
ſtrange thing to ſee a Husband jealous, who had a
wanton goſſiping Cocquette to his Wife; that as for
her, all the world knew ſhe never ſtirr'd abroad, and
excepting at play, kept no Company at all; why
ſhould he accuſe her then of Crimes which were not
to be manag'd without much intriguing and aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
afore hand.</p>
            <p>She would have talkt all day I believe, if I had not
interrupted her; but finding there would be no end
of it, I ſtopt her, by telling her that I was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
to receive her Juſtifications; that as for me
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57806:85"/>
I was perſwaded ſhe had more Prudence, but that was
not enough, if her Husband was not ſo; that the way to
ſatisfy him fully, was to avoid the company of the man
whom he ſuſpected; and ſince ſhe did not ſee him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
at play, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe needed not matter it, there
being a great many in <hi>Paris</hi> ſhe might play with as
well as with him, and that being done, I did not doubt
but her Husband would do her juſtice to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
her vertue as well as I; that this was only his
nice humour, which was for preventing any ſcandal,
tho in the great poſt he was, Malice it ſelf could faſten
nothing on his conduct; yet if ſhe ſhould give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for it to work on hers, it would be full as bad.</p>
            <p>She anſwer'd me, I might turn things as I pleas'd,
but ſhe muſt judge as ſhe ſaw, that her Husband was a
Brute and a jealous-pated Man, that ſhe ſhould be
always unhappy with him, but ſince it was her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to be ſo, I might tell him, ſhe would obey his
arbitrary will and would ſee the perſon no more, there
was all this ado about; and if he would too, ſhe would
hide her ſelf from all perſons that came to the Houſe,
even from her own Servants, for one was as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the other. Theſe words did ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
her concern, however as it was not my buſineſs
to take any notice of it. I took my leave of her, but
with ſo mean an opinion of her vertue, that I very
much doubted ſhe would not keep her word. In the
mean time to put a ſtop to this, and to avoid any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuſpicion, ſhe broke off the Meetings for Play
which us'd to be at her houſe, and kept in ſeveral days
without being ſeen; but having privately entertain'd
the perſon I mention'd, ſhe made her ſelf amends for
the Pennance ſhe had undergone.</p>
            <p>The Mareſchal being inform'd of this, by Spies
which he kept always about her, and reſolving to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
both her and her Gallant, he ſent three Dragoons
of his Regiment to <hi>Paris,</hi> with order to aſſaſſinate the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57806:85"/>
one, and to poiſon the other; the firſt of theſe was
eaſier to be done than the ſecond: My Friend co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
home one night very late from Play, at the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>d Estrees,</hi> was ſet upon and kill'd in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Dragoons would have made their eſcape,
had not one of them fell into the Common Shore near
the <hi>Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> St. Louis;</hi> ſo they took him and clapt him up
into Priſon, and made him pay for the other; they
put him to the torture to make him diſcover his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices,
and by whom they were ſet on work to
do ſuch a fact; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e having diſcover'd all that he
knew, the Lieutenant Criminel <hi>Tardieu</hi> went to carry
the informations to the Cardinal, and askt him what
he pleas'd ſhould be done with them. <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who
was oblig'd to the Mareſchal, order'd him to ſuppreſs
them, and to cauſe the Dragoon to be ſtrangled in
Priſon, which was done accordingly. But the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
being afraid, that Madam <hi>la Ferte</hi> ſhould fare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner, he ſent her word privately to
take care of her ſelf, and to endeavour to regain the
good opinion of her Husband; ſhe had been very
much diſturb'd at the misfortune of her Gallant, but
this Compliment made her very ſerious. She fled to
the Queen Mother for protection, and feigning her
ſelf religious, ſhe began to attend her to her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Mareſchal finding ſuch an alteration in
her at his return, took it very well, and believ'd all
the reports he had of her to be ſcandals and falſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ies;
and having been a long time from her, he receiv'd her
more like a Miſtreſs than a Wife. However ſhe would
not put up all this ſo eaſily, but would have it exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
into, which prov'd ſo much to her advantage,
that her Husband himſelf askt her pardon for his
ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>All this while the War continu'd, but the heart of
<hi>France</hi> was free from it, and the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> after
all his great deſigns, was oblig'd to retire into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>

of his Pocket, and that I muſt have patience. I

It was in vain for me to oppoſe going, all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

in ſpight of my teeth: The Chevalier <hi>de Rieux,</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57806:88"/>
and Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> who now had the
Soveraign Authority, hearing a great many falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of this Action, order'd us to be proſecuted
with the utmoſt vigour: ſo we were examin'd, and
that as ſtrictly as if we had been the worſt of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
and I eſpecially, having had ſome words
formerly with him that was now our Judge, who
fancy'd that I did him an ill Office once with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>de Richlieu.</hi> If I had been conſcious of any
guilt, I would without doubt have excepted againſt
him, as a Party prejudic'd againſt me; but knowing
my ſelf clear, I made no ſcruple of being examind
by him, which he was very glad of, thinking now
he ſhould have an opportunity to be even with me:
In ſhort, I perceiv'd that the Clerk, who held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with him, and took my Examination,
wrote a great deal more down than I ſpoke, which
made me diſſatisfied with his reading it, ſo I wou'd
not ſign it till I had read it my ſelf; but he told me
that was not their cuſtom, and they would not
make a new Law for me. But this made me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
them the more, inſomuch that telling them
plainly that I would not ſign it then, he not only
gave me a great deal of ill Language, but committed
me to the Dungeon. O God! What a paſſion was I in,
to ſee my ſelf us'd like a Highway-man or a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
for a bare frolick, with no hopes of getting
out, and kept ſo cloſe that I could have no
Friend admitted to me, nor no body to ſpeak a
word to, but the Keepers: I begg'd one of them
to convey a Letter for me to a Friend, and to help
me to a Pen and Ink to write it, and promis'd him
to do him more kindneſs than it came to, when I
ſhould get out of Priſon; but he was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toucht with my entreaties, that he gave me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57806:88"/>
ill Language, enough to have madded a very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Man. The Chevalier <hi>de Rieux</hi> far'd not a jot
better than I; and being both accus'd of the ſame
Crime, the Lieutenant Criminel was oblig'd to
treat him exactly in the ſame manner, leſt he ſhould
be thought to proſecute me, upon a private Picque.
The Chevalier was a very lewd perſon, and
little better than his Brother (who we have known
to be a notorious Debauchee) and had like him,
the guilt of very many and great Crimes upon
him, which now reflecting on a little ſeriouſly,
he thought this a judgment on him for his wicked
courſes; and as Mariners in diſtreſs make vows for
their deliverance, ſo he made ſolemn promiſes to
reform, if ever he got out of this unhappy buſineſs;
but he ſoon forgot them all when God had heard
his Prayers, and inſtead of reclaiming, grew more
vicious than before; till he waſted his Eſtate and
left himſelf not a bit of bread, and then put himſelf
into a Monaſtery, that he might not ſtarve for want:
But this life not agreeing with his inclination, he
quitted his Caſſock, and little Band, and took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
turn abroad; when having try'd his Fortune all
the ways he could think of, he turn'd Eccleſiaſtick
a ſecond time, more to avoid Humane Juſtice, which
he was in danger of, than Divine; and taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
is now a Curate in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves
himſelf no better than he did at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my own caſe. The Cardinal
being ſollicited every day to make an example of
ſome body or other, for the terror of thoſe that
practic'd this way of robbing in the Streets, which
indeed was abſolutely neceſſary, to ſtop the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
conſtantly committed in the Street, ſo that
'twas not ſafe going abroad in the Night, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57806:89"/>
the Lieutenant Criminel to bring him the
informations; and having ſeen ours, in the manner
the Judge had been pleas'd to draw it, he order'd
them to proceed againſt us. This Order was too
publick not to be known at Court, and the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<hi>de Rieux</hi> being related to almoſt all the People of
Quality, he made no queſtion but they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for him, for fear of ſuffering a blot upon the
Family, which they did; and applying to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Criminel, he told them he ſhould be very
glad to ſerve them, provided it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my receiving part in the favour; that our Crimes
were the ſame, but if they who we had ſaid were
with us, would ſubmit to be examin'd, which had not
yet been done becauſe of their Quality, and would
teſtify that 'twas I that prompted them not only to
go on the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> but alſo to do all thoſe ill things
we were accus'd of. Theſe were the conditions, and
ſuch did theſe Gentlemen accept of; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it to the others, they found them very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
ſo they purchas'd their own liberty with my
ruine, and I was charg'd with a thouſand things that
I never ſo much as dreamt of; ſo I was as it were
a Victim deliver'd up to the malice of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Criminel; and had doubtleſs been ſacrific'd,
had not God ſent me deliverance by a way which
I leaſt expected. There came one day into my

and this woman mov'd with my diſtreſſes,
lookt on me, as I could eaſily diſcern, with a more
compaſſionate Eye than uſual: ſhe durſt not howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeak a word to me while her Husband was by,
but coming again a ſecond time, ſhe took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſhow me, that ſhe had a Letter for
me, which I ſhould take ſo as her Husband might
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57806:89"/>
not perceive it; but this was impoſſible to do, this
man kept his Eye ſo continually upon me, which
oblig'd the woman to make as if ſhe was looking
upon my Straw-bed, and turning it up, ſhe threw
the Letter directly into it, where I found it when
ſhe was gone: The Contents was, that ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Lieutenant Criminel acted againſt me with
a Paſſion, more like an Accuſer than a Judge, which
had mov'd her compaſſion; that I was a loſt Man,
if I did not get ſome perſon of very great Intereſt
to ſtand up for me; that ſhe would endeavour to
bring me a Pen, Ink, and Paper; that I might
write to my Friends, and ſhe would take care to
convey it for me.</p>
            <p>This was very ſeaſonable for me, my Perſecutor
being ready to confront me with his Witneſſes, and
waiting immediately upon that to give Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, which would alſo have ſoon been confirm'd
by the Parliament. Beſides, they had made new
informations, and whereas in the former, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
depos'd that they found me upon the Brazen
Horſe, they depoſed now, that they took me in the
fact, Robbing on the <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> and catcht me as
I was endeavouring to make my eſcape. The
Keepers Wife was as good as her word, and made
uſe of the ſame device to convey me the Pen and
Ink ſhe had promis'd me, as ſhe had to leave me
the Letter; ſo that having wherewith to do it, I
wrote two Letters, one to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the
other to Mouſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> Son to him that was
Keeper of the Seal; I directed both of them to him,
and the Keepers Wife having deliver'd them to
him, he told her, he wonder'd what I meant; that
while I was in favour, his Family, whatever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
they had of me, never heard from me, but as

ſoon as I was in Affliction I had recourſe to them;
however, he would not fail to do me all the ſervice
he could, and would have done it before if he had
known my neceſſity. This being reported to me by
the honeſt woman, I confeſt in my mind it was an
anſwer very true and very generous, for I had given
him no cauſe to have any thoughts of me to my
advantage, for they knew nothing, how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

they very well remembred, that 'twas I that carry'd
the Order to have him apprehended; for all which,
he delay'd not a moment, but that very day preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Petition in my name to the Parliament; by
which he declar'd that the Lieutenant Criminel was
my mortal Enemy, for the reaſons I have already
given, and as I had inſtructed him in my Letter,
acted againſt me with ſo much private ſpleen, that
he had ſuppreſs'd the firſt Information to make new
ones; and not only ſo, but had himſelf ſuborn'd
Witneſſes againſt me, and the Chevalier <hi>de Rieux</hi>
among the reſt, and that he had ſuppreſt my Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to recriminate upon him, not letting it be brought
before them that would have done me Juſtice, and
that without a kind of miracle, I had never had
opportunity to preſent this Petition; and in ſhort,
that I was ſo innocent of the Crimes laid to my
charge, that tho I was indeed in ſuch Company as

from them, and not at all concern'd in what
they did.</p>
            <p>The Credit of Monſieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> (who had a

Criminel was forbid to proceed any further in
my proceſs; and the Officers who took me, were
order'd to come and depoſe before an Officer of the
Parliament, but not one of them durſt appear; and
I obtain'd a perſonal Summons for every one of
them, which was afterwards turn'd to a decree to
take them up; and I took three or four of them,
and had them put into the Common Goal: when
they were in Cuſtody they told the truth, and how
all had paſs'd, ſo that I was juſt a going to have a
Judgment, by which the truth of the whole matter
would have been extorted from the Lieutenant
Criminel, if he had not been advis'd to transfer it
to the Counſel. The Parliament who had already
receiv'd ſeveral reprimands from the King, for having
ſlighted the decrees of the Council, knowing they
had given one, by which he was forbidden to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
any further, durſt not go on with it, which
ſpun out my buſineſs to a great length: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
Monſieur <hi>de Marillac</hi> having repreſented to the
Council the injuſtice that was done me, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Criminel was defeated, and was forbidden to
be Judge in the caſe, and the Dean of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
<hi>du Chatelet</hi> was ſubſtituted in his place, who
had order to take new informations; and he be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
having himſelf like a Man of honour and honeſty,
the truth was brought to light, and my Enemies
were proved to be Lyars: So I came out of Priſon,
after having been confin'd four Months, whereof I
had been two Months and a half in the Dungeon.
My firſt viſit was to Monſieur <hi>de Marillac,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me very kindly, without ſpeaking one word
of what he had hinted to the Keepers Wife; he
return'd me the Letter I had wrote for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> not finding it convenient to deliver it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57806:91"/>
After having acknowledged this obligation, I
thought of diſcharging another of no leſs value,
which was to pay my thanks to the good woman,
the Keepers wife; to whom having made an offer
of a very conſiderable Preſent, I was ſurpriz'd to ſee
her refuſe it. This affliction gave me leiſure enough
to reflect upon my ſelf, and having given my ſelf
up to the Pleaſures of the World, like a Man that
never conſiders he muſt one day dye, I had made
a reſolution to change my courſe of Life: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
it coming into my head, that this woman
could not do all this for no end, or with no deſign;
and ſince ſhe had refus'd my Preſent, I concluded it
could be no other than that of Love, and thought
my ſelf oblig'd to content her that way too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſidering that I was going already to break
the promiſe I had made to God in my Troubles.
But if I was ſurpriz'd at her refuſing my Preſent, I
was much more ſo, at the manner in which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
my Complement; for without that Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that 'tis ſo much the faſhion for Women to
make, who would be thought more vertuous than
they really are; ſhe told me roundly, that I did not
deſerve the Deliverance that God had ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
beſtow'd on me; that I had more reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
him thanks than to pull down his vengeance on
me, by an account ſo criminal, as the Adultery I
had compaſs'd in my Thoughts: That if ſhe had
oblig'd me, 'twas only becauſe ſhe knew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
that was offer'd me, and this was but an ill
requital, to propoſe ſo horrid a Crime to her. I
was heartily glad to ſtand corrected by ſo Chriſtian
a reproof: and as vertue commands our eſteem, ſo
I had more real value for her, than I ſhould have
had love, if ſhe had yielded to my ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57806:91"/>
I had no ſooner loſt the thoughts of this crime,
but I entertain'd another in my breaſt; I reſolv'd to
revenge my ſelf of my falſe Witneſſes, and begun
with the Chevalier <hi>de Rieux,</hi> whom I forc'd to
draw in the ſtreet, having met him by accident:
as he naturally was but a Coward, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to convince me, that I was under the greateſt
miſtake in the world, to offer that to him who was
always one of my beſt Friends; but as I knew well
enough what I ought to believe, I took no great
heed to what he ſaid, but gave him ſeveral blows
with the flat of my Sword, ſeeing he would not be
perſwaded to draw; but I was not ſatisfied with all
this: Next I meditated revenge againſt the Count
<hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> who I knew had treated me uncivilly
behind my back: Tho he was of a moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Family, and tho his Quality exempted him from
giving me the common ſatisfaction in ſuch caſes, yet
I was reſolv'd one way or other to let him know,
that I was not inſenſible of the affront; and it was
not long before I had an occaſion put into my
hands; there was a Captain in the Marine Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
call'd <hi>Deſplanches,</hi> who was one of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in the Country, to whom he had behav'd
himſelf very imperiouſly, upon pretence that his
Anceſtors had raiſed their Eſtate by being Rent-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
or Stewards to his Family, by which means
they had left their Heirs a better Eſtate than their
Maſter, intimating as if they had dealt unjuſtly by
him. 'Tis true this <hi>Deſplanches</hi> had been ſo, and had
little leſs than thirty thouſand Livres a year Eſtate;
and having obtain'd Letters Patents for his Nobility,
and a Coat of Arms, now he thought he ought
not to bear all thoſe meanneſſes, which was impos'd
upon him by the haughty carriage of the Count:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57806:92"/>
Beſides this, that Prince had a great mind to a peice
of Land that belong'd to him call'd <hi>Rufflais,</hi> which
joyning to his Eſtate at <hi>Harcourt,</hi> he was always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching
upon.</p>
            <p>I no ſooner was inform'd of all this, but I offer'd
my Service to <hi>Deſplanches,</hi> whom I had no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with before; but I found means to let him
underſtand, that I was like to be very hearty in
joyning with him againſt one that was ſo much my
Enemy as well as his. This man, who was the
greateſt Drunkard that ever I knew in my life, never
thankt me, nor nothing, but told me, he ſhould be
very glad to drink with me; and not to delay it,
deſi'rd me to dine with him at the <hi>Flower de luce,</hi>
where he lodged, near the <hi>Hoſtel de Soiſſons.</hi> He
told me however after his firſt Compliment, that he
was oblig'd to me, but I did not find him ſo eager
of the thing as I thought he would have been; ſo
that I concluded either that he wanted courage, or
that he was afraid of embroiling himſelf with a
Prince of that intereſt. I held of this mind till Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when having eaten his Soup, and taken off two
or three Bumpers, he began to talk very ſcandalouſly
of the Count <hi>de Harcourt:</hi> I told him he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me in ſaying, this was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the way he ought
to revenge himſelf of his Enemy; that I had heard
the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> had offer'd him ſeveral inſults,
even in his own houſe, and if he pleas'd we would
go home with him, and ſee if we could perſwade
him, to come and do the like again. <hi>Deſplanches,</hi>
whoſe paſſion encreaſt with his Wine, told me,
he lik'd the propoſal very well; and having askt
two or three Officers of the ſame Regiment, that
were with us, if they would be of the party, they
all agreed immediately they would go: So he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57806:92"/>
his Horſes to be ſaddled, and deſir'd us to ſend
for ours. I thought we had nothing to do now,
but to put on our Boots and to mount, but 'twas not
his way to riſe from Table ſo ſoon, and 'twas ſix a
Clock at night before he would ſtir, and then he was
ſo drunk, that inſtead of going about what had
been agreed, he fell to quarrelling with one of thoſe
Officers, ſo that if I had not clapt in between, the
quarrel would not have ended without miſchief; I
endeavour'd to make him ſenſible of his error, but
he being no more capable of reaſon than a Horſe,
was the more unruly, till the Officer that knew him
better than I, was oblig'd to go out of the Room,
for fear-of puſhing the humour too far: The two
others, leſt I ſhould think he did ſo for want of
courage, told me at the ſame time ſoftly, that
'twould be beſt for us to withdraw too; that when
he was drunk he was quite mad, and if we did not,
we ſhould, it may be, find ſome of the effects of his
diſorder: I ſaw reaſon enough to believe them, ſo
we ſent back our Horſes and went home to our own
Lodgings, while <hi>Deſplanches</hi> was fighting with his
Men, and quarrelling with his Landlord and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
for letting us go.</p>
            <p>The next morning before I was up, he comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, and taking no notice of laſt nights
work, he askt me if I held my reſolution, of going
with him into the Country as I had promis'd. I
told him Yes, and was ready to go when he pleas'd.
He told me he would go as ſoon as ever the other
Gentlemen were ready, to whom he had ſent that
morning, and ſo deſir'd me to riſe: and then he took
five or ſix turns in my Chamber, walking haſtily as
if he had ſome great thing in his head; at laſt it
came out, and he told me that he was diſturb'd in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57806:93"/>
his thoughts, for fear he ſhould make a broil with the
Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who wanted nothing but ſuch an
opportunity to out him of his Eſtate: This made me
ſenſible that ſuch ſort of people always retain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the meanneſs of their Nature, in ſpight of
all the Patents of Nobility their Money may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them; and if the Officers had not come in, in
that very moment, I had put off engaging with a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of ſo mean a reſolution: I told them what
<hi>Deſplanches</hi> had been ſaying to me, at which they
ſhrunk up their ſhoulders; but being Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
they told him, he ought rather to dye than
to bear the affronts he received every day; that
they did not deſign to go and quarrel with the
Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> at his own Houſe, but they
would only go with him and Hunt upon his Lands,
that lay next to the Count's, to let him ſee that he
was not afraid of him.</p>
            <p>And to hearten him up, they gave him leave to
go to Breakfaſt firſt, upon condition he ſhould drink
but his ſhare of two Bottles of Wine; and this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the deſir'd effect, we got on Horſeback and
took the direct way to <hi>Normandy:</hi> Now tho this
Man had nothing to do, but to make haſte to our
Journeys end, yet all we could do, could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
him ſtaying a whole day at <hi>Mantes,</hi> where he
lighting on ſome excellent Wine, made them fill a
hundred Bottles of it, which we ſet in the head of our
little Troop, and convoy'd to his Houſe. And leſt
the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who was at home, ſhould
have notice of our coming, we thought it beſt to
come in in the Night; and having forbid the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
telling any body how many we were, we went
a Hunting the next morning, and rod up even to
the very edge of the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi>'s Land,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57806:93"/>
which lay next to <hi>Rufflais.</hi> The Count being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
inform'd of it, and ſuppoſing it to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Deſplanches</hi> and his Men, laid an Ambuſcade for
them as they ſhould come back. In ſhort, as we
were riding under a Hedge, we were ſaluted with
two ſhots from the other ſide, one of which ſtruck
off the Pommel of my Saddle, upon which I turn'd
about immediately, and being very well mounted,
I came up with one of the Fellows that had ſhot,
before he had time to charge again; I could eaſily
have kill'd him if I would, but not being willing
to do ſo, I contented my ſelf with beating him
moſt unmercifully with my Fuſil: The Fellow
knowing me, call'd me by my Name, and told me
he belong'd to ſuch a Gentleman, and hop'd that
for his Maſters ſake, whom he thought to be one of
my very good Friends, I would be pleas'd to pardon
him: <hi>'Tis your Maſter Sirrah,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>is the cauſe that
I uſe you at this tate, but I will let you go, provided you
will promiſe me to tell him ſo.</hi> He made no difficulty
of promiſing me this, and going another way to
eſcape <hi>Deſplanches</hi> and the Officers, who were in chaſe
of the others, he got at laſt to the Caſtle <hi>de Harcourt,</hi>
all over batter'd and bruis'd, and his Cloaths torn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
off of his back, ſo that any body might ſee he
had fallen into very bad hands: <hi>Deſplanches</hi> and his
Friends blam'd me extreamly for letting him go,
thinking that I ought rather have ſeiz'd him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
him to Juſtice; but I who aim'd moſt at my
private revenge, was very well pleas'd with what I
had done. In ſhort, the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was ſo
enrag'd at the affront, he had as he thought receiv'd;
that he aſſembled all his Friends, and not conſidering
that he was the Agreſſor, he reſolves to pull down
the very houſe at <hi>Rufflais,</hi> and to bury us all in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57806:94"/>
Ruins. This was not to be done ſo ſecretly, but
we had notice of it, and the Houſe being not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fencible,
we retre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted to the Houſe of the Count
<hi>de Crequi Bernieulle,</hi> who was no Friend to the
Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and whoſe Houſe was then the
Seat of a little War between him and the Marquis <hi>de
Sourdeac;</hi> for there was not only a Suit at Law depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between them, but 'twas grown to that height,
that they made a formal War againſt each other;
and oftentimes met one another in the field, with
fifteen or ſixteen hundred men of a ſide, as if they
would come to a ſet Battle; ſo we offer'd our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to him to engage in his Party againſt both the
Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Sourdeac:</hi>
There was a great deal of difference between theſe
Troops and regulated Souldiers, as appeared parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
one day, when the Count <hi>de Crequi</hi> being
advanc'd, the Marquis <hi>de Sourdeac</hi> had no ſooner
fired one ſhot from a Fauconet at the Caſtle <hi>de
Nieufborg,</hi> but all the Squadron ſcour'd away as hard
as they could drive, every one laying the blame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
upon his Horſe, who was not us'd to
ſtand fire; but as the diſgrace was general, thoſe
that ſtood were willing enough to take it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.
As they made war upon the Marquis <hi>de Sourdeac,</hi>
ſo did I upon the Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> upon whoſe
ground I ventur'd two or three times to kill ſome
Partridges: The Bayliff came, and deſir'd me civilly to
forbear, pretending his Maſter was gone to <hi>Paris,</hi>
but I knew well enough that was a ſham, for the
very next night he came with his men, and cut down
the Trees, at the very Gates of <hi>Rufflais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought however I had done enough to teſtify
my reſentment, and <hi>Deſplanches</hi> being on the other
hand oblig'd to return to the Army, I was oblig'd
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57806:94"/>
to bear him company to <hi>Paris,</hi> for he durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to have gone alone; being arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> I
went preſently to Court, and the Cardinal ſeeing
me, askt me whence I came, which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that he knew all that had paſt; nevertheleſs
I durſt not tell him the truth, leſt he ſhould give me
a reprimand for it, and perhaps ſomething worſe;
but I was ſurpriz'd, when inſtead of that, he told
me I had done very well, and he ſhould like me the
better for it as long as he knew me; that one <hi>Folle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
le Sens,</hi> who was a Gentleman of that Country,
and who belong'd to him, had told him all, and
that I needed not be diſturb'd at it; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
might depend upon his Protection. I humbly
thankt him for this goodneſs, but I askt him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
how he would pleaſe to diſpoſe of me: For
while I was under confinement, he had given away
my Company; ſo that I lookt methought, in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
condition, little better than a <hi>Valet</hi> out of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
he bid me take no care of that, but attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, for he went every year into the Army with
the King; who began now, not only to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
great, but alſo to give an early proof of what
he would one day appear. In ſhort, he delighted
in the War above all things, and tho they caution'd
him with regard to his Health, not to expoſe his
Perſon ſo in the Heats and Rains, yet he ſeldom
miſt being on Horſeback as long as any Day-light
was left.</p>
            <p>I had ſpent more time in the Court than in the
Army; and ſeeing however my Inclination led me
to the Profeſſion, yet that 'twas impoſſible for me
to manage my ſelf in it, as well as thoſe who had
been bred to it, I was not ſorry for the Command
the Cardinal laid upon me. I waited upon him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57806:95"/>
with the greateſt aſſiduity poſſible; and tho I
ſay it, omitted nothing that might oblige him.
However, there was ſeveral Poeple, who pretended to
perſwade me that I took wrong meaſures, and among
the reſt one <hi>Artignan</hi> and <hi>Beſmau,</hi> who complain'd
that they had done the ſame thing all their lives,
without any advancement more than what they were
at firſt; and indeed they made but a very ſorry fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
and were in ſuch a pitiful condition for the
moſt part, they knew not where to get a Penny
to buy a Dinner: This oblig'd them to think of
retiring from the Court; but as they were of the
furtheſt part of <hi>Gaſcogne,</hi> and that they had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to undertake ſo long a Journey, they try'd all
ways poſſible to raiſe a little money, but all People
were ſo kind to them as to refuſe them: for if they
had got together but ten Piſtoles, we ſhould never have
ſeen one of them Commander of the firſt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Grand Muſqueteers, nor the other with an
Eſtate of Three Millions of Livres, as he is at this
time: However, all they could ſay was not capable
to diſhearten me from following his Eminence to
the Frontiers. The Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> went the
ſame time with the King, and looking a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully
at me, I ſent him word by one of my
Friends, that if he was not pleas'd, he had nothing
to do but to tell me ſo. He return'd again, that I
did not know my ſelf, but he ſhould find a time to
make me do it. This was a Bravade which I laught
at, and other People laught as well as I; for tho he
was a Prince, he ought not to have carried it ſo
high; and ſeveral as good as he, and thoſe ſome of
his own Family too, had not thought it below them
to meaſure their Sword with a Gentleman; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
my Friend advis'd me to have a care of my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57806:95"/>
ſelf, but I ſlighted it, thinking a Prince of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was incapable of a baſe action; but thoſe who
I thus gave my opinion to, told me, that he who
had done his beſt to take me off when I was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
might very well be thought to attempt it now
I was at liberty: However, I was not deceiv'd in
him, and whatever his endeavours had been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf, he never attempted any of thoſe
ways they ſeem'd to ſuſpect: For I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that any private Ambuſcade, had been laid at
any time for me; and tho I did attribute to him an
accident which happen'd to me a few days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
yet I ought always to ſay for the honour of
the Perſon I had to do withal, that he fairly gave
me time to draw my Sword; and if I was roughly
handl'd, it was by the Fortune of the fight, and not
a private aſſault.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Breaute</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
who was a Man brave enough, and a very handſom
Perſon, but of a behaviour ſo extraordinary inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that it render'd all the other good Qualities he
had, not worth taking notice of: He had this ill
temper by inheritance, from the Marquis <hi>de Breaute</hi>
his near Relation, who had ſo good an opinion of
himſelf, that he challeng'd five and twenty
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> to fight them all one after another;
but Monſieur <hi>de Grobendonc</hi> Governour of <hi>Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc</hi>
laughing at his inſolence, told him, that he
ſhould have enough of one; and to make it good,
added, that he ſhould bring four and twenty <hi>French</hi>
men along with him, and he would ſend five and
twenty <hi>Spaniards</hi> to meet them. <hi>Breaute</hi> enrag'd
with this anſwer, askt leave of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
under whom he ſerv'd, to accept of the Challenge,
and having obtain'd it, he manag'd the fight ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57806:96"/>
that he was kill'd upon the ſpot, and two and
twenty of his Men, and the two other cry'd for
Quarter, who being brought Priſoners to <hi>Boleduc,
Grobendonc</hi> immediately hang'd them, which action de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd
his honour, and ſullied the Victory his Party
had obtain'd; but he gave this reaſon for it, That all
the Combatants had ſworn to maintain the fight to
the laſt drop of their Blood rather than to demand
quarter, and 'twas but juſt that theſe who broke
their word, ſhould expiate the perjury with their
lives, for a ſatisfaction to their Companions that
perform'd their vow to the laſt. <hi>Breaute,</hi> tho as you
ſee, he had no great cauſe to brag of this action of
his Kinſman, yet he had the ſtory always in his
mouth, and at every turn would repeat it, to ſhow
that his Family had been always men of Courage;
and to make himſelf more ridiculous, he would
bring it out, that if <hi>Grobendonc</hi>'s Men had had to do
with him, they ſhould not have come off ſo well.
I have heard him tell this ſtory very often, which
has made very good ſport to all the Company: But
having been taught by experience, that we ſhould
not always laugh at the follies of others, I was the
only Perſon that kept my Countenance at theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and conſequently was furtheſt off from the
thoughts of a Quarrel; and yet when I leaſt thought
of it, I was oblig'd to fight him, upon pretence
that I had been as rude with him as the reſt. My
honour would not permit me to refuſe him, but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
there was ſomething more in the matter, and
being willing to know the bottom of it, I told him
that if he had no other cauſe to quarrel with me than
that, he might put up his Sword again, for I had
never ſo much as dreamt of it; and that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were with me would give me the ſame
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57806:96"/>
ſatisfaction, that I did not ſay this out of fear, I
believ'd I had given proofs enough of my courage
in ſeveral occaſions, not to have it call'd in queſtion
at ſuch a time: while I was ſaying this I kept at
Swords length off, if poſſible to have avoided fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But he deſpiſing my juſtification, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excited on ſome other account, threw himſelf
upon me in a ſtrange fury, and wounded me in the
ſide. I became raging mad at the ſight of the blood,
and making a deſperate thruſt, I ran my Sword to
the Hilt thro his Thigh, but he preſently reveng'd
himſelf, for at the next paſs he ran me quite through
the Body, upon which I dropt immediately, and he
diſarm'd me.</p>
            <p>I had a ſuſpicion, that this was done by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of the Count <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by what I heard the next Morning; for they
told me, that he carried my Sword to that Prince,
and that for joy of the Victory they made ſuch a
Debauche of it, that all the Company that were there,
were ſent home in a lamentable pickle, and the Count
himſelf made no ſcruple to own the fact: 'Twas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſhonorable for him to tell all the world thus,
that he could not fight but by Proxy, he had a name
bad enough already, after the manner that he liv'd
and treated his Lady, he needed not have taken ſuch
pains to encreaſe it. In ſhort, he liv'd more like a
Bully than a Prince, which was the cauſe that he
treated his Lady after ſuch a ſort as I hinted but now:
That 'twas reported that he us'd to beat her, I know
not whether this was true at the bottom, or that his
being Brother to the Duke <hi>d' Elbeuf,</hi> who had kill'd
his Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with ill uſage, got him this Reputation:
However 'twas, this is certain, that this Lady, who
was a rich Heireſs, not being able to bear his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57806:97"/>
retir'd to a Monaſtery, where ſhe remains to
this day.</p>
            <p>My wound was too great to be ſoon cur'd, my
Longs having been pierc'd quite through; and you
could not hold a Candle to the Orifice, but the
wind that came from it would blow out the light.
The Cardinal, who hated the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> and
his Family, becauſe they were always againſt him,
ſuſpected as well as I that this came from him, and
declar'd himſelf openly in my favour; and told pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
that if he could get <hi>Breaute</hi> into his hands,
who now abſconded, he would teach him how to
quarrel in cold blood: Nor did he ſtop there, but
to vex the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> more than for any
kindneſs he had for me, he ſent me his own Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
and beſides that a Bag with about five hundred
Crowns: This was ſo unuſual a thing with him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Money, and above all to a man that was
neither one of his Family, nor indeed one of his
Party, that every body was ſurpris'd, and ſo was I
my ſelf, and indeed could hardly tell what to think
of it, till <hi>Deſplanches</hi> came to ſee me, and inform'd
me that the Cardinal had ſent for him, and told
him, that as ſoon as the Campaign was over he
would have him take ſome of his Friends with him
down to his houſe, and do all they could poſſible to
affront that Count; and that his Eminence under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
I ſhould quickly be cur'd, would have me be
of the Party; and that he would certainly ſpeak to
me of it, as ſoon as ever I was abroad again. In
ſhort, being gone to thank his Eminence after I was
well again for his goodneſs to me, he told me, he
ſhould be very glad to have me go upon that deſign,
and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>twas he told me how the Mareſchal <hi>de la
Ferte</hi> had juggl'd with me, when he pretended to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57806:97"/>
get a Regiment for me. I thought that this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
proceeded from ſome diſcontent the Cardinal
had with him; indeed they ſaid then that his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
had ſome ſuſpicion that he was not true to
him, and that tho the Mareſchal us'd to ſay of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he never had chang'd his Coat; 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were not ſo good as their words to him
in what they promis'd him, rather than want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
on his part.</p>
            <p>The Campaign being ended, <hi>Deſplanches</hi> took
four choice Lads of his own Company with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant,
whom he diſguis'd like <hi>Valets,</hi> that his deſign
might not be known; and we went all of us to his
houſe, where there came a Gentleman of <hi>Perigor,</hi>
that was a Captain in the ſame Regiment. By the
way he receiv'd a Letter from his Collonel, who was
the Count <hi>de Tonecharante,</hi> by which he deſir'd him
very civilly indeed, to give a diſcharge to a certain
Souldier of his Company: It unluckily happen'd, that
the Meſſenger came in while he was at Table, and the
heat of the Wine adding ſomething to his ugly humor,
which was bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h enough of it ſelf, he told the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the Count <hi>de Tonecharante</hi> buſied himſelf with
that he had nothing to do withal; that for his part
he would do nothing in it, and if the Collonel did
not like it he might take his courſe. Seeing
him diſturb'd, we ask'd him what was the matter,
tho he had ſpoke enough already to make us gueſs
what it was; but he ſhow'd us the Letter, which
was in the modeſteſt terms that was poſſible; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that not being able to ſee him ſo brutiſh, I
told him he was to blame to give ſuch an anſwer to
it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at I had not the honour to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
known to Count <hi>de Tonecharante,</hi> but he
muſt give me leave to tell him, 'twas not uſual to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57806:98"/>
deal ſo by ones Collonel, who was ſo generous to
requeſt a thing of him which he could have done
without him; that 'twas what the Captains could
not have done without the Collonel; and if the
Collonel choſe to go the contrary way, 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that they were unwilling to uſe their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in prejudice of the Captains; that this refuſal
would but put him upon giving the Souldier his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
without him, and that would not be all nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for he would eternally loſe his friendſhip,
which he ought to preſerve above all things; that
'twas the practice always at Court, as indeed it
ought to be every where, that the Captains did all
that in them lay to keep a good underſtanding with
the ſuperior Officers; that I ſpoke as his Friend, and
pray'd him to conſider theſe things a little; and tho
he had an Eſtate, and ſo did not value preferment,
yet he ſhould be careful to preſerve his Reputation;
that infallibly Monſieur <hi>de Tonecharante</hi> would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd,
and I beſought him but to think of that a
little.</p>
            <p>I know not how he did to have patience while I
ſaid all this; however, 'twas all one, he would have
it, that 'twas the Captains Office to give a diſmiſs to
a Souldier, and that the Collonel had nothing to do
with it: And growing very high becauſe I was not
of his Opinion, he had ſo little manners as to give
me the Lye in his own Houſe; for we were got to
<hi>Planches</hi> near <hi>D' Evreux,</hi> which was not above Six
or Seven Leagues from <hi>Rufflais,</hi> and belong'd to him.
He had no ſooner let ſlip the Word, but I catcht
up a Plate and threw it at his head, and the Wine
having put Courage into him, he clos'd in wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> me,
tho' three or four Perſons who were at the Table
with us got in between us; by good fortune for us
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57806:98"/>
both we had neither of us our Swords on, ſo our fight
being but with our Fiſts, 'twas not likely to be very
Bloody; however, we were ſo warm that 'twas
not without great difficulty that they parted us.
There was no great likelihood after this that we ſhould
proceed on our Journey, ſo I order'd my Men to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
my Horſe; the Gentlemen who were there did
all they could to accommodate matters: But he
ſtood off, and would do nothing; ſo I came away,
and being pretty late I could reach but to <hi>Paſſi</hi> that
Night, which was in the Road to <hi>Paris.</hi> Nothing
would ſerve him but he would follow me, that he
would; but his Friends, who ſaw I ſaid nothing but
what was true, prevented him, that he might ſettle
his brains. The next morning 'twas quite another
thing, and he told the Gentlemen that I left with
him, that he was extreamly concern'd for what had
happen'd, and that they ought to have kept me, and
that he would go and overtake me to ask my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
They were all very glad to hear him talk af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
this manner, and having ſaddl'd their Horſes,
they came all away with him a gallop. They came
up with me at <hi>Mantes</hi> where I baited, for I had no
occaſion to be in any haſte; when I ſaw them, and
that their Horſes were all in a foam, I wonder'd
what ſhould be the matter they were in ſuch haſte,
and preſently imagining it was to affront me. I
plac'd my ſelf at the top of the Stairs in a poſture to
receive them with a Piſtol in each hand: But <hi>Deſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
advancing before them, and offering me his
hand in token of friendſhip, he pray'd me to forget
all that was paſt, telling me, that I knew well
enough when a man's in drink he is not maſter of
his reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57806:99"/>
I could not find in my heart to be angry, hearing
him talk at this rate, for beſides that, I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
he had acted himſelf in that which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd;
I had a mind alſo to obey the Cardinal, by
whoſe order, as I have mention'd, I undertook
this Journey: So I went back again with him, after
we had embrac'd each other, and ſtaying two days
at <hi>Planches,</hi> we came at laſt to <hi>Rufflais,</hi> where we
underſtood that the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was at home
at his Caſtle. I courted <hi>Deſplanches</hi> to go abroad that
very day, but he pretended he was not well; ſo I
took my Fuſil, and with only my own Servants,
went out quite to the grounds belonging to the
Count <hi>de Harcourt;</hi> there was no game ſtirring, but
going on more with a deſign to be ſeen than to kill
any thing, I ſhot up in the air; one of the Count's
Servants came out immediately to ſee who 'twas,
he knew me aſſoon as ever he ſaw me, and run in
to carry the news to his Maſter: The Count under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
I had but two men with me, ſent out all
his men, but took care to ſtay behind himſelf:
When I ſaw I was like to engage nothing but a Mob
made up of Plowmen and Footmen, and that I
was in a fair way to be devour'd, I thought it was my
beſt way to retreat; they perſued me cloſe, but being
well mounted I got ground of them, till I came to a
lane that was juſt in the road: Theſe fellows per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
me ſtill, and made ſeveral ſhot at me at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
but I eſcap'd a greater danger preſently after,
for I was not gone fifty paces in the lane, when I
received a whole volley of ſhot from another ſide,
at which, thank God, I was more afraid than
hurt, and not without cauſe, for I had three ſhots in
my Hat, and two in my Cloaths; juſt at this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
I diſcover'd <hi>Deſplanches</hi> with his Souldiers, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57806:99"/>
not doubting but they were going to ſet upon me, I
had certainly kill'd him, if he had not cry'd out, and
told me, that he did not think he had ſhot at me,
but at the Count <hi>de Harcourt</hi>'s men: I was ſuch a
Coxcomb to be perſwaded into this; and having
told them, that ſince it was ſo, we had nothing to
do now but to fall upon them, they charg'd again,
and we turn'd upon them, and perſu'd them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
return'd to <hi>Rufflais,</hi> they all made a great ſtir
about the danger I had been in, and he askt my
pardon, with a great many words to convince me,
that all that had happen'd was by accident; but my
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> who it ſeems had at that time
more wit than I, told me, as he was undreſſing me,
that I ſhould not truſt my ſelf there, and that I was
with a man that made a practice of ſuch kind of
Villanies; for a Countryman thereabouts had told
him, that he had kill'd two or three ſo baſely from
behind a Hedge; and that ſince I had had a quarrel
with him, 'twould be my beſt courſe to get away
aſſoon as I could: This diſcourſe made me begin to
recollect, what a Blockhead I had been to beleive
all he had ſaid to me, and reſolv'd to leave a man
with whom there was ſo little ſafety; however I
wanted an excuſe to come away, and having ſent
one of my men to <hi>Brione,</hi> to ſee if there was any
Letters for me, I gave him one which I had wrote
my ſelf, wherein 'twas mentioned, that I was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
immediately at <hi>Paris,</hi> about ſome buſineſs of
conſequence; ſo I took my leave of this Traytor,
without taking notice of any thing; and it
pleaſing God, that I ſhould not continue long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
whether my ſuſpicion was well or ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it happen'd that a Souldier whom my <hi>Valet</hi>
had carry'd to drink with him, on purpoſe to pump
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57806:100"/>
him, told him, that I was much in the right of it to
go away, for I had ſcap'd a ſcowring; he could not
get a word more out of him, tho he preſt him to
ſpeak pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iner; but as this was enough to make me
judge of the perſon, I was no ſooner on Horſeback,
but I told him, I ſhould remember him as long as I
liv'd, and that at another time I would tell him
more; he ſtood mute at theſe words, and not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him time to juſtifie himſelf, I clapt Spurs to
my Horſe, and got ſo far from him, that if he had
ſaid any thing, 'twas impoſſible for me to hear
him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time all that I had told him came to
paſs. Monſieur <hi>de Tonecharante</hi> having been inform'd
of his rudeneſs, gave the diſmiſs to the Souldier
without him, and not content with giving him this
affront, he reſolv'd to have him caſheer'd, the firſt
minute he could get an opportunity: The thing was
difficult to be done at that time, it being not then
as 'tis now, that the Collonels were abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of their Regiments; for on the other hand, the
King was in want of Officers, and accordingly was
more chary of them, than it has been ſince: Indeed
they did not come in ſuch crouds for Commiſſions in
thoſe days, nor were not ſo prodigal either of their
Eſtates, or of their Lives; ſo that Monſieur <hi>de Tone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charante,</hi>
tho he had reſolv'd to do his utmoſt to
throw him out, found it impoſſible to bring it to
paſs, till the Peace of the <hi>Pyrennes;</hi> but now the
time being come, that there was not ſo much need
of Souldiers, and the King making a reform among
his Troops, he manag'd it ſo, that he got his name
into the Liſt of thoſe that were to be disbanded,
tho it was a little out of the order, for he was the
fifth or ſixth Captain of the Regiment, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57806:100"/>
us'd to begin at the youngeſt: <hi>Deſplanches</hi> could
not bear this affront without making his complaint,
which the Count <hi>de Toncherante</hi> had foreſeen, and
had been beforehand with him, having waited upon
the King, and given him a large account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
which was not only brutiſh, but ſomething
worſe, for he was grown to that height, that ſacred
things were not free from his violence when he was
in drink, and he would ſpeak either of God or the
the King, in the ſame terms, as he did the worſt of
his Enemies.</p>
            <p>For all this he had the Impudence to go to the
King, and having pleaded the merit of his ſervice,
how he had been ſeveral years in the Army, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept his Company full, and had never been
charg'd with any failure of his duty; that he had an
Eſtate of his own, and did not ſerve meerly for his
Pay, and a thouſand things to the ſame effect. The
King, after he had given him Audience with a great
deal of patience, anſwer'd him coldly, that he
knew all this as well as himſelf, and that ſince he
had been ſo faithful to him, he had done this to
give him leiſure to ſerve God, as regularly as he had
ſerv'd him; and tho he did not expect him to be a
Saint, yet he would not have him be impious; that
he had been inform'd from very good hands, that
he had piſt in the Holy Water Pot, in contempt of
that ſacred Element, and of all Religion; that he
did not know how it came to paſs he was not proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for it; and but that he underſtood at the ſame
time he was in drink, he ſhould perhaps have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
coming to him elſe. <hi>Deſplanches,</hi> who knew
in his heart, the King had tax'd him with nothing
but what was true, inſiſted no more upon it, but
went out with ſhame enough, and retir'd himſelf
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57806:101"/>
altogether to the Country, and never ſtirr'd out of it
but once, that he came to <hi>Paris</hi> to marry the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Monſieur <hi>de Brillac,</hi> Councellor of the great
Chamber; but this Lady neither, being not able to
cure him of his Debauchery, he kill'd himſelf with
drinking in about five or ſix years.</p>
            <p>I had reſolv'd at my laſt parting with him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſatisfaction from him for the Treachery he
had us'd towards me; but having given the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
an account of the whole matter, he prohibited
me ſo ſtrictly, that I durſt not think of it: In the
mean time he ſent me to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> upon a ſecret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
which I muſt not reveal, and in which I could
not ſucceed. The Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> was ſtill at
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, and it happen'd while I was
there, that Monſieur <hi>de Beauvais</hi> was kill'd; he
was Father to the Counteſs <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> and Maſter
of the Horſe to the Prince; he was a Man of
Courage, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad too good a conceit of himſelf,
which was the cauſe of his misfortune; for as he
was coming down from the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi>'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Lodging,
he met a Gentleman coming up, and takes him by the
arm at the top of the ſtairs with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch ſorce, that he
threw him down, and walkt over him himſelf.
The Gentleman would not ſo much as ask him the
meaning of it then, from the reſpect he ow'd to
the Place; but going out immediately, he gets
a Friend, and ſends him to <hi>Beauvais</hi> to demand
ſatisfaction of him for this affront. <hi>Beauvais</hi> was
not a man that us'd to refuſe any body, ſo having
brought a Friend with him to be his Second, they
fought it out two and two of a ſide; one of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
was quite kill'd upon the place, but he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the better for this ſhort liv'd advantage, for he
receiv'd a Piſtol Bullet in his head, of which he dy'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57806:101"/>
in a few days. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being inform'd
of this accident, went to ſee him before he dy'd;
and as he ſaw there was no hopes of his life, he told
him, that ſeeing the condition he was in, he ought
to leave all other thoughts but thoſe of his ſoul;
that he had kept a certain Lady a long time, by
whom he had had ſeveral Children, (one of which
was the preſent Counteſs <hi>de Soiſſons)</hi> but was never
marry'd to her; that he advis'd him to diſcharge
his conſcience, which he might do by making her
his Wife; that he knew not how to ſhow his
friendſhip more to him, than by adviſing him for
his good; and that if he would be rul'd by him, he
would go and ſend for a Prieſt immediately. <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vais</hi>
had loſt all his ſences, and had not ſpoke a
word in four and twenty hours; but the Prince's
voice, or rather the diſcourſe he made to him,
reviving him: <hi>No, my Lord,</hi> ſaid he, raiſing his
voice, <hi>I ſhall not be rul'd by you, I never promis'd
her any thing, nor I don't ſee, that I am oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any thing.</hi> The Prince reply'd, that he knew
that beſt himſelf indeed, and that what he
ſpoke was upon the common report that ſpread it
about ſo; to which the other having again anſwer'd
the ſame thing, he left him to dye in quiet.</p>
            <p>All this while the War continu'd with great fury,
not only on the Frontiers with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the heart of the Kingdom; and the weakneſs
of the Chief Miniſter encourag'd ſuch as were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

Authority, and the preſent form of Government in
the Kingdom: I don't pretend to reflect, in ſaying

               </gap>ty Tyrannies they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
in their own limits. Indeed they had in
every Province two or three of theſe little Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for ſuch they were in effect, for the Kings
orders were but laught at among them, if they
were not agreeable to their deſigns. This was
a great trouble to the Cardinal, but more to the
King, who had a thouſand times more courage,
and who was more nearly toucht in theſe practices
than others; but 'twas his time to wink at all this,
and as young as he was, he was extraordinary poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and choſe rather not to reform an abuſe, tho
he knew it to be ſo, than to let it appear that it was
too great for him to attempt, in ſuch an uncertain
condition as things then ſtood. In the mean time,
never was there ſuch a prank play'd as was done now,
by a certain Coxcomb that had married one of my
Relations, and in whoſe caſe I had like to have been
involv'd. This Man call'd himſelf the Marquiſs
<hi>de Pranſac,</hi> he was a huge hulky fellow of himſelf, but
his pride ſwell'd him beyond all dimenſions; if he
had any Nobility in his blood, 'twas only that he
was Grandſon to a Preſident of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> but
ſince I am fallen upon his Genealogy, I muſt give
you a ſhort hiſtory of his Great Grand-father. He
kept a Brandy-ſhop at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and made a figure
ſo mean, that no body reckon'd him to be worth
above two thouſand Franks. In ſhort, he not only
dwelt in a little naſty houſe, but bought and ſold
privately in other Peoples names. He had but one
only Son, who he had bred up well enough and
above what 'twas thought he could afford; for not
intending to make him a Brandy Merchant, he ſent
him to the Univerſity. This young fellow was a
meer <hi>Thomas Diaforus,</hi> that is juſt ſuch another Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57806:102"/>
as <hi>Moelier</hi> calls by that name in<note n="*" place="margin">Malade Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaje.</note> his Comedy,
or as we may ſay a very<note n="†" place="margin">Ben. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
               <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew
Cokes.</hi> However, he happens
to ſee one day at Church, one of
the Preſidents Daughters, and falls
deſperately in love with her, inſomuch, that but one
ſight of her brought him into the yellow Jaundice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
His Father, who as I ſaid, had no more Children,
and knew himſelf to be richer than anybody thought,
was almoſt diſtracted to ſee him in ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And after a deal of pother to know what ail'd
him, at laſt with much ado got the Secret out of
him. <hi>Pſhaw!</hi> ſays the old man, <hi>is that all? Ne're trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thy ſelf, I'll warrant you I'll get her for you;</hi> and
with that away he goes to her Father, and demands
her of him for his Son. The Preſident thought the
little old fellow was mad, and askt him who he was,
that he ſhould come with ſuch a compliment to him;
and gueſſing at the man by the figure he made,
which was very indifferent, he was going to bid his
Footmen kick him down Stairs. The little man,
not at all daunted at the ſcornful treatment of the
Preſident, and to come to the point, askt him how
much he could give his Daughter, for let it be as
much as it would, he would give his Son three
times as much in ready Money, beſides the refuſal
of ſuch a place as his was, which he had ſecur'd for
him when he ſhould be capable to manage it. The
Preſident hearing him talk at this rate, could not
tell what to make of it; and ſeeing nothing in him
that lookt as if he were craz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, began not only to
treat him civilly, but to ask him as civilly, if he was
able to make good what he talk'd of. The old man
told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was not very likely to be deceiv'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
his Money would not go, for 'twas all in <hi>ſpecie;</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:57806:103"/>
and taking him home with him, he ſhow'd him a
great Iron Cheſt, and in it above eight hundred
thouſand Franks all in Gold.</p>
            <p>The Match was ſoon made up after ſuch a ſight
as this, and from this Conjunction ſprung the Father
of our Coxcomb; I leave any one to judge whether
I have done him wrong in giving him ſuch a Title,
when they have heard his Story. Firſt, tho he
knew his own Original well enough, yet his Coach
would not pleaſe him unleſs it was adorn'd with a
great many Coats of Arms; ſo without any regard
to the Coat that his Grand-father had taken up, and
which ſerv'd his Father well enough, he picks out
ſuch Coats as he lik'd beſt, and orders the Herald to
quarter them with his own, and to divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſixteen quarters, the leaſt of which belong'd to
ſome Prince or other, and withal gives a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Livery, that made all the Town ſtare at him.
The City of <hi>Paris,</hi> like other great Cities, never
wants Sharpers, who live by their wits, at the price
of other peoples follies. One of theſe obſerving our
Gallant, and finding him ruuning ſtark mad after the
vanity of Grandeur, preſents him with a very formal
Genealogy, by which he made it out as clear as the
Sun, that he was deſcended in a direct male-line
from the Family <hi>De Dreux,</hi> a younger branch of the
Blood Royal; and that as ſuch, he had a right to bear
in his firſt and fourth quarter the arms of <hi>France,</hi> and
in the ſecond and third thoſe of <hi>Dreux:</hi> He was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd
with his diſcovery, and I happening to be
then at his Houſe, he askt me what I thought of it:
I found he was too well pleas'd with it for me to
contradict it, for I had no mind to diſoblige him:
So I having given my opinion in his own ſence, I
made him ſo compleat a Fool, as that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57806:103"/>
ſends for his Coach-maker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, beſpeaks a new
rich Coach, giving him the Arms that he would
have ſet upon it; he chang'd alſo his Plate, and
made the ſame Coat of Arms be engraven upon
that; and to omit nothing that might add to the
Luſtre of his Family, in ſome Writings he had
making, he caus'd himſelf to be ſtil'd, <hi>The moſt
Serene Prince L. ... de Dreux,</hi> adding however
the Surname of <hi>Rhedon,</hi> which was his true name,
but which he intended to drop in proceſs of time,
or to attribute it to ſome accidental imaginary entail,
as a great many other Families in <hi>France</hi> do; who, if
they were to tell the truth, would be very much at
a loſs to make out their Original.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the new Marquiſs <hi>de Pranſac</hi> chang'd
his Livery again, and took up the ſame with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle
<hi>de Montpenſier</hi>'s, the Lining only excepted,
one being green, and the other blue; and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Attendants with four Pages and ſome Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
he went beyond ſeveral Princes in his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page:
He took care in all his greatneſs not to forget
a Canopy of State, and wanting nothing but the
name of his Highneſs to make him a compleat
Prince, ſince he now began to beleive himſelf to be
really one; I was the firſt, that to carry on the jeſt,
beſtowed that title upon him; he took this ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
kindly of me, that I muſt eat always at his
own Table, and if I would beleive him, he could
not part with me. He that firſt ſet him up for a
Prince, was alſo very liberally rewarded, and being
reſolv'd to outdo me, made one addition more to his
title, and ſtil'd him his Royal Highneſs, telling him,
that ſince he was deſcended from ſo many Kings, he
did not ſee any reaſon, why he ſhould content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with the bare title of his Serenity. Our Marquis
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57806:104"/>
thought this very rational, and giving his aſſent by
nodding of his wiſe head, he ſhow'd how well pleas'd
he was with it; but being reſolv'd to manage this
humour, I began a little to contradict this, and his
Highneſs was to be Judge between us; I told him
then, that was the way to call the reſt of his Titles
in queſtion, to give him one that did not belong to
him; that none but the immediate Children of
Kings took this Title upon them, and that was but
lately neither, and that the very next remove was
that of Serenity, as in the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the
Prince <hi>de Conti</hi> his Brother, to mention no more:
This diſcourſe allay'd a little the vanity of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>de Pranſac.</hi> But the other Gentleman, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
himſelf further, told him, that the Title of
Royal Highneſs was well enough, for the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> had aſſum'd it; I reply'd, that he never
knew any body give it him but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Gazetteers;
and if it was due to the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> as ſhe
was a Daughter, and Siſter of a King of <hi>England,</hi>
it did not follow, that her Husband ſhould be ſtil'd
ſo upon that account; that the Princes of the Blood
Royal of <hi>England,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> never
loſt their quality, tho they did marry Husbands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to themſelves, and therefore 'twas a miſtake
of his, to give the Husband the Title, which was
due only to the Wiſe.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs of <hi>Pranſac</hi> was pleas'd to think me
in the right, and to be content with the character
that was his due, ſo he told us with a very grave,
tho a very fooliſh manner, that time would bring
every thing to paſs. All People were amaz'd to ſee
him ſet up ſuch an Eſchutcheon, and to appear in
ſuch an Equipage: But he having not an Eſtate to
anſwer ſuch a prodigious expence, it ſhrunk his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57806:104"/>
Revenue, ſo that to leſſen his charge he was fain to
retire into the Country, till his Exchequer ſhould
be in a condition again to ſupport his Pageantry.</p>
            <p>This piece of Fopery paſt well enough ſo long as
the War held, but when the Court, (the Peace being
ſettled) had leiſure to look into civil affairs, the King
gave order to the Procurator General of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to enquire, how the Marquis <hi>de Pranſac</hi> came to
be a Prince of the Blood: Whereupon the Procurator
General goes with his Officers to make him a viſit,
and finding how the caſe ſtood, he caus'd them to
break in pieces all the Coaches where the <hi>Flower de
Lis</hi> were quarter'd in the Eſcutcheons, and calling
for his Plate, they caus'd that alſo to be bruis'd,
and the Arms to be beaten out; beſides they gave
him a Summons, to anſwer to a Complaint which
was preſented to the Parliament upon this ſubject.
Never was man ſo perplext as his Highneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
upon this occaſion; he ſent for him that had
wheedled him up in this fancy, but he knew well
enough, 'twas no time for him to be ſeen; then he
ſent for me, and I went, for I had a mind to ſee
how he carry'd it under his mortification. Really
the man deſerv'd Pity rather than Envy; for he was
ſo great a Fool, that he would ſtill be call'd his
Highneſs; for having fail'd in ſhowing him that
reſpect, he told me with a great deal of gravity,
that I ſhould have a care of being too familiar
with him; that his Cauſe was not yet loſt, and
that before long he might be in a condition to
make me repent affronting a Prince of the Blood:
But he abated much of his Pride ſhortly after, when
the Procurator General, who proſecuted him vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
condemn'd him in a Fine of fifty thouſand
Crowns, and declar'd him and his Poſterity unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57806:105"/>
of the Priviledge of the Nobility; and ſeveral
other clauſes in the ſentence to degrade him of his
Honour. Beſides all this, the Lawyers advis'd him
to drop his pretenſions, and with much ado prevail'd
with him to do it; but that which was worſt of all,
he was forc'd to draw up the ſurrender of his claim
himſelf, no body caring to meddle in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
in which he ſet forth, that the man I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
and my ſelf, were the perſons who inſinuated
into him, that he was a Prince of the Blood; and
that he, meaning no harm, verily beleiv'd it had
been ſo; but that ſince it appear'd otherwiſe, the
ſame ſincerity oblig'd him to relinquiſh the thoughts
of it; that he begg'd his Majeſty's Pardon, and
hop'd, that having not intended any way to offend
him, he would be pleas'd to extend his Royal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to him, and not proſecute him with the utmoſt
rigour. I was ſummon'd to anſwer upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and my Friends thought I ſhould have
been ſecur'd; but being examin'd, I made it appear,
that I was far from prompting him to that folly, and
only made my ſelf ſport at it; that 'twas not my
fault, if he had not more wit to take a thing ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
which was ſpoken only to banter him; that I
knew his Original too well to beleive it my ſelf; but
that in ſhort, 'twas impoſſible to make a Fool a Wiſe
Man let one do what one could: My Examination
did him more ſervice than I had foreſeen, for there
being other circumſtances, that made him appear a
very weak perſon, the Parliament us'd him gently,
and he got clear with asking the Court's Pardon,
and paying a thouſand Crowns Fine.</p>
            <p>After this buſineſs he was oblig'd to change his
Name and his Arms; as for his Name, he reſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
his own, but for his Arms, 'twas four or five years
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57806:105"/>
before he could reſolve upon it; ſo he bare upon
his Coach nothing but his own Cypher with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet,
and nothing at all upon his Plate; at laſt he
gave for his Arms a <hi>Lyon Sable</hi> in a <hi>Field Or,</hi> but as
he could not forget the <hi>Flower de Lis,</hi> he put a great
many in the alliances which he quarter'd with his
own, which was as much as to tell the world, once
a Fool and always a Fool. After this, tho he was
threeſcore and ten years of age, he thought himſelf
young enough to fall in Love, and to begin his
Amours, he makes Love to Madam the Dutcheſs
<hi>de Saux,</hi> but in ſo very a reſpectful manner, that he
never ſpoke a word to her, but contented himſelf to
go to the <hi>Fauxbourg Saint Germaine,</hi> where he ſtays all
the while the Maſs was celebrating at the Convent
<hi>des Minims,</hi> only to have the honour to ſee her go by,
and returns the happieſt Man in the world, if ſhe
vouchſaf'd to take the Holy Water from his Hands,
and takes but ſo much notice of him, as to bow
when he gives it her. The Dutcheſs was a good
while before ſhe imagin'd any thing, but ſome body
having told her Husband, the Duke <hi>de Saux,</hi> he
was reſolv'd to obſerve the humour himſelf, which
having ſeen, he order'd his Lady to look a little
favourably upon him; which put the good man ſo
beſides himſelf, that if it continu'd a month or two
longer, he muſt certainly have been ſent to a Mad-houſe.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I would not break off this ſtory, I have
run on thro the tranſactions of ſeveral years, which
I muſt look back again to, for what relates to my
own affairs. I was pretty well with the Cardinal,
and tho I had not ſucceeded in my Voyage to
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he employ'd me again in a ſecret buſineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he had on foot on that ſide, which was to get off
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57806:106"/>
the Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> from the Intreſts of the Prince
<hi>de Conde,</hi> for whoſe ſake he had ſacrific'd his fortune;
for had he continu'd in his duty, he had not fail'd
being made a Mareſchal of <hi>France:</hi> Indeed there
was few men underſtood military affairs better, nor
that was fitter for any great enterprize; and yet for
all this, the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> quarrell'd with him, for
not having punctually obſerv'd ſome Orders he
gave: The Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> excus'd himſelf, and
ſhow'd him how the occaſion requir'd him to make
ſome little alterations. But the Prince, who was the
paſſionateſt man alive, turning haſtily from him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the fire, would not hear him ſpeak, but in a
fury, <hi>Ah</hi> Marcin, ſaid he, <hi>who would have thought, that
you would have us'd me as you do;</hi> repeating the ſame
words over and over five or ſix times with ſo much
heat, that he bit the Chimney-peice with his teeth
for madneſs. <hi>Marcin,</hi> ſeeing what a rage he was in,
thought it his beſt way to retire, for fear of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worſe. The Cardinal was, by his Spies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
inform'd of this miſunderſtanding, which
was the occaſion of his ſending me on this Errand.
The Riſque was great in this adventure, for it had
been as much as my life had been worth, if I had
been diſcover'd; but going for a Merchant of <hi>Leige,</hi>
I lodg'd in a private ſtreet, and feigning my ſelf ſick
aſſoon as I came into my Lodgings, I told my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
I had a Letter of great conſequence to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
to the Count <hi>de Marcin;</hi> I wrought ſo well
with my Hoſt, that he offer'd me freely to go and
carry it to him for me. I charg'd him to deliver it
to his own hands, which he carefully perform'd.
The Count <hi>de Marcin,</hi> who gueſſing at the thing,
carry'd on the diſguiſe, bad him take care of me, and
that if I wanted for any thing, he ſhould tell me, I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57806:106"/>
ſhould not ſcruple ſending to him; that he could
not come to ſee me till the next day, becauſe he was
juſt taking Horſe to ride out of Town, but that he
would be with me at Eight a Clock in the morning
without fail. My Landlord, coming back with
this good news, did not queſtion but I was at home,
but I had poſted my ſelf in Ambuſcade, about ten
or a dozen doors off to ſee, if inſtead of an anſwer,
he did not bring a Party of Souldiers with him to
apprehend me; and I ſtay'd out upon the ſcout, at
leaſt an hour after I ſaw him come back; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the coaſt was clear I return'd home; he askt me
whence I came, who he had left in no condition to
go out, and if I intended to increaſe my illneſs. I
told him, that I had a mind to be at the Maſs, tho
I was ſo weak, I was hardly able to get back again.
This diſcourſe being over, he told me what Monſieur
<hi>de Marcin</hi> had ſaid to him, which I was overjoy'd to
hear, hoping that ſince he had lent an ear to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of my meſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge, ſome good iſſue might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be made of it. I waited that night with great
impatience, and Monſieur <hi>de Marcin</hi> being come at
the hour appointed, he ask'd me what Propoſals I
had to make to him, and what Credentials I could
ſhow to ſatisfy him, if he ſhould treat with me. I
told him for that matter I had ſufficient; and not
to give him any reaſon to doubt it, I ſhow'd him
my Letters from the Cardinal. He told me this was
ſomething indeed, but it was not enough howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
that I ought to have had a Letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the King himſelf; that tho the Cardinal
did govern the Kingdom as Chief Miniſter, yet he
diſengag'd himſelf oftentimes from very ſtrict Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
and Treaties, on pretence that the King did
not approve of them; and that this was his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57806:107"/>
only to try people how they were affected, or
to make them ſuſpected to their own Party; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I might tell him, what advantages they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to him; that if they were ſuch as he ſhould
think worth while to conſider of, I might then
return and get a larger Commiſſion; and if not,
that then 'twould be needleſs to give me ſo much
trouble. He had ſome reaſon indeed in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
for what he ſaid of the Cardinal; for he had
ſeveral times in that manner, ſhifted his head out
of entangling Caſes, while the Civil Wars laſted:
As for example, in the Caſe between the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> and the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> where he render'd the
Prince ſuſpected by the <hi>Pariſians;</hi> who doubting
the Prince would not perform his Engagements, he
broke off ſeveral times with him, when the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> thought all things were concluded of:
However, being deſir'd to declare my ſelf, I told
Monſieur <hi>de Marcin,</hi> that if he would quit the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of the Prince, and break off his Treaties with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the King ſhould give him fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns in Money, a Government of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in the Heart of the Kingdom, with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of being made a Knight of the Order at the
firſt Promotion. I had ſeveral other offers to make
to him, but I was like our Shopkeepers, who never
ſhow the beſt of their Commodities till the laſt. I
conceal'd what I had more to ſay, till I had heard
him ſpeak, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at I might know what his intention
was. He told me the Cardinal banter'd him ſure,
to make him ſuch offers as theſe at this time of day,
for he had offer'd him more than all this long ago;
that either he muſt beleive him to be extreamly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
at the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> or that he was reduc'd
to great neceſſity, to fancy he was to be tempted
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57806:107"/>
with ſuch a little matter as this was; that he did not
offer him half the value of the loſs he had receiv'd
in his own Eſtate in <hi>France;</hi> that this was far from
making amends for the ill treatment he had met
withal; that if he had quitted <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in a time
when his preſence was moſt neceſſary there, the
Cardinal ought only to blame himſelf for it; for
that after having put him in Priſon, at the ſame
time when the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi>
and the Duke <hi>de Longeville</hi> had been apprehended,
tho he had never been concern'd in any thing, that
might give the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpicion; he ought to
have kept his Orders more ſecret, which he had
given to treat him in a different manner from them,
after the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> was gone out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that there was nothing which a man would
not venture upon to gain his Liberty, and that he
remembred every day what the loſs of his had coſt
him; that he was fain to purchaſe his Eſcape, at
the price of throwing himſelf out at Window,
from the top of a Houſe, which broke one of his
Legs, and that to avoid the like treatment, there was
nothing ſo ſacred in the world, that he would not
violate; that the Cardinal ſhould not then accuſe
him, as he did every day, of the blackeſt crimes
that ever were committed; that if there was any
one could be tax'd with ſuch crimes, 'twas he who
had caus'd him to be apprehended, once already,
without cauſe, and would have done it a ſecond
time, if he had not taken care to prevent him;
that bare ſuſpicion ought not to be ſufficient ground,
to uſe extremities with men of Honeſty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
but they ſhould have plain Matter of Fact to
charge and prove upon them. He made a long Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this ſort, full of complaints, too many to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57806:108"/>
incerted here; and I would not interrupt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I knew, that when a man has diſcharg'd his
paſſion, he is the more tractable to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
In the mean time, finding that he began
to be cool, I told him, that I did not pretend to
juſtify the Cardinal, but that I would tell him this, tho
by the by, that a man who is in ſuch a Poſt as his
Eminence, is often at a loſs, and that too much
confidence would have ruin'd him; and that 'tis the
conſtant Maxim of Politicians, to ſecure always the
perſons of them whom they ſuſpect, and then to
examine whether they were guilty or no; and that
if he had been in his place, he would have done no
leſs himſelf: That his falling in ſo violently with
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> was what the Cardinal could
not be pleas'd with, who ſaw that Prince, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
laid for his ruin, ſuffer'd himſelf to be carry'd
to all manner of extremities; that 'twas too late to
recall thoſe things now, therefore 'twas better to
drown the remembrance of them in a hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
which he might make very much to
his advantage; that ſince the Offers I had made
him were not ſatisfactory, I begg'd him to tell me
what it was he expected, and that I would uſe my
endeavours with the Cardinal, that he ſhould have
full content. He told me that he would think of
it, and that this Converſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion having already been
too long, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being naturally jealous,
to take away from them all cauſe of ſuſpicion, he
would not come to me any more there, but pray'd
me to go to <hi>Liege,</hi> and to come to him to his Caſtle
<hi>de Modave,</hi> where he would be in eight days time:
but he could not tell what I would do to paſs thro
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Towns upon the Road, which I could not
avoid; that he would have given me a Paſs-port
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57806:108"/>
himſelf, if the Prince <hi>de Conde</hi> had been abſent; but
as it belong'd to him, he durſt not encroach upon
his authority, and that it might do me more harm
than good if it ſhould be diſcover'd; that 'twould
be better for me to apply my ſelf to the Governour's
Secretary, as if I was of <hi>Liege;</hi> that thoſe ſort of
People would do any thing for money, without
much troubling themſelves to examine into it. I
thankt him for his Counſel, but I had no occaſion
to make uſe of it; for that I was provided with all
thoſe things before I came to <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and inſtead
of coming by the great <hi>Paris</hi> Road, I came down
the <hi>Meuſe</hi> in a Luggage Boat, which had a Paſs-port
for <hi>Liege.</hi> The Mareſchal <hi>de Fubert</hi> who was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Sedan,</hi> having notice from the Cardinal,
that I went from him about affairs of Conſequence,
had inſtructed the Maſter of the Boat, and that I
might paſs ſafely at <hi>Charlemont</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> I diſguis'd
my ſelf and went for one of his Boys; at <hi>Liege</hi> I
was directed to a man the Cardinal employ'd there
for a Spy, and he got me a Paſs-port under the name
of a Burgher of that Town, ſo that having nothing
to fear I went not from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> till the day before I
was to be at <hi>Modave:</hi> I lay that Night at <hi>Lovain,</hi>
and leaving <hi>Loo</hi> on the left hand, I went on and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into the Country of <hi>Liege</hi> about a League fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I ſtay'd ſix days in the chief Town thereabout
for News of Monſieur <hi>de Marcin,</hi> for the Country
People, who came every day into the Town, would
preſently have brought the News if he was come
home; at laſt underſtanding that ſome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that he ſent before him were come, I went
away and met him there the very day he arriv'd:
I was diſguis'd like a Maſon, as was agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
between him and I, for ſuch people were not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57806:109"/>
ſuſpected coming to him, becauſe he was a great
lover of Building, ſo that there was no notice taken,
tho we were lock'd up together for a great while:
he knew me as ſoon as he ſaw me, and asking me if
I had brought him the Draught that I had promis'd
him, I anſwer'd him yes, and taking a Paper out of my
Pocket I made as if I would give it him, but he bid
me keep it; and when he had view'd a thing, which
he was treating with ſome Workmen about, we
ſhould then go into his Cloſet and diſcourſe of it.</p>
            <p>To avoid all ſuſpicion, when he ſaw me at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that I could not hear him, he ſaid to them
near him, that he did not believe I could do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
that I came on purpoſe from <hi>Cologne;</hi> but that
he had been told by ſome people that I was not ſuch
an Artiſt as I pretended. He told me all this a few
Minutes after, and how well it had taken; that ſome
of the Workmen had envy'd me, becauſe they
thought I came to take the work out of their hands;
at laſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ving taken ſeveral turns, and done ſome little
buſineſs about the Houſe he took me into his Cloſet
with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I askt him for an Anſwer, to what
I concluded my laſt diſcourſe with: He told me, that
was eaſie to do, and ſo going on with it, explain'd
himſelf upon the matter: That they ſhould make
him Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> Governour of a Province,
Knight of the Order at the firſt promotion, General of
the Army either in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and ſhould pay
him two hundred thouſand Crowns in Money.
Theſe demands being ſo extravagant, I was amaz'd;
however, as my Inſtructions reach'd further than I
had yet diſcover'd to him; I told him, I had wrote
to the Cardinal about it, ſince I had the honour to
ſee him, and had receiv'd this anſwer: That inſtead
of the Government of a Province, he ſhould be made
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57806:109"/>
a Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> which he did not queſtion
would pleaſe him better; and that he ſhould receive
one hundred thouſand Crowns in ready Money, and
withal that he ſhould be aſſur'd of the dignity of the
Order, whenever there was a vacancy: he was in a
rage at this, and asking me if the Cardinal made no
difference between him, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Fouca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi>
to whom beſides that dignity, they had given fifty
thouſand <hi>Lovis Dor's.</hi> I told him yes, I believ'd they
did, but that he was not maſter of a ſtrong place as
'tother was, when he took the opportunity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a bargain for himſelf; and that when the
Cardinal granted him thoſe Conditions, 'twas becauſe
he ſaw plainly 'twould coſt much more to recover
ſuch a place out of his hands; that regard muſt be
had to the Circumſtances, and all things were to be
conſider'd; that he was but a private Captain among
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and could not do them much more
hurt than the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> would do without him,
who was left ſtill behind.</p>
            <p>I ſaid a great many ſuch things to perſwade him,
but he would not abate a jot of his demands; upon
which I deſir'd him to give it me in writing, that I
might ſhow it to the Cardinal, to whom I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to return. I meant honeſtly; nor did I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any thing but to juſtify my ſelf to his Eminence,
that I had done my beſt; who knowing ſo well
what had happen'd between Monſieur <hi>de Marcin</hi> and
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> made no doubt but I ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in my deſign; and therefore order'd me not to
come up to the offer of a hundred thouſand Crowns,
but with a great deal of difficulty; ſo that I doubted
he might blame me for miſmanagement, and I was
willing to have ſomething to clear my ſelf: But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Marcin,</hi> taking it quite otherwiſe, roſe up in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57806:110"/>
a rage, and told me, he could find in his heart to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
me that moment to his juſt reſentment: For
what did I ſee in his face to propoſe ſuch a thing to
him; and if this was the Cardinals method, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
a man in Negotiotions on purpoſe to diſcover
it to his own Party, he ſhould have a care of him;
that if he ſhould have been ſuch a Fool to give it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand, he made no queſtion but they
would take care to have it publiſh'd both in <hi>Spain</hi> and
at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and at all the Confederate Towns in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
that he perceiv'd I was only ſent to ruin the
confidence that had been put in him by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
that however, he would be ſo generous as to let me
go, provided I went about my buſineſs immediately,
for he had nothing more to ſay to me. I was quite
confounded with the Paſſion he was in at me; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
commanding my ſelf, I let him go on without
any interruption, and finding that his fury was over,
I told him, that if the Cardinal had any ſuch deſign,
'twas more than I knew; but for my ſelf I could
give him an account of mine, and I would ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
tell him the reaſon why I made ſuch a propoſal
to him. That I had to do with a Perſon that was
very difficult, and that expected every thing ſhould
come to paſs to his own fancy; that I had ſeen him
ſo prepoſſeſt with an opinion, that my negotiations
could not fail, that I was very careful to ſatisfy him
at my return, that I had done my beſt; that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
to him, that I was to blame to make
him ſuch a Propoſal, having not the honour to be
known to him, and the deſire I had to ſee him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>France,</hi> where his merit would meet with
another ſort of recompence than what he found from
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> made me willing to give him an unuſual
ſatisfaction, which I would do by ſhowing him my
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57806:110"/>
Inſtructions which I had kept by me, tho I run the
greateſt danger in the World, if it ſhould be found
out.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe cool'd him a little, but not at all
prevail'd with him to leſſen his demands; ſo ſeeing
there was no good to be done with him, I took my
leave, and came back to <hi>France,</hi> by the ſame way
that I went; and being arriv'd at <hi>Charleville,</hi> I was
forc'd to ſtay for a Convoy to go as far as <hi>Rhetel,</hi>
for the Prince <hi>De Conde</hi> who held <hi>Rocroy,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
who was Governour of it, made ſuch excurſions
as hindred the Communications between thoſe
Towns. The Duke <hi>De Normouſteir</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Charleville,</hi> and to whom I was particularly
known, askt me were I had been; but having no
order to communicate to him any of my Buſineſs,
I told him, I came from the <hi>Spaw,</hi> where I had
been ordered by the Phiſicians to go to drink the
Waters: He took this for an Anſwer, and having
ſent out his Cavalry into the Country of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
for a Military execution, the People having
refuſed to pay their Contributions, I was oblig'd to
attend till their return; and there being a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other people, who waited as well as I, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us a Convoy of the firſt that arriv'd, but we
were but little the ſafer for them, for they were but
thirty Troopers, and thoſe ſo fatigu'd with the
duty they had been upon, that both Horſe and
Man were ready to fall every ſtep they took: If
the reſt of the Company would have been rul'd by
me, we would not have ſtaid for them at all, for
we were enough of us to have ventur'd; but the
majority was againſt me, and over-rul'd me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I would or no: which we had all of us cauſe
enough to repent of. In ſhort, <hi>Montal,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57806:111"/>
of <hi>Rocroy</hi> for the Prince <hi>de Conde,</hi> knowing
well enough that there was a great many people
waited for the return of the Convoy, ſet one to
give him an account what time they came back,
and beſet the ways with ſeveral parties; ſo 'twould
have been a miracle if we had eſcap'd them. When
we were come within a mile and half of <hi>Pierre-Pont,</hi>
the Enemy, who were hid in a Wood, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
us; and having divided themſelves into
two Bodies, one attackt us in the Front, and the
other in the Flank; our Guard made but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
and would have run away if they could,
but their Horſes, as I ſaid, being harraſs'd, they were
taken immediately; for us, we made a body by our
ſelves, and made a ſhow to defend our ſelves, and
at the firſt charge we kill'd two of their Officers;
but being overpowr'd by numbers, we were forc'd
to ſeek our ſafety from the ſwiftneſs of our Horſes;
and ſo made away to get back to <hi>Charleville.</hi> In
the mean time, having obſerv'd, that the Dragoons
had gotten before us, and had poſted themſelves in
a Defile, by which we muſt of neceſſity paſs, I got
into a Wood, and tho I was perſu'd by three Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
yet I loſt them, and coming out on the other
ſide I ſaw no body appear, which made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
I was out of danger; and I travell'd two
Leagues without any oppoſition, and was juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
to my ſelf that I had eſcap'd, when four
Horſemen very well mounted diſcover'd me; and
one of them coming up to me with the uſual queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Qui vive,</hi> or who are you for? I had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
anſwer'd, <hi>Vive France,</hi> but he bid me ſurrender
my ſelf, or I was a dead man: In the mean time,
the other, who were coming towards me, and were
not above ten paces off, rendring it impoſſible for me
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57806:111"/>
to eſcape them, I was oblig'd to give place to my
ill fortune, and to yield my ſelf their Priſoner; ſo I
was carry'd into a Neighbouring Wood where the
reſt of the Troop lay in Ambuſcade; and he that
commanded them, having ask'd who I was, and
whence I came: I told him that I was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
and that I came from <hi>Charleville.</hi> It happen'd that
this was a Gentleman that liv'd but two Leagues
from my Fathers, ſo making my ſelf known to him,
he would not ſuffer me to be ſearcht, or any way
roughly dealt with, but us'd me very civilly.</p>
            <p>I ſtaid there with him till Evening that they broke
up their Ambuſcade, which I thought very ſtrange,
knowing 'twas not cuſtomary to do ſo till Sun riſe:
But he told me 'twould ſignify nothing to ſtay there
any longer, for they only waited for any Perſons
they could find that had got away from the others;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut ſince they had met with no body but me, 'twas
very probable the reſt were all taken; and indeed ſo
it prov'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I found them all got to <hi>Rocroy</hi> before me,
which was ſome Comfort to me in my Affliction;
yet ſtill I muſt ſay, that I was better treated than
any of them, for there was not one of them but
had loſt his Money, whereas I kept mine, of which,
to my great comfort, I was very well provided. In
the mean time I was in great perplexity, whether I
ſhould ſend to the Cardinal or no; for on one hand
I conſider'd if I did ſo, he might perhaps get me out,
but then on the other hand my applying my ſelf to
the firſt Miniſter of State, might give them cauſe to
ſuſpect, I was not the Perſon I pretended to be; for
I had told Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi> that I was a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Foot in the Regiment of <hi>Grancy;</hi> of which
Regiment I was throughly acquainted with all the
Officers; Inſomuch that when he queſtion'd me, I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57806:112"/>
gave him an exact account of the State of the whole
Regiment: At laſt, having well conſider'd what I
had to do, I thought 'twas beſt to let it alone, and
to diſcover my ſelf to the firſt perſon that ſhould get
his liberty upon <hi>Parol,</hi> or till the general exchange of
Priſoners, which was expected would not be long;
I had alſo another reſerve, which was ſince I had
Money, to offer my ranſom, but Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi>
would not accept of it, ſo I found my ſelf fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of that deſign. Tho we were not far from the
Capital City of the Kingdom, where every one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
has ſome acquaintance, yet 'twas not to be
imagin'd, how few there was that receiv'd any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from their friends; I could not however ſee
ſo many worthy Gentlemen ſuffer, without ſharing
with them ſomething of what I had left, which
unſeaſonable bounty ſoon ſhew'd me the bottom of
my Purſe; but ſtill I comforted my ſelf, that I had
half a years Arrears due to me at <hi>Lyons;</hi> but when
the time was come, the queſtion how I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſe
a Receipt on the back of the Order was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perplexity, and I muſt ſign my own name,
which I had conceal'd from Monſieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> and
call'd my ſelf by the name of one of the Lieutenants
of <hi>Grancy;</hi> ſo becauſe I would not expoſe my ſelf to
appear a Lier, I choſe to continue in that miſery,
which I had begun to be ſenſible of ſince my Money
had fail'd me. In the mean time, many of thoſe to
whom I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent my Money, having received recruits
from their friends, conceal'd it from me, for fear they
ſhould be askt to repay me, and I that aſſiſted every
body, was deſerted in ſuch a manner, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was miſerable beyond expreſſion. I was
oblig'd to live above three months upon the Basket;
and to compleat my misfortune, my Linnen was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57806:112"/>
ſtolen from me, and I had but one Shirt and one
Crevat left me in the whole world, ſo that I was
fain to lie a bed all day to have it waſht; for my
part, when I call to mind how 'twas with me at
that time, I cannot imagin how I was able to bear
it; and above all to find thoſe whom I had aſſiſted
in their diſtreſs, ſhun me as if I had the Plague, tho
they knew in their own Conſciences, that I had
never been reduc'd to this condition, but for my
compaſſion to them. All this while there was no
appearance of the General Exchange, which we had
ſo long lookt for, altho the Campagne was ready to
begin; that was all the news that I enquir'd after,
for I was, juſt as it were, ſinking under my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
my Cloaths, and eſpecially my Shirt, hung all
in rags; and for Beer or Wine I had almoſt forgot
the taſte of them. In ſhort, I, who had compaſſion
of every body, found all the world cold and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to me, they would wiſh me better fortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but no body would do any thing to procure
it.</p>
            <p>'Tis eaſy to judge, that my mind was perplext un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all this affliction almoſt to diſtraction, and was a
thouſand times juſt upon the point of diſcovering
my ſelf to Monſieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> chooſing rather to
dye at once, than to linger out my life by little and
little; however reſolving with my ſelf to have a
little more patience, at laſt the Exchange ſo long
wiſht for arriv'd, but 'twas no help to me, for the
Mareſchal <hi>de Grancy</hi> having given in the names of the
Officers of his Regiment who were Priſoners, left
my name out, as he very well might, for that he
whoſe true name it was, remain'd with the body;
ſo I had the unhappineſs to ſee all my fellow Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
go free, and my ſelf left behind. I remain'd ſo
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57806:113"/>
overwhelm'd with trouble, that Nature it ſelf ſunk
under it, and I fell into a Fever which held me
two months at leaſt, and being carry'd to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
all my hopes depended upon an Officer of
<hi>Picardy,</hi> whom I thought to be an honeſt man, and
to whom I had diſcover'd my ſelf; I had deſir'd
two things of him before he went away, one was
that he would convey a Letter for me which I had
writ to the Cardinal, in which I had given him an
account of the ſad accident that had befallen me;
the other was to ſend me the half years revenue
that was due to me of my rent at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d
him to receive, and to that end gave him a
Blank Receipt ſigned with my hand, for the Pay-maſter
to fill up as uſual in that caſe; but inſtead of
doing me this kindneſs, he not only run away with
my Money, but was ſo barbarous as to keep my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which I had written to the Cardinal. I waited
with impatience for an anſwer from him, and from
his Eminence, but I heard from both of them alike;
yet I was ſuch a credulous Coxcomb as to flatter
my ſelf for three months, that there was ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
thing had fallen out to hinder him; at laſt,
ſeeing I was forſaken both of Heaven and Earth, if I
may dare to ſpeak ſo, my deſpair was ſo great, that
I was ready to lay violent hands upon my ſelf; in
the mean time I relaps'd into my diſtemper, and
was come to that extremity, that they began to tell
me I ought to think of ſettling my Conſcience; I
askt then for a Confeſſor, and having, as it happened,
fallen into the hands of an honeſt man, I made him
my Confident in ſome part of my ſorrows; I told
him of the falſe name I had taken up, and how it
depriv'd me of that relief which otherwiſe I might
have had. I durſt not tell him any more, leſt out of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57806:113"/>
a falſe zeal he ſhould reveal my Confeſſion. The
good man, after he had given me what Conſolation
he could, offer'd himſelf very freely, to go for me
to <hi>Paris;</hi> and having gladly accepted his pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er, I
gave him a Blank ſign'd, as I had done the Officer
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> that he might receive whatever there was
due to me from <hi>Lyons;</hi> I did not tell him how much,

and indeed he found that he had receiv'd five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns, which he was gone away with, but
there being by this time another half year due, he
brought me likewiſe the like ſum of five hundred
Crowns, excepting a ſmall matter for the Charges
of his Journey. If I durſt have truſted him, as I
ſaid, with my affair to the Cardinal, he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> both by Birth and Inclination; but
Providence having order'd things otherwiſe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
with my ſelf, being reliev'd from that horrible
neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was in, to have a little longer patience,
and the rather, becauſe they began now to talk of
the General Peace, which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had
always rejected it, ſeem'd now more inclinable to,
ſince the ill ſucceſs they had in the laſt Campagnes;
but it all depended upon this Summers Expediti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n,
and if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould happen to beat us, all our
hopes would be loſt again. The Kings Army was
commanded by the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had
with him join'd in Commiſſion the Mareſchal <hi>de la
Ferte,</hi> but the latter ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing himſelf to be beaten by
an overſight before <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>de
Turenne</hi> manag'd it ſo, that he had no longer a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
and affairs were never the worſe for it;
for before, the Jealouſy which aroſe between theſe
two, ruin'd the beſt of their deſigns, but now thoſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57806:114"/>
diſorders being prevented, we got the better of the
Enemy on all ſides; but as we could not be ſatisfy'd
with any Conqueſts, till we had added that of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
which nevertheleſs was to be deliver'd up to
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by virtue of a Treaty with them, the
Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> marcht thither with his Army.
Monſieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> who apprehended nothing ſo
much as a Peace, ſaid openly, that it all depended
upon the ſucceſs of this Enterprize; and I, aſſoon
as I heard how it was, pray'd heartily it might come
to paſs, as I had reaſon to do, for I ſaw plainly
enough, that this was the only hope I had left for
the recovery of my liberty; but the place being of
the greateſt conſequence to both Parties, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
were not leſs vigilant in the defence of it, than
we were vigorous in our attacks; and they who
had always before ſhun'd giving Battle with a great
deal of caution, now drew all their Forces together
into the Field, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having join'd
them with his Forces, advanc'd together within
Cannon-ſhot of our Trenches. The Viſcount <hi>de
Turenne,</hi> who did not expect to take ſuch a place as
this without blows, had diſpos'd all things for their
reception, like a great Souldier; and the Enemy
knowing who they had to deal with, reſolv'd to
make a diſcovery of his Lines, before they advanced
any further. Don <hi>Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who commanded
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would truſt no body for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but advanc'd himſelf with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
to take the view; and the Mareſchal <hi>de Hoquincourt</hi>
who was with them, having with more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
than wit, adventur'd too far before the reſt,
was kill'd with a Muſquet-ſhot; this made the reſt
retire, but did not put by their deſign of attacking
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57806:114"/>
us in our Trenches. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> having
notice of this by his Scouts, was reſolv'd to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
with them, and coming boldly out of his
Trenches drew up in a poſture to receive them;
he did not ſtand to encourage them by amuſing
them with a long Speech, but riding thro the Ranks
to ſee that all things were in order, he ſhow'd a
countenance ſo full of aſſurance, that put ſuch an
opinion into the minds of his Souldiers, as was a
good Omen of a certain Victory.</p>
            <p>If I had been in this Engagement my ſelf 'twould
have pleas'd me to have given you the particulars,
the account being ſo much to our advantage, but I
know too well the errors they are ſubject to, who
write of ſuch things from the mouths of others, and
ſhall therefore, to avoid the ſame miſtakes, content
my ſelf with telling you in general, that the Viſcount
<hi>de Turenne</hi> having broken the whole body of the
Enemies Army, ſat down immediately before <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
which he oblig'd in a few days to capitulate;
and from thence he march'd his Army along the
Sea Coaſt, and took in all the ſmall Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
for having gain'd ſo great a Battle, and
taken ſo ſtrong a Town in ſo ſhort a time, they
thought there was no reſiſting him; and he would
have over-run all <hi>Flanders,</hi> if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not
taken their meaſures very ſpeedily to obtain a Peace.
I was too much concern'd in the iſſue of theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
not to be very inquiſitive about them, my
Liberty depending upon them; and therefore I was
always teazing my friend the Eccleſiaſtick to ſend
me word how things went: Firſt, he ſent me word
of the Battle, and how the ſucceſs of that put the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> upon uſing their utmoſt endeavours for a
Peace; this overjoy'd me, but I waited in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57806:115"/>
eighteen months longer before 'twas brought to
perfection. I can't imagine what the Cardinal
thought of me all that while, for 'twas three years
before he had any news of me. Without queſtion he
tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> I was dead, or elſe I ſhould have let him

               </gap>'d writing to him from
one day to another till at laſt 'twas ſo long, I thought
'twas to no purpoſe to write at all; I was blam'd
for it by many, but I think with very little reaſon,
conſidering my circumſtances.</p>
            <p>At laſt the happy hour arriv'd, the General Peace
was made, and I was deliver'd: aſſoon as ever I
got out I went to wait on the Cardinal, whom I
found at <hi>Vincennes;</hi> he took me for an Apparition at
firſt, but recovering his ſurprize, he askt me whence
I came, and how I had the Impudence to ſee his
face, after I had ſerv'd him ſo. I told him, I
thought I had reaſon enough, conſidering what had
befallen me, and I would make himſelf my Judge,
if he would pleaſe to give me a hearing; I told him
then the reaſons that prevented my writing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
the particulars I have juſt now related; he
made light of it, and ſhrinking up his ſhoulders,
as if he thought me craz'd, he told me for anſwer,
he was ſorry for me, but if I talkt at that rate, God
help me, he thought the beſt he could do
for me, was to ſend me to the<note n="*" place="margin">Bedlam.</note>

and ſo ſcandaliz'd at it I was, that I went out all in
a rage, and meeting with <hi>la Cordonniere,</hi> who is now
Lieutenant General, but then belong'd to him, I
told him, that his Maſter was ſo haughty with his
good fortune, that 'twas intollerable; that 'twas all
one to him who he affronted, and a Gentleman
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57806:115"/>
ſhould have no better uſage from him than a Slave,
but I hop't the time would come, that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my ſelf of him for the language he had given
me. I thought I had ſpoken this to one of my
friends, when I ſaid it to <hi>la Cordonniere,</hi> who I had
oblig'd, and lent him Money ſeveral times, when he
was but a mean fellow, and wanted it enough; but
forgetting all thoſe obligations, I had no ſooner
opened my mind to him with all this freedom, but
he began to take his Maſters part, and one word
bringing in another, we both drew, and were both
of us wounded, and if we had not been parted by the
Marquis <hi>de Rennel,</hi> we had not left off without ſome
miſchief or other; and it being impoſſible for us to
proſecute the heat after this diſcovery, we went off
each of us as our occaſions directed: Mine was to
hide my ſelf, the Cardinal having publickly ſworn,
if ever I fell into his hands, I ſhould come ſhorter
by the head. I made my retreat into a Convent, the
Prior whereof was my true friend; while <hi>la Cardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi>
was viſited by a crowd of the Grandees, who
to make their Court to the Cardinal, could ſubmit
to any mean Reſcal that had but his favour. This
affair of mine making a great noiſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
where I was began to be afraid of me, which
the Prior perceiving, was fain to give out, that I
was deſirous of taking the Habit, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was to paſs the Probation; ſo he directed me to
go every night to the <hi>Office,</hi> and to make great ſhew
of my Devotion, for being to ſave the life of a
friend, he made no ſcruple to make uſe of any ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to effect it. 'Tis not for me to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he did well or ill in it; I am ſure the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
mine, for without his aſſiſtance I had run a
great riſque of a Scaffold; for the Cardinal, who
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57806:116"/>
was a true <hi>Italian,</hi> revengeful as the Devil, when
he could not come at my body ſeiz'd my rent,
and had reduc'd me to a very miſerable condition, if
my friend the Prior had not ſtuck cloſe to me; but
he differ'd in that, eſpecially from his Brethren of
the Order, who ſtudy nothing but their own intereſt,
for the more miſerable he ſaw me, the more he
ſtrove to comfort me; for my part I knew not what
to think of my ſelf, but in my opinion it was my
evil deſtiny rather than any fault of mine: I made a
ſtrict examination of my ſelf, as if I had been to
make my own Proceſs, but whether ſelf love was
predominant in me, or that indeed I was rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
than guilty, I could find no ſatisfactory reaſon
to condemn my ſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſtay'd in this Convent till the Death of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
which tho it happen'd quickly after, yet 'twas
not ſooner than I deſir'd, for as godly as I was grown,
I could not heartily wiſh well to a man that had done
me ſo much injury, and who, after he had been the
cauſe of my lying three years in Priſon, oblig'd me
now to another Confinement, in a place not one jot
more agreeable to me than the place I came out
of; if I had been any thing ſeriouſly diſpos'd, I
had certainly become a Religious, and I oftentimes
ſecretly wiſht, Heaven would have given me the
Grace to attempt it; but being not cut out for that
Vocation, I was fain to have Patience with all my
Fury. The Count <hi>de Charoft</hi> whom I have formerly
mentioned, and who was pleas'd ſtill to retain a
kindneſs for me, ſpoke to the King in my favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I druſt appear, and having given him an account
of my adventure, of which his Majeſty was wholly
ignorant, he was pleas'd with a great deal of goodneſs
to give me his Pardon, provided the Scuffle I had
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57806:116"/>
had with <hi>la Cardonniere</hi> could not be prov'd to be a
Duel; for he had ſolemnly ſwore at his Coronation
upon the holy Evangeliſts, that he would never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
any one that was guilty of that crime, an Oath
which we ſee he hath never yet diſpens'd with; and
if we may judge by what happen'd ſoon after I eſcap'd,
we may conclude he never will; I mean the affair of
Meſſieurs <hi>de la Frette,</hi> and of Monſieur <hi>de Chalais,</hi> in
which I was very happy that I was not engag'd, as
you will ſee by the following ſtory.</p>
            <p>You muſt underſtand, that about a fortnight or
three weeks before, I happen'd to be playing at
Tennis with a Gentleman of <hi>Poictou,</hi> call'd <hi>la Verie</hi>
an Officer of the Guard; we play'd at the Tennis
Court in <hi>la Rue de Vangirard,</hi> near <hi>Luxembourg;</hi> there
was a great many better Tennis Courts in <hi>Paris</hi> than
that, but we went thither, becauſe our Lodgings
being both near it, we had the convenience of going
in our Morning Gowns; we plaid ſeveral Games,
and when we were juſt a going to give over, the
Chevalier <hi>de la Frette</hi> came in, and ſtanding by the
Ball Basket, as if he had a mind to quarrel, began to
toſs the Balls into the lower Hazard of the Tennis
Court. <hi>La Verie</hi> loſt the Game, and being a little
out of humour upon it, becauſe at that time we did
not play by the Set, but paid for the Balls we ſhould
looſe, deſir'd him, that he would pleaſe to divert
himſelf with ſomething elſe; I know not whether
he ſpoke it ſurlily or not, or whether the Chevelier
<hi>de la Frette,</hi> who to ſay the truth was a ſort of a Bully,
took it for an affront on purpoſe to make a broil,
but without any more ado he takes the whole Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
up, and throws the Balls all about the Tennis
Court, this occaſion'd ſome hot words between
them, and the Chevelier <hi>de la Frette</hi> was in ſuch a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57806:117"/>
rage, that not conſidering that the other was not
only without a Sword, but as a man may ſay, quite
naked, he drew and made a paſs at him: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that ſtood by ran in between them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him doing any miſchief, ſo we left off the
Play, and went into the dreſſing-room to put on our
Cloths. There was no Gentlemen there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that
having parted us, they apprehended nothing of any
further miſchief, and we went away without any
notice being taken. <hi>La Verie</hi> told me, if he was
ruin'd by it, he would have ſatisfaction. I durſt
not diſſwade him, tho 'twas againſt my judgment,
leſt he ſhould think 'twas for want of Courage,
and ſo I, that was but juſt got out of one ſnare, fell
into an other, that was ten times more dangerous. I
was fain to be the Meſſenger to go and carry the
Challenge to the Chevalier, who liv'd in the ſame
ſtreet, at a great Houſe, now belonging to the Duke
<hi>d' Elbeuf.</hi> I had nothing to do to make him a long
Compliment: He told me preſently he knew my
buſineſs, and preventing me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told me, that we muſt
get another man; for that two of his Friends who
had heard of the quarrel, had made him promiſe
that he would not engage without them: Upon this
we went to ſee if we could find the Count <hi>de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
youngeſt Son of the Marquis <hi>d' Entragues,</hi> who
has ſince taken upon him the Title of Marquiſs
<hi>d' Illiers,</hi> and was made under Lieutenant in the Light
Horſe of the Guards, and loſt his life at the battle of
<hi>Seneff.</hi> But happy enough for him, we could not
find him; but as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought for him at his Fathers
houſe, <hi>L' Hoſtel d' Entragues,</hi> we met with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who was his Neighbour in the Country, one
<hi>Chilvant,</hi> who made up our Party; ſo we fought
behind the Convent of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> where I was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57806:117"/>
wounded, and our ſide had the worſt of the day,
but no body was kill'd. We every one ſhifted for our
ſelves, knowing we were loſt men if we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd';
but as good luck would have it the thing
was never known: <hi>La Verie</hi> return'd to his Poſt as if
nothing had been done, and none of us had the
leaſt diſturbance about it. For my part, I had taken
ſanctuary at the Marquiſs <hi>de Noirmouſtier,</hi> Eldeſt
Son to the Governour of <hi>Charleville,</hi> of whom I
made mention before, but he ſoon inform'd me there
was no need to be afraid, ſo I appear'd again too as
well as the others.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight or three weeks after this, as I
hinted before, happen'd the quarrel of the Meſſieurs
<hi>de la Frette,</hi> which did not come off ſo well: The
Eldeſt was at a Ball at the Palace Royal, where was
a great appearance of Courtiers: when all was over
and every one preparing to go out, this <hi>de la Frette</hi>
who reſented ſomething from Monſieur <hi>de Chalais,</hi>
about a Miſtreſs, and had a mind to let him know it,
rudely juſtled him ſeveral times as he went out. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Chalais</hi> looking about to ſee who juſtled
him, preſently knew <hi>la Frette,</hi> and gave him ſome
words about it that were diſobliging enough. If
they had had Swords there would have been ſome
diſorder about it in the Palace, tho that was a very
improper place to quarrel in, but every one being
dreſt for the Ball, <hi>la Frette</hi> would take no notice of it
there, but waited without for him to demand ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
They ſoon agreed upon it, to fight three
to three, and fixt the place, where they ſhould meet
the next day, it being too late for that night. This
was in too publick a place to quarrel, and make a
ſecret of it; the King was made acquainted with it,
and immediately ſent away the Chevelier <hi>de St. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57806:118"/>
to tell Monſieur <hi>de la Frette,</hi> that he poſitively
forbid him fighting, and that if he ſhould dare to do
it, he ſhould certainly dye for it. <hi>St. Agnan,</hi> who
was his Couſin German, found him out preſently,
and made him this compliment. <hi>De la Frette</hi> told
him, that he hop'd he had more regard to his honour
than to make him forfeit his word; that the hour
was at hand, and 'twas in vain to think of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
them; and beſides being his Friend too,
he ſhould rather expect, that he would make one in
their number, and that they would ſend to <hi>Chalais</hi>
to provide himſelf with another man. The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>de St. Agnan,</hi> never conſidering that he was
ſent by the King with ſo ſevere a meſſage to prevent
it, nor how ſtrictly all ſorts of Duels were forbid,
raſhly embarques in an affair, which he could never
hope to get clear of; and join'd with them in it, ſo
they immediately ſent to <hi>Chalais</hi> to provide a fourth
man. The Marquis <hi>de Noirmouſtier</hi> his Brother-in-law,
who was already engag'd, knowing of the
affair I had lately had with the Chevalier <hi>de la Frette,</hi>
immediately thought upon me, and ſent about to
look for me; but very happily for me, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
that night at play at a Friends houſe; and tho
it is not the cuſtom at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon any occaſion, to
ſtay from ones Lodging, yet it being very late, and
that the ſtreets were at that time very full of Rogues,
I was oblig'd to take a Bed with them. This odd
ſtep ſav'd me from all the miſchiefs of this affair,
and was the only time that I could ſay, I was
oblig'd to fortune for my deliverance; and that tho ſhe
had always croſt my advancement, yet ſhe had not
reſolv'd my ruine. The eight Gentlemen who
fought, were the Chevalier <hi>de la Frette, Ovarti</hi> his
Brother, ſince called by the name of <hi>d' Amilly,</hi> and is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57806:118"/>
now Lieutenant in the Guards, the Chevalier <hi>de St.
Agnan</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Flammarin,</hi> on the one ſide.
The Prince <hi>de Chalais,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Noirmoustier,</hi>
the Marquis <hi>d' Antin,</hi> Brother to Monſieur <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan,</hi>
and the Viſcount <hi>de Argenliece</hi> on the other.
The ſucceſs of the buſineſs was not fatal, only to
the Marquiſs <hi>d' Antin,</hi> who was kill'd upon the ſpot;
but the reſt got off cheaper, yet their condition was
bad enough. The King was in a great rage when
he heard of it, but above all at the Chevalier <hi>de St.
Agnan,</hi> who indeed was more to blame than all of
them. In the mean time their danger was equal,
there was a neceſſity for them to think of getting
out of the Kingdom, and that very privately too;
for the King had given ſevere orders at all the Ports,
and all the Paſſes on the Confines to ſtop them.
However they got off, ſome into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſome into
<hi>Portugal,</hi> ſome one way, and ſome another, as their
own good fortune guided them. But as whatever
a man enjoys in a foreign Country has a ſort of
baniſhment in it, while he is kept out of his own;
ſo with all the joy of their eſcape, they had every
one time to repent of his folly: No body pittied
the Chevalier <hi>de Agnan,</hi> all the world ſaid he had no
more than he deſerv'd; the Brothers <hi>de la Frette</hi> were
as little as he, for they were ſo very quarrelſom upon
every ſlight occaſion, that they were very well
compar'd to a vicious Horſe, that will let no other
Horſe come into the Stable. For the reſt, every
body was concern'd for them, and would have been
very glad, if it had been poſſible, that the King
would have a little wink'd at it on their accounts:
Indeed they were all very honeſt Gentlemen, and
deſerv'd better fortune; but not one perſon durſt
ſpeak to the King for them, and tho the Duke <hi>de
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57806:119"/>
Agnan</hi> was very near to his Perſon, yet he was one
of the firſt that told to the King, his Sons Crime
was of a nature too groſs to be forgiven, and that if
he knew where he was, he would be the firſt ſhould
bring him to juſtice; that therefore he would not
trouble his head to ask any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour for him, and he
believ'd that all People would be of his mind. This
was a diſcourſe well enough for a Court Paraſite,
that ſuited all he ſaid to the temper of his Prince,
but very ill became a Father, who at leaſt ought to
have extenuated the Crime of his Son, not agrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it. The Relations of the Meſſieurs <hi>de la Frette</hi> took
other Meaſures. If they durſt not expoſe themſelves
to ſpeak to the King, they ſet all their wits at work
to prevail with him: The Dutcheſs <hi>de Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lnes,</hi>
whoſe Husband was Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> oblidg'd
him to ſpeak to the <hi>Pope;</hi> and tho the Holy Father
at the ſame time ought to juſtify the Kings ſeverity
in theſe matters, yet that did not hinder him from
promiſing his aſſiſtance in this occaſion. In ſhort,
having a Legate reſiding at <hi>Paris,</hi> on ſome Affairs
needleſs for me to repeat, he order'd him to ſpeak
to the King in his name on their behalf: The Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
could not have employ'd any whoſe Intereſt was
more likely to prevail, the <hi>Pope</hi> having power to
diſpence with the Oath, which 'twas ſuppos'd was
the chief cauſe, that made the King ſo inflexible
to all ſorts of Application. But he anſwer'd the
Legate, that he ſhould be glad to oblige his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in any thing, but that in this his hands were
ty'd, and that none but God himſelf could diſcharge
him of an Oath ſo ſolemnly taken: Not that he
call'd in queſtion the Authority of the Holy See,
but that 'twas for the Honour of God who made
him a King, that he ſhould be a Prince of his word,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57806:119"/>
and he did not queſtion but the Pope himſelf would
forbear preſſing him any farther, if he pleas'd but to
conſider the conſequence of it.</p>
            <p>The People ador'd the King when they came to
know the anſwer he had made the Pope; and his
Holineſs himſelf, who indeed concern'd himſelf in
it, but at the Importunity of the Duke <hi>de Chaulnes</hi>
was overjoy'd at the conſtancy of the King; and if
one may credit what I heard from a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſecretly, thankt the King for the refuſal: On the
other hand, the Duke <hi>de St. Agnan</hi> coming to be in
extraordinary Favour ſoon after, no body doubted
but he would employ it in behalf of his Son, but he
was very cautious; whether 'twas that he ſaw it
would be to no purpoſe, or as others thought, that
he was without natural affections.</p>
            <p>This affair having made a great noiſe, as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
with things at firſt, People began now to
forget it, another publick accident happening to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
their diſcourſe. Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the <hi>Finances</hi> was ſeiz'd and committed to
Priſon; indeed he had ſuch powerful Enemies that
'twas a miracle how he eſcap'd the Scaffold. About
the time he was Arreſted they gave out ſeveral things
againſt him to render him more odious to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but I owe this Teſtimony to the Truth, to ſay
that many of them were really falſe, which I can more
eaſily juſtify, than ſay that I had not a hand in ſome
of them my ſelf. Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> was a man of a
large Soul, and a very generous Spirit, and 'twould
have appear'd more had he been of any Profeſſion
but of the Long Robe. Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> had taken
an averſion to him, for that he being Procurer Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to the Parliament, he could not bear to hear
the Cardinal reflect upon that great Body, of which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57806:120"/>
he had the honour to be a principal Member: He
had however often told the Cardinal that he
would not deny, but there were ſeveral Perſons in
that Aſſembly that he could wiſh were not: But this
was not ſatisfaction enough for an <hi>Italian,</hi> who made
nothing to retain a grudge againſt a man all the days
of his life, tho being of an effeminate cowardly nature,
he durſt never diſcover his malice, but juſt when he
was a dying, and then he told the King, that he was a
man, who not only profuſely waſted the publick
Treaſure, but alſo apply'd great ſums of it to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
uſe; that he lived in greater ſplendor than the
King himſelf; that his Houſes were finer than the
Royal Palaces, both for the Buildings, and the
Magnificence of the Furniture; that he gave private
Penſions to ſeveral perſons about the Court, a
ſhrewd ſign that he had ſome dangerous things in his
head; that he had caus'd <hi>Belle Iſle</hi> to be fortify'd, a
place which he had bought of the Houſe of <hi>Gondi,</hi>
which had the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the antient Enemies of the
Kingdom, behind it, <hi>With whom,</hi> ſays the Cardinal,
<hi>I will not aſſure your Majesty he doth not hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence;</hi>
that the only way to prevent ſuch a
miſchief, was to ſtrike at the root, and to make ſure
of ſuch a dangerous man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that nevertheleſs this was
to be done very cautiouſly, and to be ſure not while
he was Procurer General, becauſe then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be his Judges, and he would certainly
get off; that therefore he ſhould take his meaſures
accordingly, and above all, that it ſhould be done
with ſuch ſecreſy, that he might be ſure to have no
ſuſpicion of it.</p>
            <p>This was juſt at the time of the Cardinal's
Death, who that he might ſhew himſelf a true
<hi>Italian</hi> to the laſt, ſent for this very Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:57806:120"/>
and embrac'd him, calling him one of his beſt friends,
mentioning to him the many obligations he had
receiv'd from him during the Civil Wars, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
how he had ſent him fifty thouſand Crowns,
when he was oblig'd to fly, and retire to <hi>Leige,</hi>
which he had not paid him till a long time after:
But as this was his manner to wheadle with thoſe
he had a deſign to betray, ſo his being upon the
brink of the next world, did not one jot alter his
meaſures; for he left the King prepoſſeſt with all
thoſe fine ſtories he had made of this Miniſter.
His Majeſty, who was perfectly form'd for all thoſe
great things we have ſince ſeen him execute, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Maſter of his own ſecrets, which is one of
the moſt eſſential qualities of a great man; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſcover'd his intentions to no ſoul but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>le Tellier,</hi> whoſe fidelity he had try'd in too
many occaſions of the laſt moment, to have any
cauſe to ſuſpect; and to Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who
the Cardinal had recommended at his death, as a fit
perſon to manage the Finances, and theſe he made
exactly perſue the method the Cardinal had ſaid down,
which was not to attempt Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> till they
had got him out of the Office of Procurer Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>And now, ſince we have occaſion to ſpeak of this
Monſienr <hi>Colbert,</hi> who had been one of the moſt
profligate wicked fellows of the Age, I'll tell one
ſtory of him, concerning ſome buſineſs that happen'd
between him and I: It was a great many years ago,
and in thoſe days he was counted a very honeſt man.
My Siſter, whom I told you of, had a great Trial
about the birth of her Son, had by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
a certain rent charge upon the <hi>Hoſtel de Ville,</hi> and
the Writings were left in the hands of this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57806:121"/>
               <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Father, who as every body knows was
Paymaſter of thoſe Rents: Her Husband, however
it happen'd, knew nothing of it; but my Siſter hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found a little <hi>Memorandum</hi> among his Papers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

piece of News to him, who ſince he began to
come into favour had ſet up for a man of quality,
which appear'd chiefly in his Retinue, eſpecially
after his pretenſion to be deſcended from the Royal
Family of <hi>Scotland:</hi> However, he demanded to ſee
the <hi>Memorandum</hi> I mention'd, and I being ſuch a
<hi>Coxcomb,</hi> as I may well be aſham'd to mention,
ſhow'd it him; as ſoon as ever he lookt on it, and
ſpy'd this defect in it, that it wanted a Date; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that 'twould therefore be very difficult for us to

he would ſearch among his Papers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
me to call on him again in about weeks a time.
I went to him again at the time appointed, and in
the mean time my Siſter caus'd the Regiſter to be

They that my Siſter apply'd to, ſaid the ſame thing
to her, ſo that I began to think there was nothing
in it; when there comes a man to me one day, and

               </gap> me, that if my Siſter would allow him one half
of the rent, he would procure her the Writings: I

was effectually done, and he was found to go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

told me, 'twas not proper to expoſe the affairs of his
Family to other peoples knowledge, that he was an
honeſt man, and I ought to believe him upon his
word.</p>
            <p>This was all the reaſon I could ever underſtand
why the Advocates, to whom my Siſter went for
advice, directed her to have recourſe to the Regiſter,
and to take out a Duplicate of the firſt Deed, which
nevertheleſs could not be, till we had made him
ſwear that he had not the Original: So we caus'd a
Summons to be given him, and while we attended
the ſealing of it, we made them look over all the
Regiſters of the <hi>Hotel de Ville;</hi> but the Father and
Son, being one as honeſt as t' other, had alter'd that
which only could give us any information of what
we lookt for; and our Contract had gone under the
names of ſo many people on one ſide, and t' other,
that neither his name nor ours was to be ſeen in it:
The only refuge we had left, was the Oath he was to
take, but our friends having very well obſerv'd to
us, that he that was Knave enough to cheat us,
would alſo be Villain enough to forſwear himſelf,
we were advis'd to make up the matter; ſo we gave
him a diſcharge for all the Arrears which he had
receiv'd under borrowed names, and alſo for the
year then going on, and ſo had her Writings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd.</p>
            <p>I leave any one to judge, if a man whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was ſo well manag'd, could be thought to
ſtick at the ſupplanting poor Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi> who
held a place which he had ſo great a deſire to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſes
him of, and in which he might ſo eaſily rob
both the King and the People: So he ſet all his
wits at work to get him out of his place, that he
might then attack him as was concluded; and as it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57806:122"/>
was neceſſary to find out a pretence for this, they
made a fine ſtory to him, that now he would be ſo
much encumbred with affairs in the Council, the
weight of all buſineſs there lying wholly upon him,
ſince the Cardinal was gone, and not able to
aſſiſt him, that 'twould be impoſſible for him to
diſcharge the buſineſs of the Parliament too, and
therefore 'twould be better for him to lay it down;
to carry this on, the King ſhow'd himſelf kinder
and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>much that
the good man being abſolutely deceiv'd, fell blindly
into the ſnare, and laid out for a Chapman for his
place in the Parliament, which being paſt all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the beſt in the Parliament, there was great
ſtruggling amongſt the mony'd men who ſhould have
the opportunity to buy it; Monſieur <hi>de Fieubet</hi> bid
moſt for it, for he offer'd boldly ſixteen hundred
thouſand Franks for it; but Mr. <hi>Fouquet</hi> choſe rather
to let Mr. <hi>de Harlai,</hi> one of his particular friends,
have it, tho he got not ſo much of him by two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand Franks. This was a piece of genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
few, but himſelf, were capable of, and for which
he was admired both by his friends and his enemies;
but the latter, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully an action that got him ſo much
honor, reported preſently, that he had robb'd the
King of ſuch Sums, that ſo ſmall a matter was not
worth his taking notice of; and as nothing is ſooner
credited than an ill report, every body believ'd it,
till by the iſſue of his affairs it appear'd, that he was
ſo far from having made himſelf rich, that he was
above two Millions in debt. Being thus out of that
Poſt, which was his Protection, the King thought
it beſt to make a <hi>Tour</hi> into <hi>Bretagne,</hi> before he
ſuffer'd him to be arreſted, that if he had any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
either within or without the Kingdom, he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57806:123"/>
might ſeize upon <hi>Belle Iſle,</hi> where they apprehended
a Rebellion. And this was manag'd with a great
deal of prudence, had there been need of ſo much
caution; for before Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> ſuſpected any
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Souldiers were planted ſo near to <hi>Belle
Iſle,</hi> that if any of his friends would have attempted
any thing for him, it had been impoſſible; his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
ſtartled abundance of people, nor were
they leſs ſorry for him, for tho it happen'd at a time
when the publick Miniſters were odious to the
people, by reaſon of the great Taxes, yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
obſerving, he was always a generous man, and
did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oard up what he got, as Stateſmen do, but
ſpent it freely amongſt them, they diſtinguiſht him
from the reſt, who they had markt out as the publick
grievance of the people; others were mov'd chiefly
by their intereſt, for he had oblig'd the affections of
abundance by ſuffering them to get by him, and theſe
could not ſee him carry'd to Priſon without regret,
who had done every body rather good than harm;
and if he had been guilty of any thing, 'twas
only under the Miniſtry of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and in
executing his orders too punctually. But that which
mov'd them moſt to compaſſion, was to ſee the
King put <hi>Colbert</hi> in his place, one who under the
Cloak of Moderation nouriſht an intollerable
ambition, always deceitful, tho he pretended to be
fair, preaching honeſty in all his diſcourſes, while
under-hand he robb'd every one with impunity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelf an Enemy to Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by enriching
himſelf with their ſpoils; barbarouſly cruel, and
yet at the ſame time preſſing and recommending
nothing but Clemency and Compaſſion; being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of not one good quality, but that he knew how
with an exquiſite art to hide his own faults. People
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57806:123"/>
thought him a man wholly given up to buſineſs, one
that had no time for Softneſſes and Pleaſures, and
yet no man was more Debaucht than he; he had his
hours for his Amours and his hours for his Publick
Affairs, only with this difference, that in the latter
he always put on a ſtarcht formal gravity; but in the
other appear'd with a free humour, and an air of
Gallantry.</p>
            <p>If it was a great unhappineſs to Monſieur <hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quet</hi>
to have diſpleas'd the King, 'twas no leſs a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to have ſuch a ſecret Enemy as Monſieur <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;</hi>
for tho he had premeditated his overthrow
long before with the Cardinal, and had plaid a
thouſand Tricks to render it inevitable; yet, leſt
Monſieur <hi>Foquet</hi> ſhould at laſt juſtify himſelf, he made
ſure of all the Officers that depended upon him for
falſe Witneſſes; and ſo order'd it by <hi>le Berrier,</hi> that
all his Papers were ſtole from him, by which he
ſhould have clear'd his innocence: and not ſatisfy'd
yet, he ſpread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abroad all the horribleſt reports of
him that 'twas poſſible for him to invent; as that
he had Debaucht the greateſt part of the Women of
the Court, by means of his money; and his end in
this was, that their Relations and Friends, who
would perhaps have aſſiſted him in his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
ſhould be provoked rather to aſſiſt in his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine:
And in this caſe perhaps I can give a better
account than moſt People; as for inſtance, they
had rais'd a report when the Queen Mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
<hi>Madamoiſelle de la Motthe Agencourt,</hi> that it
was on his ſcore, when I am aſſur'd upon very
good grounds, that it was for entertaining the
Marquis <hi>de Richelieu</hi> againſt her Majeſties expreſs
Command: This Lady, who was one of her Maids
of Honour, was a perſon whom I was particularly
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57806:124"/>
acquainted with, and that ſo much, as I was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have a Paſſion for her: ſhe was co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ted
one of the fineſt women in the Court, and therefore
I was not at all diſpleas'd to have it thought ſo, for
except <hi>Madamoiſel de Meneville</hi> (who had her Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
there was none that would pretend to diſpute
it. 'Twas not for me to decide the caſe between
theſe two Beauties, being ſuſpected to be partial,
from what I have ſaid before. But to come to the
Story, One day as I was at <hi>Fountain Bleau,</hi> where
both the Queens continued while the King was in
<hi>Bretagne,</hi> ſhe came to me in a great concern, and
with tears in her Eyes told me, ſhe was ruin'd if I
I did not ſerve her in one affair, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to convey into her Chamber a Suit of Mens
Cloaths; but that I ſhould be ſure not to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
for ſhe had a great many Eyes upon her: I
askt her what the occaſion was, and if ſhe was ſo
much concern'd in the diſgrace of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi>
as to oblige her to fly for it? <hi>No,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that, I never was intimate enough with him to
be ſo very much concern'd for his misfortune; but this
I'll confeſs to you, they will have it, that Love has caus'd
me to commit ſome faults, fooliſh enough to be puniſh'd
for: That impertinent old Jade</hi> de Beauvais <hi>has been
buzzing in the Ears of the Queen Mother, that I have
ſeen her Son in Law; and her Majeſty, who ſuffers
her ſelf to be govern'd by that Wretch, reſents it ſo highly,
that ſhe has order'd one of my Relations to diſpoſe of me
into a Cloyſter; I mean the Counteſs</hi> de Maulevrier,
<hi>the ſame whoſe Husband you had formerly a quarrel
with; therefore for Gods ſake deliver me out of her
hands, and do as I have deſir'd you; and then be ſo kind
as to get me a Horſe, and place him at the Kings Wine
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57806:124"/>
Preſſes on t' other ſide the Ferry</hi> de Velvins, <hi>that I may
be gone.</hi>

            <p>If I had been in Love, as the World would have
me be thought, I leave any one to judge how this
Compliment would have pleas'd me; but having
really never pretended any thing of that nature to
her, I was very ready to aſſiſt her, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
at the occaſion: ſo I ſent one of my Horſes to
the place ſhe had directed, and went my ſelf to her
Chamber with a Suit of my own Cloths; but there
being no body there to take it, I put it under the
Bed as ſhe had order'd me; and the Chambers or
Lodgings of the Maids of Honour being always
open to the Gallery, I went and fell into a chat with
the good old Lady, Madam <hi>du Tilleul</hi> under <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi>
of the Ladies: who was one of my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and walking up and down with her, I
ſaw lying upon the <hi>Toilet</hi> ſeveral Combs, and a
Powder Box, and all the neceſſary Impliments of the
Dreſſing Box, and amongſt the reſt there ſtood a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Pot of <hi>Pomatum,</hi> ſo I muſt needs take a little to
rub upon my hands becauſe they were a little rough;
I found it quite of another colour than the ordinary
ſort, which made me fancy it might be good for
the Lips too, and ſo without any conſideration, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
ſome to mine, they being a little chopt; but I
ſoon paid for my curioſity, for immediately my Lips
were all on fire, my Mouth was contracted, my
Gums ſhrivl'd up, and when I went about to ſpeak,
I made Madam <hi>du Tilleul</hi> laugh at that rate, that I
might eaſily ſee I had very finely expos'd my ſelf;
and which was worſt of all, I was not able to
bring out one word diſtinctly; and running direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Looking-glaſs to take a view of my ſelf,
I was ſo damnably aſham'd of the figure I made,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57806:125"/>
that I run away to hide my ſelf; but juſt as I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
going out I met the Duke <hi>de Roquelaire</hi> who was
coming to make his Court to one of the Ladies, and
being ſcar'd to ſee me in that condition, he askt me
what the <hi>Devil ail'd me?</hi> I told him very ſimply
my misfortune, but inſtead of pittying he fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

laughing at me, and told me I was but rightly ſerv'd;
that at my Age I ought to know that there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of Pomatum; that the ſort I had meddl'd
with was not either for the Hands or for the Hair,
but was deſign'd for another ſort of uſe; after he
had had his fill of this rallying, he left me, and went
to the Apartments of the Queen Mother, where he
made his Court at the expence of my misfortune. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
all the Town came to ſee me, and finding
that I had really furniſh'd them with ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their mirth, I would have been one of the
firſt to have laught at the Jeſt, if I could but have
open'd my Mouth. This adventure was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of the whole Court, for at leaſt a
Week, they were ſo taken with it, that they ſent
an account of it to <hi>Nants</hi> where the King was, who
as ſerious as he was, could not forbear ſmiling at
it; for my part, I had as much inclination to laugh
as any body, when I thought of this accident, but
though I waſh'd my Mouth often with freſh Water,
and ſometimes with warm Wine, yet nothing but
time would bring me to rights again.</p>
            <p>This little diſgrace however hindred me from
ſhowing my ſelf for ſome days, ſo that till I came
abroad again, I could not hear any tidings of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle
<hi>De la Motthe,</hi> but then I was preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that the Counteſs <hi>de Maulevriere</hi> had put her
into a Cloiſter at <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aliot,</hi> and that this confinement,
which was a true Priſon to her, was accompanied
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57806:125"/>
with a very ſevere reprimand made her by the
Queen Mother: I was inform'd alſo, that this Lady
who was blindly in love with the Marquis <hi>de Richlieu,</hi>
had given her ſelf a great deal of liberty, in reflecting
upon <hi>la Beauvais,</hi> notwithſtanding the reſpect which
ſhe ought to have had for the Queen; and reproacht
her among other things, that ſhe took occaſion to
wait upon the King when he was but very young,
and to make him this civil requeſt, that his Majeſty
would be pleas'd to lye with her. I could not eaſily
believe Madam <hi>la Motthe</hi> could be guilty of ſo great
a folly, but the thing being confirm'd to me by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, I askt them if what ſhe reproacht the little
old Lady with one Eye for, was true, and if his
Majeſty had been ſo charitable as to oblige her?
They told me, that was not a thing to be queſtion'd,
and askt me where I had liv'd, that I ſhould be the
only man in <hi>France</hi> that was ſo ignorant.</p>
            <p>Tho this was the true Hiſtory of Madamoiſelle
<hi>de la Motthe,</hi> yet Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> had maliciouſly
nam'd her amongſt thoſe, whom as he ſaid, Monſieur
<hi>Fouquet</hi> had been intriguing withal; but this was a
ſmall matter compar'd to the other methods he us'd
for his ruine. He pickt out ſuch Members of the
ſeveral Parliaments as he thought were the moſt
needy, and who watcht for an occaſion to oblige the
Court, to be his Judges: Theſe he fed with hopes,
and made them large promiſes of Preferment, if
they would give their voices as he directed, and
upon this account was ſo confident of his deſtruction,
that he gave order to have a Scaffold made privately
ready for the occaſion. In the mean time he had ſo
firmly poſſeſt the King, that Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> could
not poſſibly clear himſelf, that his Majeſty had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
his Horſe Guards to attend him to <hi>Chartres;</hi> a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57806:126"/>
journey which he had contriv'd, not for any Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as was pretended, but to be out of the way of
any Applications, which he foreſaw would be made
to him on behalf of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet;</hi> for tho he was
of no extraordinary Family himſelf, he had marry'd
one of his Daughters to the eldeſt Son of the Count
<hi>de Charoſt,</hi> and the King was ſenſible ſhe would
throw herſelf at his feet for her Father. Thus the
King ſtood ready to be gone, the very moment they
ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ng him news that the poor man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
when one of the Judges (a Councellor of
the Parliament of <hi>Aix)</hi> ſtood up and ſpoke for the
Priſoner; He told them he was aſtoniſht to find
ſuch prejudice in that Court againſt a man, as to
ſeem reſolv'd on any terms, right or wrong, to hurry
him out of the world; that at firſt view indeed
there might be ſome appearance of guilt; there had
been found, 'twas true, among his papers, a rough
ſcheme of a Rebellion, with ſeveral methods how
to raiſe it, and other projects for his conduct in ſuch
an affair, when it ſhould be brought to paſs; and
many ſuch things for which Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> might
ſeem to deſerve no leſs than death: But when one
came to examine into the the proofs of theſe Crimes,
there was cauſe enough at leaſt to ſuſpend ones
Judgment againſt him; this was found among a
parcel of old waſte Papers, thrown by, not only into a
corner of the Room, but into the Chimny, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for nothing but the Fire, as Monſieur <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi>
had very well obſerv'd in his defence; that there
was no other marks of it, but as of a thing form'd in
his mind, provokt to it by the barbarous uſage of
Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who upon all occaſions had not
fail'd to teſtifie his malice againſt him; that, 'twas a
general maxime in the Law, that no man could be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57806:126"/>
puniſh'd for thinking Treaſon, nor for intending, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he proceed to ſome <hi>Overt-act;</hi> that here was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like it in this caſe, but on the contrary, very
evident tokens that he had laid aſide ſo much as the
thoughts of it; that Kings ought not to be more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
than God himſelf, who ſo graciouſly paſſes
by the inadvertency of our conceptions; but beſides
there was ſomething of more conſequence than all
this that had been ſaid, that Monſieur <hi>de Fouquet</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
expreſly that he had wherewithal to prove
beyond contradiction, his repentance of that very
intention, if they had not inhumantly ſtole away his
Papers; that 'twas true thoſe words might be ſpoken
only to excuſe himſelf, but 'twas alſo true, that it
might be really ſo; this was certain, and not to
be denyed, that they had found among his Papers
ſeveral Petitions adreſs'd to Monſ. <hi>Colbert,</hi> with the
title of my Lord, which was never given to him till
ſince the impriſonment of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet;</hi> that
this was a proof, they had come into his Houſe
without his knowledge, and ſearcht there at their
own pleaſure; and 'twas an infallible conſequence,
that they did ſo with a deſign to ruin him, becauſe,
that under pretence of ſearching in that manner, they
had carried away all the Papers which he ſhould uſe
for his Juſtification; that notwithſtanding all this, he
had clear'd himſelf of the great Crime; his enemies
made ſuch a ſtir about, of waſting the Revenues of
the Crown; that he had laid before them an account
of his eſtate, what he had when he entered upon the
Miniſtry, and what he had with his Wife; (which
rogether amounted to above a million) what Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
he had received, and what had ſell to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other occaſions. And though theſe were very
conſiderable, yet he had not only ſpent all this in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57806:127"/>
ſervice of his Majeſty, but was run into Debt above
two Millions: that his extravagance ought not to
be reckon'd criminal, ſince he had means enough of
his own to do it, without wrong to the King, and
he had done no injury to any body, but himſelf,
poor man, and his Family.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Judges were amaz'd, not
ſo much at the diſcourſe of this man, tho' that had a
great deal of force with it, but to ſee how little
he valu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the great Men, whom he knew he ſhould

               </gap>t the higheſt rate. Now, as we cannot
do our Neighbour a better ſervice than by a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to ſet him in the right way, all thoſe that ſpoke
after him, were of the ſame mind, and thoſe who had
before given their Voices for his Condemnation, being
aſham'd of ſo unjuſt a Sentence; retracted their
judgment, ſo that in a moment, there was ſeen ſuch
a change in the Court, as if ſome influence from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
had wrought a miracle upon them: However,
as there was cauſe enough to inflict ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi> either for that project
of a revolt I mention'd, or that he had fortifyed
<hi>Bell Iſle</hi> on his own account, they thought fit to
condemn him to Baniſhment. They were very much
ſurprized at Court, at a Sentence ſo little expected;
and it quite broke off their journey to <hi>Chartres,</hi> and
Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> fearing that if Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi>
ſhould ever be at liberty, he would find an occaſion,
ſome time or other, to let the King know certain
things which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> concern'd him to have kept ſecret,
prevail'd upon the King, to change the Sentence of
Baniſhment, to a perpetual Priſon. After then he
had laid I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not how long in the Dungeon at
<hi>Vincennes,</hi> they carryed him to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> where he
continued at leaſt ſixteen or ſeventeen years: But
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57806:127"/>
this was the Pennance for his faults, for they who
knew him in that place of Perſecution, ſay he made
ſo good uſe of it, that nothing could have happen'd
more to his advantage. And ſince I have nam'd
this, I cannot forbear telling you a ſtory, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
upon the occaſion of his meeting with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>De Lauſun,</hi> who was committed to the ſame
Priſon about ten years after, and from whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this account. Upon the firſt meeting they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
one another, and Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
immediately where he had ſeen him, askt
him his Name? Whether or no he had forgot him
in the time of his Diſgrace: Or that, as 'twas moſt
likely, Monſieur <hi>De Lauſun</hi> was not ſo conſiderable
in his time, as to be known to him? But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>De Lauſun</hi> having given him ſatisfaction who he
was, goes on to make himſelf known to him, with
the common vanity of telling ones own Hiſtory, by
acquainting him with the particulars of his life.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> heard him very intently, for he
was extreamly ſurpriz'd at ſome diſcourſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have had with the King, about Madam <hi>de
Monaco;</hi> How he had told his Majeſty he was no
better than a Tyrant, in offering to take away his
Miſtreſs from him, and how he refus'd to ſerve in
his Office of Collonel General of the Dragoons, in
the Army which marcht into <hi>Italy;</hi> how he had askt
the King to be made General, and upon the refuſal
had thrown up his Commiſſion. In ſhort, how his
Majeſty had ſent him to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> from whence
nevertheleſs he was releas'd in four and twenty hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to riſe the greater in his favour: Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi>
gave him the hearing, but obſerving the man, and
taking notice of the very mean figure he made, he
could not perſwade himſelf, the King, who was a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57806:128"/>
Prince of the niceſt judgment, and known to be of a
fierce and violent temper, ſhould ſuffer himſelf to
be Nos'd at that rate; and ſhould ſo far forget his
Character, as to bear thoſe Inſults from a Subject,
eſpecially one ſo deſpicable as he appear'd; however
Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> conceal'd his ſentiments, and would
by no means interrupt him, but when he came to
relate his Marriage with Madamoiſelle <hi>de Montpenſier,</hi>
how the King had given his conſent to it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
recall'd it, and the concern that Princeſs was
in at the diſappointment, and all the conſequences of
that affair; he could not forbear turning to another
Priſoner of State, that had join'd them juſt before,
and making a ſign to his Forehead, as we do when
we would ſignifie a man is craz'd, he gave him to
underſtand that he thought no better of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
Monſieur <hi>De Lauſun</hi> perceiv'd it, but made
as if he took no notice of it, and went on with other
ſtrange paſſages of his life, which did but confirm
Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> in his former opinion.</p>
            <p>But to return to Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who was now
by the diſgrace of this Miniſter become ſo powerful
at Court, and had the Kings ear ſo entirely, that he
grew uneaſy to Monſieur <hi>Tellier;</hi> this latter had been
an old Courtier, and having done very great ſervices
to the State, it was but juſt he ſhould expect ſome
marks of diſtinction. The firſt method that <hi>Colbert</hi>
took to fix his Reputation, was to change the whole
form, and eſtabliſh a new exact order in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Finances,</hi> reforming the number of Offices,
and ſuppre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing the Under-Treaſurers and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies,
who were all clapt up in Priſon upon
pretence of having cheated the King; ſo that thoſe,
who pretended to have vaſt Sums due to them, were
ſo far from recovering their Debts, that they were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57806:128"/>
forc'd to part with all they had to ſatisfie his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Demands: Indeed to ſay the truth, there
was very groſs abuſes practic'd in the <hi>Finances,</hi> and
'twas no more than neceſſary they ſhould be redreſt
But here were ſeveral great perſons touch'd by this
Affair, for theſe fellows being rich, had ally'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſeveral conſiderable Houſes, as the Duke
<hi>de St. Agnan</hi> for one, whoſe eldeſt Son the Count
<hi>de Seri,</hi> was to marry Madamoiſelle <hi>de Monero,</hi> the
Daughter of one of theſe Officers, with whom he
was to have two Millions of Livres. This Duke
being very much in favour, as we have formerly
ſaid, and Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> apprehending ſome ill
Offices from him, who was alſo a very riſing man, he
appeaſed him by promiſing him his eldeſt Daughter
for his Son, inſtead of Madamoiſelle <hi>de Monero.</hi>
'Twas thought he made this promiſe againſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
the Duke being not very rich, and he had
a proſpect of marrying her more advantageouſly;
but whatever his thoughts were, he durſt not have
gone back from his word, if the Count <hi>de Seri</hi> had
liv'd to accept of it: Wherefore to preſerve his
friendſhip with the Duke, he told him, that tho it
had pleas'd God to diſpoſe of his Son, yet that he
had another left, and tho he was young, that ſhould
not hinder their alliance, ſince he had a younger
Daughter of a ſuitable age, and he would give him
his word ſhe ſhould be reſerv'd for him. The Duke
<hi>de St. Agnan,</hi> who had occaſion for money, and
knew no where to get a greater fortune for his Son,
eaſily conſented to this offer; when they were grown
up, Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> was as good as his word to him,
and they were marry'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>The reaſon which induc'd Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> to be
ſo fond of this alliance, was becauſe the Duke <hi>de
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57806:129"/>
St. Agnan,</hi> as we mention'd before, grew every day
more and more in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour; for the King, who was
now fallen in love with Madamoiſelle <hi>de la Valliere,</hi>
one of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Maids of Honour, a
Lady of no extraordinary beauty, but one who was
more agreeable than thoſe that were infinitely more
handſom, and had a mind to conceal it from the
Queen, committed the management of that intrigue
to the Duke. This young Lady was but of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Family, ſhe was the Daugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wars, had enobled her Great Uncle, which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Gentility; and before the King had any thoughts of
her, there was a Gentleman ſo in love with her, that
he intended to marry her; he was of a very good
family near <hi>Chartres,</hi> and Heir to an Eſtate of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand Livres a year, which was counted an
advantageous Match to her, his Name was <hi>Estour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
and was a Lieutenant in the Guards; he had
but one misfortune, which was, that his Eſtate lay
ſo much in the power of his Father, that he durſt not
marry without his conſent: So he was oblig'd to
leave his Miſtreſs for a while, to ſollicit the old
Gentleman upon that account. It was gone ſo far
on her ſide, that ſhe deſir'd him to make as ſhort a
ſtay from her as was poſſible; and 'twas gone ſo far
on his ſide, that he needed no ſuch importunity, but
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57806:129"/>
he had a Father to deal with, that requir'd more time
to conſider of it than he was aware of, for the
meanneſs of her Birth, and eſpecially of her Eſtate,
were difficulties which were not ſo ſoon over with
him, but took up ſo much time, that when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
things, and return'd at laſt with his Fathers
conſent, he found things were ſtrangely alter'd in
his abſence, for the King had not only appear'd to
be in love with his Miſtreſs, but ſhe had prevented
his Addreſſes by making a diſcovery of her paſſion
for him. He met with this News for his firſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

mouth but her own, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he went to the <hi>Palace Royal</hi> to

as formerly, the King having plac'd thoſe about her
whoſe obſervation made it neceſſary for her to be
cautious who ſhe converſt with; which ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
ſo well, and withal being full of her new
Grandeur, that when he ſent up his name to her, ſhe
made ſtrange of it, and return'd that ſhe knew no
ſuch perſon. <hi>Eſtourville</hi> knew how to interpret this
anſwer, and tho he made no more doubt of the
truth of his misfortune, her ingratitude ſo
overcame him, that he kept his Bed upon it. His
Friends, who knew the particulars, accus'd him of
folly, in being concern'd for ſo perfidious a creature;
but being uncapable of impreſſion by all their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

that he found ſhe had an influence upon the King,
and this gave him the advantage of all pretenders to

world, and if it had not been for my little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
I have ſo often mention'd, I ſhould have

contrary, if a Glaſs of Water would have ſav'd my
life, I verily believe, he would have ſuffer'd me to
periſh for want of that relief: This was a ſenſible
grief to me when I reflected on it; but as it pleas'd
God I was not quite reduc'd, I bore it with the more
patience, eſpecially when I conſider'd, that it was
not from any fault of mine. At laſt, about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the year 1663. I receiv'd a Letter from
his Curate to come down with all ſpeed, if I had
any deſire to ſee him before he dy'd. I had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to hinder me, ſo I took Poſt immediately, and
in ſix hours time I was at his Houſe; he was ſurpriz'd
to ſee me, and imagin'd preſently that I had been
privately ſent for, but however he made as if he
was glad to ſee me, and told me I had prevented him,
for his deſign was to have ſent for me; that he being
weak, and his great age making it improbable that
he ſhould recover, he was willing to ſettle his affairs,
and as there was nothing he deſir'd to prevent more,
than Law Suits among Relations, he did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I would refuſe, conſidering the condition in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57806:130"/>
which I ſaw him, to agree matters now with his
Wife and my Brothers; and he pretended to oblige
me in doing it. For this purpoſe he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old me, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Eſtate ſhould be equally divided, his
Wife coming in for a part, beſides her Joynture;
that this was for my advantage, for ſhe had brought
a great fortune to him, and which his Eſtate was
engag'd for; ſo that if ſhe ſhould come to demand
it, as is cuſtomary in like caſes, ſhe would carry
away above half the Eſtate. I made no anſwer at
all to a Propoſal ſo unjuſt, he having no regard in
that diſcourſe to the Joynture of my own Mother,
which was my Birthright, and which he ought to
have reſerv'd for me, when he marry'd again. He
took my ſilence in this caſe for an aſſent to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
and without preſſing me to any reply, ſent
away for a Notary. I ſuffer'd all this without giving
him the trouble of any contradiction, in reſpect to
his indiſpoſition; but when I ſaw the Notary was
come, and he began to dictate theſe things to him.
I beg'd him to defer it, till I ſhould take ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
about it; that I deſir'd him to remember, that
I was his Son as well as the reſt, that they had always
enjoy'd the priviledges of his houſe, which I had
been depriv'd of. That his eldeſt Son by this ſecond
Wife was already provided with two good Benefices,
ſo that he might not only very well bate his Legacy,
but was in a good condition to aſſiſt his younger
Brother; that I had diſpos'd of his Daughter, who
was rich enough alſo to have no need of it; that I
did not ſay this with any thought of depriving her
of the Inheritance, nor to take that from them
which Nature had given them a right to, but that
he ought to conſider me upon the ſame account;
that I would conſent, if he pleas'd, that he ſhould
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57806:131"/>
give my Mother-in-law a Penſion as large as he
thought fit, which I was ready to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irm, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to my youngeſt Brother, that ſo, if his Brother
ſhould not be kind to him, he might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to ſubſiſt; but for the reſt he muſt permit
me to adviſe upon it, as I had ſaid before.</p>
            <p>There was nothing could be more fair than my
Propoſal, and indeed it was a meer impoveriſhing
my ſelf to enrich others: But my Father was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht
to my Mother-in-law and her Children, that
he would certainly have got up and ſtruck me, if he
had been able to lift himſelf up in the Bed; he told
me, that now he ſaw all that had been ſaid to him of
me confirm'd; that I was an unnatural Dog, and
one that would ſhorten his days by my Diſobedience;
that he had made me a Propoſal too much to my
advantage, but that I would deprive my ſelf of it
purely in malice to diſturb the Family; that he did
not wonder I had ſo many broils with my Maſters,
who were better acquainted with my humours than
him; that another in my place would have made
his fortune, but that God had dealt with me as I had
deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>v'd; that I ſhould get out of his ſight, that he
might not be diſcompos'd at his departing out of the
world; that if I continu'd in that reſolution, he
would leave me his hearty Curſe, and that I ſhould
conſider of it, whether I was willing he ſhould dye
in that opinion.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs to you, I wiſht my ſelf a thouſand
miles off when I heard him talk at this rate; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to pacify him by the moſt profound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
and labouring to make him ſenſible, that
what I demanded was nothing but juſtice. I told
him once more, that if he did not pleaſe to let things
go in the ordinary way of Juſtice, for fear they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57806:131"/>
ſhould be too much to the prejudice of my Mother-in-law,
I was willing they ſhould have the Eſtate
who wanted; that I had as much occaſion of it as
any of them, eſpecially ſince there was a talk of
ſuppreſſing the Bank of <hi>Lyon,</hi> or at leaſt of retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the particular rents of it; that my
Brother the Abbot was like to be richer than all of
us together, from whom I had reaſon to expect
nothing, ſince, tho he ow'd all his fortunes to my
procurement, he never offer'd me a farthing when
he ſaw me in ſo much neceſſity.</p>
            <p>My Paſſion perhaps might make me think this the
moſt reaſonable diſcourſe in the world; I thought
ſo indeed, but my Father it ſeems was of another
opinion, and I had the unhappineſs that he dy'd
without being reconci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d to me; 'twas none of my
fault, and ſo I believe his Curſe had not the effect
he deſir'd upon me. At his Death I enter'd upon
the Eſtate, and ſet my Seal upon the Goods, which
you may be ſure put my Mother-in-law into a great
rage: She, who, when I did all I could to oblige
her, perſecuted me with ſo much cruelty, would not
fail to exclaim againſt me upon this proceeding; I did
now as I us'd to do formerly, let her ſay what ſhe
pleas'd, and the rather, becauſe ſhe never had more
occaſion; however that ſhe might have nothing
juſtly to reproach me with, and not out of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
of my own Title, I offer'd her a thouſand
Crowns a year, provided ſhe would relinquiſh her
other pretenſions: this was a Preſent ſhe ought to
have look'd upon as very civil in me, for in juſtice
ſhe could hope for nothing but her own Fortune, of
which the beſt part was never paid; but ſhe having
taken ſome meaſures which I knew nothing of, ſent
me word, that I ought to have accepted the offers
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57806:132"/>
my Father had made me, if I had been well advis'd;
but that ſince I had not, I ſhould ſee in a ſhort time
whether I was in the right or no.</p>
            <p>This ſort of talk did not trouble me, having no
apprehenſions of the trick they were going to play
me, but I went on to make out my Title, and was
buſie with the Advocates, who according to their
rules, declar'd, I ought to have the whole Eſtate, if
it was never ſo great: So I concluded to take off the
Seals which I had put on, which I did in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
form, and found among the papers, that my
Mother-in-law was a <hi>Feme ſole</hi> by the Contract of
Marriage: I ſuppos'd my Caſe was the better for
that, becauſe that then if there had been any pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made out of her money, the Eſtate was not
anſwerable for them; and imagining, that ſince ſhe
had ſhown ſo much ill nature, ſhe might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
this particular, I was ſuch a Fool to tell her
of it; but all the anſwer ſhe made me was, that the
end of the matter would diſcover the truth, and
perhaps it might ſpoil my mirth I could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
for the ſoul of me what ſhe had in her head,
till at laſt it diſcover'd it ſelf in a moment, to my no
ſmall diſturbance. The perſon that made the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
brought me a bag of papers ty'd together, with
a Ballet or Ticket upon it, in which was written
with my Mothers own hand as follows, <hi>Diſburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
paid of my Money out of the ſeveral parts of my
allowance, due to me from my Husband, for which I have
the Preference of Demand upon his Eſtate, before all other
Debts.</hi> I was not much ſurpriz'd at this, till I had
look'd a little further; but taking the papers out of
the bag, I ſaw ſome contracts of Settlements, made
by my Grandfather to ſome particular perſons in truſt,
for payment of Debts, one of which was for no
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57806:132"/>
leſs than fifty thouſand Crowns; ſo that if what
my Mother pretended had been juſt, ſhe might well
ſay, I had no cauſe to laugh, ſhe would ſpoil my Mirth;
for I was remov'd out of the Family when I was but
a Child, and had never any account of their
affairs, ſo that I could ſay nothing to this till I was
better inform'd: I ſaw well enough there was a
juggle in it, and the moſt favourable conſtruction I
could paſs on it, as to my Mother-in-law was, that
ſhe had imploy'd the Revenue of her Sons Benefices
to her own uſe; that which confirm'd me in this
thought was, that tho my Brother the Abbot left all
his affairs to the management of his Father and
Mother, yet I found but eight Livres and a half of
ready Money in the Houſe when my Father dy'd, a
fine ſum for a Family that made ſuch a figure in the
Country; or rather a very good mark of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
extraordinary management. However, after I
had mus'd upon this Caſe a while, I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that 'twas impoſſible my Grandfather ſhould
leave ſo many Debts, ſince the whole Eſtate did not
amount to more, and my Father had marry'd two
of his Siſters, and had paid them five and twenty
thouſand Livres each for their Portions; and from
hence I thought this was an infallible conſequence,
that my Father was far enough from having his Eſtate
ſo much encumber'd; but that they were old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
that they had reviv'd by ſome clandeſtine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
to make pretenſions upon the Eſtate; the
chief of thoſe Creditors being all Relations of one
kind or another to my Mother-in-law.</p>
            <p>I acquainted ſome very judicious perſons with my
ſuſpicions, who were preſently of my opinion, and
after them the Lawyers, who advis'd me however,
before I made any ſtir about it, or commenc'd any
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57806:133"/>
Suit at Law in the caſe, which could not but be
very inconvenient to me, that I ſhould try if I
could any way underhand diſcover the Cheat. I
try'd all the ways that I could poſſibly think of,
having ſet ſeveral Perſons of Quality of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to work for me, who knew what I had done
for the Family, and were mov'd to compaſſion to
ſee me us'd in ſuch a manner: But tho they us'd their
utmoſt skill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very heartily too, the Agents my
Mother-in-law had employ'd, had plaid their game
too ſure to be diſcover'd, and no doubt had been
well enough paid, ſo that all our endeavours were
to no purpoſe, and I was forc'd at laſt to begin a
tedious Suit at Law. Then I charg'd them with
Forgery concerning thoſe pretended Reinburſements,
and having obtain'd the liberty to publiſh a Monitory
thereof, I caus'd it to be read in the Churches of
thoſe Pariſhes where they liv'd, whom I ſuſpected
had a hand in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aud, hoping that the time of
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> being at hand, when every one was to paſs
for Abſolution, 'twould oblige them to conſult ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
with their Conſciences. My Siſter ſhow'd
me at this time a particular mark of her Gratitude;
ſhe came to me and told me, that tho ſhe knew
what ſhe was going to ſay would embroil her with
her Mother, if ever ſhe ſhould come to hear of it,
ſhe would nevertheleſs witneſs the truth ſo far as to
tell me, that ſhe had heard my Father often ſay, in
diſcourſing of ſeveral things with my Mother-in-law,
that his Father had not left him one Farthing in
debt, but that on the other hand he found eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Franks of ready money in the houſe at his death:
She told me ſhe remember'd this, as perfectly as if it
had not been above a quarter of an hour ago, and
that if it would do me any ſervice, ſhe would make
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57806:133"/>
               <hi>affidavit</hi> of it before a Judge: I gave her a thouſand
thanks for her good will, but not being willing ſhe
ſhould incur the hatred of her Mother for her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to me, I told her it ſhould ſuffice me to ſee
ſuch a proof of her Love, without making her a
ſacrifice; that I was ſorry I was in no better a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for her ſake; that I had reſolv'd ſhe ſhould
be my Heir to that little I had, for I lov'd ſuch an
honeſt principle; in ſhort, ſhe did all I could deſire,
for ſhe gave me a Declaration two or three days
after, whereby ſhe relinquiſht any claim for her part
in any thing her Mother might pretend upon my
Fathers Eſtate, acknowledging that it all belong'd
to me, and charging her Son, in caſe of her Death,
not to meddle with it, but to make me reſtitution:
She forc'd the paper of this into my hands, and
made me take it, but I laught at her, and having
torn it in her ſight, I told her we ſhould eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
the caſe between her and I, if there was
no body elſe concern'd; that I took this as kindly
of her, which ſhe had now done, as if ſhe had given
me a hundred thouſand Crowns; and that all my
trouble was, that I was not in a condition to requite
her kindneſs.</p>
            <p>Our Cauſe, which had at firſt been commenc'd in
the Country, was quickly brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> by the
means of one of my Mother-in-laws pretended
Creditors, who ſuppoſing he ſhould ſerve her the
better there, where he had a great intereſt, made
her remove it to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he did all his buſineſs.
I was ſo far from being ſorry for this, that they could
not have pleas'd me better, having perhaps as many
friends there as he, and hop'd they would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me in a Cauſe ſo very juſt. In ſhort, every one
proffer'd me his ſervice, and I that had always hated
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57806:134"/>
Law Suits above all things, carry'd on this with ſo
much vigour, that I minded nothing elſe. When I
think of this ſometimes, I wonder what it was
wrought ſo great a change in me, unleſs it was, that
my Mother having on all occaſions exaſperated me,
I was very willing to have my turn in vexing her too,
and plague her as much as I could. In the mean
time however, the Cauſe was againſt me, and every
body told me, that when it came to a hearing I
ſhould be caſt, unleſs I could produce ſome Deeds
to make out the Cheat I pretended was put upon
me. I had brought the Contracts of my two Aunts,
whereby it appear'd they had receiv'd fifty thouſand
Franks, and that 'twas likely my Father had a great
deal more, becauſe we liv'd in a Country where
'twas the cuſtom to be favourable to the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but the Lawyers laught at this, and told me,
that in matters of Law they did not uſe to judge by
ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>I was to be ſure ſtrangely embarraſt at this ſort of
diſcourſe, and ſaw my ſelf at the point to be caſt for
the charges; when a certain Councellor of the
Great Chamber ſent to me to tell me, that if I
would promiſe to marry his Daughter, he would
engage I ſhould carry my Cauſe. I askt of the
Meſſenger who this Councellor was, but he told
me, he was not to tell me, unleſs I accepted the
propoſition; but that aſſoon as I had given him my
word, I ſhould ſee both my Father-in-law and his
Daughter. I reply'd, that folks did not uſe to
marry they know not who, and before I promis'd
any thing, I ſhould be very willing to know who I
had to do with; that in the firſt place the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſeem'd a little freakiſh, or to ſpeak ſeriouſly, it
ſeem'd to come from a man that was not very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57806:134"/>
that my Father-in-law pretended belike to
ſell me Juſtice, ſince it might chance I ſhould buy it
with the loſs of my Liberty, and perhaps of my
Honour; and in the ſecond place, this caution he
us'd to get my promiſe before I ſhould be ſuffer'd to
know him, lookt as if he had no great confidence of
his own reputation; that I could not imagin who it
ſhould be, and could gueſs but two or three perſons,
whom I would not name; but if it was any one of
them, I defy'd them, and would rather run the
hazard of being miſerable all my life, than to buy
my Eſtate with ſo diſhonourable a Match: The
man let me go on without the leaſt interruption, till
I had quite done, and then ſhrugging up his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
he told me, this diſcourſe from a man of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
year old would be well enough, but for one that
had ſeen almoſt fifty, 'twas an inexcuſable folly,
that I call'd it then ſelling of Juſtice; that he would
help me with his credit and intereſt; what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had a man to prefer my intereſt before my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-laws,
who in all appearance had the right on
her ſide; that thoſe Gentlemen who I talkt ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly
of, were at the ſame time the chief men in
the Parliament; that all perſons were at their beck,
and that if I ſhould have ſo little wit and ſo much
boldneſs, to offer them any ill language, I ſhould
certainly loſe my Cauſe, which if I ſhould be ſo
much a Fool to do, I ſhould ſoon alſo be made to
pay the coſts; and that if he ſhould hear the News,
that all this was come to paſs, he ſhould be the firſt
to ſay I was ſerv'd as I deſerv'd.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I was ſenſibly touch'd with this threat,
and endeavouring in my ſelf to excuſe the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this pretended Father-in-law, I told the
Meſſenger, perhaps he was not ſo much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57806:135"/>
on as I imagin'd; that perhaps the methods
he would uſe to aſſiſt me might be only intereſts, not
unjuſt; that ſuch men as they ſaw further into a
Cauſe than other People, and doubtleſs it was upon
that ſcore, that he pretended to be able to help me
in mine; on the other hand, 'twas not ſo ſtrange,
he ſhould demand for his recompence, that I ſhould
marry his Daughter; for 'tis fair every man ſhould
ask what wages he pleaſes for his pains; that in
this caſe, to ſay the truth, 'twould not be my giving
his Daughter a portion, but his Daughter giving me
an Eſtate, ſince without her I was juſt a going to be
not worth a groat. In ſhort, to ſay the truth, the
averſion I had for my Mother-in-law, reconcil'd me
to all the difficulties of this affair, more than I thought
'twas poſſible for me; ſo I told the man I would
venture, provided my Father-in-Law that was to be
was not Monſieur <hi>Genou,</hi> and that the Woman was
not infamous. I had an implacable enmity in my
mind againſt Monſieur <hi>Genou,</hi> for a piece of Injuſtice
that he did to ſome very honeſt Gentlemen of my
acquaintance, which I could not forgive him; and
he run ſo much in my head for a notorious fellow, I
would be ſure to avoid, that it put others out of
my memory, who were every jot as bad as himſelf;
the man taking it for granted the buſineſs was done,
names to me Monſieur <hi>de Canae,</hi> who was ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Villain as <hi>Genou,</hi> if not a worſe; the very name
made me cry out as if ſome ſudden diſaſter had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
me: The fellow perceiving his miſtake, and
that no good was like to come of it, bid me have a
care what I did, that the loſs of my Suit at Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon my managing this affair; that the young
Lady was a diſcreet perſon, and agreeable enough;
that to refuſe it now would make her Father out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57806:135"/>
and he would certainly be my Enemy, and ſo
I might only thank my ſelf, if my Cauſe miſcarry'd. I
reply'd, the thing muſt be as it pleas'd God, but I
could never conſent to be Son-in-Law to Monſieur <hi>de
Canae;</hi> that he might indeed make me loſe my Suit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blackening his Conſcience, ſince he had been guilty
before of ſo many Villanies, as had already brought
it to the colour of the Chimney; that I could not
but wonder he had not found the means, of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his Daughter, who by this time began to grow
ſomething ſtale; ſince without doubt he had many ſuch
affairs as mine in his way; and might find ſome Client
or other to make a Cully of; but it would not paſs
upon me.</p>
            <p>I ſaid too much indeed, conſidering I had a Suit
depending, and that he was one of the Judges, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
before a perſon he particularly employ'd
in ſuch under-hand practices; who having given him
an exact account of what I had ſaid, my Mother-in-Law
herſelf did not ſollicit her Cauſe, with ſo much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt me in publick, as he did in private. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
'twas to his advantage, that I refus'd his Daughter,
for he married her to Monſieur <hi>Montigni,</hi> Son to the
Governor of <hi>Diep,</hi> who was richer than I ſhould have
been, if I had recover'd my Eſtate; and this coſt him
nothing, but doing a little injuſtice for him, juſt as he
offer'd to me.</p>
            <p>However, I never repented that this Gentleman car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
away the Prize, for ſhe wears the Breeches man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and all that her Husband can do to ſhew that he
is Lord and Maſter, is that, when he pleaſes he will go
to <hi>Chartres</hi> and get drunk, becauſe ſhe won't ſuffer him
to have a drop of Wine at home. I ſuppoſe I may be
allow'd to mention this ſtory, that reflects on his Son-in-Law,
becauſe I have ſo much reaſon to hate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In ſhort, he was the occaſion that about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
after I loſt my Cauſe, and was condemn'd to pay
the charges, and ſince that I have not had an Enemy,
has done me half the miſchief which he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:57806:136"/>
The charges amounted to a huge ſumm, and my
Mother-in-Law who had no thoughts of favouring me,
took out Execution againſt me, at the perſwaſion of
Monſieur <hi>de Canae,</hi> and clapt me into Priſon, at the
time when I leaſt of all expected it: The ſumm was
no leſs than two thouſand livres, and money being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſcarce then, as well as now, I could meet with
never a friend, would help me to ſuch a ſumm: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
abundance of them came to ſee me, and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with me at the ingratitude of this woman, but that
was a ſmall relief to me, ſo I was forced to take it as
patiently as I could: I found in the Priſon, a great
many honeſt Gentlemen, whoſe misfortunes had
brought them into the ſame condition, but they were
not ſo much concerned at their afflictions, as I was at
mine, for I ſaw them ſeek all manner of ways to divert
themſelves, as if they had been at Liberty; but not
being of their humor, I ſpent my time in curſing of my
Judges, and railing at the times, in which there was ſo
little Juſtice to be had; and there being Spies there, as
well as in other places, they inform'd againſt me, ſo
from a Debtor, I was made a Criminal, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away to <hi>Pierre Enciſe.</hi> I was a long time before I
could gueſs what they were going to do with me, and
what I had done to deſerve this ſort of uſage; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
that I had ſpoken a little too freely of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Miniſter, I troubled my ſelf no further for a cauſe
of my removal; but the Crime being of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
they gave me liberty to walk abroad. The
other priſoners ſeeing a new comer, were very eager to
hear my ſtory; I made no difficulty of telling them all
the particulars, and proteſting my innocence, but I
found this was ſo common a tale in ſuch a place, that
they were all as innocent, as by their own accounts.
Among the reſt I found the Marquis <hi>de Freſne,</hi> whom
I had known well enough to give him more particular
reſpect, than the others, and on that account, I told
him my caſe ingenuouſly, and askt his advice what
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſe I ſhould take, to make ſatisfaction for my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence;
he told me, he knew not what to adviſe me
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57806:136"/>
to, in ſo nice an affair, and that he ſtood in as much
need himſelf, his misfortune coming from a like cauſe:
He ſurpriz'd me in ſaying ſo, having always been told
'twas for endeavouring to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell away his Wife to ſome
Pyrates, and I could not forbear telling him what I
had heard; he anſwer'd, that ſince I had been ſo ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
he would acquaint me in a few words, with his
true Hiſtory. Having no great matter of buſineſs in ſuch
a place, I was as willing to hear this adventure, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it muſt be extraordinary, as he could be to relate
it: So we ſat down on a bank, upon the Platform where
we was walking, and he told me, That before he was
married, he was paſſionately in love with her, who
was now his Wife, that tho 'twas his conſtant maxim,
that Daughters took always after their Mothers, and
that he knew well enough what was the manner of her
Mother, yet it ſpite of his own-notions, he was ſuch a
fool to fall into the ſnare, and after having try'd all
poſſible means to enjoy her, and finding them ineffectual
but by marrying her, reſolv'd to ſatisfy his inclination
at any rate; ſo he ask'd her Mothers conſent, which
the old woman, not caring to part with her money, had
refus'd him; that this repulſe had but encreaſed their
paſſion on both ſides, ſo that they reſolv'd to do it
without her; upon which he had taken her away, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
goten a Prieſt ready to marry them, this oblig'd the
old Gentlewoman to give her conſent; that upon this
he thought himſelf the happieſt man in the World.
But this happineſs laſted no longer than three months,
when Monſieur <hi>de Ecuilli,</hi> his Brother, fell in love with
his Wife, and ſhe with him, and that they manag'd this
with ſo little prudence, that he cou'd not but perceive
it preſently, and was ſo enrag'd at it, that he was ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times tempted to diſpatch 'em both; but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what a noiſe ſuch an action wou'd make in the
World, he thought of ſome other method, and the
more, becauſe, as falſe as ſhe was, he cou'd not bring
himſelf to that degree of hatred againſt his Wife; but
having not the ſame tenderneſs for his Brother, reſolv'd
to fight him, upon pretence of ſome Eſtate that was to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57806:137"/>
be divided, and about which they had formerly had
ſome words, and to urge him to it, he had frequently
taken occaſion to diſcourſe about that concern; but
that the love he had privately for his Wife, caus'd him
to take all the reproaches he made him without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
It madded him ſo much the more to ſee his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
policy, in avoiding all occaſions of quarrel, and
he was loth to fight him without ſome apparent cauſe;
but a circumſtance which he happened to be an Eye-witneſs
to, made him change his deſign of fighting him,
into a reſolution of diſpatching him by a ſurer way;
for one day coming unexpectedly into her Chamber, he
had ſurpriz'd them in the fact, and before he entred the
Room had overheard them plotting together to aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
him: that his Brother ſeeing him coming in,
made as if he had been only toying with her, and he
on his part made as if he believ'd it, that he might not
give them any cauſe of miſtruſt; and ſo they parted
from one another, without any words of the matter,
but with the more reſentment in their Hearts: For in
ſhort, he for his part had appointed one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
whom he knew he could truſt, to ſhoot him as
he was a Hunting, and his Brother at the ſame time,
had hir'd ſome Souldiers to do as much for him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it fell out ſo, that neither part was perform'd,
and yet the deſign on both ſides became publick, and
made a great noiſe in the World. His Servant in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
had taken ſuch groſs meaſures, that he had as
good have betray'd his Maſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for he made him be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and that perfectly loſt him the favour of the
King, and alſo was taken to be done upon account of
private intereſt, and not from his jealouſy; that after
this his Brother having not opportunity as formerly
with his Wife, and ſhe being not of an inclination to
be content without a Gallant, e'n entertain'd them,
where ſhe could find them, according to the cuſtom of
her Family; that among others ſhe happen'd upon one
who was a Perſon of great Credit at Court, who being in
his young Blood, gave himſelf up to his pleaſures, tho
at the ſame time, he had great employments, in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57806:137"/>
State. He told me, that their behaviour was alſo ſo
notorious, that he could not refrain taking notice of
it, and reflecting upon the Perſon, which ſoon came to
his Ears, and there began his ruin. The Perſon howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deferr'd his revenge, becauſe the World would ſay,
'twas too hard to kiſs the Wife, and quarrel with the
Husband; and waited only for an opportunity, which
he was not long without. <hi>De Freſne</hi> could not bear
the mocks and reproaches he met with in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
on this occaſion, and therefore reſolv'd when this
Courtier ſhould be abſent, he would take an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to convey his Wife away. To prevent all ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this, he made as if he would be reconcil'd to her,
and became ſo kind to her, that ſhe was perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
and was as forward for going as he; finding
her in ſo good a humour, he took her at her word, and
taking the Road to <hi>Lyons,</hi> he carry'd her into <hi>Provence,</hi>
with a deſign to have ſhipt her on board ſome of the
<hi>Levant</hi> Pyrates, and ſo to have ſold her, having bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
with a Captain of ſuch a Veſſel for that purpoſe:
But he had been ſo unfortunate, that his Wife had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
as it were by a miracle, and that inſtead of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himſelf of a Whore, he had got the name of a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
and a Raſcal, for attempting it; upon which her
Gallant, who, as has been ſaid, waited for a pretence to
ruin him, has laid hold of this, and had effectually lodg'd
him in that place, which was hardly ſo grievous to him
as the ſcandal; that his Wife having procur'd a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to furniſh her with money to carry her back to
<hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe had been ſo baſe, as to force him to go to
Law with her for it, before ſhe would reimburſe, and
this came before the Parliament, where the ſaid Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
was oblig'd to tell the whole ſtory, to ſet forth
the neceſſity ſhe was in of the money, and to aggravate
the ingratitude of it; for indeed he had a great deal of
reaſon to complain of her uſage, after having done her
ſuch a remarkable kindneſs; and tho, as he told me, he
ow'd this Merchant a great deal of ill will, for not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Wife where he found her, yet he could not
but acknowledge, ſhe was very ungrateful to cheat him
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57806:138"/>
of his Money, upon pretence, as ſhe pleaded, that ſhe
was under the Covert of a Husband, and ſo had no
power to make an Obligation.</p>
            <p>Tho I knew a great part of this Hiſtory before, yet I
would not interrupt him; and he told me ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that I did not know before, as that he was in
Priſon for having diſoblig'd his Wives Gallant. This
ſtory made me reflect on my condition, as not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo unhappy as ſome perſons, ſince I had never been
marry'd; and gave me ſo great an averſion to that Sex,
that I made a Vow never to have to do with any of
them. I liv'd three years in this <hi>Pierre Enciſe,</hi> without
ſo much as hearing either of Friend or Foe, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my ſelf confin'd for term of Life, I grew ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and it ſo alter'd me, that people did not know
me; and the more I reflected upon my miſery, the
more it afflicted me: Sometimes calling to mind my
old Maſter, the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu,</hi> I more paſſionately
bewail'd that loſs, than ever Lover did that of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.
In ſhort, having paſt my time in this condition,
with how much ſatisfaction you may eaſily imagin, the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> Brother to the Mareſchal <hi>de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi>
who acted as Lieutenant of the Province, ſent me
word, that I might go abroad when I pleas'd, for his
Majeſty had given me the bounds of the City, only for
my Priſon. I return'd him my thanks, as if the favour had
come immediately from himſelf; and he was vain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to accept my Complement, as if it had been his
due. I had been maintain'd at the King's charge all the
while I continu'd at <hi>Pierre Enciſe,</hi> and by that means
had a little Arrears of my Rent due to me, with which
I made ſhift to pay my Mother-in-law, and had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in my Pocket; and now I began to reſolve upon
being a good Husband, ſeeing to what I had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
for want of two hundred Piſtoles, to pay thoſe
pitiful Charges. But whatever Reſolutions a Man may
make, it is impoſſible to avoid one's Deſtiny. The
Archbiſhop, having taken me with him a hunting, to
his Houſe at <hi>Nimis,</hi> which he had lately call'd <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villi,</hi>
notwithſtanding he had told me, I ſhould not go
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57806:138"/>
out of the City; when we came back we muſt needs go to
play, and my Complaiſance there coſt me all the Money I
had in the World. Being in a rage at ſuch a misfortune,
it made me reflect upon the Life of this Man, whoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
was ſo wide of his Profeſſion. Indeed he was a
Military Archbiſhop, and was ſurrounded with Guards,
inſtead of Prieſts; following the Stag at the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls of
fifty couple of Hounds, rather than following the
Croſs; making good Chear, inſtead of Faſting; boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, and magnifying the Grandeurs of the Court,
rather than practicing, or preaching Humility; and in
ſhort, he governed the City of <hi>Lyons</hi> at ſuch a rate, that
he ſeemed rather a Tyrant than an Archbiſhop. I ſaw
before my Eyes a thing no leſs ſtrange than true: He
would ſend every now and then for the Magiſtrates of
the Town, upon pretence of having received ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from Court; and if he told them, that his Brother
the Mareſchal had ſent him word he had loſt a ſumm of
Money, they durſt do no leſs than make him a Preſent
of as much the next morning; this was the Price of
his Protection, and this coſt me, as well as others, who
had Demands upon the Bank, one quarter part of my
Rent; for having thus exhauſted the Town by this ſort
of Contribution, if I may be allowed that term, he
was oblig'd to ſollicit a Warrant from the Council,
which reduc'd the Rents to three quarters the value.</p>
            <p>Having loſt all my Money, the Archbiſhop ſent me
word, he had Orders from Court to diſcharge me; ſo
I was at my liberty to go whither I pleas'd; this was
the unhappieſt piece of good news to me that could be,
now I might go about my buſineſs, I had no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
left; ſo I was fain to continue in my old quarters
till I had recruited a little, and paſs'd away my time
there as well as I could. I had accidental converſe
with abundance of Strangers, for my Lodging being at
a Publick Houſe, and that City ſtanding on a very
great Road into many Provinces, we had new faces
came every day to quarter there as they travell'd, and
their ſort of Converſation I found very diverting; and
that for a man who had no great, but a ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57806:139"/>
ſuch a ſort of life was not very diſagreeable:
Among the reſt, there came to lodge there one Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>St. Sylveſtre,</hi> an Officer of ſome Note in the Army,
I did not know him, but his humour, as well as mine,
being free and eaſy to be acquainted, we ſoon fell into
Company together; he came from his Regiment, which
I think was quarter'd in Garriſons in <hi>Franche Comte;</hi>
and having fallen into the Company of a Gentleman of
that City, call'd <hi>Servietes,</hi> (Father to him who has the
fine Cabinet) This Gentleman came to him to invite
him to Supper; <hi>St. Sylveſtre</hi> asking him leave to bring
me along with him, he was too much a Gentleman to
refuſe; and I went very freely. After Supper he askt
us if we would play a Game at <hi>Tric-Trac;</hi> I took him
at firſt word, being pretty well acquainted with that
Game. We play<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d but for half a Piſtole an end, and
Fortune ſtood ſo neuter among us, that we play'd above
four hours before any one of us had loſt a whole one,
and they both crying out we muſt not part ſo, truly we
play'd on till eight a clock the next morning, and by
that time I had the good luck to have won an hundred
Piſtoles; the Cornet being quite overcome with ſleep,
told me, he demanded quarter, for he could hold up
no longer: I told him, it was for him to order that as
he pleas'd; for that tho I had every jot as much an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to ſleep as he, yet I would not leave off firſt,
becauſe I had gain'd; ſo being both agreed we left off
play, under an agreement to go to it again after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
ſo we lay down on the Bed, and having ſlept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four or five hours, they brought us ſome Soup,
and then we went to play more vigorouſly than before,
and Fortune continuing to favour me, I won five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtoles; at laſt, conſidering he could never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo great a ſumm, and that we ſhould be likely to play
all night again, he deſir'd me to play him three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtoles a ſet, for three times running: I agreed
to it immediately, and won the two firſt currently,
but then fortune turning upon me, I loſt two more as
quick; ſo that being juſt where we began, we agreed
to our three Sets again; theſe Games were more tedious
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57806:139"/>
than the other, both ſides playing with more caution;
but I had the worſt of it at laſt, ſo that I was come to
two hundred Piſtoles, which was all I had left, and ſo
we gave over play. This was no inconſiderable ſumm for
the ſmall Game we began at, nevertheleſs he had once
loſt eight hundred Piſtoles, by which we may ſee there
is nothing ſo dangerous as play.</p>
            <p>This comforted me for my loſs with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
and having got Money enough to carry me
to <hi>Paris,</hi> I took my leave of him. It was a good while
before I durſt ſhow my ſelf at Court, for I took it for
granted, I ſhould not be lookt upon very well, after
this laſt affair of mine. Indeed we were got into
an age, where the Miniſters expected as much reverence
as if they had been Petty Gods, and tho they could
pretend to no more merit than uſual, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make private Gentlemen ſhow them as much
reſpect, as Princes of the Blood: I went never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
to viſit Mr. <hi>de Surenne,</hi> who I knew carry'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
after another manner; for as he came of a better
Family, than any of them could pretend to, ſo he was
much the more courteous and affable. I had the
honour to know him at Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s, and had
ſeen him ſeveral times ſince that; he receiv'd me indeed
with all that Civility which is ſo natural to him,
and telling me that he was better pleas'd to ſee me
there than at <hi>Pierre Enciſe,</hi> ask'd me the particulars
of that affair, I told him I had a great deal
of trouble in it indeed: That the Cardinal had
done by me as the Ape does by her young ones; for
by loving me too much, he had been the cauſe of
the ruine of my fortune; for if he had left me
to follow the Profeſſion of Arms which I had choſen,
I had in all probability been in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that the War was my Inclination, and that
had made me fall into it again under Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine;</hi>
that Fortune had however ſeem'd to croſs my
Undertakings, yet I was reſolv'd to try her again; that
on the other hand, I was now of an age which ſeem'd
more to require Eaſe than a New Apprenticeſhip; yet
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57806:140"/>
I could not but tell him, if he had occaſion for an old
<hi>Aid du Camp,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, I ſhould think my
ſelf very well accommodated; that my young blood
was ſufficiently temper'd by my afflictions, he need not
be afraid I ſhould ruine things by my raſhneſs; that I
thankt God my mind was ſtay'd and ſettled now; and
yet when I was once a Horſeback, I was as capable
of undertaking the fatigues of the War, as I was at five
and twenty, which he ſhould find if he pleas'd to make
uſe of me.</p>
            <p>I made him laugh with the manner in which I offer'd
him my ſervice; and taking me at my w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd, he told
me, he would appoint me a Comrade, who, tho he
was not ſo old as I, ſhould have no need of inſtructions;
he meant one <hi>Clodore,</hi> who had been Captain in an old
Regiment, and was one that I knew very well, which
pleas'd me ſo much the better. This Man, tho he was
very well known for his Merits in ſeveral occaſions, yet
he was more known by ſomething elſe, not ſo much to
his advantage; he had the misfortune to have a Jilt to
his Wife, and one time as he was coming from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
one of his Friends having oblig'd him to bear him
company to a Houſe of ill repute, his Wife, who in his
abſence took occaſion to divert herſelf that way, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
to be one of the perſons produc'd for their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
You may judge how diſturbing an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of this nature muſt be to a man of his Spirit;
he did not only handle her very roughly upon the
place, but ſecur'd her, and put her into a Convent;
and yet quickly after, by a ſurprizing turn of his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
eſpecially for one who had always been lookt
upon as a Man of Honour, he chang'd his mind, took
her back again, and now actually lives with her. This
had been a great Diſadvantage to him, for he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
banter'd for it among the Souldiers; ſo that if
I had been a marry'd man, I ſhould not have car'd to
have joyn'd with him, for fear they ſhould have ſaid
we were Comrades in every thing; he was overjoy'd,
as he ſaid, to ſee that I would ſerve again; ſo we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
our Equipage together, in order to make the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57806:140"/>
Campaign in <hi>Holland,</hi> which prov'd ſo glorious.</p>
            <p>Since the King had been marry'd we had ſeveral ſhort
Campaigns on every ſide, but the Forces of the Kingdom
were never all of them employ'd, except it were in
that of <hi>Liſle;</hi> the King had never engag'd any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of great Reputation in thoſe little Expeditions,
ſo that their failures made thoſe great men to be the
more eſteem'd. But having now to do with the moſt
flouriſhing Republick, and whoſe Wealth went beyond
moſt of the greateſt Monarchs, he made choice of the
two greateſt Captains of Chriſtendom, the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne.</hi> The Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> undertook this charge with a great deal of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
having receiv'd ſeveral Mortifications ſince his
return from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſt; for except it was in
the year 1668, when they made uſe of him for the
Conqueſt of the <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> they made no Eſteem
of him; and this great Employment happen'd to him,
more from the Marquis <hi>de Lovoys</hi> Jealouſy of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> than any reſpect to the Prince, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the great Actions he had done. The
occaſion of this Jealouſy in the Marquis <hi>de Lovoys</hi> was,
that during the Campaign of <hi>Liſle,</hi> he thought the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
had the Kings Ear to his prejudice; and ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this great man he brought the other into play,
who had been as it were, confin'd to his Houſe at <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilli,</hi>
and had receiv'd ſeveral affronts. Indeed this was
to be taken notice of, that when the King ſent ſome
Troops into <hi>Hungary,</hi> the command of them was given
to his Couſin, the Count <hi>de Coligny,</hi> only to ſpight him,
becauſe they two were at Enmity, and becauſe every
body does not know this circumſtance, it may not be
improper to relate it.</p>
            <p>In the year 1660, as I take it, the King being to
make ſeveral Knights of the Order, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
had the Nomination of one, and the Count <hi>de Coligny</hi>
made no queſtion, but he ſhould be the man, becauſe
of the many obligations the Prince had to him, or at
leaſt it ſhould have been the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who
was then call'd the Count <hi>de Bouteville;</hi> and indeed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57806:141"/>
'twas thought the Prince would have certainly have
preferr'd one of thoſe two, as well upon the account of
their quality, as that they both belong'd to him; but
he having nam'd his Favourite <hi>Guitaut</hi> to that Honour,
as it were over their Heads, the Count <hi>de Coligny</hi> was
ſo ſcandaliz'd at it, that he went to him immediately,
and threw up his Commiſſion of Captain Lieutenant of
his <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> and the ſame time told him, that he
did not deſerve what he had done for him; that he had
left one of the beſt Offices in the Kings Houſhold to
follow his fortune, and in return of all, he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
before him a man that he could not ſo much as
call a Gentleman; that he had Children, and if ever he
ſhould live to ſee them grown up, he would ſooner
piſtol them with his own hand, than they ſhould ever
engage in any ſervice but the King's. 'Twas the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi>'s character, that he was not the moſt patient
man in the world, but whether 'twas that he conſider'd
he had wrong'd the Count, or that he was willing to
regain him by any means, he treated him very civilly,
and told him, he had no reaſon to be in ſuch a paſſion;
ſince if he had nam'd <hi>Guitaut,</hi> in prejudice of the
Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> and himſelf, 'twas becauſe, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
their quality would, ſome time or other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it for themſelves, which <hi>Guitaut</hi> could not hope
for from the meanneſs of his; that if he had known
they would have taken it ſo ill, he ſhould perhaps have
taken other meaſures; that they ſhould therefore be
ſatisfy'd, and it ſhould be no fault of his, if they were
not better pleas'd for the future. Tho this was a great
deal to come from the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who did not
uſe to be ſo complaiſant, yet the Count <hi>de Coligny</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from him in a paſſion, and was far enough from
any reconciliation.</p>
            <p>This was the chief reaſon, as I noted before, for which
they gave him the command of the Troops that were
ſent into <hi>Hungary;</hi> which ſo madded the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> that if he had not retir'd to <hi>Chantilli,</hi> where he
had leiſure to give vent to his paſſion, he had certainly
dy'd with the Grief of it: Here he continu'd a long
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57806:141"/>
time, under pretence of being troubled with the Gout.</p>
            <p>But when the King ſaw himſelf entring upon a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
War, he chang'd his carriage to him, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with all the Careſſes imaginable; and ſhutting
up himſelf in the Cabinet with him and the Viſcount
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> he ſpent ſeveral whole days with thoſe two
great men, to take his meaſures for the enſuing War from
their known Experience. I ſhall not take upon me to
relate the ſucceſs of that Campaign, it would be too
affected for <hi>Memoirs;</hi> beſides the whole World is full
with the remarkable Hiſtory of it: Only this I ſhall
ſay, that the Enemy being at a diſtance, we took our
own time, and made but very ſlow footſteps at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this War. The Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who
foreſaw what would happen, told the King, that
'twould not be always thus, and that if he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
more vigorouſly, he would find himſelf in an error.
The King had a great confidence in Monſieur <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
but the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who, to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
had indeed the direction of the Army, had no
ſooner diſcourſt the King about it, but his Majeſty quite
alter'd his mind; ſo that <hi>Turenne</hi> finding he could do
nothing with the King by his advices, having not the
good fortune to be believ'd, let them take their own
courſe without troubling himſelf about them. In the
mean time I had my Office of <hi>Aid du Camp,</hi> which was
eaſy enough to me; and when I thought leaſt of it,
they were pleas'd to change my quality, and miſtake
me for a General, coming to me for Certificates. The
Duke <hi>de Longueville</hi> had a great many Gentlemen in his
Retinue, and amongſt the reſt the Chevalier <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevreuil,</hi>
Brother to him who is now Colonel of the
King's Regiment; he was a very compleat Gentleman,
and had been very fortunate with the Ladies; for the
Duke's Mother lov'd him at that rate, that one day when
he came back from the Army, ſhe her ſelf helpt to
pull off his Boots, which was ſuppos'd to be, that he
might the ſooner be ready to ſerve her in another way;
beſides this, he was very much in the favour of ſeveral
other Ladies; inſomuch, that if he had not ruin'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57806:142"/>
by gaming, he might have been in a very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but he would play away all that ever came near
him, whether 'twas his own or no; and one time he
loſt all the Advance Money of the Regiment of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
which was put into his hands for Recruits. He
had often practis'd theſe tricks, ſo that he had not only
loſt his Reputation, but in ſome meaſure his ſences;
for he ſaw himſelf reduc'd at laſt, to ſuch extremities,
that even diſtracted him; yet for all this he could not
leave off Play. He was no ſooner gotten into
<hi>Holland,</hi> but he begun afreſh, and his old ill fortune
continuing, he loſt every penny he had; which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his old diſtemper upon him, he became perfectly
mad, and a Fever ſeizing him with it, in few days
carry'd him out of the world. The Duke, his Maſter,
did not ſurvive him long, for getting ſome Wine in his
head, in the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Camp, juſt before he paſt
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he made that fooliſh ſtep which coſt his own
life, and the lives of a great many brave Gentlemen.
There being but a little time between both their Deaths,
the Relations of the Chevalier <hi>de Monchevreuil</hi> came to
me, to deſire me to write to my Acquaintance in their
Country, that he dy'd for Grief at the loſs of ſo good a
Maſter. 'Twas a very pleaſant Requeſt, when I knew
that they carry'd him to <hi>Nuits</hi> the day after we entred
<hi>Rhineberg,</hi> which was at leaſt four or five days before
we paſt the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but feigning my ſelf ignorant, I told
them I would do ſo to oblige them, tho I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
that he was ſick before. I could not imagin,
what ſhould make them deſire this piece of ſervice of
me, except it was, that they had a mind to conceal the
nature of his Death, to avoid a blemiſh upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
but they had another reaſon, for he having
play'd away a great many peoples money, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make them believe they had receiv'd it again, after
his Death, than that he dy'd for Grief at the loſing of
it; and after all, 'twas a fineneſs that I could never
underſtand, for let it be which way 'twould, 'twas of
no great conſequence; and on the other hand, they
might be ſure to expect, that thoſe perſons would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57806:142"/>
their money; but the eldeſt Sons Eſtate was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd,
who was the only perſon they could expect it of;
and if Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> had delay'd much longer to
take care of that Family, they had been ſo far from
paying Debts, that they had been reduc'd into very
bad circumſtances. I can't be thought to ſpeak this
enviouſly to leſſen his quality, if you will but conſider
what I have ſaid of my ſelf, they may ſee I do not
flatter; and if it ſhould ever come to paſs, that
I ſhould be as rich as the greateſt, I ſhould never be for
boaſting of it. I did not indeed inquire of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
what their end was, but thoſe people to whom
I wrote, wonder'd what the meaning of it ſhould be;
for coming preſently after to underſtand that he dy'd
diſtracted, his Relations immediately concluded that I
was the cauſe of it, and upon that account ow'd me all
the ill will poſſible; however not one of them had the
impudence to charge me with it; but as they were near
Neighbours to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> is famous for
Treachery, they did their utmoſt to ruin me; and if
Madam <hi>de Maintenon</hi> had been in as much favour as ſhe
is now, they might eaſily have done it, and the beſt I
could have hop'd for, had been to have ſpent my life in
the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> but to my great good fortune her credit
was not ſo great at that time, and ſo all they could do
was to make Grimaces at me. The truth of it was, I
never ſought to diſabuſe them, but taking not a word
of notice, either good or bad, I let them alone to do their
worſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time our Army gain'd ground in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and having paſt the <hi>Rhine,</hi> we came to the <hi>Iyſel,</hi> and
paſſing alſo that River, laid ſiege to <hi>Doesbourg.</hi> The
Duke <hi>de Orleans,</hi> the King's Brother, was in the Army,
and his Birth requiring, that he ſhould have the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
command, next to his Majeſty, he march'd on one
ſide the River, and the King on the other. He had
nothing of the Air and Mein of the King; as much as
one was majeſtick, ſo much the other had of meanneſs
in his Countenance, and in his Manners; he had the
very Looks of a Woman, and painted like the Sex,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57806:143"/>
which he did, becauſe 'twas ſaid he had a Tetter upon
his Cheek, and he would have been very much disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd
without it, which might be; but if he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
on that account, yet he was inexcuſable in
another, for he wore a Cornet in bed, like a Woman,
inſtead of a Night Cap, not forgetting a Scarlet
Knot, and a Riband of the ſame to tye it under his Chin.
'Tis true, he was ſo aſham'd of it himſelf, that he would
make all withdraw when he went to put it on; but as
always there was ſome Valet, or ſome Favourite, that
had acceſs to him, the ſtory became ſo publick over
<hi>Paris,</hi> that all people knew it, and 'twas neceſſary he
ſhould be very brave to have all theſe failings, and yet
pleaſe the <hi>French,</hi> who are very nice and cenſorious;
but indeed he wanted not that quality, for he who
avoided the Sun, for fear of his Complexion, would at
the ſame time expoſe himſelf to Fire, fearleſs of Death.
In ſhort, he laid hold of all occaſions to ſignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which was not very pleaſing to his Favourite the
Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> not ſo much out of tenderneſs of
his Maſter, as of that ſhare he was oblig'd to take in the
danger; for tho he had acquir'd ſome reputation at Sea,
ſome years ſince, when with the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> and
another, they ventur'd in a ſmall Shallop to burn a great
Ship of the Enemies; they will have it, that he did it
rather by the excitement of others, than any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had to ſuch actions: This was ſomething
ſtrange for one, that was Son to one of the greateſt
Captains, and one of the braveſt Souldiers we have had
a great while; this made me believe, that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
ſpread abroad of him, was nothing but Lies;
but tho I was ſo charitable, the truth was too plain to
be conceal'd, for the next year at the Siege of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi>
he behav'd himſelf ſo in the ſight of the whole
Army, that there was no more queſtion to be made of
his Cowardice. But to return to the Siege of <hi>Does<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg;</hi>
Monſieur <hi>Martinet,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> and
Collonel of the Kings Regiment, was very unhappily
kill'd in the Trenches, by a Cannon-ſhot which came
from the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s quarter. The King was
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57806:143"/>
exceedingly troubled at it, for he had indeed been very
ſerviceable in the Army, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing the firſt that put the
Infantry into that Order and Diſcipline which we now
ſee among them; but the Souldiers, who like Brutes, that
know not what is good for themſelves, diſlik'd him for
his Severity, and were ſo far from regretting his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that they rather rejoyc'd at it. I may ſay too, that
a great many of the Officers were not ſorry for it, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
the innovations in their Diſcipline to him;
which tho they depriv'd them of ſome advantages they
us'd to make, yet were really very much for the ſervice
of the King: However their Joy did them no ſervice,
for things did not return to their old condition again
at the Death of <hi>Martinet;</hi> the Court too well approv'd
of his Maxims not to continue the practice. The King,
deſiring to give the command of his own Regiment to
one who ſhould be capable of following his ſteps,
refus'd it to ſeveral perſons of great quality, who made
their Court to him for it, and gave it to the Count <hi>de
Montbron,</hi> who was but a private Gentleman, but who
was already at the Head of the ſecond Company of the
Grand Muſqueteers, and whoſe fortune had rais'd him
to that Poſt, againſt the expectations even of all the
world, as well as his own. Indeed tho he had merit,
yet that was a place which was not to be obtain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
favour too, and both little enough to gain it: He
had ſerv'd at firſt in the Regiment of <hi>Picardy,</hi> where he
was a Captain; after which he was made Under-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
in Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Company of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers.
The Cardinal dying, the King took that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
which was then called <hi>les Petits Mouſquetairs,</hi>
till ſuch time as <hi>Colbert Maulivriere</hi> bought them of
Monſieur <hi>de Marſac,</hi> who then had the command of
them; the name of the Company was then chang'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and call'd the Second Company of the Grand
Muſqueteers, which was done by the favour of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Colbert</hi> his Brother; in the mean time Monſieur <hi>de
Caſſau,</hi> who dy'd Governor of <hi>Bergues,</hi> was before
Mr. <hi>de Montbron,</hi> having always commanded this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
under Mr. <hi>de Marſac;</hi> he ſeeing Mr. <hi>de Montbron</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:57806:144"/>
put in over him, thought he had injuſtice done him, and
ſo gave up his Commiſſion, at the ſame time that Mr. <hi>de
Montbron</hi> had the guard of Madam <hi>De Pleſſis Belliere,</hi>
who was confin'd upon the account of Monſieur <hi>de
Fouquett;</hi> this was the beginning of his good fortune,
which afterwards was enc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eas'd by the affair of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Colbert Maulivriere,</hi> who ſwelling with Pride to
ſee his Brother ſo near the King, reſign'd his Poſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they refus'd him a conſiderable Government which
he would have bought; and Monſieur <hi>de Montbron,</hi>
who had wiſely made his Court to the Marquis <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois,</hi>
got leave to treat with him about it, and having
marry'd a rich Wife he was the better able to compaſs
it.</p>
            <p>By theſe degrees he came to be what we now ſee him,
and the King having given him his Regiment, and at
the ſame time having made him Brigadier of Foot, he
quitted the Muſqueteers to ſerve at the Head of thoſe
Troops. I was overjoy'd that the King had made choice
of him for a Poſt ſo conſiderable, and having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
one of his friends, I was one of the firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
him; he receiv'd me very kindly, and told
me he had formerly been oblig'd to me, and ſhould be
very glad of an opportunity to ſerve me; I told him
that 'twas now in his power to do it, if he pleas'd, that
I had a Nephew, my Siſters Son, who was in the firſt
Company of Muſqueteers, for whom I would beg a
Lieutenants place of him, if he had a Vacancy in his
Regiment; or if not, the next that ſhould happen; he
granted it me immediately, and the gentile manner of
his doing it, oblig'd me more than the Gift it ſelf; for
he went himſelf to Mr. <hi>de Louvois,</hi> making the affair
his own, and telling him a thouſand things in favour of
my Nephew, tho he had never ſeen him in his Life. That
which made him ſo very hearty to me was, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
while he was not ſo great, I did him a very good

that ſhe had indeed ſuch a Fortune, he had
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57806:144"/>
propos'd to marry her. I happen'd once to go and ſee
this Lady, but without any deſign in the world but to
divert my ſelf in the Company, which was generally of
the beſt; ſhe having put a little confidence in me more
than ordinary, deſir'd me one time very ſeriouſly, to
give her my opinion of the Count <hi>de Montbron,</hi> and of
his Eſtate; I told her, that for his perſon I could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
her preſently, but for the other I deſir'd a little
time; that he was a Man of Honour, and deſerv'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
well, and that in general I knew he had
a good Eſtate, but in two or three days I would tell
her more particularly. I went preſently to the Count
himſelf, and inform'd him of this converſation, and
deſir'd him to inſtruct me what I ſhould ſay; and he
giving me my Leſſon in Writing, I did all I could to
bring about the buſineſs; but we had to deal with a
Fool, who was yet not ſo eaſy to be manag'd as we
thought for. She had amus'd a dozen people at leaſt
at this rate, and while thus ſhe talkt of Marriage with
all the world, there were ſome certain Sparks, who
without troubling themſelves with thoſe things, had
found out a way to come directly to the point, and
conſummate without Matrimony. She was both old
and ugly, and but that ſhe was a good Pay-miſtreſs,
would have had but few Cuſtomers; yet by the help
of her Money ſhe found ſome who had ſtomach enough
to be concern'd with her, and they had ſo drein'd her,
that now, if ſhe could find a fair motion to a Husband,
there would be no great difficulty in the bargain.</p>

               <hi>Souris,</hi> Major of a Regiment of

General, he being oblig'd to command in the room of
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who acted with a ſeparate Army,
and was wounded in paſſing the <hi>Rhine.</hi> We took
Towns faſter than we could march to them, for we no
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57806:145"/>
ſooner came before a Town but we found the Gates o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
or at leaſt they made us no reſiſtance, ſo that we
took an infinite number of places, and excepting a little
oppoſition we met with at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> we could hardly
perceive there was any War; the reaſon why the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were in ſuch ſtrange confuſion was, the Diviſions
which were amongſt themſelves, beſides that, they had
no aſſiſtance at all from their Confederates, who ſeeing
the Kings Army ſo powerful, durſt not give him the
leaſt ſhadow of diſguſt, for fear he ſhould fall upon
them; 'twas in ſhort a very lamentable thing to ſee the
condition they were reduc'd to, and not eaſily to be
expreſt, but you may gueſs at ſomething of it by this,
their State was ſo perplext, that they entertain'd any
thing that offer'd to ſerve, if there were but the bare
looks of a man. Upon which I have heard a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
ſtory of an <hi>Italian,</hi> who offer'd his ſervice to the
Penſioner of <hi>Holland</hi> to raiſe a Company, who being
examin'd if he had been a Soldier, and whence he was,
and the like, after giving anſwer to thoſe queſtions,
he draws out his Sword, and tilting at the Wall,
ſhow'd them that he was a brisk fellow; but the jeſt of
the caſe lay here, the Penſioner having objected, that he
was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and conſequently a Papiſt: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>I am ſo, ſince you muſt know it, but this Sword is a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and ready to ſerve the States and your Lordſhip.</hi> The
Penſioner lik'd his blunt way of anſwering ſo well, that
inſtead of a Company, which he askt, he made him Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Collonel of a Regiment; but he had no ſooner fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
the Money than he ran away, and never rais'd a Man.</p>
            <p>The Enemy being often thus cheated, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of their affairs encreaſing daily, began to think
that a Peace, however diſadvantageous it might be,
would be leſs ſo than the War; by which in leſs than a
month, they had loſt three whole Provinces: This was
the opinion of ſome of the more timerous people, but
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was of another mind, and to that
end diſpatcht his Courriers to his Uncle, the Marquis of
<hi>Brandenburg,</hi> to remonſtrate the ſtate of affairs to him,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd how it was his intereſt to joyn his Forces with the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57806:145"/>
States; that we took indifferently his Towns and theirs,
all was alike to us. Tho the King was ſerv'd the beſt,
and moſt exactly in the world, yet his Spies, who he
kept in that Country, gave him no account of this, till
eight days at leaſt, after the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne</hi> had
advis'd him of it. I know not by what means he got
this news, but he came himſelf to the King about it,
and informing his Majeſty of what he had heard, told
him, Now was the time for him to make a Peace, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
to his advantage; by which, at leaſt, he might
demoliſh the greateſt part of the Towns he had taken,
and keep his Army entire to oppoſe his Enemies. The
King would have the opinion of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
upon this affair; and having ſent a Courrier to <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
whether he was carry'd to be cur'd of the Hurt he had
received, the Prince immediately gave the ſame advice.
The King ſaw of himſelf the neceſſity of their advice,
yet could not take their Counſel; for having left all
things to the management of the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi>
who thought he knew more than both of them, he let
ſlip the opportunity, being lull'd aſleep by that Miniſter,
with the hopes of eaſily defeating all the Contrivances
of the <hi>Germans:</hi> And as generally one error draws on
another, eſpecially with thoſe that will never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
themſelves in the wrong, they ſtaid till th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors
appear'd in the Field, and more from other parts,
and never follow'd that advice, till it came to the laſt
extremity. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Viſcount <hi>de
Turenne</hi> were very much diſoblig'd to ſee the Marquis
<hi>de Louvois</hi> harken'd to, ſo much to their Diſhonour, and
the Damage of the King's Affairs; and if <hi>Louvois</hi> had
not made up this Miſcarriage by extraordinary Services,
perhaps the King had not been ſo well ſatisfy'd with
him, as we now ſee him.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> being come before <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
ſent to compliment the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and to know how
he did, as to his Wounds; and tho the Meſſage ſeem'd
to belong rather to a Domeſtick, than an <hi>Aid du Camp,</hi>
yet he was pleas'd to confer that honour upon me, as
well to ſhow that Civility to me, as that I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57806:146"/>
of ſome other affaairs. I found him very much
out of order with the hurt he had receiv'd, inſomuch
that in ſpeaking to me, he was fain to interrupt his
diſcourſe by the pain of his Wound, which occaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d
me to cut ſhort my diſcourſe as much as was poſſible;
and juſt as I took my leave of him, the Duke of <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburgh</hi>
came into his Chamber; they had told him in
the Anti-chamber how bad he was, at which he put on
an air of concern and ſorrow, and entering the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in a fantaſtick manner, or rather like a Fool, <hi>Fructus
Belli, Monſieur,</hi> begins he, <hi>Fructus Belli,</hi> and repeating
thoſe words at leaſt a dozen times, he comes up to the
Bed, without making him any other Compliment. I
would have ſtaid a little longer in the Chamber to ſee
the end of this Comedy, but my reſpect to the Prince
oblig'd me, againſt my will, to withdraw; all I could
do, was to ſtay in the Anti-chamber with <hi>Deſroches,</hi>
the Captain of his Guards, and deſire him to go in and
ſee what became of that Maggot; but he told me, I
would take him for a Coxcomb, if he troubled himſelf
to go in for ſuch a thing, that I did not know the
Duke of <hi>Mecklenburgh,</hi> if I expected he ſhould ſay any
thing which was not very ſilly.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
drawn by the force of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Money, more than
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arguments, had given his word
to march to their relief, upon which they not only
broke the Treaty of Peace which was then on foot, but
maſſacred their Chief Miniſter, who they ſuſpected to
hold intelligence with us. Many others were ruin'd in
the ſame fury, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Mombas,</hi> one with
whom I had had ſeveral affairs for a Gentleman, one of
my Relations, nam'd <hi>Brinon,</hi> whom he had notoriouſly
cheated. <hi>Mombas</hi> had lent his Mother ten thouſand
Crowns, and had taken the ſale of a peice of Land
worth 40 thouſand Crowns for his ſecurity, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of repaying the overplus of the Money, but the
Contract was no ſooner made, but he began to put a great
many ſham tricks upon him; ſo that the poor young
man, who underſtood nothing at all of the Law, had
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57806:146"/>
ignorantly given him a Diſcharge for 40 thouſand
Francs, hoping thereby to facilitate the payment of the
remainder; but inſtead of that, <hi>Mombas</hi> procures ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
pretended Creditors, who made Demands upon
him; and tho <hi>Brinon,</hi> before he engag'd the Land, had
ſummon'd all his Creditors to make their Claims, more
or leſs, as was owing to them, and to receive their
Money; yet did he make this a new obſtacle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the poor Gentleman to ſuch an Extremity, that
in a great deal of trouble he came to me. I ſpoke to
<hi>Mombas</hi> about it, who pretending to be honeſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
me to end the affair in fifteen days; but telling
me that he had not Money at <hi>Paris,</hi> he would give
it him in <hi>Holland,</hi> if he would go thither with him;
the unhappy Gentleman went with him, but when he
had him ſo far off, he forc'd him to liſt himſelf a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
in his Company, and then made him ſign to what
he pleas'd. I was in a rage when I heard of it, but the
thing was paſt remedy, the Notary having ſign'd it,

'twas at leaſt ſix years before he came back again; and
for my young Kinſman, he let him periſh in miſery, not
giving him one penny beſides his Pay.</p>
            <p>This thing lying always upon my thoughts, made
me malicious enough to rejoyce at his diſgrace; for it
was almoſt as great as that of the Penſioner of <hi>Holland,</hi>
ſaving that he did not loſe his life; for he loſt at
leaſt 20 thouſand Livres a year, and underwent a
ſevere Impriſonment. During this, the Viſcount <hi>de
Turenne</hi> was commanded to march againſt the Marquis
of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who approacht at the head of 24000
men; and being about to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Suiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Treaty with the King, they were not to be oblig'd to go
into <hi>Germany:</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> told them, that

and having ſent me to him upon ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57806:147"/>
of conſequence, the Elector would make me dine with
him, he was pleas'd to let us be very cheary together, and
I was not the firſt <hi>Frenchman</hi> that he had invited to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
he did his beſt to make us all drunk, and if we
had been as willing as he, he had ſent us home in a very
fine pickle. There was a comical ſort of a fellow at
the Table, who had introduc'd himſelf into favour by
inventing a ſtrange kind of Inſtrument, I know not
what to call it, but by clapping it to another man's ear,
you might ſpeak to him at a diſtance, and yet no body
hear you; this fellow was one that put himſelf forward
upon all occaſions, but had not wherewith to anſwer
it. He had a Woman whom he maintain'd at a ſorry
rate, and often at the Electors coſt; for when he
thought no body ſaw him, he would ſlip the Wing
of a Fowl, or any other good bit, underneath his Plate,
and afterwards very dexterouſly into his Pocket. We
had not taken notice of his Ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity, but the Steward,
to his great misfortune, happen'd to ſee him pocketing
up a young Turky; ſo he came and whiſper'd the
Elector in the ear, and told him, that if he would give
him leave, he would make him ſome ſport; the Prince,
who lov'd nothing better, would fain know how;
t'other excus'd himſelf, and ſaid, the ſtory was too
long to give him an account of, but if he pleas'd to
give a hint to the <hi>French</hi> Officers, as they roſe from
Table, that they ſhould not take any thing amiſs,
whatever was done: The Prince was very well pleas'd,
and did as he deſir'd him; and they had hardly ſaid
Grace, before the Steward came, and told him, there
was certainly a Knave in the Company, for ſome body
had taken off a piece of Gilt Plate from the Side-board;
and if he pleas'd, he deſir'd that every body might be
ſearcht, to ſee who had got it; we being told, as I ſaid,
that there was ſome Frolick in hand, was not concern'd
at this, but cry'd out, by all means, and that the
Steward had reaſon for what he ſaid; ſo putting our
ſelves all in a row, the fellow was oblig'd to do ſo too,
and after the Steward had pretended to ſearch ſome of
us, he came to him, and found the young Turky in his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57806:147"/>
Pocket; he ſaid not a word till he had hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n't, and
then lugging it out by the Legs, he ſhow'd it to the
Elector, crying out, that in looking for one Thief he
had found out another. The Elector laught ready to
kill himſelf at this Farce, and ſo did we too; without
doubt this would have put any man but him out of
countenance, all the Company ſtaring at him; but he,
who was as impudent as a Court Page, laught as faſt as
any of us, and ſpeaking to the Elector; <hi>Tis true, my
Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I took a little ſorry Turky, here, to carry
home to my Dog, that is a little indiſpos'd, and has a weak
ſtomach; but this Gentleman here, Mr. Steward, methinks
ſhould have let it alone, who is ſo us'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o cheat your
Highneſs, at leaſt of a whole Ox a day.</hi> The Repartee
took extreamly, and the more, becauſe 'twas ſo ſharp
upon one who uſe to pretend very much to that Talent
himſelf. And the Elector was ſo pleas'd, that for the
future he order'd he ſhould have a diſh of meat always
provided for him.</p>
            <p>After I had done my buſineſs with the Elector I took
my leave, and return'd to give an account of my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to Mr. <hi>de Turenne.</hi> I told him alſo the ſtory of the
Turky, which gave him diverſion enough. In the mean
time the Army marcht along the Banks of the <hi>Neckar,</hi>
and when we were within a league of <hi>Wimphem,</hi> all the
Officers came and made a complaint to him, that they
were paid in Money that would not go; that 'twas a
trick of the Paymaſter, who no doubt receiv'd good
Money, but put them off with this Money for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Exchange. The Paymaſter was my
friend, and I reſolv'd to let him know, aſſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
what was doing, I found him ſo perplext, that
I could eaſily diſcern he was guilty; but ſeeing him ſo
caſt down, I told him there was a remedy for all
things, and therefore he ſhould not be ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
and ſince it was ſo, if he would be rul'd by
me, I would tell him what he ſhould do: Hearing me
talk thus, he told me in the greateſt paſſion imaginable,
he ſhould owe his Life to me; confeſſing ingenuouſly,
that the deſire of ſaving ſomewhat by it had put him
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57806:148"/>
upon doing it; I found him ſo troubled, that I was
afraid, if I did not tell him what I had to ſay quickly
he would dye with the fright. So I askt him how much
the laſt Remittance was which he had receiv'd, and if
he had ſince that, paid any other Money than that baſe
Coin; he told me no, for he had receiv'd it from <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
inſtead of the <hi>Louis d' Ors</hi> which he had from
the Treaſury; that the laſt Remittance was of 200000
Francs, but as he had told me, he had turn'd it all into
this bad ſort of Money: When he had told me this, I
bid him go and draw out a particular of all the Money,
as well what was paid, as what he had in Caſh, but to
diſguiſe his hand ſo, that no body might know it to be
his writing; that when Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhould
ſend to ſearch, as he would not fail to do, he ſhould
ſtand in it, that he had receiv'd no other but ſuch
Money, and offer to produce the account to make it
out; but in the mean time to appeaſe the Officers, he
ſhould paſs his word to them, that if they had any of
that Money left at the end of the Campaign, he would
give them other Money, or good Bills for it; and to
make them eaſy, to deſire Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> to make an
Order, by which all the Suttlers were commanded to
take it, upon the penalty of ten Crowns a man; he
found my advice very much for his advantage, for
Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſending immediately after, and ſeeing
the account I mention'd, he told the Officers, the
Paymaſter had paid them no Money but what he had
receiv'd, that they ought therefore to be ſatisfy'd with
his Offer, and making at the ſame time an Order to the
Suttlers, there never was any more ſaid of it. By this
means the Treaſurer, not only eſcap'd the Puniſhment
he fear'd, but alſo made a very great Advantage to
himſelf; for the Suttlers bringing back the Money to
him to change, he got three or four <hi>Sous</hi> a Crown out
of them too. He was ſo oblig'd to me, that he offer'd
to lend me any Money I wanted, but I having no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thankt him, and refus'd it.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> not contenting himſelf to have

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57806:148"/>
               <hi>Neckar,</hi> oblig'd the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to retire
beyond the <hi>Mein,</hi> which he alſo paſt after him. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               </gap>ight ſo, having more
men than we by one third, unleſs it was, that if he
ſhould hazard a Battel, and have the worſt, he knew
he ſhould leave his own Country too much expos'd;
however it was, tho he was Agreſſor in this War, yet he
was the firſt that deſir'd a Treaty of Accommodation,
and we promis'd to retire out of his Country, provided
for the future he ſhould meddle with no body's affairs
but his own. The buſineſs of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> being thus
at an end, Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> return'd to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but
the Troops were ſo fatigu'd with thoſe Marches, that
'twas even pity to ſee them; and yet they were ſo far
from allowing them time to refreſh them, that they
were immediately forc'd to begin a new Campaign,
the King being then juſt going to undertake the Siege
of <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> He durſt not attack it the year before,
and tho he had always an Army about it, yet the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
fail'd not to brave them in their Camp; and the
Officers were ſo bold, that they would come pickeering,
and challenge ours to exchange a Piſtol with them,
and 'twas none of their fault, if we did not try our force
with them; among the reſt, there was none who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
himſelf more than <hi>Somerdike,</hi> who not only came
out as the reſt did, but in particular was continually
inſulting the whole Army, and no body could ſhoot
him, which made people believe, he had fortify'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with ſome Charm; and a Trooper telling me ſo very
ſeriouſly, and that he had known ſeveral perſons that
had done ſo; I laught at him, upon which he told me,
I needed not go far to be convinc'd, for that he himſelf
had one; and if I doubted it, I ſhould fire a Piſtol at
him, and ſtand but three paces off, and that he had
try'd ſeveral. He ſet me in a great fit of laughter at
theſe words; and he finding me ſtill of the ſame mind,
preſt me to try him with my Piſtol, whether he ſaid
true or no; which I refuſing, he was ſo mad, that he
told me if I would not make the experiment my ſelf,
I ſhould ſee him make it before my face: Upon which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57806:149"/>
he immediately goes from me till he came within
Piſtol ſhot of the Counterſcarp of the Town. I not
imagining his deſign, perceiv'd that he endeavour'd to
fetch off a Cow, of which there was a Herd grazing, as
big as a good Flock of Sheep; there was above 200
ſhot made at him, before he came at them; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
'twas a very pleaſant ſight to ſee a man run ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after a Cow (having ſeparated one from the Herd)
in the midſt of the Muſquet ſhot, which in an infinite
number were fir'd at him from the Town. At laſt,
after having thus diverted the whole Army, and me in
particular, who knew the occaſion, he brings the Cow
to me, and askt me if I believ'd him now? I proteſt, I
could not tell what to ſay to it, but I put it off with
telling him, that this was all by good fortune, which
words were unhappily the cauſe of his attempting the
ſame the next day, when he was kill'd for his pains.</p>
            <p>During the time that all things were preparing for
the Siege of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> I went to into <hi>Alſace</hi> and <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
by Orders from the Mareſchal <hi>de Turenne.</hi> Going
to <hi>Beffort</hi> I ſaw the Governor there, who was but a
young Soldier, to command in a place of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which I could not forbear taking notice of to
the General, to which he very wiſely gave no anſwer at
all; but the Count <hi>de Florenſac,</hi> younger Son of the
Duke <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> who had not ſo much command of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
askt me what Country I came out of, and if I did
not know, that the Women rul'd all now adays? that
that Gentleman I ſpoke of, was the Brother of Madam

and he might be allow'd a place or two, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he made his Court, as he ought to do, to the
Kings Miſtreſs; by this diſcourſe he ſeem'd to reflect on
the conduct of the Prime Miniſter, as if it had been him
that had made ſo bad a choice: In ſhort, to explain
himſelf, he ſaid, that by the example of Monſieur <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
who triumpht in the Reign of Madam <hi>la Valliere,</hi>
ſo Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> was reſolv'd to triumph in that
of Madam <hi>de Monteſpan;</hi> that it was for that reaſon he
ſo much eſpous'd her intereſt, and if we might credit
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57806:149"/>
reports, he was none of the leaſt concern'd in her preſent
advancement. We were all of us ſurpriz'd to hear him
reaſon ſo gravely, who came of a Family that never
was fam'd for any ſtore of Underſtanding; but Nature
had been kinder to him than to his Family, for he had
ſometimes very happy ſallies of Wit; and ſhe had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
another miracle in his favour, that he was the firſt
of his Name that could paſs for brave. In ſhort, there
was nothing ſo ſtrange as to ſee any of the Houſe <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi>
in the Army; which caus'd that Satyr upon him in the
<hi>Scandalous Chronicle,</hi> that he was not the true Son of his
Father.</p>
            <p>For all this Monſieur, the Governor, underſtood one
part of his Office well enough, for he had made the
Town preſent him with ſeveral conſiderable Summs of
Money; and had it not been that they knew what
power ſupported his intereſt, they had complain'd of
him at Court. I told this to the Count <hi>de Florinſac,</hi>
who continuing his Vein of Wit, anſwer'd, that I needed
not wonder at that, for he had an excellent School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
having been documented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had not loſt the uſe of his hands; that one hours inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from ſuch a Man as he, was better than a months
teaching by another; and then related to me the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of the Mareſchal during his Government of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
and told me ſo many paſſages, as would take me
two days time to relate; but amongſt the reſt, he told
me one thing I ſhall never forget as long as I live, and
which I'll give you an account of, as a ſample to judge
of the reſt by. He told me, that the Mareſchal being
come to <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Magiſtrates came to wait upon him,
brought him ſeveral Preſents, and among others a Purſe
of Gold Counters, every one weighing two <hi>Louis d' Ors,</hi>
having on one ſide the City of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and on the reverſe
ſix Fuſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s in a Feſſe, which are the Arms of the Houſe
<hi>de la Ferte.</hi> That when they were gone out, he lookt
upon them again, and liking them very well, more for
the Metal than the Device, he would have been glad of
ſuch another parcel at the ſame price; and to that end
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57806:150"/>
ſends for the Townſmen again, he pretends he did not
know what Town that was which they had repreſented,
and they returning that it was <hi>Nancy: You are miſtaken,
certainly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>why this does not look like it, for 'tis too
little for it; if you had made the Model bigger, one might
have gueſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it to be</hi> Nancy, <hi>but this does not ſhow it all. I
would have you go and make another, and let the Town be
deſcrib'd at large upon it, that the fine Towers and Steeples may
be diſtinguiſht, one can ſee nothing here.</hi> The Magiſtrates
underſtood him well enough, and being unwilling to
quarrel with him for a matter of 100 Piſtoles, they
went and brought him a preſent of Counters as big as
Medals, the ſize of which pleaſing him, he never exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
the figure.</p>
            <p>This was no ſtory to tell the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi>
tho I had made it publick enough to others; for 'twas
not the way to make ones court to him, by telling him
any thing that lookt like a reflection upon another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
he was ſcrupulous in things of this nature to an
exceſs, and our young Sparks, who were of different
ſentiments, us'd to banter him with it, and ſay he was
not a man fit to live in this world; but all this could
never alter his temper, nor make any impreſſion upon
him. Tho ſometimes it might be ſaid of theſe people,
as it was ſaid of the Father of the preſent Duke <hi>de Lude,</hi>

theſe young Blades gave him a great
deal of diſtaſte by their fooliſh carriage;
and I having the opportunity of ſeeing what
notice he took of it, when they were abſent,
and ſometimes to their faces, knew the better how to
govern my ſelf. In the mean time, tho we had made
Peace with the Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> yet the Fire was
now kindled in <hi>Germauy,</hi> of which we ſoon felt the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57806:150"/>
conſequence. 'Twas the Emperors intereſt not to ſuffer
the Kings Forces to come ſo near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> eſpecially
conſidering the Leagues he had made with ſeveral
Princes of the Empire, which the Emperor lookt upon
as ſo many Marks of his Ambition, and therefore ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
alſo the Princes of the Empire to confederate with
him. The Dukes of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> were very fond of it, as
being afraid to have ſo dangerous a Neighbour as the

the Count <hi>D' Iſle,</hi> Collonel of Horſe, who was there
with his Regiment. I was not very well, and therefore
went to Bed betimes, and being juſt got to ſleep, I was
wak'd of a ſudden with a great Out-cry, as if the
Houſe had been on fire. I roſe immediately, and ſlipt
on my Gown to ſee what the matter was, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the noiſe was in the ſtreet, I lookt out of Window,
where I ſaw the Count <hi>d' Iſle</hi>'s Landlord crying out for
help after a hideous manner; I was not acquainted
with the Count <hi>d' Iſle,</hi> but juſt knew him, he being a

for me, who without boaſting, I may ſay had learnt
how to behave my ſelf well enough, by living with the

down ſtairs mighty ſeriouſly, this ſtory made me laugh,
and ſeeing the man had got a great Rabble about the
Houſe already, I deſir'd him to quiet them, and I
would go and accommodate every thing for him. I had
much ado to perſwade him, he telling me, I had to do
with a Devil, that would but laugh at me; but bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him not fear, I made him go into his Houſe, where
we found the Count, who had lockt himſelf in with
one of the Kitchen Wenches, and would force her to lye
with him: I call'd to him to open the door, and told
him my Name, but 'twas to no purpoſe; at laſt I was
forc'd to tell him, that I came by Orders from Mr. <hi>de
Turenne,</hi> which he would know better when he ſaw
me. I took all this care, that he might not ſuſpect me
to deceive him, and when he heard that, he durſt not
make any farther reſiſtance; I told him Monſieur <hi>de
Turenne</hi> knew nothing of what had happen'd, yet, but
he would ſoon, if the uproar continu'd, and I would
leave it to him to imagine, how he would reſent ſuch a
diſorder; he, who we knew was a ſworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to all ſuch irregularities; that they ſaid he would
needs have a Cook Wench; why he might have twenty
by to morrow, if he was put to ſuch hard ſhift; but to
force a Man of Honour to furniſh him for his Debauch,
was a thing no man would take, and the beſt conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the World could put on ſuch an action, muſt be to
ſay he was drunk, and that it was an ill extremity to
be forc'd to excuſe one folly by another: I deſir'd him
to reflect on theſe things, now while he had time for it,
leſt, when 'twas too late, he ſhould come to repent
it.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>d' Iſle</hi> hearing me diſcourſe at this rate,
grew a little mild; however it being the humour of
thoſe people, that tho they are in an error will never
acknowledge it, he told me, that for my ſake, he
would relinquiſh his right, but that I knew well enough
it was his due. This diſcourſe was ſo ridiculous, it
had like to have renew'd the quarrel, if I had not ſtopt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57806:151"/>
his Hoſt, who was juſt riſing up again, and having
pray'd them both to be peaceable, and live quietly,
ſince it was but for ſo ſhort a time, I made them ſhake
hands, and promiſe to drink a Glaſs together the
next day: His Hoſt, who was an honeſt man, told
us with all his Heart, and he would give us a Breakfaſt;
and the Count <hi>d' Iſle,</hi> who pretended to ſtand upon his
honour again, told us he would conſent, provided he
might treat us again at Night. Theſe civilities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, left me no room to queſtion, but they
were both thoroughly reconcil'd, ſo I e'en went to Bed
again, and there had never been a word made of it, if
ſome body had not fooliſhly told the ſtory among the
Souldiers, which made the poor Count be moſt horribly
banter'd in the Army; and when he went by they
would ſay, <hi>There goes our Friend that would have kiſt the
Cookmaid: Would it not have madded any body to have been
ſo diſappointed?</hi> And for me, they told me, that truly
I had done very ill to ſpoil ſport in that manner, and to
prevent me for the future, they would have a Law
made, that I ſhould mind my own affairs, and not
meddle with them. The Count <hi>d' Iſle</hi> ſaw himſelf ſo
rally'd with this ſort of talk, that there being Troops
to be detach'd to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he procur'd an Order from
Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> to be ſent thither, out of the way.
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> was by this time come into the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
and to prevent the ruine of <hi>Holland,</hi> attempted
to give us ſome diverſion, and in order to that, had
form'd a deſign upon <hi>Charleroy,</hi> in which they were
aſſiſted by all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces, but they fail'd in the
attempt; which might have led them to conſider, how
unfit a match they were for ſo powerful an Enemy.
The Count <hi>d' Iſle</hi> thought by this means to have avoided
the raillery of the ſtory we have told, but inſtead of
that, he carry'd into his own Country, a character
which perhaps would not have reacht ſo far, had he
continu'd where he was: In the mean time we
were preparing for the War in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
having now effectually declar'd upon us; and as
<hi>Alſatia</hi> was like to be the Scene, on which the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57806:152"/>
were to be acted, Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> gave orders
for the fortifying <hi>Saverne</hi> and <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> beſides <hi>Briſac,</hi>
where ſeveral new works were made to ſtrengthen the
place. The Souldiers rejoyc'd at theſe great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and they were in the right of it, for they were
ſafe now from being disbanded, which otherwiſe would
certainly have follow'd, if the Peace had been made
with <hi>Holland;</hi> for me, I was too old to expect making
my fortune by the War, and therefore was far enough
from pleaſing my ſelf at the news; but on the contrary,
was really griev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d for the People, who had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the calamity of a ruinous Campaign, if they
had pleas'd to have us'd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> a little gentler
upon the Propoſitions of Peace; but they carry'd it ſo
high with them, that contrary to the Genius of that
Nation, they joyn'd with the Inclination of the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> who preſt them to the War, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to proſecute it, whatſoever it coſt him, having
built all his hopes upon the ſucceſs of it.</p>
            <p>The King, who knew very well, he had no General
ſo fit to command in <hi>Germany</hi> as the Viſcount <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
continu'd him there, tho he wanted him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
having great affairs upon his hands: For the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who at the beginning of the War was on our
ſide, had left us in the lurch, the King of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deſerted us, and pretended he could not help it,
on ſome reaſons of State which had oblig'd him to it.
In the mean time our Coaſts were expos'd to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents
of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and we, who being all along
aſſiſted by the whole Naval Force of <hi>England,</hi> and durſt
do nothing to them at Sea, were not ſuch Fools to
ſtand in their way now. In this extremity the King
was forc'd to ſummon the Ban and Arriereban of the
Kingdom, of whom he ſent a Party into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> leſt
the Duke, who the King had long ago deveſted of his
Principality, ſhould take this opportunity to recover
the Poſſeſſion. Seeing ſuch a bloody War at hand, I
was ſorry I was no younger; and whatever obligation
I had to the Memory of the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
a little on him for taking me from a Profeſſion,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57806:152"/>
that, as old as I was, I lov'd ſo entirely; however I
would not be thought ſo old as I was, nor I would not
keep company with people of equal years, leſt they
ſhould make me ſeem older than I was indeed; but
affecting not only the Company and Manner of the
younger Men, but a certain ridiculous Air of Gaiety,
I muſt needs put on a flaxen Perriwig, when my Beard
and my Hair was as grey as a Gooſe. Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi>
had a certain Gentleman call'd <hi>Roiſguiot,</hi> a Man that
fancy'd mightily to wear a long grey Beard, and to
look always like an old man; this fellow was my
ſcourge, and as if he had a mind to plague me, he
would be always telling me of <hi>Locates,</hi> and of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent for by the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> This was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the moſt glorious action of all my life, and yet I
could not bear his telling me of it, becauſe he would be
always ſaying too, that he was but a Child at that
time, and that his Uncle us'd to cure him with that
ſtory, telling him, that Vertue never went without a
Recompence: For by this ſtory people begun to look
upon me, and wonder'd at me, that being ſo old, I
would appear ſo young, telling me that I could not be
much leſs than fourſcore. I was made at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and bluſht oftner for anger than ſhame; yet
others that were but lately come into the Army
told me, that I lookt very well, in which they
did not know how they pleas'd me; yet this did not
ſtop the other diſcourſe, but every day one Blockhead
or another would be raiſing of it again, inſomuch that
nothing was more welcome to me, than when ſome
Order came to get on Horſeback, and there I was as
young as any of them. I have often been aſham'd of
my ſelf in my own thoughts, that I ſhould be ſuch a
Fool, and that I ſhould be the firſt that ſhould condemn
it in another; how hard a matter is it for us not to be
opinionate of our ſelves; for after having experienc'd
this in my ſelf, I never reflected upon other perſons for
the like.</p>
            <p>'Twas a very fine ſight to ſee the Nobility when they
entred <hi>Lorrain;</hi> if one had not known they had been
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57806:153"/>
Gentlemen, one ſhould rather have taken them for
Hog Drivers; and tho moſt of them were arm'd with
Plumes of Feathers, it became them juſt as well as it
did me to make my ſelf a young man. However this
was only the appearance, for they did their duty, only
that they could not pretend to keep them in order,
eſpecially with ſuch people as commanded them, who
knew no better than themſelves, and made greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
than the Soldiers; and yet as ignorant as they
were, they thought they knew ſo much they needed no
teaching: They endeavour'd indeed, to find out ſome
old Soldiers among them to make Captains, but either
they had forgot the Service, or indeed never underſtood

               </gap>wn at Court, was ſo reſented by the King, that he
immediately order'd a Party of Soldiers to be quarter'd
upon his Eſtate. For my part I was willing to believe,
with the reſt of his friends, that this was only a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
which happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to him, and that he was really
brave enough. But to have convinc'd all the World of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57806:153"/>
this, he ought to have done, as the Duke <hi>de Villeroy</hi>
did, who, in the Campaign of <hi>Liſle,</hi> having quitted his
Poſt in the Trenches, and perceiving that people laught
at him for it, brav'd Death it ſelf, the next Winter, in the
<hi>Franche Comte,</hi> where he expos'd himſelf more than
the meaneſt Soldier in the Army.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Marquis <hi>de Sable,</hi> he was carry'd
to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> reti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d,
having his ordinary reſidence in that City with his new
Dutcheſs, who was of the Family of <hi>Aſpremont;</hi> who
tho ſhe was a very fine Woman, having not had the
Small Pox, which has ſince ruin'd her Beauty, yet this
old Duke marry'd her more for his Intereſt, than for
her Perſon: There had been a Suit at Law between
him and her Father a long time, in which the Duke
was caſt, and to avoid paying the Debt, he made up
the buſineſs by marrying his Daughter. The Marquis
<hi>de Sable,</hi> who was a very compleat Gentleman, beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that this circumſtance, together with the great
diſproportion of Age between the Duke and the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs,
might be a ſufficient ground to form an Averſion
between them, was reſolv'd to make a tryal, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more inclination to an Amour than to the War;
thought 'twould make him ſome amends for his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
if he could gain ſo delicate a perſon to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable
to his Addreſſes. 'Tis hard to ſay, whether he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his deſign or not; but if I ſhould be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to cenſure, as the people that liv'd in the place,
I ſhould make no queſtion of it, but take it for granted,
as they do: But as I am not apt to judge ſo lightly,
and eſpecially in caſes of ſuch moment, where the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Perſon of ſuch Quality is concern'd, I ſhould
rather chooſe to ſay, that tho 'twas probable it might be
ſo, yet 'tis not ſafe judging by probabilities; however
it was, the old Duke was not altogether without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and to be ſure of him, he haſten'd him away, and
ſent him back into <hi>France.</hi> Any Man, but <hi>Sable,</hi> would
have been more ſenſible of the Glory of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
with ſuch a Princeſs, than of his Liberty; but
he, who took his own way, was glad to be gone, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57806:154"/>
ſo return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he ſoon comforted himſelf
for the loſs of his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having nothing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
him, he ſpent his time when he was not in the
Field in ſome Employments, which were very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to himſelf. He would go and viſit the meaneſt
Burghers, and would take more pleaſure in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
than that of Perſons of the greateſt Quality. I
have ſeen him play ſtrange pranks when I was at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
I have ſeen him dance in the open ſtreet among
the Mob, to the common Tunes of thoſe people; and
he took that opportunity once to make a conſiderable
Preſent to a Lawyers Daughter, who he had an Intrigue
with. It was the faſhion in <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to give the young
Ladies Garlands of Flowers for the Head; he gave her
one, where there was Flowers indeed, but 'twas ſet
with Diamonds beſides. They judg'd from thence,
that he was extreamly taken with her, for Liberality
was not his character, but rather the contrary; but
this was not the only proof he gave her of his Paſſion
for her. She had a Mother who had an averſion to any
thing of a Soldiers coming near her Daughter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he diſguis'd himſelf like one of the Long Robe,
that he might come to ſee her, and the young one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
her Mother, 'twas a Preſident of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and the
good Woman very honeſtly believ'd her. This ſort of
diſguiſe was very common, but he had a great many
others, in which no man took ſo much pleaſure as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
He lodg'd in the <hi>Rue de Fripiere,</hi> call'd ſo from
the Pawn-brokers who liv'd there; and I ſaw him one
day dreſt like one of thoſe people, and he had lain all the
Door and Window of his Lodging with old Cloaths; ſo
that one that did not know him, would have taken
him for one of that Trade; and he himſelf ſitting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
in a great Chair, with an Apron before him, ſcold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his next Neighbour, all one as if he had been
his fellow. In ſhort, unleſs 'twas they who had known
him very well, every body took him for a Broker. One
day a Trooper came and cheapned a Buff Coat which
hung up among other old Cloaths; the Duke told him
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57806:154"/>
he ſhould try it on before he made him any price; and
ſo taking it down, he put it on for him, which the
other let him do, not imagining 'twas the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain;</hi> but the Duke <hi>d' Arſchot</hi> coming by with a
great many other Officers, could not conceal their
knowledge of him, ſeeing him in ſuch a figure; by
which means the Horſeman finding his error, and not
knowing what would become of him, got up a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
while they were a making their Compliments to
one another, and not daring to ſtay to pull off the Coat,
rid away with it. The Duke, who had no mind to
loſe it, runs after him in the ſtreet as hard as he could
drive, but the other having ſix Legs to his two, 'twas
all to no purpoſe. They rally'd him very heartily upon
this accident, which they thought might have made
him leave off thoſe ſort of diverſions, but 'twas all one
with him, he was at it again in two or three days, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a temper ſo naturally inclin'd to ſomething odd
and unuſual, that he was never better pleas'd than when
he was thus expoſing himſelf: This was the cauſe
he was ſo very much belov'd by all the common people
where ever he came. In ſhort, he was always familiar
with them, and would go to Dinner with a poor man,
aſſoon as with a rich; he would ſtand Godfather to
any of their Children, and would have all ſuch whoſe
Children he had ſo ſtood for call him Brother, he would
at leaſt call them by no other name, and often has been
ſeen to ſtop in his Coach at a poor Tradeſman's Door to
ask how his Goſſip did, and all the Family.</p>
            <p>But to return to the War: The Enemy was ſo ſtrong,
that Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was oblig'd to give ground,
and they took up their Winter Quarters on this ſide the
<hi>Rhine.</hi> Our Troops however being canton'd in the
Neighbouring Villages, with order to keep ſtrict
guard, having apprehenſions from ſeveral quarters
Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> had poſted perſons of great experience at
every quarter, that if any thing happen'd, they needed
not come to him for Orders, not he needed not be oblig'd
to march in perſon, it being impoſſible he ſhould be in
all places; and he had choſe to poſt himſelf about <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsburg,</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:57806:155"/>
where the Enemy ſeem'd to bend their greateſt
force: As for me, I had been ſo extreamly fatigu'd
with making two Campaigns in one year, that I was
left behind ſick in the Quarters of Monſieur <hi>Pillois,</hi>
Brigadier of Horſe, where, when I verily believ'd I
ſhould dye, I was cur'd by a kind of miracle; for
when every body had given me over, a Trooper that
was taken Priſoner by one of our Parties, and was put
into a Houſe next Door to where I lodg'd, told me, he
would undertake to cure me, if I would give him as
much as wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d pay his Ranſom. The price was ſo
ſmall, that I made no difficulty of bargaining with
him, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he gave me a Doſe made up with Brandy, Sugar,
Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>mon, Pepper, and a certain Powder which he
had in a Tobacco B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>x. This Compoſition ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
my Stomach, that in eight days time I was able to
get on Horſeback. Aſſoon as I was well, I reſolv'd to
go to Mr. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who ſeveral times in my Sickneſs
had the goodneſs to ſend to the Quarter, to know how
it went with me; but Mr. <hi>Pillois</hi> would by no means let
me go yet, for fear of a relapſe. During the time he
kept me thus, I had an opportunity to do him a piece
of ſervice, which very much oblig'd him, and which,
without vanity I may ſay, was very much for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
tho I took no great pains in it neither; the
Enemy had beſieg'd a little Town near <hi>Homburg,</hi> and
he having Orders to relieve it, drew together what
Troops were at hand, which making not above 2500
Horſe, he found 'twould be a difficult thing, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
having receiv'd a great Reinforcement, ſo that
they were at leaſt ſeven or eight thouſand Men; he
call'd a Counſel of War about it, and every body was
of the opinion, that 'twas not a thing practicable,
without expoſing the Troops to manifeſt ruine. I ſaw
him ſo extreamly afflicted with it, that made me try if
I could find any way to comfort him: I had heard ſay,
that ſometimes Policy goes beyond Strength, and being
reſolv'd to ſtudy upon it, I put my invention to the
rack, and at laſt a thought came into my head, which
afterwards had a ſucceſs as happy as I could deſire.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57806:155"/>
This was nothing but to write a Letter to the Governor,
that it not being proper to attempt the relief of the
place with leſs than ten thouſand Men, Monſieur <hi>Pillois</hi>
could not get ready before, but that now he was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his ſuccor, and by two a Clock the next day he
would give the Enemy a Viſit, and that he ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold out the place ſo long, and he ſhould be an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs
of the Sport. This Letter was to be carry'd,
directed to the Governor, but ſo to be contriv'd, that
it might fall into the Hands of the Enemy; and alſo it
was to be order'd, that he who carry'd it ſhould not be
privy to the deſign neither. Having laid all theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
I deſir'd Mr. <hi>de Pillois,</hi> that he ſhould get the
richeſt Man in thoſe parts he could meet with, and
threaten him, that if he did not carry that Letter ſafe,
he would not only burn his Houſe down, and all that
was in it, but he would certainly hang him, if ever he
came home again; he had confidence enough in me to
do all this for me, without inquiring upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
and having got a Man, he would fain have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
himſelf upon the account of the difficulty of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Enemies Lines, but he had as good have ſaid
nothing. Mr. <hi>Pillois</hi> told him, in ſhort, he ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
go of this Errand, or of another into the next
World; ſo ſeeing there was no remedy, he prepar'd to
go on the Meſſage: But while he was getting ready, my
Hoſt, who I had gain'd with a promiſe of a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
got before him, and ſtaying by the way, met
him, and made him believe he was going about ſome
buſineſs the ſame way. Thus jogging on together, and
falling into diſcourſe, he who had the Letter to carry
told him, what a ſtrait he was in, adding that he was
undone both ways, that if he ſhould perform his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
he ſhould be taken in the Camp, and hang'd for a
Spy; and on the other hand, if he did not, he ſhould
leave his Wife and Children to the mercy of Monſieur
<hi>de Pillois,</hi> who beſides the plundering and burning of
his Houſe, would treat him in the worſt manner that
could be imagin'd; that he had told him what would be
his fate, ſo that there was no room to flatter himſelf;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57806:156"/>
that he had thrown himſelf upon Providence, being
unable to make a choice, when it lay between his own
Life and theirs, who were as dear to him as his life.</p>
            <p>My Hoſt pretended to pity his Misfortune, and to
gain more upon his belief, accus'd Monſieur <hi>de Pillois</hi> of
Cruelty; however after a great deal of talk, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
his concern for him, he told him, that if he
was in his place, he would e'n go and ſurrender himſelf
into the hands of the Enemies, and tell them by what
Threatnings he was oblig'd to carry the Letter; that
they would let him carry it into the place, or they
would not let him, but either way he would ſave his
Life, and his Wife, and Children, Mr. <hi>de Pillois</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he was taken, endeavouring to execute his Orders,
could have nothing to ſay to him; and the Enemy on
t'other hand, would do him no hurt, ſeeing he had
put himſelf voluntarily into their hands. The Man
thought this was an admirable expedient, and reſolving
to take that courſe, gave him a thouſand thanks. My
Hoſt ſeeing him in ſo good a mind, had done his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and feigning that he was to go no farther that
way, left him, and coming back the ſame way, he met
Mr. <hi>de Pillois,</hi> who marcht at a venture with his 2500
Horſe; he gave us an account of what reſolution he had
left the Man in, and we taking it for a good Omen,
made no queſtion, but the Enemy would take it all
for truth, and the rather, for that the Man himſelf had
been really made believe, there was a very great force
ready to march to raiſe the Siege; in ſhort, what with
the Man's Report, and the Letter together, they were
ſo frighted, that they immediately reſolv'd to raiſe the
Siege, and retreat.</p>
            <p>We receiv'd this News when we were come within
three leagues of the Enemy; and Monſieur <hi>de Pillois</hi>
having then no buſineſs to go any further, marcht back
to his own Quarter, where in a little time he receiv'd
Letters from the Court, which complimented him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
on this happy ſucceſs; not but that it was
known by abundance of people, that I had a great ſhare
in the action, but as he was the General, and they bear
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57806:156"/>
the Reproach of ill ſucceſs, and ſo ought to have the
Credit of the good; ſo alſo it was juſt he ſhould have
the Privilege his place afforded him. And indeed I
ought to ſay this in his praiſe, that he was a Man that
perfectly underſtood the Cavalry, and perhaps there
was none in the Army went beyond him, of which he
gave an undeniable evidence a little while after; when
in the Fight at <hi>Einſeim,</hi> he refus'd to charge at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Monſieur <hi>de Vaubrun;</hi> for ſeeing that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
kept their advantage, he choſe rather to ſtay till he
drew them out of their Poſt, than to obey and be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
I do not ſay he did well in diſobeying, and he
that had ſerv'd ſo long, ought to have known, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can diſpence with our obeying the Order of our
ſuperior Officer; and he found the effects of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
being caſhier'd for doing it; but yet he ſhow'd
by that action, that he underſtood his buſineſs better
than Monſieur <hi>Vaubrun</hi> who commanded him; and the
Court was ſo ſenſible of it, that tho they could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the fact on account of the example, yet they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him a Penſion of a thouſand Crowns a year, that
it might not be ſaid he had ſerv'd ſo long, and ſo well,
for nothing.</p>
            <p>Juſt as I was come back from this Adventure with
Mr. <hi>de Pillois,</hi> there came an Officer to me and made
me a very pleaſant Compliment, which was, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been pleas'd to quarrel with Mr. <hi>de Montperoux,
Maiſtre du Camp</hi> of the Regiment <hi>de Rovergne,</hi> he had
occaſion to cut his Throat a little, and deſir'd me to be
his Second. I told him I was very much his humble
Servant, and I ſhow'd my ſelf ſo moſt effectually, for
inſtead of going to fight, as he imagin'd, I took care to
have us diſcover'd, by which I prevented him from fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away his Life. This Monſieur <hi>de Montperoux,</hi> was a
very ſtout Man, but ſo very ſhy, that 'twas difficult to
conform to his temper; he had his Sallies of Humour,
which made him very ridiculous; but of all his Whims
that was the pleaſanteſt, when the King gave him the
Regiment; for after the King had told him, he granted
the Regiment to him, he begg'd his Majeſty to give it
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57806:157"/>
the Name of ſome of the Provinces of the Kingdom;
tho it was not the cuſtom then, except for the old
Troops; telling the King, that he was ſo little known
in his own Country, that if the Regiment ſhould be
call'd by his Name, no body would liſt themſelves in it.
The King thought this was ſomewhat ſtrange in a
<hi>Gaſcon</hi> too, who generally value themſelves extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and don't uſe to fail ſo in their own character;
however the King would not deny him, and he behav'd
himſelf with a great deal of Bravery, till at laſt, as it
often falls out with thoſe who ſerve a long time in the
Armies, he was knockt on the Head.</p>
            <p>I was of an age, as I have often ſaid, that I could
not expect to live long; and ſo much the rather would
not attempt to preſerve my Life at the Expence of my
Reputation; however what I had done, on account of
this Man that had deſir'd me to be his Second, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to my Enemies to reflect on me, as if I had done
it for fear, and they began to count me a Coward: If I
had been as much a Fool as I have been formerly, I
ſhould have made ſome miſchief or other on that
account; but beſides that my Blood was not ſo hot
now, God firſt of all, and then the King, had forbid
my taking that Vengeance, we uſe to call Satisfaction,
and I took another way to let them know, that I had as
much Courage, or more, than they that ſaid ſo. The
firſt occaſion that offer'd me, without taking notice of
any thing to theſe Gentlemen, I deſir'd them to go out
with me to diſcover the Enemy, and I carry'd them ſo
far, that they began to mutter at me, and told me, I
had certainly been hir'd by ſome body, to bring them
all to be murther'd; this was all as I would have had
it. I told them, I wonder'd they ſhould diſcover any
fear, who had been ſo ready to cenſure others; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no ſign of returning, I came within reach of the
Enemies ſhot, when they were pleas'd to leave me.
This gave me opportunity enough to revenge my ſelf.
When I came back to the Camp, I told all this to their
Acquaintance, and to my own Friends, how they had
quitted me aſſoon as I came to the Enemies Quarter;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57806:157"/>
and tho ſome people did not fail to tell them again, yet
they thought it convenient to take no notice of it, leſt a
Man who valu'd his life ſo little, as they themſelves had
ſeen, ſhould not be always in the humour to bear their
Reflections. Indeed I was very unhappy to be ſo much
talkt of, for ſo ſmall a matter; ſince the like happen'd
to another Man but t'other day, and no notice at all
taken of it. Every body knows, that the Marquis <hi>de
Crequi</hi> having challeng'd a Collonel, the Collonel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of meeting him as he had appointed, goes and
acquaints the Marquis his Father, who was General of
the Army, and taking him with him to the place, they
found the Marquis there with his Second; who being
ſurpriz'd, as no doubt any Son would have been, to ſee
his Father in ſuch a caſe; and ſeeing there was no way
to conceal the deſign, he threw himſelf at his feet, and
promis'd him never to attempt it more. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but good fortune and bad in the World. This
Collonel was ſo far from hurting his Reputation, that
he encreaſt it, and paſt for a wiſe man; and yet I not
only ſuffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in ſuch a caſe, but had the misfortune to
have ſeveral of my Friends reflect on me as well as the
reſt, and I had no opportunity to tell them my mind,
tho I deſir'd it exceedingly; above all, an account of a
certain bluſtring Fellow call'd <hi>Chateau Bautot,</hi> who, if
we would believe himſelf, was the ſtouteſt man in the
Army; I had my Eye upon him, I never came into his
Company but I thwarted him, upon which he grew
ſo reſerv'd, that I often found he had a great deal of
patience, and eaſily perceiv'd he was not ſuch a Bravo
as he ſaid he was. I ought indeed to have been content
to have mortify'd him in this manner, but I watcht for
a further opportunity, which at laſt offer'd it ſelf when
I leaſt lookt for it. When I return'd to the Camp the
next Campaign, I came to <hi>St. Diſier</hi> one day, when
there being a great many Troops in the place, I had
like to have lain in the ſtreet all night, but that at laſt
I found out an Hoſt, who by the help of a Crown pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
me a Chamber; ſo I put my Baggage in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to lodge there; I went out then to ſee ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57806:158"/>
of my acquaintance, but while I was walking with
them, Monſieur <hi>de Chateau Bautot</hi> comes into the
ſame Inn, and finding there was never a Chamber but
mine, makes bold to turn my Baggage out and take
poſſeſſion; as ſoon as I came back they told me how it
was, and not believing any man could be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
I run up Stairs to inform my ſelf; I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to find him there who I wanted ſuch an occaſion
againſt, and he was no leſs, when he ſaw who it was he
was like to be concern'd with; but not giving him
time to make his excuſe, I clapt the door to and bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and told him there was no reaſon I ſhould have
the advantage of the Inn ſo much, becauſe I happen'd
to come in an hour or two before him, but I thought he
beſt deſerv'd the Chamber who was beſt able to keep it.
With thoſe words I drew, expecting that he would do
the like; but inſtead of that, he told me he would
not be guilty of ſuch an ill action; that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
he had abus'd me, and as a further mark of it,
he would immediately remove his Baggage, if I pleas'd
to let them be carried away. I was aſham'd of his
Cowardice, and putting up my Sword, I told him that
at leaſt then, he ſhould behave himſelf more modeſtly
for the future, that I had born a great deal from him, but
I ſhould not always take it ſo; that I would not uſe
him as he had done me; tho I had much more reaſon;
that I now was ſatisfied he had a great deal more
Tongue than Courage, and I ſhould take occaſion ſome
time or other to tell him ſo, if he did not take care to
uſe me better. Thus I remain'd Maſter of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which I was not a little glad of I aſſure you; for
I muſt own to you, I had rather it had been he than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſon in the World, for tho I know I ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
yet I could not help being thoroughly pleas'd at
ſuch an opportunity to revenge my ſelf. This accident
however made him quit the Army, and go and ſerve
under Mr. <hi>de Schomberg</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he had a
Troop of Horſe in the Regiment <hi>de Gaſſion;</hi> but as he
was always a man of pleaſure, he left the Army to run
after a Miſtriſs, and as he was coming back again, was
kill'd by the <hi>Miquelets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:57806:158"/>
As for me, I was ſtill <hi>Aid de Camp,</hi> and tho the King
had ſeveral in the Army who wore long Beards as well
as I, as the Marquis <hi>de Angeau,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>d' Arcy,</hi>
yet none of them would pretend to diſpute the Seniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with me; however I was ſtill very vigorous, and
Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> would ſay of me ſometimes, that
'twas pity I began ſo late, and that, if I had as good a
conſtitution of body to the War, as I had of mind, I
ſhould have been able to do any thing. Indeed I us'd
to tire two or three Horſes a day; I was ſo conſtantly
riding about in every corner, that they call'd me the
Petty General of the Army. I did not do this to make
people believe great things of me, but 'twas my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
and I always choſe rather to pleaſe all the world,
if 'twas poſſible, than to give offence to any; and I
know but one man in the whole Army, that complain'd
of me, and I leave the world to judge, whither that
was my fault or no. In the Regiment of Horſe <hi>de Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
there was a Gentleman of <hi>Vexin,</hi> call'd <hi>Bellebuine,</hi>
whoſe Father having been one of my acquaintance, a
Captain in the Guards, I thought my ſelf oblig'd now
and then, to give his Son a hint of my obſervations
of his conduct, and I had told him of ſeveral things
which I thought were not very much for his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
indeed he was very debaucht, and tho he
had a very honeſt Woman to his Wife, yet he run away
from her, and follow'd a Gang of naſty common
Whores: This could not but produce ill effects on him,
and all that I had foretold him came to paſs; he was
lookt upon in the Regiment, as one who 'twas ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to be ſeen with, and beſides he had done two or
three very diſhonourable actions, and to compleat all,
he brought the fould diſeaſe with him from <hi>Paris;</hi> and
whether he wanted Courage, or was unable to ſerve on
theſe accounts, I know not, but he came to me one
day, and deſir'd me to ask leave of Monſieur <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
for him to go ſomewhere to be cur'd: We had
then the Enemies Army juſt at our Trenches, and thnking
it was not a proper time for any Man to leave the Army,
I gave him my opinion, that Mr. <hi>de Turenne</hi> would not
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57806:159"/>
grant it him; he would not take my word for it, but
ſeeing I refus'd to ſpeak for him, he went to Monſieur <hi>de
Turenne,</hi> and askt him himſelf, but he told him the
very ſame thing as I had ſaid, which not ſatisfying him,
he went away without leave. In ſhort, I had good
reaſon for what I ſaid, for the Armies engag'd in a day
or two after, and had he ſtaid till then, I ſhould have
made no difficulty to have ſpoke to Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>
for him; and Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> who was very civil to
him, told him, if he would have patience two or three
days he ſhould go; but going his own way to work, he
was caſhier'd, as he well deſerv'd. God knows I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
accus'd him to Mr. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> but ſaid all I could
in his favour, when they told him of it; nevertheleſs,
he took all the diſgrace that was done him to be my
doing, and they wrote to me from <hi>Paris,</hi> that he
threatned me ſtrangely; I made a trifle of it, and
indeed I knew him too well to be afraid of him, but I
was ſoon taught, that the braveſt Men are not always
the moſt dangerous Enemies; but on the other hand, a
Man has nothing to ſecure himſelf againſt Malice
and Treachery. In ſhort, I was no ſooner come back
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e Campagne, but one night as I was going along
the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germaine</hi> very late, three Men ſet
upon me with naked Swords in their hands, and I
knew him to be at the head of them. I was not ſo
much ſurpriz'd, but that I had time to ask him in cold
blood, if it was poſſible for a Gentleman to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in ſuch a piece of Villany. I confeſs he had been
in a great many ill actions, as I have before obſerv'd;
and now, having reduc'd himſelf to the laſt extremity,
he had liſted in the <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> where, tho I do not
ſay but there may be ſome honeſt Gentlemen, yet I
ſhall not fear to ſay alſo, there are others, who will
ſtick at no manner of crime; here it was that he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
himſelf for all ſort of Villany, and I believe
'twas by concert with theſe people, he that undertook
an action ſo horrid: I was in the more danger from
theſe Rogues, becauſe 'twas very late, and I could hope
for no help from the Watch, for they were gone, it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57806:159"/>
being near day: But I had not ſo much work with
them as I expected; and taking care to ſet my back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Shop, that they might not come behind me, I
ſtood upon my Defence; I have wondred a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, reflecting on the paſſage, how it came to
paſs, ſince they had Villany enough to contrive ſuch an
action, that they had not arm'd themſelves in another
manner; but ſo it pleas'd God to order it, I kept
them off in that faſhion with the point of my Sword,
till at laſt a Coach was heard, which was the Duke
<hi>Leſdiguieres;</hi> aſſoon as ever the Villains ſaw the
Flambeaus they fled; and the Duke, who was in his
Coach, knowing me by the light, made his Coach ſtop,
and askt me what was the matter? I would not tell
him the name of him I had ſo much reaſon to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
out of my reſpect to his Relations, who were
very honeſt people: I only told him, I had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd
by three fellows, I knew not who, and if his
Grace had not come by in the minute, I did not know
how it might have far'd with me. He ſtept out of his
Coach immediately, for fear of a ſurprize, and we
walkt along together two or three whole ſtreets, but
could ſee no body. But this was a day of ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
coming to a new Houſe, which was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half finiſht, we heard a grievous groaning, which
was like a Woman's Voice: Mr. <hi>de Leſdiguieres</hi> order'd
his Footmen to go into the Houſe, and ſee what was the
matter, and we follow'd them; but I was ſtrangely
ſurpriz'd when I ſaw what it was: 'Twas a Young
Woman extraordinarily well dreſt, and to appearance
of ſome Quality, with a Maſque on her Face; ſhe was
fallen in Labour in that place, and without any manner
of help but a ſort of a Girl, that was not like to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of doing her any ſervice; I was extremely mov'd at
her circumſtance, and ſaid ſomething to her to make her
ſenſible of it; but Mr. <hi>de Leſdiguieres,</hi> who was a hard-hearted
Man, fell a laughing at her, and was a going
to make her pull her Maſque off, and if it had not been
for me, I believe he would have done it, for he ſaid a
great many hard things to her which I did not approve
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57806:160"/>
of: I had a great deal of difficulty to get him away,
but having at laſt perſwaded him, I did her a great
kindneſs, for I ſaw ſhe had almoſt ſtifled herſelf with
her Mask for fear of being known; and if ſhe had been
to keep it on much longer there had been no ſaving her.
I had the Curioſity the next day to go and inqure about
her, making all the deſcription I could of her Dreſs
and Shape, and the like, I got ſo much information,
that I underſtood 'twas a Councellors Daughter, that
paſt for a young Saint: However, tho ſhe was of no
mean Family, yet the Child was expos'd to the Pariſh,
and the Commiſſary was juſt taking it away as I came
by: If I had thought fit, I could have given him ſome
light into the matter; but conſidering that I ought not
to ruine a poor Girl, who without doubt had been
drawn in, I never ſpoke a word of it.</p>
            <p>However this affair of <hi>Bellebrunne</hi> that befel me,
made me bethink my ſelf, and I was juſt a going to his
Captain, the Prince <hi>de Soubize,</hi> who I had the honour
to be particularly known to, and I knew he would do
me juſtice; but then conſidering 'twas a ſorry Wretch
I had to do with, I thought 'twas not worth my while,
only I would look to my ſelf a little better; ſo I took
care to come home betimes at night, and if I was out
late, I always took ſome of the Watch, who for a ſmall
matter would guard me to my Lodging; by which
means I avoided him in the night, and he had not
Courage enough to attack me by day light.</p>
            <p>I had follow'd the War now three years, in which
time I had plaid the good Husband ſo well, that I had
three years Rent in Bank, which I think was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for my Poſt, where 'twas not the Cuſtom to be
ſaving; for my pay was 100 Crowns every ſix weeks,
and truly I made bold to live upon Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>
for my Diet; ſo that I never was in a better condition
in my life. But knowing not well what to do with
my Money, I enquir'd after an opportunity to put it
out; and ſpeaking to a Friend of mine about it, he
told me, he could accommodate me himſelf without
my ſeeking any further; that he had lent 20 thouſand
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57806:160"/>
Francs to a Gentleman of <hi>Provence</hi> to buy a place with,
and had taken a Mortgage of him for it, and he would
entereſt me in it if I pleas'd; and that, tho it was not
uſual, yet he had a Counter Security alſo upon the
place to the value of 20 thouſand Crowns, between
him and the Mareſchal <hi>d' Humieres,</hi> who had lent 40
thouſand Francs on the ſame account; ſo that I ſhould
run no hazard in it, and ſhould oblige him too. This
lookt ſo fair that I had nothing to object, and being
alſo very willing to ſerve him, I fetcht him my Money,
tho I had intended to have put it into the Fund for
Annuities, or at leaſt into the Town-houſe. Indeed I
had better have done ſo, but I was born to be a Beggar.
I receiv'd the intereſt but a very little while; and the
Gentleman dying, the King gave the place to Monſieur
<hi>de Briſſac,</hi> Major of the Guard <hi>du Corps,</hi> without any
regard to the Obligation the other had made: I had
laid my meaſures ſo fooliſhly, that inſtead of taking an
Aſſignment of the Deed from the perſon I lent the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to, with his Security for the payment, I let him be
quit, and my ſelf be conſtituted in his place; ſo that all
the hopes I had, was upon the ſucceſſion of Monſieur
<hi>d' Arbouſte,</hi> who held the ſaid Government; but then
underſtanding that he owed already more than he was
worth, that thought was at an end; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en we
reckon'd, that if the King had an account of the Caſe, he
would cauſe Monſieur <hi>de Briſſac</hi> to pay us; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe the Mareſchal <hi>d' Humieres</hi> was concern'd,
who we thought had intereſt enough to appear for us;
the perſon I had done this withal had great Friends too,
it was Mr. <hi>de Saillant,</hi> Brother to Mr. <hi>de Montauban,</hi>
Lieutenant General in the King's Army; but tho this
Man did his endeavour, the other did not ſtir in it,
telling us 'twas to no purpoſe, for that Mr. <hi>de Briſſac</hi>
not being able to pay us, to trouble the King about it,
would but be to ask him to give us ſo much Money out
of his own Coffer: But this did not ſatisfie Mr. <hi>de Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi>
and me; and as I did not care neither to appear
too publickly in it, all the care of the matter lay upon
Mr. <hi>de Saillant,</hi> who to ſay the truth, ſpar'd no pains in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57806:161"/>
the buſineſs; but 'twas three months before he could
have a word of anſwer, tho he had given abundance of
Petitions to the King with his own hand; at laſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Louvois</hi> told him, that if he would not offend
the King, he ſhould deſiſt his pretenſions in this affair,
and think of ſomething elſe to ask of the King to make
him ſatisfaction. This was enough to let us know our
Money was loſt. But Monſieur <hi>de Saillaut</hi> thinking
himſelf oblig'd on my account, but chiefly on account
of his own Family, not to be put off ſo, preſented ſtill
ſeveral other Petitions to the King, to one of which the
King anſwer'd him himſelf, that he might know of the
Mareſchal <hi>d' Humieres</hi> how that affair ſtood. Mr. <hi>de
Saillant</hi> having told me this, I troubled my ſelf no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thinking that Mr. <hi>d' Humieres</hi> having already
told us his mind, he had made his Court at the expence
of our Cauſe, but I did him wrong; for very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
he had told the King, that if he had not impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
him, 'twas becauſe his Majeſty had already been
ſo bountiful to him, and that in his Majeſties favour he
could not be the poorer for the loſs of 40 thouſand
Francs; but that it was otherwiſe with Mr. <hi>de Saillant,</hi>
who, beſides that he was not very rich, had alſo a very
great Family; as for me he ſaid nothing, for as I ſaid I
did not appear, and I ſaw alſo that Mr. <hi>de Saillant</hi> did
what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as poſſible. One would have thought ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
a Declaration as this of the Mareſchal <hi>d' Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres</hi>
ſhould have done us ſome ſervice, and that the
King, or Mr. <hi>de Briſſac</hi> would have paid us; but they
thought no more of that, leſt they ſhould be oblig'd
to pay the Mareſchal <hi>d' Humieres</hi> too: ſo that Mr. <hi>de
Saillant</hi> had for his laſt anſwer, that he ſhould not preſs
it any farther, but rather ſeek for ſomething elſe to ask
of the King; he car'd not for all this neither, but ſtill
continued ſolliciting, tho to no purpoſe at all.</p>
            <p>But to return to my other affairs, which this ſtory has
too much diverted. The year 1675 being begun, I
prepar'd again in the Campagne with Mr. <hi>de Turenne:</hi>
He had finiſhed the laſt ſo gloriouſly, that there was
nothing known like it; he had fought four Battels in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57806:161"/>
one Summer, with ſuch unequal Forces, as any body,
but he, would have been overthrown; but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
or his Courage, always ſupply'd his Want of
Numbers; and in the laſt fight, with not above 25000
Men, he drove the <hi>Germans</hi> back over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> tho
they were at leaſt 70000 ſtrong. In other places where
the War was more diſpers'd, it was ſtill proportionably
ſucceſsful on our ſide, the King having taken the <hi>Franche
Comte;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who made head againſt
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having taken his Baggage at the
Battel of <hi>Seneff,</hi> and made him raiſe the Siege of <hi>Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
In all theſe places there fell a world of Men, and
a Peace ſeem'd equally needful to both parties, but one
thing rendred it impoſſible to be effected. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Grana</hi> had been too cunning for Prince <hi>William</hi>
of <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and had
ſurpriz'd him in the City of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and taken him
Priſoner; and this had quite broken off all the Treaties
then on foot for the Peace of Chriſtendom. He was
carry'd to <hi>Neuſtadt</hi> under a ſtrong Guard; and the
Emperor, who knew he was deep in the intereſts of
his Enemies, and afraid too of his capacity, reſolv'd to
detain him, tho the action was condemn'd by all the
world, as againſt the Laws of Nations; the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Aſſembly at <hi>Cologne,</hi> on the part of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of that name; and the violence offer'd him there
was enough, without any further deſign upon him:
and people were the more concern'd at this too, becauſe
of all things the Emperor himſelf was a Prince far
from any ſuch ill deſigns; but ſome of his States-men
perſwading him, that he could not be ſafe without it,
and that this Prince <hi>William</hi> had as much credit in the
Empire as himſelf, he made his Judgment ſtoop to his
Intereſt, and ſo his ruine was concluded on; and if the
Emperor had been leſs religious he had not liv'd long.
In ſhort, they aſſembled the next day, more indeed to
make a formal Judgment, than to examine much into
his Affair; but the Emperor would have but three of
his Miniſters there, of whom the Prince <hi>de Lokowits</hi>
was one. They condemn'd him to loſe his Head, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57806:162"/>
the Execution was appointed to be in private, and not
to be known till it was over. But the Prince <hi>de Loko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits,</hi>
who ſign'd the ſaid Sentence much againſt his
Will, whither it was that he was a Penſioner to <hi>France,</hi>
as his Enemies gave out, or that he thought that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of proceeding would reflect upon the honour of the
Emperor his Maſter, ſent word to the Popes Nuncio,
and deſir'd him to go to the Emperor, and to threaten
him with the Cenſure of the Church, if he ſuffer'd this
Sentence to be executed. The Nuncio, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Orders from the Pope to interceed for the Princes
Liberty, was very ready to forward the matter, and
ſent immediately to demand Audience of the Emperor;
who being ſurpriz'd, when he underſtood he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with an affair which he had committed to ſo
few perſons: the Emperor did all he could to find out
how he came by the information; but the Nuncio told
him, his Majeſty knew well enough what he told him was
true, and begg'd his Majeſty to conſider what might be
the effect of ſuch a proceeding. The Emperor, who is a
mighty religious Prince, and whoſe Conſcience would
not permit him to contradict the Pope, ſuffer'd himſelf
to be bluſter'd out of his intentions, by the high words
of this Church-man, and ſo chang'd the Sentence from
that of Death to cloſe Impriſonment. It was alſo a
great ſtep to his Deliverance, that he had taken up the
Habit of an Eccleſiaſtick, for that was the Nuncio's
great Argument to the Emperor, that he had nothing
to do to put to death a Man who was conſecrated to
the Church; and that if he was guilty of any crime,
the Pope ought to take cognizance of it.</p>
            <p>But if the Prince <hi>de Lokowits</hi> found means thus to
ſave the Prince of <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> he ruin'd himſelf by it;
for the Emperor preſently ſuſpecting that this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
muſt come from him, caus'd him to be arreſted,
and ſeized upon his Secretary at the ſame time, who
they put to the torture. It is hardly to be imagin'd the
barbarous uſage they both receiv'd; for beſides this
affair for which they were reſolv'd to plague him, the
Empreſs, that then was, ow'd him a ſpleen, for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57806:162"/>
her Marriage, which ſhe could never forgive him;
he had indeed puſht on the Match with the preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
and had the other dy'd ſooner, perhaps he might
have made ſhift to have got off clear; but the Empreſs
hating him, every one made their Court to her by puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at him, till at laſt he was ſent to one of his own
Caſtles, where they found means to poiſon him, and ſo
ſent him out of the way.</p>
            <p>Theſe things had rais'd ſuch a ferment on both ſides,
that inſtead of Peace, or the hopes of it, the Flame of
War was kindled more violent than ever. All the
preparations imaginable were made on every ſide; but
after all, fortune ſtill declar'd for us, and every year
before the Enemy could be got together, the King had
taken two or three of their beſt places; by this means
the <hi>Low Countries</hi> grew weaker and weaker, tho indeed
'twas chiefly by the negligence of the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi>
for inſtead of committing the Government of thoſe
Countries to an experienc'd Soldier, that underſtood
things, the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> was then Governor,
who had never ſerv'd in any degree above a Captain of
Horſe, and was no way a match for the old politick
Commanders in the King's Army. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> had
another failing too, which was that they wanted Money
to make Magazines for their Forces; whereas the King
could take the Field in the middle of Winter, and his
Men had no neceſſities to encounter, but the ſeverity of
the ſeaſon; all theſe things ought to have inclin'd them
to a Peace, and moſt people thought it would have done
ſo; but the Miniſters of State ſeeing with other Eyes,
they reſolv'd upon the continuance of the War, to the
great regret of all <hi>Europe,</hi> who was quite weary of ſuch
a long and bloody contention.</p>
            <p>I had ſtill my old poſt, and being of ſo ill an age for
action, I ſought for no other; and finding that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Turenne</hi> was almoſt ready to go into the Field,
I got away before with my little Equipage: As I went
by <hi>Courtenai,</hi> I found a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officer of the Regiment
of <hi>Grana,</hi> call'd <hi>Cueillette,</hi> who had been taken Priſoner
at the Battel of <hi>Seneff,</hi> and was returning into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:57806:163"/>
with ſome private Soldiers, who had run the ſame
fate with himſelf; they had an Order for Quarters,
paying for what they took; but the Sheriffs were forc'd
to put them all into a Barn with Straw for their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the Officer was lodg'd in an Inn, and I becoming
acquainted with him there, we lodg'd together for three
or four times; I found him a very civil Gentleman, he
told me he was a <hi>Lorrainer,</hi> and that he had been Page
to the Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> now Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> His
company was very agreeable to me, eſpecially ſince I
travell'd no faſter than he, only it coſt me a little
dearer; for when we came to <hi>Bar Sur Scine,</hi> he told
me his Money was all gone, and that Monſieur <hi>Louvois</hi>
having made him attend ſeveral days for his Paſsports,
he had ſpent his Money, and knew not how to get more
till he ſhould reach to <hi>Mets;</hi> that if I would defray
his Charges ſo far, and his Men, I ſhould extreamly
oblige him, and he would certainly reimburſe me when
he came there. I believ'd all he ſaid, and did more for
him than I ſhould have been perſwaded to do for one
of my own Countrymen; at leaſt unleſs I had known
him very well: I told him he ſhould not be diſturb'd,
I would let him have what he had occaſion for. When
we came to <hi>Mets,</hi> he told me, the Man who he was
directed to, was gone out of Town, ſo that inſtead of
paying me what he had promis'd me, he muſt beg me
to continue my aſſiſtance to him, and ſupply him till
he came to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> that there he had abundance of
Acquaintance; and that aſſoon as ever he came there,
he would punctually repay me all I had laid out for
him: I did not miſtruſt him yet, but ſupply'd him
with whatever he wanted; but from that day to this I
could never ſee one penny of my Money; and 'tis the
leaſt that I can do, to give this caution to ſuch as read
theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> to take heed who they truſt in that
manner: I have been ſince told he is become a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,
but he might have paid his Debts firſt; for I do
not underſtand they have any more priviledge than
other people to rob their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:57806:163"/>
In ſhort, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſoon after being come
to the Army, he had about as much cauſe to be pleas'd
with the Inhabitants of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> as I had with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Cueillette;</hi> they promis'd him a thouſand things
which they never perform'd, but he might have known
them, for they had us'd him juſt in the ſame manner the
year before; this oblig'd him to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their giving up their Bridge to the Enemy; but
all the Country being ruin'd, it is impoſſible to tell you
what difficulties we were put to for want of Forrage,
and for fifteen days together our Horſes eat nothing
but Weeds we pickt up and down near the Camp. The
Quarter Maſter General of the Horſe, gave Monſieur
<hi>de Turenne</hi> an account of this every night when he went
for Orders, telling him the Cavalry could not ſubſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer, if they were not permitted to Forrage, for it
had been a long time ſince he would ſuffer them to go
out for that ſupply; but Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> anſwer'd
him, that they would never dye with hunger, as long
as there was Leaves upon the Trees, and if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they might go and gather them if they pleas'd. The
Enemies far'd no better than we did, and we did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on neither ſide but watch to ſee which
would break up firſt, ſo as the other might make ſome
advantage of it; for if we had a great Captain at the
head of our Army, the <hi>Germans</hi> had no fool with them,
being Commanded by no leſs a Man than <hi>Montecuculli,</hi>
who had ſhown us a piece of his skill at the beginning
of the War in the firſt Campaign, when feigning to
march way, he countermarcht immediately, and went
directly the contrary, and on a ſudden ſurrounded <hi>Bon</hi>
in ſuch a manner, as we could by no means relieve it.
Thus the two Armies lay and both ſuffer'd great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
till at laſt they came ſo near, as 'twas thought
they could not part without coming to a Battle, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one was overjoy'd at the hopes of being deliver'd at
once from all theſe miſeries; but juſt at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> thought the hour of
Victory was come, he was kill'd with a Cannon Bullet,
by the fault, in part, of Monſieur <hi>de St. Hillaire,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57806:164"/>
General of the Artillery; I ſay by his fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> having ſpoke to him to go
along with him, to view where he might place a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
he muſt needs ſtay to put on a Red Cloak, by
which they were known to be Officers, and that made
the Enemy fire at them; and the ſame Ball that kill'd
the one, ſhot off the Arm of the other, as he was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at ſomething they were taking notice of together.</p>
            <p>If another was to tell this ſtory, you might expect
ſome account of the ſtrange conſternation which ſeiz'd
the whole Army upon this unhappy accident; but I
can give no diſtinct relation, for the confuſion I was in
my ſelf was ſo great, that I minded no body elſe, nor
took no obſervations of other matters; this I know,
that every body gave themſelves over for loſt; and the
more, becauſe the Marquis <hi>de Vaubrun,</hi> and the Count
<hi>de Lorges,</hi> without conſidering that the condition we
were in requir'd a common unity for our general ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
fell to making Factions and Parties, and to draw
the great Officers to their ſides, about the principal
Command. This had certainly been the ruine of the
whole Army, if it had continued but two days, but
ſome of the graver heads remonſtrating to them, that
this was not a time for them to diſpute Punctilio's of
Honour, and point of Command, but to conſider the
Honour of the King, and that they would be call'd to
an account for it if things miſcarry'd upon this ſcore:
At laſt they perſwaded them to refer their pretenſions
to ſome of the principal Officers, choſen by the reſt to
decide it between them; and ſo the differences being
compos'd, we began to retreat towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
where we had a Bridge of Boats. But we had taken
ſeveral advanc'd Poſts very near the Enemy, and 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to draw our Men out of them before we decampt,
which we did without any loſs, ſetting fire to our
works, and principally at <hi>Willeſſat,</hi> where all the Mills
were burnt. The Enemy, aſſoon as ever they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Death of our General, imagining we would
reſolve to retreat, as we did indeed, prepar'd to fall
upon us; and decamping the very moment that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57806:164"/>
to retire, they attackt us at a Paſs of a little River;
the Fight was very obſtinate on both ſides, ours being
enrag'd at the loſs of their General, and the other in
hopes to make their advantage of our Confuſion,
knowing we had loſt our principal dependance; but
neither Party had their ends, for the <hi>Germans</hi> being
oblig'd to repaſs the River with the loſs of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, we had the honour of the Action; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we were forc'd to proceed on our Retreat, and that
with all the caution imaginable; and the Enemy having
waited upon us to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> we paſt that River in ſight
of their Army.</p>
            <p>My Commiſſion being void by the Death of Monſieur
<hi>de Turenne,</hi> I reſolv'd to leave the War; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great many more in the ſame circumſtances, we
form'd our ſelves into a little Troop, that we might be
able to defend our ſelves if we ſhould be attackt; for
beſides that the Country was full of <hi>Schepepans,</hi> a ſort
of people as dangerous as the Enemy, the <hi>Germans</hi> alſo
had paſt the <hi>Rhine</hi> after us, and fill'd the Country with
their Parties, and we met with one of them preſently,
with whom we engag'd, and had the good fortune ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to defeat them by plain force: We took the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
that commanded them Priſoner, and they that took
him having ſearcht him, they found a Paſsport in his
Pocket, which they brought to me, for they had made
choice of me to command them, till we ſhould be paſt
danger. This Paſsport ſeem'd ſomething particular to
me, for among us there was no body took Paſsports,
but ſuch as belong'd to ſome Garriſons; but they told
me they did not belong to the Body of the Army, but
to certain Troops which the Enemy had poſted in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places in <hi>Alſace.</hi> While he was talking with me, I
perceiv'd ſome Blood to run down his Coat, upon which
I told him, I doubted he was wounded; he told us he
was not, for he knew nothing of it; but when he ſaw
his Blood he chang'd colour immediately, and which
was very ſtrange, in a moment more he dropt down
dead; whether 'twas really from the greatneſs of the
Wound, or the ſurprize of it that ſeiz'd him, which I
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57806:165"/>
am more apt to believe; for certainly Fear is capable
of producing more extraordinary effects than that:
And the Marquis <hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles,</hi> Collonel of the Dauphin's
Regiment, told me a ſtory a few days ago, that at the
Battel of <hi>Caſſel,</hi> one of the Soldiers fell down dead in
the Ranks, before one ſhot was fir'd, juſt as they were
going to charge. 'Twas a great good fortune to us how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that this Man dy'd thus, without which, I, and all
my Troop, had been taken Priſoners, for we were
hardly got a League farther, before we met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party of the Enemies Horſe, who were at leaſt
three hundred ſtrong. I was a little ſurpriz'd, for our
Scouts had not had time to come to ask them who
they were for? But ſome of their body came up to
me, and askt me who we were? It came ſtrangely
into my Head, at the very moment, to make uſe of
the Paſsport, I told you of, and with a greater preſence
of mind than was uſual to me in ſuch caſes, I told them,
we belong'd to ſuch a Garriſon, naming the place the
dead Officer had belong'd to, and to confirm it I ſhow'd
them my Paſsport, which they taking for granted, let
us all go. 'Twas a great happineſs to me, that I was
pretty well Maſter of the <hi>German</hi> language, ſo that
they never imagin'd me to be a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was what deluded them moſt. Being thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
got out of their Clutches we purſued our Journey,
and arriv'd ſafely in <hi>France,</hi> where they had given over
all for loſt upon the Death of Mr. <hi>de Turenne.</hi> The
King himſelf indeed expected ſome diſaſter to fall out,
and therefore had ſent an Expreſs to the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
who was then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to put himſelf at the
Head of the Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> with all the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
imaginable. The <hi>Germans</hi> were ſet down before
<hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>genau,</hi> but the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> advancing with a
reſolution to fight them, they rais'd the Siege: They
had alſo appear'd before <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erne,</hi> and rais'd ſome Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and for three days together had fir'd upon the
Town, and thrown in a great many Bombs; but this
only ſerv'd to encourage us again, ſeeing they made no
better uſe of the advantage they had. I was juſt arriv'd
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57806:165"/>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> when the news of theſe things came thither;
but nothing ſurpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me like the ſtory they told of
ſome <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe Towns, who had got a way to put
out the Fuſe of the Bombs, juſt as they were going to
break. They threw themſelves deſperately upon them
with the Hide of an Ox juſt kill'd in their hands, and
ſtopping the Mouth of the Fuſe ſo that no Air could
get in, they put the Fuſe quite out. It had been a
brave contrivance for the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> to have had ſome of
theſe people with them, upon the late recounter we had
with them; which if they had their City, which was
the moſt magnificent in the world, had not been reduc'd
to that condition we are told it now lyes in.</p>
            <p>The death of Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was daily in my
thoughts, and if I had had the leaſt inclination to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
I believe this alone would have caus'd me to
have retir'd to a Cloiſter; but that ſort of life having
been always my averſion, I made no advantage of the
example that great man left me, who had reſolv'd to
retire himſelf among the Fathers of the Oratory if ever
he had out-liv'd the War. I ſpeak this to my own
ſhame, that an old Fellow as I was of above threeſcore
and ten, ſhould be ſo fond of the World at that Age;
that I could not be perſwaded to forſake it. To ſpeak
the truth, I did not ſeem ſo old as I was, as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for tho I might have been truſted ſafely enough with
Women, yet my Age it ſeems did not appear ſo much,
but that I was capable of making ſome people jealous:
Indeed I was the occaſion that a Gentleman of <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
whoſe name I ſhall conceal, made a pretty ſort of an
eſſay upon his Wife, which might have been a fine Hiſtory
if it had been publick, for being become extraordinary
jealous of his Wife, he gets him a Fryers habit, one of
the ſame ſort he knew his Wife went to Confeſſion to,
and having brib'd her Page to be true to him, he order'd
it ſo that when ſhe ſent the boy for her Confeſſor, he
ſhould bring her word that he was not well, but that
he had ſent one of his Fellows of the Order. In the
mean time her Husband dreſt himſelf in the habit, and
went to her Chamber, which being a dark Room, he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57806:166"/>
did not fear being diſcover'd; being there, he began to
make ſtrange work with her, for he inſtead of acting
the Confeſſor, examin'd her particularly if ſhe had not
entertain'd me, and ſhe could not imagine why after
all ſhe could ſay to him, ſtill he repeated the ſame
queſtion to her over and over, which he did alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf of ſome other ſuſpicion which he had in
his head, if I might believe what ſhe told me the next
day; he got nothing from her but what ſhe did not care
if all the World knew: But the truth was ſhe knew
him by his voice which made her be cautious, and ſhe
had Wit enough not to let him perceive it; but both
made a jeſt of their Religion, one to ſatisfy his jealouſy,
and to find out, if it had been poſſible, the Intrigues of
his Wife, and the t'other, to cure his Jealouſy if ſhe
could, which only made him ill natur'd.</p>
            <p>While I ſpent my time thus, the Kings Army had
enough to do to repulſe the <hi>Germans,</hi> and hardly cou'd
keep them from preſſing into <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; for the
death of Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was not the only misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that befel us, for there happen'd a worſe at <hi>Treves,</hi>
were the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> was ſo intirely beaten,
that we have very rarely heard of ſuch a defeat; moſt
people, eſpecially thoſe that did not know how things
were carry'd, thought the accident which befel M. <hi>Vignori,</hi>
the Governour of <hi>Treves,</hi> was the occaſion; they thought
I ſay that he having agreed with Mr. <hi>de Crequi</hi> to ſally
out and fall upon the Enemies Rear, and being kill'd
in the march, which the General knew nothing of, was
the cauſe of the diſaſter, it being impoſſible to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all things, but I muſt explain this; for Mr. <hi>de Crequi</hi>
knew well enough before that his Horſe had thrown him
and broke his Neck, the Kings Lieutenant of <hi>Treves</hi>
having ſent him word of it by an Expreſs: the real occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the misfortune was, that inſtead of 200 Horſe,
which he had ordered to go out to forrage, the order
was miſtaken, and all the Horſe went out, ſo that when
the Enemy appear'd, there was no Horſe to receive the
Charge or to cover the Foot. However 'twas, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57806:166"/>
perplext the Court very much, if the Enemy cou'd
have made the beſt of their advantage, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
among themſelves were the occaſion, that it all
ended with the taking the City of <hi>Treves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had followed a courſe of Life for four years paſt
which was very agreeable to me, and tho one would
have thought I ſhould have lov'd my eaſe better, yet
I could not be quiet but I muſt return to the Wars,
but I could find no opportunity, for every body knew
me, and I was aſham'd at my years to go and beg an
employ, ſo I was forc't to ſit ſtill whether I would or
no; I know not whether my diſquiet at this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe brought me to it, but at laſt I began to be
out of order, and in ſeven or eight days I was ſo bad,
that I was given over by all people; my Diſtemper
was a Dyſſentery, and tho they could find no way to
ſtop it, yet I was of ſo ſtrong a conſtitution, that I do
not think I was ſounder at 25 years of Age; from
whence I could not believe I was ſo ill as they ſaid I
was, and no body would tell me of it, but ſeeing my
<hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> cry, I would know what was the
matter with him, and he told me it was becauſe the
Chyrurgeon had told him I was a dead man; I ſay the
Chyrurgeon becauſe you muſt know I fell ſick in the
Country, and having no Doctor at hand, I would not
let them ſend for one: I was not frighted at what the
Boy ſaid, but finding my diſtemper increaſe, I ſent to
<hi>Paris</hi> for a Horſe Litter to carry me thither, being about
12 miles off; being brought thither I ſent for a Doctor
that us'd to come to me, one <hi>Jonquet,</hi> and the firſt thing
he askt me was, if I had not had a debauch; I askt him
what he meant by it, for there was ſeveral ſorts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches;
that if he meant of women, I had not been a
hater of the Sex in my time, but he told me he meant as
to Wine, adding withal that if it was from that, he
would not undertake me, for it would be impoſſible to
recover me; I aſſur'd him there was no ſuch thing, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he told me then there was hope, however
he would promiſe me nothing, for I was ancient and
therefore he advis'd me to ſend for a Prieſt, and make
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57806:167"/>
ters even for another World, I believ'd him, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf wholly to Gods mercy and the Doctors art; he
took me into his management, and kept me in his
hands five Months intire, in which time I took ſome
Phyſick or other of him every other day: This is a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
every one may not believe, that one of ſeventy years
old ſhould hold out ſo long in a Diſtemper, that often
diſpatches younger men in half the time; at laſt, my
Phyſitian coming to ſee me told me, 'twould be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to him to take any more of my Money, and do me
no more good; that all that he could think of to give
me, or all that he could be inform'd of in conſultation
with others, ſerv'd indeed to keep me alive, but not at
all to recover me, and therefore he would come and ſee
me as a Friend but not as a Phyſitian. This was in ſhort
to tell me had given me over, however, tho both from
my Diſtemper and my Age I had reaſon enough to fear,
yet I had no apprehenſion on me, I only deſir'd him, to
continue his good Offices, and come to ſee me as he us'd
to do, but he like a very honeſt man, would not take
any more Money; and tho my diſtemper held me four
Months longer, he never fail'd coming to ſee me: I
ſhould tell you a lye if I ſhould ſay, I was in as much
pain all that time as I was before, for I had a great deal
of eaſe to what I us'd to have, but being not at all cur'd,
and reſolv'd if 'twere poſſible, whate re it coſt, to get
rid of the Diſtemper, I had recourſe to a thouſand
Quacks and Mountebanks to relieve me, and I took a
world of Slops and Drugs, but finding all was to no
more purpoſe, than what Mr. <hi>Jonquet</hi> had done already,
I ſent for one Father <hi>Ange,</hi> a Capuchin, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an admirable man for theſe ſort of things; when
he came in, I told him a long ſtory of what I had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by this Diſtemper, and that I hop'd he could tell
me of ſomething to cure me, he reply'd in a doleful Air,
that he had known ſeveral that had languiſh'd a longer
time under the ſame Diſtemper than I, that the Duke
of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> had had it four years together, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this might hold me as long; if I had been able I
believe I ſhould have beaten him to hear him talk in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57806:167"/>
ſuch a manner; but I was grown ſo weak that the
leaſt puff would have blown me down almoſt; ſo I
was forc'd to take it patiently, and only askt him if he
could tell me of any thing to do me good, at leaſt that
I might get ſome reſt, for I had not ſlept, as I may ſay, in 8
months, and 'twas that which weaken'd me ſo extreamly.
The good Man to pacify me, brought me the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a miraculous Syrup, which beſides its Vertue, was ſo
pleaſant to the taſte, that I thought when I took it, I was
drinking Rasberry-water. I ſlept after it 12 hours without
waking; and when he came to ſee what effect it had
on me, I embrac'd him, and aſſur'd him, that I ſhould
be bound to acknowledge the remainder of my life was
owing to him. But I began to rejoyce a little too ſoon,
for all the other remedies he gave me, were ſo far from
having the ſame effect, that they only put Nature into
a ferment; and all the benefit I had, was that I found it
eaſy to take his Medicines, for they were all as pleaſant
as the firſt; ſo I diſmiſt Father <hi>Ange,</hi> as I had
done all the reſt: And I believe this unhappy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
had ſtill been my Companion, if Madam <hi>d' Ort,</hi>
Siſter to the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> had not happen'd
to come to <hi>Paris.</hi> I was acquainted with her, but more
particularly with her Husband, who was a very brave
Gentleman; ſhe enquiring after her old Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
hearing what a pitiful condition I was reduc'd to, came
to ſee me, and brought with her a certain ſort of Bread,
which ſhe had made up like a Cake, which I had no
ſooner eaten of, but I found my ſelf perfectly cur'd: I
have carry'd ſome of it about me ever ſince, and I think
I may ſay it has been the preſerver of my life.</p>
            <p>'Twas impoſſible to be brought lower than I was;
yet this good effect my affliction had, that it made me
more ſenſible of the things of another world than I had
been formerly; I went to Church a little oftner than I
us'd; and in ſhort, I began to remember, that I was ſome
time or other to dye: On this account having heard of
a certain Capuchin, call'd Father <hi>Marc d' Avano,</hi> who
was reported to work Miracles, I had the curioſity to go
and ſee him. I took Poſt from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:57806:168"/>
where I heard he was; but being told he was newly
gone from thence for <hi>Germany,</hi> I follow'd him, and
overtook him in the Country of <hi>Gueldres.</hi> I had no
occaſion to make much enquiry after him, for all the
Road was crowded with people, who came, as I did,
from all parts to ſee him. But tho every one told me
with great earneſtneſs, that they had ſeen him cure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Diſeaſes, and particularly the lame; yet tho I
look'd with all the Eyes I had, I could ſee nothing of
it, only that the vogue was got ſo into the heads of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he had never leſs than an hundred thouſand
people about him, where-ever he quartred, and made a
figure like the Entry of ſome great Prince; they built
Scaffolds, and paid for ſtanding at Windows to ſee him
go by. My zeal having made me as much a Fool as the
reſt, it was not long before I repented it, for the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
I was got upon to ſee him, breaking with the weight
of the people, I fell down from a place ſeven or eight
foot high, and broke one of my Arms; ſeveral others
had the like misfortune, or were as much hurt; but tho
they ſay 'tis a comfort to have companions in affliction,
I found none from it now, and the rather, becauſe I
was in a Country, where 'twas a rare thing to
get a good Surgeon. I ſent about for one of the beſt,
but they brought me one that underſtood no more
than one of our Apprentices in <hi>France;</hi> and after
he had very roughly handled me for about three weeks,
I found it was ſo ill ſet, that 'twas all to be done over
again. I repented a thouſand times of my Devotion,
and curs'd the people that put this ſtory of Father <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi>
into my head; but all this did not cure me, I found
my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf reduc'd to the neceſſity of carrying my Arm to
<hi>Paris,</hi> in the condition 'twas then in; or elſe to put my
ſelf into the hand of the Hangman of <hi>Ruremond.</hi> This
man underſtood ſetting of bones, as well as breaking
them, and had got ſuch a name for it, that ſeveral
Gentlemen told me, all people who thought themſelves
ill cur'd by others, went to him. It ſeem'd an odd
thing to me, to apply my ſelf to the Hangman; but
conſidering, I was but in an ill condition to be carry'd
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57806:168"/>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> I e'en deliver'd my ſelf over to him, like a
condemn'd perſon in deſpair: Being come to his
Houſe, I told him what had happen'd to me, and askt
him if he could do me any good; to which he ſurlily
reply'd, with the true air of a Hangman, that he had
cur'd thoſe that had been worſe than I; he took hold
of my Arm and ſtretcht it out; and whether it was that
he handled me a little rudely, or the averſion I had
to the Man, I know not, but I thought he had done me
a prejudice, and I gave him ſuch a look as would not
have pleas'd him, if he had ſeen it: However, after
telling me, that he who had had me in hand was a ſorry
ignorant fellow, and making it out by a great many
terms of Art, which I have forgot, he askt me if I had any
body to hold me, while he perform'd his Operation; I told
him no, and I thought there would be no need, I hop'd I
had courage enough to bear it; and I ſuppos'd all the
pain he would put me to, would not force me to cry out.
He ſhook his head at that, which was as much as to ſay
he believ'd ne'r a word of it, and told me he was not ſuch
a Coxcomb to attempt it upon that ſuppoſition; but
ſince I had no body with me, he would have ſome of
his own people for that purpoſe, and that he muſt ſtay
for them, for they were gone upon a ſmall Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about a league or two off. This little Execution he
talkt of was; they had been breaking a Man upon
the Wheel that had kill'd his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by and by they
came home, and with their hands all bloody, lay'd
hold of me, juſt methought as they had been doing
to that Murtherer. The Maſter took hold of my Arm,
and broke it again in an inſtant, without any engine but
his hands, but not without ſuch exquiſite pain to me,
that he had good reaſon to tell me I muſt be held. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I was very well ſatisfy'd in going to him, ſor I
was well again in a few days, and never felt any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in that Arm ſince, any more than if it had never
been hurt.</p>
            <p>At laſt this War ended, after it had held three
years, and all was concluded by the Peace of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi>
as much to the Kings advantage, as the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57806:169"/>
Campaign had been; for he had found out the way to
divide his Enemies in ſuch a manner, that inſtead of
uniting their common intereſts, they fell into private
Treaties with him, and every one made their Peace as
well as they could. This was ſuch a falſe ſtep as the
like was never known, and they ſoon found their error.
Aſſoon as ever the King had ſeparated them, he lays hold
of the opportunity with his uſual policy; and as he had
ſeen by the War, that his Kingdom would never be
perfectly at eaſe, while <hi>Luxemburg</hi> continued in the
hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he reſolv'd therefore to have it
in exchange for <hi>Aloſt,</hi> which he had pretenſions to of
another ſort. This was not ſuch a Chimera neither as
ſome people pretend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. The King having taken <hi>Aloſt,</hi>
among ſeveral other Towns, in the courſe of this War,
and the Treaty of Peace expreſſing, that all ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
ſhould remain to him, as were not mention'd
particularly in the Treaty, this was doubtleſs his own,
there being not the leaſt notice of it taken in the ſaid
Treaty; all the Objection was, that he had kept no
Garriſon in it, and ſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſaid it was actually
put into their power again, aſſoon as ever we had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
it. But the King return'd, that he had left it
to the keeping of the Inhabitants, who had always been
their own Maſters, and therefore he would ſtand by
the Letter of the Treaty. In ſhort, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
but to decide the matter by the Sword, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who had been
Mediat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r of the Treaty, and was Guarantee of the Peace.
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſuſpecting, that Prince not to be ſo
much their friend as that requir'd, choſe rather to name
Commiſſioners to accommodate the matter; the King
did the like, and they appointed the Town of <hi>Courtrai</hi>
for their meeting; which having produc'd nothing but
arguments Pro and Con, and no concluſion appearing
likely to be made, the King order'd <hi>Luxemburg</hi> to be
inveſted.</p>
            <p>Every body thought this would kindle the fire again,
and that the War would break out hotter than ever.
The neighbouring Princes were ſo alarm'd, that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57806:169"/>
they diſpatcht Orders to their Envoys at both Courts,
to try if 'twere poſſible to ſoften the matter, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the miſeries that threatned upon a rupture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
it was impoſſible to adjuſt it, the King would have
<hi>Luxemburg</hi> or <hi>Aloſt;</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſaw, 'twas
equally inconvenient to them to part with either; if
they gave up <hi>Luxemburg</hi> they ſhut out their Succors from
<hi>Germany,</hi> from whence they muſt come; if they
granted <hi>Aloſt,</hi> it was to give away one of the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
in all <hi>Flanders,</hi> the income from that Bailliage
bringing in a Revenue of 1600000 Livres a year; and
beſides, the juriſdiction of it extended even to the Gates
of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> on one ſide, and <hi>Ghent</hi> on the other: ſo that
it would be to block up both thoſe Cities. And to ſay
all in a word, in the neceſſity they had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to, the King taught them which to chooſe; for
his Majeſty having more mind to <hi>Luxemburg</hi> than to
<hi>Aloſt,</hi> ſent them word that was better for his turn
than the t'other: But he had not the gift of perſwaſion
neither, if they could have helpt it; but <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
in the mean time continu'd blockt up, which if it had
not, he muſt have made uſe of ſome force to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
his paſſage on that ſide the Country. The King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſaw himſelf in no condition to reſiſt ſuch
powerful forces by himſelf, had ſent orders to avoid the
quarrel if poſſible; ſo that the Souldiers were wholly
unprovided when they ſhould have come to fight. Theſe
things will hardly be believ'd in times to come, but
ſince there is no other Hiſtory, I believe, will mention
them, I hope the moſt incredulous will take my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of them; and if I have given an account of theſe
things, 'twas not that I was really preſent there, or that
I am troubled with that itch of ſcribbling, to write of
thoſe things which has already employ'd the Pens of ſo
many worthy men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould have ſaid leſs of this affair,
had I not been oblig'd to mention it upon the account
of my Nephew, whom I ſhall ſpeak of preſently, and of an
accident which happen'd to him, which had certainly
been his utter ruine, if he had not found very good
friends to appear for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:57806:170"/>
He had quitted the Kings Regiment, where, as I ſaid
before, I had plac'd him, and had put himſelf into the
Cavalry, where his inclinations led him to ſerve, and
was made a Captain meerly on the account of merit,
for a very gallant action which he had perform'd; and
tho it be not proper for an Unkle to praiſe one of his
near Relations, yet I muſt not omit, that he had a very
good reputation in the Regiment; but ſo it hapned, that
in one day he loſt all that eſteem he had obtain'd, which
nevertheleſs was not ſo much his fault, as that by his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Luxemburg</hi> was prevented falling into our hands at
that time. We had been already a good while before
the Town, and the Garriſon began to feel the want of
many things, and above all of Money, for want of
which the Governor could not ſubſiſt his Men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reſolv'd to ſend ſome body to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to get
ſome in if poſſible. He fixt upon three perſons for this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
the Count <hi>de Walſaſtine,</hi> and two other Officers,
and he order'd Capt. <hi>Gregorie,</hi> an old Soldier, for their
guard, who knew all the by-ways round the Town for
twenty miles together. <hi>Gregorie</hi> found means to get
them clear well enough, but we having ſome people
in the Town, who gave us an account of every thing
that paſt, we had advice not only of their going out,
but of their errand to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and could have trac'd
them thither if it had been needful; but we contented
our ſelves to watch them ſo exactly, as to be ſure of them
as they came back. Our Spies look'd out ſo well,
that we had certain advice when <hi>Gregorie</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
were come within a days journey of the Town,
whereupon ſeveral Parties were ſent out, one of which
was commanded by my Nephew; it happen'd that
<hi>Gregorie</hi> fell into his Ambuſcade in particular, and they
being but about ſeventeen Horſe, and my Nephew
above ſixty, they thought it their beſt courſe to retreat,
and ſo made off towards <hi>Treves:</hi> My Nephew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
him kept ſo cloſe to him, that he was forced to
take into the Town, and appear'd at the Gates
almoſt aſſoon as he; but the <hi>Germans</hi> not favouring our
party, deny'd him entrance, on pretence that they
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57806:170"/>
muſt firſt go and ask leave of the Governour, my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
told them, in ſhort, the King would have a ſevere
ſatisfaction for this falſeneſs; but 'twas all one, they
made them ſtay a full hour at the Ports; in which time
Captain <hi>Gregorie</hi> and the Count <hi>de Walſaſtine</hi> conſulted
together what to do, whether they ſhould ſtay in the
Town, or go out another way, but at laſt they reſelv'd
to ſtay in the Town; ſo they took up in an Inn which
had a private back door, againſt which they threw a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat
heap of Horſe-dung. The Governor of <hi>Treves,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
by this time they had ſecur'd themſelves, orders
the Troop to be let in; and my Nephew being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rm'd,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were in that Inn, he quarter'd his
people all thereabouts, and having viſited all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
he plac'd Centinels at every place which he
thought proper; but ſeeing the Dunghil which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
he never imagin'd there ſhould be a door the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.
In the mean time, <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to amuſe him, and that he
might not imagin he would be ſtirring that night, made
a ſtrange revelling in the Inn, and ſuch a noiſe as if they
had been all drunk, and appear'd at the Windows with
Glaſſes of Wine in their hands, and this they got ſome
<hi>Germans</hi> to continue all night. The Centinels made no
queſtion but 'twas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> all the night; while in
the mean time they open'd the falſe door I told you of,
and threw aſide the Dung, and went about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
My Nephew knew nothing of their going till twas
quite day, when finding how 'twas, and underſtanding
they were gone towards <hi>Coblentz,</hi> he follow'd them.
Tho <hi>Gregorie</hi> was a great way before them, yet his
Horſes were ſo fatigu'd, that he was afraid of being
overtaken before he got to the Town; wherefore ſeeing
a little Chapel upon the road, he reſolv'd to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of that, and to defend it if my Nephew ſhould
attack him; but his ill fate would not put it into his
head to look there. So that paſſing by without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
them, <hi>Gregorie</hi> came out, and advis'd the Count
<hi>de Walſaſtine,</hi> and the two others, who carry'd the
Money, to venture with it alone. It was the beſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
that could poſſibly be given, for our Parties were
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57806:171"/>
very vigilant, and upon the ſcout on every ſide; the
Count <hi>de Walſaſtine</hi> took his directions, and with the
two Officers betook themſelves to the Woods; but they
ſtaid three days before they could get along, and had
ſtaid longer, but that they were forc'd to venture for
meer hunger; Fortune favour'd their Vigilance, for
they paſt undiſcover'd in the night, juſt between two
Squadrons of our Troops. They got into <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
in very good time, where the want of Money was ſo
great, that the Governour would not have known what
to do if they had ſtaid any longer.</p>
            <p>As for Captain <hi>Gregorie,</hi> he wandred a long time in
the Woods, before he could get in; but all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
being <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> he found means to ſubſiſt, and ſo was
not in ſuch neceſſity but that he might wait for a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
occaſion, which at laſt offer'd it ſelf, and he got ſafe
into the Town; the Governor, who had been in great
pain for him, was overjoy'd to ſee him return without
the loſs of a Man. We had News every moment from
ths Town, and when the Hiſtory of this Eſcape came to
the Army, all were enrag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d at my Nephew, for letting
him eſcape ſo; they wrote the account of it to the
Court, and very luckily for him, I was gone that very
day to <hi>St. Germains.</hi> I had ſome Friends in the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's
Office, and among the reſt Monſieur <hi>de Charpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
under Mr. <hi>de Louvois,</hi> a very civil obliging Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and always ready to do offices of kindneſs
to every body; he ſeeing me coming from Maſs at
the King's Chapel, deſir'd me to come and dine with
him. I was going to excuſe my ſelf, for that I had
promis'd to dine with a Friend: <hi>I don't ask you,</hi> ſaid he,
whiſpering in my ear, <hi>for the good chear you ſhall find
there, but to inform you of ſomething which concerns you.</hi>
He ſaid no more to me then, having another man in
his Company, who he was not willing ſhould know
what he had to tell me; but this was enough for me to
put off any other appointment. So I went to him, and
there I had the whole ſtory; after thanking him for his
information, I ask'd him what I had beſt to do in it;
he told me I ſhould go to Monſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and not
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57806:171"/>
ſeem to be ſurpriz'd at what he ſhould ſay to me; that
I ſhould let him ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on and ſay what he would, and
only tell him, that this was a miſchance might have
happen'd to any body as well as my Nephew, and that
he had never had the misfortune to diſpleaſe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and that if he would pleaſe to pardon him this,
it would oblige him to greater circumſpection; he told
me ſeveral other things I ſhould ſay, which I obſerv'd
exactly, but I found Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> in ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that inſtead of hearing me ſpeak, he told me, that
he thought he ought to make out a proceſs againſt ſuch
a man as he; that if he had taken the Count <hi>de Walſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
he had taken <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> and he was going to
inform the King, how much he was beholding to him;
I begg'd of him not to do ſo with all the ſubmiſſion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
but he was not a man to be mov'd with pitiful
words, and he had certainly done as he ſaid, had not a
Courier very happily arriv'd at the inſtant, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him into his Cloſet, gave me time to go and
ſeek ſome friends to ſpeak to him: <hi>Monſieur</hi> the <hi>Grand
Maſter</hi> did me the moſt ſervice, for he would not
leave him till he had promis'd his favour to my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew;
having thus happily made his peace, I ſent him
word who he ow'd the obligation to, that he might not
be ungrateful, but above all I order'd him to thank
Monſieur <hi>Charpentier,</hi> without whom it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to have hindred his ruine.</p>
            <p>I came acquainted with the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> by the
means of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Vitri,</hi> who was I think one
of the beſt of Women, and of whom I ſhall always
have a good opinion, for all that has been ſaid of her
Conduct in the World. I had very great obligations to
that Lord, yet ſeeing him one time when I was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a viſit; take a great deal of pleaſure to reflect
on her, I deſired him to do me the favour to refrain from
ſuch diſcourſe, aſſuring him if he did not, I muſt
go out of the Room; he told me he was glad to ſee me
take my friends part ſo vigorouſly, but he hop'd I did
think that which he then ſpoke was not out of malice,
and that he only talkt ſo to ſee if I could make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57806:172"/>
for her; for all the world could tell him, that ſhe
kept a certain young <hi>German,</hi> whom ſhe had rais'd from
a Lackey to be her <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and from that to be
Maſter of her Horſe, but he would ſay no more becauſe
ſhe was a friend of mine; the beſt could be ſaid tho was
this, that ſhe had ſhewn affection enough for him to
marry him; and for his part he believ'd, they either were
already contracted, or marry'd upon Honor. I know not
how he came by theſe particulars, but the truth was, that
Lady manag'd her ſelf ſo unhappily with that fellow,
that every body reflected on her for it; but while we
were talking about it, came in Monſieur <hi>de la Tonr,</hi>
who had marry'd Madamoiſelle <hi>de Vitri,</hi> and I preſently
gueſt 'twas all from him, and that he did it in revenge
becauſe ſhe had oppos'd his Marriage. His coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
our diſcourſe, but I reſolv'd to inform Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Vitri</hi> of it; but that ſhe might not take ill my
freedom with her, I us'd a great deal of precaution in it:
I told her, if ſhe would promiſe not to take unkindly
one thing I had to ſay to her, I would inform her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that ſhould not be to her diſadvantage; ſhe told
me I ſhould not ſcruple ſaying any thing to her; and
after having made a great many proteſtations, that I
ſhould extremely oblige her, I told her, that being in
company with a certain Duke, I heard her ſo ſeverely
reflected on concerning her converſation with one of her
Servants, that tho I was very much concern'd for her,
yet I was ſcarce able to juſtifie her conduct. I aſſur'd
her however, that I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of her
Vertue, and would anſwer for her to all the world bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for body; but if ſhe would permit me to ſpeak ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to her, this Groom was a fellow that deſerv'd to
be handſomly chaſtis'd, ſince, when he knew what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
the world took of it, inſtead of behaving himſelf
cautiouſly to prevent the ſpreading of ſuch a noiſe, he
had encreas'd it by his impudence, and had made peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
believe what really never was; that I knew he had
pull'd out handfuls of Money among his Comrades,
which was as much as to ſay, that he who had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of ſomething ſo extraordinary, could want for
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57806:172"/>
nothing; that this I had taken notice of in particular,
but there were a multitude of ſuch like paſſages;
tho without troubling her with ſuch trifles, I left it to
her ſelf to judge, if this was to be ſuffer'd in ſuch a
fellow.</p>
            <p>Tho ſhe had ſaid a thouſand things to urge me to be
very free with her, yet I perceiv'd ſhe was very uneaſie
at my diſcourſe, her colour came, and ſhe bluſht
like fire when I touch'd ſome particular points; and
when I had done, inſtead of flying out on the Raſcal I
had ſo plainly detected before her, ſhe exclaim'd vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
on her Son-in-law, who ſhe ſaid was the Author of
all theſe Calumnies. It was to no purpoſe in the world for
me to ſwear and deny it, ſhe did not believe me, or at
leaſt ſhe pretended not to believe me; but at the ſame
time threatned what ſhe would do to him; and ſhe
gave proofs of her good will in a few days, in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſell a fine Eſtate ſhe had about <hi>Nemours,</hi> that it
might not come to him: The ſumm being at leaſt four
hundred thouſand Francs, ſhe could not ſoon find a
Chapman; and Mr. <hi>de la Tour</hi> did all he could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
people againſt it, when he ſaw them inclin'd to
it. Indeed her conduct in this affair was inexcuſable,
not only on that account, but as ſhe had ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
as to tell the fellow all I had ſaid to her. He,
who, tho he had chang'd his habit, had ſtill the ſervile
ſpirit of a Foot-boy, durſt not expreſs his reſentment
to me; but he had ſuch an influence upon his Miſtreſs,
that ſhe let me ſee it in her countenance, which was
enough to have taught me to deſiſt, and if ſhe
had a mind to ruine herſelf, to give her liberty:
Indeed 'tis ſo with all the world, and a man ought
not to attempt doing people good againſt their will;
but as I did every thing different from other people, I
went to her again as I us'd to do, and told her, that for
all her diſpleaſure at me, I was reſolv'd to let her ſee
how entirely I was devoted to her, and therefore came
to tell her, that in endeavouring to ſell her Eſtate, ſhe
made the world talk of her more than ever: That now
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57806:173"/>
they ſaid, for Money to give the Groom, ſhe would
ſell the Inheritance of her Family, and ruine her only
Daughter; that ſhe might eaſily gueſs what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this would be, ſince a perſon of her quality
muſt needs be more ſenſibly touch'd with ſuch reports
than other people; that her Family, and that of her
Husbands too, were concern'd and at ſtake; and if I
might venture to tell her what I had been told, there
were not wanting thoſe that had reſolv'd, by ſome
means or other, to diſpatch the Raſcal that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
her, and made her the common talk and jeſt of
the Town.</p>
            <p>Nothing that I could ever ſay to this Lady, made
ſuch an impreſſion upon her as this laſt circumſtance;
ſhe enquir'd who it was that told me ſo, but finding
me unwilling to name any names, ſhe preſt me to it by
all the intreaties and good words poſſible; but I begg'd
her pardon for not proceeding any further, which made
her imagin I had made the ſtory my ſelf. I told her
ſhe was at liberty to believe what ſhe pleas'd, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
time would make it appear too true, that I was
wholly incapable either of adding to, or diminiſhing
from the truth: Upon which I left her without any
more ceremony. The next day, paſſing thro the ſtreet
where ſhe liv'd, I met Mr. <hi>Theodore,</hi> (that was the
name of the Groom) who thinking he had to do with
one of his own ſort, comes up to me, and tells me, I
was well ſet a work to go and tell ſuch a parcel of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
ſtories to his Miſtriſs. He had no ſooner
ſpoke the words, but without any other reply, I gave
him his reward with two or three good rubs over the
Shoulders with my Cane, at which he was ſo ſurpriz'd,
that he did not ſo much as offer to put his hand to his
Sword. In the mean time he took another method to
revenge himſelf, and gets an order to have me before
the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and did not queſtion, I ſuppoſe,
but according to their uſual ſeverity, I ſhould have been
ſent to Priſon. But I having acquainted the Mareſchal
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> of the matter, before whom that Court was
held; and alſo that ſuch a fellow as he had not a right to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57806:173"/>
ſummon before them; he could have no Audience
there, but was referred back to the common courſe of
Juſtice, and there I had been before hand with him, by
the advice of a cunning fellow I employ'd, ſo that he
was ſurpriz'd, when coming to get a Warrant for me,
he found himſelf arreſted by vertue of a Judgment I
had obtain'd againſt him in the ſame Caſe. Madam <hi>de
Vitri</hi> was but ill pleas'd with me on this account, and
had told ſome of my Friends, that I had ſo little
reſpect for her as to abuſe one of her Servants; that
ſhe had always had a great reſpect for me, but ſhe
would never forgive me this as long as ſhe liv'd. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
them to inform her that I was provok'd to it by his
ſawcy language; that it was true I might have conſider'd
that I ought not to have been provok'd by any thing
ſuch a fellow could ſay, but one is not always Maſter
of ones paſſion; beſides a Man ought always to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his own honour; and if I had fail'd in that, yet
I deſir'd her to conſider, that having a Sword by my
ſide, I ought ſo much the leſs to bear ſuch affronts as
thoſe. Another would perhaps have thought theſe
excuſes reaſonable, but Monſieur <hi>Theodore</hi> having a
greater influence upon her than I, ſhe was not at all
moderated, but continued as furious as ever. I did not
much trouble my head with it, having the ſatisfaction
of the general approbation in what I had done. Indeed
I dare ſay ſhe govern'd herſelf more by her humour
than her reaſon, as appear'd ſoon after in her ſelling her
Land for half the value, to Monſieur <hi>de Boisfranc,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of the houſhold to the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> this
enrag'd all her Relations againſt her, and the report
went that to make Mr. <hi>Theodore</hi> amends, for the affront
I had put upon him, ſhe gave him good part of
the Money; Monſieur <hi>de la Tour</hi> who had the greateſt
concern, finding things went thus, thought he ought
not any longer to ſuffer this Wretch; however before
he did any thing, he thought 'twould be beſt to theaten
him, to ſee if he could make him run away of his own
accord; the deſign ſucceeded, for Monſieur <hi>Theodore</hi>
ſeeing that all the world was bent againſt him, marcht
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57806:174"/>
off with his Money, without ſo much as taking leave of
his Dutcheſs, and if we may give any heed to the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Chronicle,</hi> ſhe laid it ſo to heart, that it was the
cauſe of her death. This is true tho, that ſhe liv'd not
long after his departure, and it had been better for Mr. <hi>de
la Tour</hi> that he had gone 4 or 5 years before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e had not
then ſquandred away the beſt part of her Eſtate, nor
loſt her Reputation, which before was ſo great, that no
Lady could have a better.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Blockade of <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
all this while inveſted, and tho the arrival of
the Count <hi>de Walſaſtine</hi> gave new courage to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
yet the relief he brought could not laſt always,
and that being waſted they were reduc'd to the ſame
condition they were in before; this made the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
very thoughtful, but at laſt he committed one error,
for which, if he had been a Subject of <hi>France,</hi> he would
at leaſt have loſt his Government, if not his Head. When
our Forces firſt approach'd, he brings a noiſe of Muſick
to the Ramparts, as much as to ſay, he was very glad
to ſee us, and that we had oblig'd him in giving him an
opportunity to ſhow his Courage, and upon that made
ſeveral Balls and Rejoycings in the Town; but he never
conſider'd that he had to do with Enemies, who knew
how to dance to other ſorts of Inſtruments, and whoſe
Courage had been too well ſhown in the late War, to be
ſuſpected; and if I may be allowed to make a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſion,
I would ſay if they had been attackt by plain
force, it might, for ought I know, have fared with
them as it did with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> at the Siege of
<hi>Lerida.</hi> He being fluſht with a multitude of Victories,
which he had gain'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and imagining that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was bound to follow him into <hi>Catalonia</hi> or where
he pleas'd, not at all concern'd at the misfortune that had
befallen the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> the year before, he
brings his Violins to play in the Trenches, and not
content with this, he ſends to tell the Governour,
that he would give him every day ſuch Serenades; to
which the Governour anſwer'd, he would endeavour to
return his civilities, but begg'd his pardon till the next
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57806:174"/>
day, his Violins being out of order, but he would take
care they ſhould be in a readineſs by that time; his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
were a peal from his Cannon, which he caus'd to
fire without any intermiſſion, and in the heat of it
he ſally'd out and fell upon the Trenches with a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
fury: The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſtood him gallantly,
and there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as no Courage wanting in him to beat
him back into the Town, but being not ſo well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
as he ought, he was forc'd to give ground,
leaving at leaſt ſeven or eight hundred of his men upon
the ſpot.</p>
            <p>Now if I might be ſuffer'd to give my opinion of ſo
great a Captain, I think he was very much to blame,
for where is the jeſt of theſe ſort of Bravado's? are not
there a thouſand other ways for a man to ſignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and if one comes to be baulk't, as it happen'd here to
the Prince, how fooliſh does it look? but I won't run
too much on this ſubject. To go on with the buſineſs of
<hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> the Governour was a man of great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and he muſt have degenerated from his family if
he had been otherwiſe, for it has been a houſe which has
produc'd a great many Gentlemen of extraordinary
worth; and the action which I am blaming him for,
proceeded indeed rather from an exceſs than a want
of Courage; however he ought to conſider that even
too much Courage is an inexcuſable fault in a General
or Governour of a Town, tho it may be allow'd in a
Souldier; however there was leſs reflection made on
him, for this affair, than for another of a different
nature which happen'd ſoon after, and 'twas this
I meant, when I ſaid he had been very ſeverely puniſht
for it, had he been in our ſervice; being one Night at a
Ball within the Town, he happen'd to have ſome words
with a Collonel of the Garriſon call'd <hi>Cantelmo,</hi> who
thinking himſelf affronted, whiſper'd him in the Ear,
that if it would oblige him he would give him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
immediately: The Governour took him at his
word, and without ſo much as conſidering that he had
an Enemy under his Walls, he withdrew from the Ball
without any noiſe, and was immediately at the place
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57806:175"/>
appointed, in a by Street of the Town; the Governours
Second was the Count <hi>de Walſaſtine,</hi> and <hi>Cantelmo</hi>'s an
under Officer of his Regiment; their Footmen had
Flambeaus to light them, and tho the buſineſs held but
a little while, yet there was ſome blood ſhed; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
gave <hi>Cantelmo</hi> a thruſt in the ſide, which
glanc'd along upon his Ribs, and whether it was that
the Collonel thought himſelf wounded worſe than he
was, or that his feet ſlipt, it was not known, but he fell
down, and the Governour coming up to him, he askt
his life, and was going to deliver his Sword; when the
Officer who was his Second ſeeing the danger his Coll.
was in, flew to his reſcue with ſuch fury, that he had
run the Governour thro and thro if the Footmen had
not ſtept in and kept him off with their Flambeaus,
which they run juſt in his face, and ſo the battel ended,
for they knockt him down juſt by his Coll. and the
Count <hi>de Walſaſtine</hi> being come up to the Governour,
they eaſily maſter'd the other two who were down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
If the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who lay before the
Town, had had orders to have attackt it, no doubt he
might have made but ſhort work of it, while the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
that commanded it had ſo little diſcretion, but
tho we had forces enough yet we durſt not attempt it,
as otherwiſe we would have done, for we had meaſures
to keep with the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was the more
troubleſome to us, the more he was himſelf diſturb'd
by his own people that hated us, upon which account he
concerted all matters with us. Let not the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
think the better of themſelves for what I have mention'd;
I dont ſay we were ſo afraid of them, as that we were
bound to do every thing they order'd; if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
againſt us it had not been much the worſe for
ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> affairs, but 'twas not prudence for us to create our
ſelves new Enemies, when there was ſo many jealouſies
already of the progreſs of our Arms. I allow they are
a brave people, but I dont doubt we have convinc'd
the World we are ſo too; one thing we excel them in,
and that is, in having abundance of experienc'd
Souldiers and Officers, bred to the War; and above all
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57806:175"/>
a King, who if he abandons himſelf to his pleaſures,
yet abandons all thoſe pleaſures, to perſue the courſe
of an immortal fame.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not give any other account why the Blockade
of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> was rais'd, than what went currant
in the World; 'tis an action ſo lately done and ſo
well known, that all the world muſt remember it:
There were ſome reflections upon my Nephew on the
occaſion of this deſign failing, which he laid ſo much
to heart, that I perceiv'd he was grown melancholy;
I advis'd him to lay down his Commiſſion, but he would
not do that neither, but being overcome with diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
at laſt he fell deſperately ſick: I lov'd him
very tenderly, and indeed above all the reſt of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and therefore I no ſooner heard of it, but I took
Poſt to go and ſee him; 'twas no difficulty for me not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
my Age, for that ſort of Coach which is
an invention we have from the <hi>Germans,</hi> carries one ſo
very eaſy, that it is not the leaſt inconvenience; at my
arrival at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> for there was his Quarters, I found
him ſomething better, and very glad he was to ſee me,
for as I lov'd him, as I ſaid before, ſo he had the ſame
affection for me; and it appear'd preſently; for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ſo reviv'd him, that he began to recover apace,
and I never left him till he was quite well: And as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contributes to our recovery from any diſtemper,
more than a proper divertiſement; I endeavour'd to
bring it about for him, by inviting ſome Ladies to
come and play at his Chamber. This did not continue
long, for in a little while he was well enough to viſit
them. There were at that time a Poppet-ſhow in the
Town, and all the people went to ſee it, the famous
Punchinello doing ſtrange things; tho my Nephew, nor
I, did not much fancy thoſe things, yet I carry'd him to
ſee it; we were exceedingly diverted, and ſo were a
great many more beſides us, by ſome extraordinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
in this adventure. Some may think it very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in writing theſe Memoirs, to trouble the World with
ſuch a mean ſtory as this of the Poppet-players; yet if
they pleaſe to have patience till they have heard it out,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57806:176"/>
they will be better ſatisfy'd; the reaſon I mention ſuch
a trifle as this, is becauſe ſome Hiſtory depends upon
it, at worſt; it may make 'em laugh, as it hath done many
more beſides my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brioche</hi> the famous Poppet-player of <hi>Paris,</hi> finding
people began to be weary of his fooleries in the City,
took his opportunity when moſt people were out of
Town, to make a turn in the Country; firſt he went
into <hi>Champagn,</hi> thence into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſo into <hi>Alſace,</hi> and
at laſt he came to <hi>Stratsbourg,</hi> where abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
having never ſeen Punchinello, run after him; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo good ſucceſs there, he takes a march into <hi>Swiſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I can not poſitively remember into what Canton
he went, tho I have been told that too; but in ſhort,
'twas in one where they were ſo perfectly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thoſe ſhows, that when he came to play his
tricks among them, they took him for a Conjurer and
thought he dealt with the Devil; away they go to the
Magiſtrates, who it ſeems were juſt as wiſe as themſelves,
and in ſhort they were going to give ſentence againſt
him; but as it happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, before they would go ſo far
they bethought themſelves of one Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi>
Colonel of a Regiment of <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> which was in the <hi>French</hi>
ſervice, and who happen'd to be then in the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he laught heartily at their ſimplicity, and aſſur'd them
that there was no witchcraft at all in the matter, and
that in <hi>France</hi> they were ſo frequent, that they were to
be ſeen in every Market Town; but Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi>
being a jocoſe ſort of a man, and the Magiſtrates think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he only bantred them, they were reſolv'd not to
take their meaſures wholly from what he ſaid, but to
be better inform'd, they order'd Witneſſes to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d,
and there having teſtify'd that they heard little
figures in the ſhape of Men and Women to ſpeak, they
concluded they could be nothing but Devils, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without any more ado paſt their decree againſt
<hi>Biroche:</hi> They carry'd the ſentence to Monſieur <hi>Du Mont,</hi>
who told them in ſhort, they were going to make
themſelves ridiculous, and he was heartily ſorry that
his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>untrymen ſhould be ſuch abominable Fools. Being
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57806:176"/>
not able with this freedom to undeceive them, he reſolv'd
to play 'em a Trick; he turn'd his tone immediately
and told them, that if he had not confeſt the whole
matter at firſt, 'twas becauſe he ſaw they would engage
him in an ugly piece of buſineſs; that <hi>Biroche</hi> was a
<hi>French</hi> man, and the <hi>French</hi> were now ſo great, that
people ought to conſider well what they did before
they quarrell'd with them; but beſides that, he had a
great many perſons of Quality among his Poppets,
with Princes and Princeſſes of ſeveral Countries, that
he did not know what relation he might have to thoſe
great Perſons, but to be ſure his intereſt was very great,
ſince they ſhould give him leave to bring them upon
the Stage in that manner, and that in a word, he found
they were going upon a buſineſs which might embroil
the whole Canton; but he would ſay no more, 'twas
their part to conſider of it; but in caſes where Princes and
Princeſſes were concern'd they could not be too cautious.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe ſpoken mighty gravely, took with the
Magiſtrates extreamly: They told Monſieur <hi>Du Mont,</hi>
that what he had told them was of conſequence and
deſerv'd conſideration, indeed, that they would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call an Aſſembly to adviſe what was to be done,
before they proceeded any further, and pray'd him to
continue his good Offices to them on this occaſion; in
ſhort, they call'd their Aſſembly to conſult of the matter,
and they ſoon agreed, which was, that they ſhould have
a care of bringing a troubleſome buſineſs upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and therefore they ſent to Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> to
tell him, that they would not proceed to extremity,
but content themſelves with baniſhing <hi>Biroche</hi> out of
the Canton, on condition that he paid the charges of
his proſecution; Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> took upon him to
carry this meſſage himſelf; but <hi>Biroche</hi> would not hear a
word of it, ſo Mr. <hi>Du Mont</hi> told the Magiſtrates, that
ſince <hi>Biroche</hi> would not ſubmit to their ſentence, 'twas
his opinion they ſhould cauſe his Poppets to be ſtript
of their fine Habiliments, for what ever relation they
might be to perſons of Quality, Princes and Princeſſes,
they would have him do juſtice to be ſure, and when
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57806:177"/>
they underſtood he had refus'd it, they would blame
him: They thought this was the moſt reaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
in the World; and ſince they could have no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from him, they ſent and plundred all his Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and carry'd away all their fine Cloaths in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and poor <hi>Biroche</hi> was fain to dreſs them all in
new Cloaths, before he could appear in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went next in his way to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> had done this fellow no mean
ſervice, as you may judge by the ſtory, yet he thought
otherwiſe, and made him a very ill return for it, of
which I can give a particular account, having been an
eye-witneſs of it my ſelf. Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> had been
a long time in Garriſon at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got a Miſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſs at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> had a fancy one time
to go thither to ſee her; he went <hi>Incognito,</hi> and having
conceal'd himſelf there ſome time, his Miſtreſs would
needs have him go with her to the Poppet-ſhow, and
promis'd him ſhe would ſo diſguiſe him, that no body
ſhould know him; ſhe had much ado to perſwade
him: But as 'tis a hard matter to refuſe any thing to a
perſon a man loves, he agreed to go with her; ſhe
dreſt him up like a Burgher, and they ſat in a corner
by themſelves, the young Lady having told her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it was one of her Fathers friends; <hi>Biroche</hi> coming
upon the Stage with his Punchinello, and looking
about him, ſpies out the Colonel, and knew him,
tho he did all he could to conceal himſelf; ſo he makes
his Punchinello cry out Treaſon, Treaſon, Treaſon in
<hi>Spain,</hi> Treaſon in <hi>Germany,</hi> Treaſon in <hi>England,</hi> Treaſon
in <hi>Portugal,</hi> Treaſon in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at laſt, Treaſon in
<hi>Flanders. Biroche</hi> tells him he ſhould hold his Tongue
and look he did not trouble his head with what was done
in the ſeveral kingdoms of <hi>Europe;</hi> but Punchinello
run on and names all the other States of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi>
people wondred what this meant, becauſe it was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from what they us'd to hear, none of the Plays
beginning like this; but it all came out in an inſtant,
for <hi>Biroche</hi> turns to Punchinello and tells him, that
ſince he had a mind to talk and prate, he would give
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57806:177"/>
him leave, only on this condition, that he ſhould not
ſay a word that Monſieur <hi>Du Mont,</hi> Colonel of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Suiſſe</hi> ſat there in that corner, dreſt up like a
Burgher and his Miſtreſs with him; as there was a great
many Officers there who knew the Colonel well enough,
they all ſtood up and lookt on every ſide, to ſee if what
<hi>Biroche</hi> ſaid was true; in the mean time Monſieur <hi>Du
Mont</hi> helpt to diſcover himſelf, for being in a ſtrange
confuſion to find himſelf ſurpriz'd in ſuch a condition,
he made a great deal to do to hide himſelf; but one
who knew him a little more particularly than the reſt,
made him pull away his Hat from before his face; ſo
then it ſignify'd nothing to endeavour to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
any longer; if he was in confuſion enough, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
was in more, and 'twas well for her that ſhe
pull'd her Hoods over her face, by which ſhe prevented
her being known. But the Comedy was quite put by
on this occaſion: Monſieur <hi>Du Mont</hi> ſwore he would
be reveng'd on <hi>Biroche;</hi> but he left the Town the ſame
day to get out of his way, and went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was
fain to lye hid too, for fear of the Colonels reſentment.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer on this ſtory, becauſe I fancy
every body will be pleas'd with it, for of all things that
have been ſaid of the <hi>Suiſſe,</hi> I believe no one ever heard
ſuch a ſimple buſineſs as this. By this time my Nephew
was quite recovered, and I came back to <hi>Paris,</hi> where
telling this ſtory, I had paſt for a great Lier, had not
<hi>Biroche</hi> been by to juſtifie it; and I deſire all that read
theſe Memoirs and doubt of the truth of it, to inform
themſelves from him. He tells a great many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
diverting enough, which I omit here on purpoſe
becauſe I would not make the ſtory too long.</p>
            <p>Being come back to <hi>Paris,</hi> I found I had got a little
ſtock of Money again aforehand; and tho I ought to
have learnt the wit to know what to do with it, having
paid ſo dear for my experience in the caſe of Monſieur
<hi>de Saillant,</hi> yet I muſt ſtill be conſidering forſooth how
to improve my Money; this good husbandry was a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
came upon me a little too late; had I been ſo wiſe
when I liv'd with Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> I had had no need
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57806:178"/>
of it now; but it was my lot to be ruin'd, whoever I
dealt with.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>De Saillant</hi> muſt excuſe me if I ſay ſo, 'twas
a word ſlipt out by chance, and may well be forgiven a
man whom it coſt eight thouſand Francs beſides Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
only to do him a kindneſs; however my deſign is
not to do him any harm, for he did his beſt, and ſo did
he that I am going to ſpeak of, and I forgive them
both; I had 2000 Crowns by me in good Gold, and
as old age has this particular quality to love hoards, I
enquired of every body if they knew one to whom I
might ſafely put out this Money; they propoſed ſeveral
to me, and I choſe out one of them, to my misfortune:
No body pleas'd me ſo well as one Monſieur <hi>Joſeier de
la Jonchiere,</hi> becauſe he made a good figure, and I
thought him a rich man: Any body wou'd have been
cheated as well as I, for he had a place of eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand Francs a year, a fine Houſe of his own
at <hi>Paris,</hi> Rents on the Town-houſe, Lands in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and if one had had a hundred thouſand Crowns to
put out, he had ſix times enough to anſwer it; in ſhort,
I gave him my Money, and thought my ſelf very much
oblig'd to him that he would take it; but about ſix
months after, going along the ſtreet where he liv'd, I
ſaw a croud of people at his door, and enquiring what
was the matter, they told me they did not know the
particulars, but the Kings Souldiers had taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Houſe; which was enough to tell me my Money
was in danger, and I was too true a Prophet, for tho he
appear'd ſeveral days after, yet his affairs and mine were
not much better than one another; he call'd his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
together, and I coming among the reſt, he told us
he had enough to pay us all, if we would have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the King would have any compaſſion of
him, that he had had ſeveral loſſes, which the wiſeſt
man alive could not foreſee. Firſt, that one of his
Factors had run away with a hundred thouſand Crowns.
Secondly that upon calling in the Money the pieces of
four Sous, and giving out the markt pieces, he had not
above eight days warning, and having a vaſt quantity
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57806:178"/>
by him, at leaſt ſix Millions, ſix hundred thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,
he loſt above eight thouſand Francs by them; do
whatever he could; that tho Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> was
inform'd of his loſs, he being a Publick Notary himſelf,
yet he had not ſpar'd him in the Tax, but had rated
him, as he did the two other Treaſurers General Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
of the War, at five hundred thouſand Livres;
that nothing was ſo unjuſt as that Tax which was laid
on them, on pretence that they had ſhared with ſome
of the Under-Treaſurers in their Cheats; that he would
not anſwer for other folks, but for himſelf he could
ſafely ſwear he had nothing to do with them; that all
his loſſes amounted to fourteen hundred thouſand
Francs, which had all befallen him in a year or two;
that however he had this to comfort him, that no body
needed to loſe a farthing by him.</p>
            <p>He could not ſay this to us without ſome tears, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on his paſt fortune, which indeed compar'd to
his preſent condition, was enough to move compaſſion,
who but a few days ago liv'd in ſplendor equal to a
Prince, and was now in a moment reduc'd to ſuch a
condition, as not to have a Bed to lye on: His Wife,
who was a <hi>Colbert,</hi> and marry'd him but for his Eſtate,
deſerted him now ſhe found he was like to be miſerable;
and his friends, at leaſt ſuch as call'd themſelves ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his diſaſter, ſerv'd him in the ſame manner; and
to compleat his miſery, his Brother-in-law, one <hi>Brebier,</hi>
who had marry'd his Siſter, put him in Priſon for a
Bill of Exchange he had paid for him. In ſhort, every
one run upon him, and did him all the miſchief they
could, and no body, but I, regarded the inconſtancy
of fortune; but I thought myſelf oblig'd, rather to
help him than to cruſh him in this condition; I had
rather, that he ſhould ſay this than I, becauſe it is of my
ſelf; however, tho I was in no condition to make large
gifts, yet I frankly gave him my two thouſand Crowns;
and if all his Creditors had been of my mind, he would
ne'r have periſht in Priſon, as now he is in great danger
to do. Perhaps God ſent him this affliction, to puniſh
him for being a little too ſure of his proſperity; for there
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57806:179"/>
was nothing rich enough, or fine enough, neither for
him or his Wife. They would not give themſelves the
trouble of going to the Play, but the Actors muſt come
and play at their own houſe. Their Diet was extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
nice, and every thing elſe anſwerable, tho at the
ſame time they thought, that they had a fortune pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable.
He had a place which in time of War ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
brought him in leſs than a Million a year in his turn,
and was at other times worth an hundred thouſand
Crowns a year, and there were but three of them, who
had every one a year in their turn; a rare example of
the viciſſitude of humane affairs, from whence one may
learn, that there is nothing ſo mortifying in a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as to reflect upon our former proſperity.</p>
            <p>A little after this happen'd, my Nephew came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and as he went out after dinner from one of his
acquaintances houſes, he was ſet upon by four Ruffians,
who after having ſtab'd him in three ſeveral places with
their Swords, made off, ſuppoſing they had kill'd him.
The Citizens are commanded, when any ſuch accident
happens, or when two draw their Swords to fight in
the ſtreets, to diſarm them, and ſecure their perſons;
but this is an Ordonance which is but very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and 'tis with juſtice enough that the <hi>Pariſians</hi>
are accus'd of Cowardize; the Tradeſmen being always
very little fond of parting a Fray in the ſtreet; by which
means theſe fellows got away: And tho I made great
ſearch after them, I could never hear a word of them.
My Nephews wounds were very bad, but yet not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as I was afraid they were, and ſo were cur'd in
leſs time than I expected, which I was very glad of;
but however we were ſatisfied from this, that he had
ſome Enemies underhand, and ſuch as were the more
dangerous, becauſe they were not to be known, tho we
did our utmoſt to diſcover them. I enquir'd of him
who he had given any occaſion to, and on what affair he
could affront any body to deſerve ſuch uſage; and after
having ſtudy'd a little on the matter he told me, he
could not tell who to ſuſpect, except it was one <hi>Bletterie,</hi>
who was in his Winter-quarters in the Country, near
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57806:179"/>
the <hi>Loire;</hi> he had been acquainted with his Wife, who
had carry'd it ſo very obligingly to him, that he had a
very great eſteem for her; that her Husband who was
always by, was ſo far from ſhewing any diſlike at it,
that he was always the forwardeſt to invite him to his
houſe: However ſince men are not always of the ſame
mind, ſo he would not ſay 'twas not on his account:
That this man having been oblig'd to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> about
the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> he had left ſome Money with
his Wife, with order to give it to one that was concern'd
with him in the Farms; but that he happening at the
ſame time, very unfortunately, to loſe all his Money, ſhe
let him have two thouſand Crowns, without any reſpect
to the order her Husband had left with her; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
great diſturbance follow'd, and the Farmer Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſeiz'd his Goods for want of payment; that he had
wrote ſeveral Letters to his Wife, but receiving no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
he was forc'd to come himſelf; where ſhe finding
herſelf unable to ſatisfy him, was fain to pretend ſhe
had been rob'd; but that upon enquiry the man was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that there was ſomething elſe loſt beſides his
Money.</p>
            <p>My Nephew having made this ingenuous confeſſion, I
troubled my ſelf no more at what had happen'd, but on
the other hand told him, he had but his due; for a man
that could not be content to kiſs his friends Wife, but
muſt bilk her of his Money too, deſerv'd no fair play,
but ought to expect to dye in the ſtreet, as he had like
to have done. However, this did not hinder my making
all the enquiries I could poſſible, to find out whether
this happen'd to him on that account or no. I made one
of my Servants I had tutor'd, hire himſelf to <hi>le Bletteire,</hi>
who was to ſay, he came from the ſame Town where
my Nephew liv'd, and had been injur'd by him; which
was to draw ſomething from him, by which he might
gueſs how he ſtood affected to my Nephew; but he
came away with a parcel of ſilly ſtories, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any conſiderable diſcovery. Another would have
been diſcourag'd after ſo many fruitleſs attempts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
too, after having ſpent more Money about it than
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57806:180"/>
can be imagin'd; for 'tis a cuſtom at <hi>Paris,</hi> when they
fancy you are eager to revenge your ſelf, to have a
number of ſharping fellows come about you, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
ſome this way, and ſome that way, to give
you information; and if you hearken to them a little,
they ſoon find the depth of your Pocket.</p>
            <p>I was the Cully to theſe ſort of people for two or
three months; at laſt, one that had ſerv'd me like the
reſt, came and told me, he had found one of the Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians:
I thought this was only a trick to get more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and ſo I told him, if he did not get him about his
buſineſs, I ſhould have him ſoundly kick'd; but he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me the thing was true, told me, he askt me for
nothing till he had deliver'd the fellow into my hands;
and provided I would then give him ten Piſtoles, he
would bring me to the place where he was; that in the
mean time my Nephew ſhould go before, where he
ſhould appoint, to ſee that he would not deceive me,
and that he would order it ſo, as to help him to a ſight
of the man, and if it was he, he ſhould be provided
with people ready to ſecure him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Propoſal was
ſo fair, that I could not refuſe it, but I agreed to all his
conditions, and promis'd him more than he demanded.
So taking my Nephew along with him, he plac'd him in
a Chamber up four pair of ſtairs in <hi>la Rue de la Mortel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi>
where on the other ſide of the ſtreet, juſt over
againſt him, the perſon lodg'd whom he meant; he
plac'd my Nephew in ambuſcade behind the Window,
telling him he ſhould ſoon ſee him come to his Window,
and that he ſhould not have time to eſcape. In ſhort,
in a moments time he came to the Window, as he had
ſaid, with a Woman who betray'd him; and my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
having view<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him very exactly, was ſo well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd,
that this was one of the perſons that aſſaulted
him, that he ſent to me to come on with the Officers,
which I immediately did with all expedition. Firſt, I
poſted three or four men at the corner of the ſtreet, and
follow'd my Nephew with the reſt, who would needs
be in the action himſelf, as being moſt concern'd. We
preſently en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red the Chamber he had taken notice of,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57806:180"/>
but found no body there; for he being at the Window
when we came to the door, fled to a back room; the
Woman whom we had ſet to watch, made a ſign to us
where he was hid, and there we found him; but he
having faſtned all the Bolts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we were forc'd to break the
door open: He put himſelf at firſt into a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a Piſtol among us, but hurt no body;
but throwing our ſelves in upon him, we took him, and
carry'd him into the <hi>Chatelet.</hi> My Nephew appear'd to
proſecute him, and we had very good proof of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
for it was made in the open day, and in one of
the moſt publick ſtreets of <hi>Paris;</hi> but when they came
to be brought face to face with the Priſoner, truly there
was but one would be poſitive that he was the man, the
other ſaying, 'twas too long ago to remember particular
faces: However, this was half a proof, and I did not
doubt but they would put him to the torture upon that,
as is uſual; and I hop'd ſo the rather, becauſe he ſeem'd
a ſcoundrel kind of a fellow, that had not above two
years ago run away from his Colours. But as ſorry a
Wretch as he was, he had good friends who ſollicited
for him very hard, under-hand; among whom, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Genou</hi> was one, who having a great intereſt in the
Parliament, all we could obtain was, that he ſhould
remain in Priſon three months longer, to ſee if we
could bring any further witneſs to inform them more
fully; ſo it lay upon us to uſe our endeavour, for after
that time, if none appear'd, he would be at liberty:
But what could we do more than we had done? So the
three months run out, and we being not able to make
any further diſcovery, had the pleaſure, after a great
deal of Money ſpent in the proſecution, to have our
Proceſs diſmiſt out of the Court.</p>
            <p>I attribute this diſappointment to the ſollicitation of
Mr. <hi>Genou,</hi> and I believe I am in the right. In the mean
time, it was no very hard matter to find out, what
made him ſo willing to appear againſt us; for I had
done juſt the ſame thing in an affair that he had (or at
leaſt <hi>Vedeau de Grammont</hi> his Kinſman) againſt a certain
Lady, whoſe Father was my very good friend; but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57806:181"/>
here lay the difference between my management and
his, that he ſav'd a man that deſerv'd to be broken on
the Wheel, and I did nothing but what every honeſt
man ought to do; and to the end, the Reader may not
think, I ſay more of my ſelf than is my due, I will be
judg'd by all that hear the ſtory, which was as follows.
The ſeaſon inviting me to take the air in the Country, I
left <hi>Paris</hi> with an intent to go and ſee a Gentleman, one
of my Relations, call'd <hi>Mere,</hi> for whom I had lately
done a particular piece of ſervice, in a difference he had
with one <hi>Domanchin,</hi> who had been a Notary, but now
was become a noted Uſurer. In ſhort, this ſubtile old
Fox had cheated him, at leaſt of fifty thouſand Crowns:
The Gentleman having been put to great charges on
account of other people, particularly being to pay for
hunting Equipage for Mr. <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> he had been
quite ruin'd, if he had been forc'd to pay all that this
fellow demanded of him; he apply'd himſelf to me to
help him to adjuſt this affair; and having found out his
Adverſary, I got him a Diſcharge for a very ſmall ſum
more than what was really owing, and abundantly ſhort
of the vaſt ſum he pretended to. This perſon, thinking
himſelf under great obligation to me, had a long time
invited me to come and ſee him; and the weather being
ſo pleaſant as I ſaid, I had a mind to divert my ſelf, I
got on Horſeback by break of day, and arriv'd the ſame
night at his houſe; he made me extraordinary welcome,
and I believe I ſhould have been ſo if I had ſtaid lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but as I never lov'd the Country for any long time
together, and alſo having a mind to make another viſit
not far from his Houſe, I took my leave of him. My
other viſit was to Monſieur <hi>Herve,</hi> Counſellor of the
Great Chamber, and one of my very good friends,
who I was told was at Monſieur <hi>Salle</hi>'s Houſe, who had
marry'd his Daughter; ſo I went directly to his Houſe,
but when I came to the Caſtle, I underſtood that they
were neither of them at home, and that no body was
within but Madam <hi>Salle.</hi> I having had the honour of
acquaintance with her at her Father's, alighted to go
and pay my reſpects to her. I had not been with her
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57806:181"/>
above half an hour, but they brought her word, that
ſome of Monſieur <hi>de Vedeau de Grammont</hi>'s Footmen,
whoſe Lands adjoyn'd to theirs, were a fiſhing in the
Motes. Aſſoon as ſhe heard it ſhe chang'd colour, and
turning to me, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you are too much a friend to
my Father to ſuffer them to put ſuch an affront upon me;</hi>
and with thoſe words ſhe riſes up in a heat, and going
out of the room, ſhe runs herſelf to defend her right. I
had no thoughts of leaving her in a caſe ſo plain; but
tho the fellows were ſent on purpoſe to offer her that
affront, yet they durſt not ſtay, eſpecially aſſoon as they
ſaw 'twas the Lady herſelf, and ſhe ſnatching away
their Lines, they were in ſuch a conſternation, that if
ſhe had pleas'd, ſhe might eaſily have bang'd them.
<hi>Vedeau,</hi> who was not far off, was ſurpriz'd when he
underſtood how things were, and eſpecially when he
heard that a ſingle Woman had by herſelf return'd the
affront he deſign'd, he was ready to burſt with anger.
He was a Man of War as you might gueſs by his Habit,
of which I ſhall ſpeak preſently; and in particular of a
certain blue Coat which he had ſuch a kindneſs for,
that he had wore it at leaſt ten or twelve years. Away
he goes, raiſes the Ban and Arrierban of his Eſtate, and
having made a fine Speech to them, to encourage them
to ſome bold action, he tells them, that they muſt march
againſt Madam <hi>Salle,</hi> to recover the Booty ſhe had
made of his Mens fiſhing Tackle; and he would have
led them on himſelf, but that it was not proper for ſo
conſiderable a Captain as himſelf, to go on ſo ſmall an
Expedition. If I would ſay any more to give you his
character, I might eaſily do it; but I need only ſay,
that this was becauſe it ſeems people which have
ſuch affairs as theſe, ought not to be of the Party them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and as 'tis with thoſe that are out of love with
their own occupations, they won't trouble themſelves
to know ſo much as the terms of art; ſo he left all thoſe
things to the Men of War.</p>
            <p>I was newly gone from Madam <hi>Salle</hi> when this Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
came there, or elſe I am ſure I ſhould ſooner have
been cut in pieces than have ſuffer'd them to offer her
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57806:182"/>
ſuch violence: But they having found her all alone,
neither her Sex, her Quality, no nor her Face, which
as it was all charming, ſo was at the ſame time very
majeſtick, could not put any ſtop to their outrage; but
ſeeing that ſhe had plac'd herſelf ſingle at the door of
the Hall to diſpute their paſſage, they ruſht in upon
her, and ſhe making what reſiſtance ſhe could, they
threw her down upon the ground, and I know not
what other inſolencies they offer'd her; they drag'd
her about the houſe from place to place, as if ſhe had
been a Criminal, and they had authority for what they
did; at laſt having found what they came for, they
went away, after having ſaid all the beaſtly things to
her they could deviſe, and which they deſerv'd to be
ſeverely puniſht for. The Lady was a perſon of too
much ſpirit, to bear all this without taking ſome
courſe to revenge it. She ſent a Man immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to her Father, to inform him of what had paſt, and
he having overtaken me upon the road, and telling me
what had happen'd, immediately upon my going away,
I thought my ſelf oblig'd in honour to go back, and
offer her my ſervice. I found her perfectly diſconſolate,
and it ſignify'd nothing to tell her, her Father had
credit, and friends enough to revenge this affront, this
gave her no ſatisfaction; and I believe, if I had not
proffer'd her my ſervice, to go immedietely out and
perſue them, ſhe had dy'd under the violence of the
oppreſſion; and this diſcover'd to me the Greatneſs of
her Spirit, more than ever I had obſerv'd in my life. She
told me it was not reaſonable I ſhould expoſe my ſelf on
her account, and ſhe ſtay at home out of the danger;
but if I would needs undertake her defence, ſhe was
reſolv'd to run the riſque with me; that 'twas true ſhe
was but a Woman, but as much a Woman as ſhe was,
ſhe believ'd ſhe was able to beat Mr. <hi>Vedeau.</hi> I told her,
I hop'd there was no need of that, I would only have
her look to her ſelf after ſo much violence as had been
offer'd her; and beſides, ſince ſhe was the Party ſo
much abus'd, ſhe ſhould keep the right of her ſide;
and therefore I only deſir'd her to let me have one of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57806:182"/>
her Servants with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a deſign I had thought of. In
ſhort, I ſent to ſeveral friends I had in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to lend me the help of their Footmen; upon
which meſſage they came away themſelves, thinking I
had ſome quarrel upon my hands; but I ſent them all
back again, leſt I ſhould embroil them, they being all
marry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d men, or otherwiſe ſettled in the Country; ſo
they were forc'd to oblige me, or elſe nothing would
have been done. Having 5 or 6 jolly fellows with me,
who did not value Monſieur <hi>Vedeau,</hi> eſpecially not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known, neither to him nor his Servants; We put
our ſelves into a hunting poſture, and follow'd the
Chaſe juſt to his very Gate: He was chief Ranger of
that part of the Country, and had Men for that purpoſe
in moſt of the Villages about there; one of which
coming out, upon the firſt ſhot we made, to know if
we had leave from his Maſter; we complimented him
with a good cudgelling, and bid him go and tell Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Vedeau,</hi> that if he would pleaſe to come out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
we would be as civil to him; there came three one
after another on the ſame errand, which put us to the
trouble of ſerving them all in the ſame kind, and they
all run to the Caſtle; where tho they all told the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
Monſieur <hi>Vedeau</hi> did not think fit to venture
abroad; however he thought, if he could raiſe the
Country, he ſhould eaſily ſurround us; ſo he order'd
the Church Bell to ring out for an alarm, and gets
himſelf up to a Garret Window to ſee, by the help of
his Proſpective, if any of the Country people came to
his relief. All this did not hinder, but I kept beating
about the Fields for game, and made one ſhot juſt at
the Gate of his outer Court; and his blue Coat diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
him to me, I made as if I would ſhoot at him,
which he perceiving by the help of his Glaſs, for he was
naturally pur-blind, he popt in his head in a great deal
of haſte, which I could not but laugh to ſee; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was ſo far from being in danger, that a Fuſee
could not carry above half ſo far; but all that did not
prevent the fright he was in; by which I learnt, that a
man is never the leſs a Coward for big Looks and great
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57806:183"/>
Whiskers. All this while the Alarm rung, and at laſt
the neighbouring Pariſhes beginning to make the ſame
jangling with their Bells, I thought it was time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
Indeed, I found already the Peaſants began to
poſt themſelves at the Lanes ends, and Defiles; but none
of them daring to ſtay my coming, I retir'd very well
pleas'd with my little Expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vedeau</hi> preſently gueſt this was ſome of Madam <hi>Salle</hi>'s
friends, but having no proof, he was enrag'd at the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
he had receiv'd; he endeavour'd to get ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and ſome pretended to tell him who it was,
but it was all uncertain, for it was impoſſible to have
contriv'd it better; none of us were known, and if any
had ſeen me at Madam <hi>Salle</hi>'s, they had not ventur'd to
come ſo near me, as to know me again. This affront
was ſoon follow'd with another. Monſieur <hi>Herve</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been inform'd of what had happen'd to his
Daughter, he made out a Decree againſt his Men;
and having given it to one of the Prevoſt's Officers, he
gave him power alſo to put it in execution. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all fled, and when the Officer came, all he could
do was to make ſearch in their Houſes, where they
made ſtrange havock, and ſearcht every hole and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Monſieur <hi>Genou,</hi> ſeeing his Kinſman had ſo many
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>oils, and that, without his aſſiſtance, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to extricate him out of them all, adviſes him
to a very ſubtile trick. He made him preſent a Petition
in the name of theſe Runaways, in which he ſet forth,
that under pretence of ſearching for their perſons, they
had plunder'd their Houſes, and took away all they
had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This they had leave given them to prove, and
there was no want of ſham evidence to ſwear it. Upon
which M. <hi>Vedeau</hi> got a Decree againſt the Officer and
his Aſſiſtants; who miſtruſting nothing all the while,
and no body being ſo kind to tell him what had paſt,
was taken as he was ſitting peaceably in his own Houſe,
and carry'd Priſoner to <hi>Chatau-neuf</hi> in <hi>Thimerais;</hi> this
was juſt in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Vedeau,</hi> where the
Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> liv'd in very good credit: From whence he caſt
him, not only into a loathſome Priſon, but alſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57806:183"/>
order'd him to be proſecuted. 'Twas ſtrange
that a Man who was oblig'd in conſcience, and above all
by the obligation of his Office, to do juſtice to all men,
ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be led into ſuch a paſſion, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
to oppreſs an innocent man, and that purely for
revenge; for all the crime they could lay on this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
man was, that according to his Office, he
was at his Houſe to ſearch for thoſe againſt whom there
was a lawful Decree; and the pretence of his ſtealing
things was ſo frivolous, they might as well have charg'd
me with it who was not there. In the mean time the poor
man was ready to periſh, and the baſeneſs of <hi>Vedeau</hi> was
ſuch, that leſt he ſhould be reliev'd, by any body that
he thought might aſſiſt him, he order'd it ſo, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Monſieur <hi>Herve,</hi> nor Madam <hi>Salle</hi> heard a word of
it; all people who had any reſpect for him, and that
knew not how he had contriv'd it, wonder'd they
ſhould forſake the Man in ſuch a manner, eſpecially
ſince he had brought himſelf to this ruine on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and they had promis'd to bear him harmleſs. At
laſt, ſome one of his friends, being apprehenſive of
ſome further danger deſign'd, went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
Mr. <hi>Herve</hi> of the matter, who was extreamly
ſurpriz'd at the News, that being the firſt word he had
ever heard of it: He was too much a Gentleman not
to do his beſt for the poor man, the very moment he
knew of it; wherefore putting all his Irons in the fire
immediately, he manag'd it ſo well, that he obtain'd an
Arreſt, by which the Court of Juſtice of <hi>Chatea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  </gap>f</hi>
was prohibited to proceed againſt the Priſoner, and
that he ſhould be remov'd to the <hi>Conciergerie;</hi> and one
of the Officers of the Parliament was immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
to carry this News to him; and indeed he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in good time, for the King's Sollicitor was juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
paſſing the Sentence to have him hang'd; the beſt he
was to expect, was to be branded with the <hi>Flower de
Lis,</hi> and whipt, or be ſent to the Gallies. <hi>Vedeau</hi> was
very much troubled, that juſt when he was going to
make himſelf ſo famous in the Country, by ſuch a piece
of injuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt now go and give an account of his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57806:184"/>
reaſons to the Parliament, where the Father of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
had at leaſt as much credit, as he and all his
Family; but being conſtrain'd by neceſſity, he came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and finding that it was neceſſary to have all the
parties up, the thing being proſecuted in other names,
they try'd all ways poſſible to make it up. Indeed, it
was a very diſhonourable ſtrife, for both parties had
recourſe to all the tricks and ſhifts of the Law, not to
ſay injuſtices, they could deviſe; and the paſſion and
ſpleen with which it was carry'd on, having made them
ſhut their Ears to all ſorts of Propoſals, this was the
occaſion of opening the whole ſcene of the affair, and
why <hi>Vedeau</hi> ſent his Servants to fiſh in the Motes of
Madam <hi>Salle</hi>'s Caſtle. Monſieur <hi>Salle</hi> it ſeems, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
<hi>de Vedeau</hi> the uſe of the Water of a River, that
belong'd to him, to water a Meadow of his, for which
he was reſolv'd to be even with him; and to that end
he purchaſes a Fief of about 5 or 6 thouſand Francks,
in right whereof he pretended, that the River was not
only his, but that Monſieur <hi>Salle</hi> had no authority to
draw the Water thro his Motes. This affair could not
but require a long deciſion, conſidering alſo what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
between, and the obſtinacy of both parties; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on both ſides throughly acquainted with all the nice
tricks of the Law. In the mean time the poor Officer
was the Sufferer; and tho he was no longer in the
Dungeon, yet he was to remain in Priſon till the truth
was made out; and to make his misfortune more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
the Parliament would not be Judges in a Caſe
that reſpected ſuch conſiderable perſons of their own
Members; and it took up a long time before they could
agree to name other Judges: At laſt, they referr'd the
Caſe to the Determination of the <hi>Requeſtes de l' Hotel,</hi>
and I having very good friends there, I joyn'd my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
with Monſieur <hi>Herve,</hi> which very much diſpleas'd
Monſieur <hi>Genou</hi> and his Son-in-law; not that they
thought I had more credit there than their party, but
that they thought it was a bold thing in me, that was
but a mean perſon to them, to oppoſe my ſelf ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
againſt them. Monſieur <hi>Genou,</hi> who was a hot
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57806:184"/>
Man, ſpoke to a friend of mine to diſſwade me from
it; but I told him I had always been Monſieur <hi>Herve</hi>'s
humble Servant, and beſides happening to be at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Salle</hi>'s Houſe when the firſt inſult was given, I
could not avoid being of their ſide. I let fall theſe laſt
words, without conſidering that his Son-in-law might
ſuſpect me by that, to be the perſon that had ſhot at his
outer gate. It had been excuſable in a young man to
have ſpoken thus haſtily, but I was of an age to have
had more wit: I ſaw immediately that I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a fault, but it being too late to remedy it, I let it
alone to take its own courſe, and never troubled my
ſelf about it. My friend having told Monſieur <hi>Genou</hi>
what anſwer I had given him, without thinking of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me any hurt, they preſently concluded, it could be
no body but me, that had offer'd him that affront; and
to be more certain of it, Mr. <hi>Genou</hi> meeting me next day
at the entrance to the <hi>Requeſtes de Hotel,</hi> where I was
ſolliciting, told me, Madam <hi>Salle</hi> was very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to me; that after I had expos'd my ſelf, as I had
done, in coming to inſult his Son-in-law at his very
doors, I ſhould ſtill be ſo hot upon the buſineſs, as at
all hours in the day to be ſolliciting for her: When he
had ſaid thus he ſeem'd to expect my anſwer, and that
he might catch me at my words, I perceiv'd he had
plac'd two fellows ready, who making as if they took
notice of nothing, hearkned to what we ſaid, but they
all loſt their labour, for I was not to be catcht ſo; for
being aware of them, I ſaid nothing they could lay any
hold of; ſo they went away as wiſe as they came. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Monſieur <hi>Genou</hi> ow'd me a grudge in his heart,
and having found an occaſion to ſhow me his good
will, as I have related, he did it with a great deal of
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But to return to the ſtory, the <hi>Hotel</hi> having again
attempted to accommodate the matter with Mr. <hi>Herve,</hi>
but finding their inveteracy ſo great, that they would
hear of nothing, they diſpos'd themſelves to do juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to paſs Sentence: For the affair of the Officer
who was ſtill in Priſon, they adjudg'd that he ſhould
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57806:185"/>
have liberty to follow the buſineſs in the Court till the
end of the Cauſe, for they had not diſmiſt his Proceſs,
tho they thought fit to allow him his liberty. In
the mean time this affair was like a heap of Snow,
which grows bigger and bigger by rowling to and
fro. There were ſo many Proceedings, that they had,
at leaſt, forty or fifty bags of papers; and it coſt
Mr. <hi>Herve</hi> an infinite deal of Money to carry it on, for
he bore all the charge of it, as well as the ſubſiſtence of
the Officer; whom in this caſe 'twas but reaſonable to
provide for. However, at laſt the Proceſs, after having
held, I know not how long, was concluded by a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in favour of my friends; and <hi>Vedeau</hi> was ſo
vext, and aſham'd at it, that for fear he ſhould be
laught at in the Country where the quarrel began, he
would not go there for a long time. This was the end
of an affair ſo much talkt of in the world, and in which
they might have ſav'd a great deal of Labour and Money,
if they would have been rul'd by the advice of their
Friends; for tho Monſieur <hi>Salle</hi> caſt his Adverſary in
the Charges of the Suit, yet it coſt him at leaſt two
thouſand Crowns in other expences.</p>
            <p>The Proceſs being at an end, I was at liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of my ſelf as I pleas'd, for I was not willing to
leave <hi>Paris</hi> till I had ſeen the concluſion of it. There was a
Gentleman who liv'd near <hi>Melun,</hi> had oft times invited
me to his Houſe, I ſent him word it ſhould now be in a
few days: Beſides, I had a great mind to go into that
ſide of the Country for more reaſons than one. In ſhort,
beſides that, I had a mind to divert my ſelf in hunting
with him; I had alſo a great deſire to viſit Monſieur <hi>de
Charoſt,</hi> who was at <hi>Vaux le Vicomte,</hi> where, as 'twas
ſaid, he went to take the Air; but that was a report
given out, to hide a ſmall accident that befel
him. The poor man was become a meer Child again,
and tho he was not ſo very old, his Spirits, which uſe
to die laſt in us, had ſo much forſaken him, that to ſee
him in the preſent condition, one would never have
thought him ſo perfect a Courtier as he had been:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57806:185"/>
what I have ſaid of him before, is more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make one believe him ſuch. There were few
that rally'd more agreeably than he; I was witneſs
of this once in my life, and tho it was on a ſubject not
very pleaſant to me, yet it did not hinder me, but I
laught as well as other people; this happen'd a little
after the Death of Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> my very good
Maſter. I have ſaid, how it was reported that he was
pretty great with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Aiguillon,</hi> his Niece, and
that they would needs have it at the ſame time, that
the Duke <hi>de Richelieu</hi> was her Son. This Report which
was common enough while he was alive, was more
publickly diſcourſt of after his death, till at laſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo common, that not only the ordinary people,
but the perſons of the firſt quality believ'd it: So that
a Court Lady, upon a quarrel with the Dutcheſs
<hi>de Aiguillon,</hi> reproacht her publickly, that ſhe had been
the Miſtreſs of a Prieſt, by whom ſhe had had ſeveral
Children. 'Tis without queſtion, that ſome things are
better conceal'd than divulg'd; but the Dutcheſs being
of the humour of moſt Women, to regard nothing ſo
ſhe gratify'd her paſſion, comes all in a fury, and
caſting her ſelf at the Queen's feet, demanded Juſtice;
the Queen bid her riſe, and let her know what was the
matter. I was juſt then ſpeaking with Monſieur <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſt,</hi>
with whom I was going to the Houſe of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
but he, who had no kindneſs for that Lady, with
whom he had had ſome pique, left me, to go and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf of the particulars. She told the Queen,
that Madam <hi>de St. Chaumout</hi> had call'd her Whore, (for
ſhe nam'd the word at length) and had openly told her,
ſhe had had five or ſix Children by her Uncle: When
ſhe had ſaid this, it was thought the Queen would have
ſpoke; but Monſieur <hi>de Charoſt</hi> not giving her time,
<hi>Alack, Madam,</hi> ſays he, (to the Dutcheſs <hi>d' Aiguillon)
will you afflict your ſelf for ſuch a ſmall matter? Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
you know that we muſt not believe above half of what is
ſaid at Court?</hi> He had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but all who
were preſent fell out a laughing; and the Queen, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every body laugh, laught too. This madded the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57806:186"/>
Dutcheſs extremely, who did not uſe to take ſuch jeſts;
but the time of her Reign being now at an end, and on
the other hand, the Queen hating her mortally, ſhe
was fain to go away without any other redreſs.</p>
            <p>All people reproach the Unfortunate: This Lady
was no ſooner out of the Queens preſence, but ſhe
found ten upon her inſtead of one; who repeating the
word <hi>Whore,</hi> which ſhe had call'd her ſelf, would taunt
her with the word; which if it was indecent in the
mouth of a Man, ſure it became a Woman much worſe.
In ſhort, they condemn'd her from this; inſomuch,
that if I had not known what I did, this would have
been enough to convince me. Indeed, this Woman,
who made all tremble under her in the days of her
Uncle, was not company good enough for Dogs, if I
may ſo ſay, for having ſo fooliſhly expos'd herſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſideration, as you have heard: And yet a
greater folly than this, tho it did not make ſo much
noiſe, was that of one of the Queens Maids of Honour,
whoſe name was Madamoiſelle <hi>de Guerchi,</hi> to whom fell
out this very unhappy adventure. I ſhould have told
you, that being with Child by the Duke <hi>de Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry,</hi> he
ruin'd her ſo unfortunately, by endeavouring to hide
her diſgrace with the Death of the Infant; and there
happen'd on this occaſion, ſo falſe a ſtep taken by her
ſelf, that ſhe deſerv'd to have Stones thrown at her
more than Madam <hi>d' Aiguillon.</hi> The Queen lov'd her
above all the reſt; and this happen'd to her at a time,
when the Queen being buſy about ſome certain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
affairs, had plac'd her at the Cloſet door, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to let no body come in, but ſuch as ſhe had nam'd:
It happen'd as ſhe ſtood here Monſieur <hi>de Vic</hi> came up to
the door, and making an offer to go in, and ſhe not
knowing his face, he being newly come from the Army,
ſhe ask'd him his Name, which he told her immediately.
Now there being but little difference in the <hi>French</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Name, and a certain thing which it is not very
decent to mention, ſhe ſtept back in a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſion, and flung
the Door againſt him. The Queen, who by accident had
her Eyes that way, obſerving the diſorder ſhe was in,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57806:186"/>
askt her what was the matter: But ſhe being ſurpriz'd

Queen wondring what ſhould ſo much diſturb her, and

commanded her to tell her what it was; that
if it was a thing not fit to be ſpoken in plains terms,
ſhe might diſguiſe it, but ſo as to let her know the
meaning of it; which would not be difficult to do, by
one that had ſo much wit as ſhe had. Madamoiſelle <hi>de

reſolv'd to tell her, but did it with ſo ill a grace, that
if ſhe had nam'd the thing at length, it could not have
been worſe. She ſaid then, that having askt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

Captain of the Queens Guards, who ſtood by, fell out
a laughing as if he would have burſt; and when he had
a little recover'd himſelf, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to the Queen,
<hi>I'm confident 'twas Monſieur</hi> de Vic <hi>who frighted this
Lady, for he came from</hi> Flanders <hi>but laſt night;</hi> but the
beſt of the jeſt was, that the Lady affirmed ſtill ſhe was

            <p>The Gentleman who I went to viſit at <hi>Melun,</hi> was
call'd the Count <hi>de la Chapelle Gantier,</hi> a perſon of a
great deal of honour, and whoſe Father was my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Friend; he was a ſworn Enemy to another
Gentleman that liv'd hard by, call'd the Viſcount <hi>de
Melun,</hi> or rather <hi>L' Arbatjete;</hi> for he did not belong
to the honourable Family of <hi>Melun,</hi> of whom the late
Conſtable <hi>de Melun,</hi> and the preſent Princes <hi>d' Eſpinois</hi>
are deſcended; he was far enough from ſuch a Noble
Original, having more Men of the Gown than of the
Sword in his Family; and yet if you would believe
him, <hi>Meſſieurs de Chatillon</hi> are not of a better Deſcent
than he. The Enmity between theſe Gentleman began
upon this ground, that the Father of one had kill'd
the Father of the other, a quarrel ſo reaſonable that no
body ever attempted to reconcile them: My Friend
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57806:187"/>
was the Party offended, it being his Father who had
the misfortune to be kill'd by the other, ſince which if
he had but heard his name mention'd, he would have
turn'd pale, and ſhook from head to foot. A Perſon
of Quality, to whom I am very much oblig'd, deſir'd
me, when I went from <hi>Paris,</hi> to attempt the mitiaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this Hatred by making a Propoſal of Marriage to
my Friend with <hi>Melun</hi>'s Siſter, but I deſir'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd,
for that this was to do a great injury to the Count
<hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> who I knew to be more of a Gentleman
than to marry the Daughter of his Father's Murtherer;
and that, in ſhort, I would never undertake ſuch an
Errand; for I knew if I ſhould, it would be to no
purpoſe. The Count <hi>de Melun</hi> alſo was a Man of ſo
much ill nature, that inſtead of endeavouring by his
carriage to make my Friend forget the Grudge that
was between the Families, as he ought to have done,
he took all occaſions to increaſe it: He was very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
drunk, and when he had a Glaſs or two of
Wine in his head he was ſo abuſive to my Friend, that
if the Laws againſt Quarrels and Duels had not been ſo
ſevere, he had been every day in danger of having his
Throat cut. This was a crime in any man, but much
more inexcuſable in the Son of a man, who had already
imbru'd his hands in the blood of my Friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Father;
beſides the King had done as much as was poſſible to
prevent his being us'd in this manner, for he pardon'd
his Father but upon this condition, that neither he, nor
any of his after him, ſhould come into the Company,
or place, where any of the deceaſed's Children ſhould
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; and that if at any time any of thoſe ſhould come
into Company where he was, or any of his Children,
they ſhould be oblig'd immediately to quit the place,
which command of the Kings every one allow'd to be
very juſt. But the Viſcount <hi>de Melun,</hi> inſtead of
conforming himſelf to this Order, as his Father
had done, us'd him as I have been telling you:
Inſomuch, that the firſt thing my Friend told me of
at my coming to ſee him was, that he could endure it
no longer; at the ſame time, he told me at large the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57806:187"/>
grounds of his diſguſt, which I could not deny but to
be very reaſonable. However, I endeavour'd to put
the beſt face on them I could, becauſe I would not
enflame him, who I perceiv'd was already diſturb'd
enough; and at the ſame time I told him, he could not
have the leaſt quarrel with him without endangering
himſelf extreamly; for the ſame Order of the Kings,
which commanded <hi>Melun</hi> to keep out of his ſight,
commanded him alſo to bear his Adverſary no malice.
I told him, that he being the party aggriev'd every body
would conclude him to have been the Agreſſor; that
in his circumſtances he ought to uſe more caution a
thouſand times than another, having a good Eſtate to
loſe, and therefore ought to conſider very well before
he did any thing of that nature; that I did not deny,
but 'twas a very hard caſe for any Gentleman to be
forc'd to bear ſo much every day, but that the leaſt evil is
always to be choſen; that there was <hi>Melun</hi> and his
Gang deſir'd nothing more than to have us take ſome
wrong ſtep which they might take advantage of; and
in a word, that we had to do with a Prince that would
not be jeſted with; and unleſs his Caſe was as clear as
the day, I would adviſe him not to meddle in it.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, who had at leaſt 12 or 15 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Livres a year, and expected very much to encreaſe
his Eſtate by marrying, being ſenſible my reaſons had
ſome weight, acknowledg'd himſelf very much oblig'd
to me for my advice; for indeed, I believe if it had
not been for me, his Paſſion had run him upon ſome
fooliſh action or other in this matter. But having thus
calm'd him we minded nothing but our pleaſure, he
and I together, either hunting or viſiting the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Gentlemen of that Country; when altogethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
unexpectedly there hapned a Caſe which put my friend
in a condition of giving himſelf ſome ſmall ſatisfaction
in the matter. One day while we were at Dinner, only
he and I, which was very ſtrange, having generally ſome
Company or other every day, we heard a noiſe of Horns
ſounding in the Park: This made him riſe from the
Table in a heat, and run into the Kitchen where he had
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57806:188"/>
ſome Arms; I follow'd him immediately, and taking
each of us a Fuſil, we made out to that part were we
thought the noiſe came from; preſently we ſaw a great
many Dogs running after a Hare, and that they had
come in by a breach in the Park. The Count <hi>de la
Chapelle</hi> had no ſooner ſpy'd the man who blew the
Horn, but he knew him by his Livery to be his Enemy's
Huntſman, and was juſt a going to kill him, for I ſaw
him preſent his piece at him; but making reflection
upon it a little, he thought he ſhould revenge himſelf
better upon his Maſter if he kill'd ſome of the Dogs,
upon which he fir'd three times one after another, and
kill'd every time; he call'd to me alſo to do the like,
but I ſeeing him in ſuch a paſſion, would not diſcharge
my piece; for I thought if his Enemy, who I ſuppos'd
was not far off, ſhould appear, 'twould be neceſſary
one of us, at leaſt, ſhould be ready for him. In the
mean time the Huntſman, who had not blown his
Horn but to call off his Dogs, and who ſaw he was like
to meet with blows there, got him back by the ſame
Gap he came in at, the Dogs following him, as if they
had known by inſtinct the danger of ſtaying. The
Count <hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> ſeeing there was no body left for
him to vent his paſſion upon, would needs ſally out to
ſee if he could find his Enemy, the Viſcount <hi>de Melun,</hi>
whom we concluded was not far off, for one might
hear the noiſe of Horſes galloping up and down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Park Wall, which we knew muſt be he, or
ſome of his Company. But I ſtopt him, telling him
he had done enough, and ought to be ſatisfy'd with it,
that if <hi>Melun</hi> had done this action to draw him into
danger, he was very finely fitted; and therefore 'twas
for his Enemy to run, and not for him; that he had kill'd
his Dogs, and had this advantage beſides, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had treſpaſs'd upon him, and he might make his
Complaint of it, and perhaps put him in Priſon; but
that if he follow'd him out of his own bounds the Caſe
would be quite alter'd: and therefore I advis'd him not
to do it, leſt he ſhould do ſomething he ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſorry for. He was preſently made ſenſible of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57806:188"/>
my reaſons, and being both of us retreated into the
Houſe together, where we were hardly got, before
there came in a Gentleman of that Country one <hi>Chiſi.</hi>
The Count <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> knew him to be an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this <hi>Melun,</hi> and ſo took it for granted he had
ſent him. This man took no notice of any thing, but
ſate down with us at Table, and diſcours'd ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>metimes
of one thing, ſometimes of another indifferently,
without ſpeaking a word of what had happen'd; we
began then to think he came in by chance, and knew
nothing of the matter, and yet we could not but have
a ſhrewd ſuſpicion that he was of the party too, and
that he came for Spy to ſee how ſtrong we were, and it
prov'd no leſs; for aſſoon as ever we had din'd, away
he goes to <hi>Melun,</hi> and informing him that we were
but two of us, in a quarter of an hour we had him at
the Gates with 5 or 6 Horſemen in his company. The
Count <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> ſpying them before they were
come up to the Draw-bridge, ſnatcht up his Fuſil
which he had at hand, at which I thought ſomething
was the matter, and I did the like. We marcht up to
the faces of them all, and plainly ſaw <hi>Melun</hi> at the
head of them, who durſt not venture to come upon the
Draw-bridge. Aſſoon as he ſaw us, he call'd to the
Count <hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> and askt him for his Dogs; but
ſeeing him preſent his piece at him, he did not think
fit to ſtay for an anſwer: And he was in the right of it,
for had he ſtood a moment longer, 'twas very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this had been the laſt affront he ſhould ever have
given my Friend, or any body elſe. <hi>Chiſi</hi> and the reſt
did the like, and they made their retreat in very good
order, for no body purſu'd them.</p>
            <p>This buſineſs could not but make a great noiſe in the
Country, eſpecially happening among perſons of
ſome condition. I advis'd my Friend to go immediately
and enter his complaint at the Court of the Deputies of
the Mareſchals of <hi>France;</hi> and my reaſon was, that
having made them acquainted with it, he might then be
excus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from giving way to an Accommodation, which
I ſaw plainly the Gentlemen of the Country would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57806:189"/>
But he did not approve of my advice, whether
'twas that he was not acquainted with the Deputies,
or that he thought it would be better to apply to the
Mareſchals of <hi>France</hi> themſelves: But while he was
preparing to do this the Marquis <hi>de St. Heran,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> came to ſee him, and deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
him for his ſake to ſtop his intended Journey, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
he would take upon him, that he ſhould have
all the ſatisfaction he could deſire; and being an old
Courtier who had known me a long time, he turn'd to
me, and deſir'd me to uſe my intereſt with the Count
to the ſame purpoſe. I told him, that truly I was his
Friend, but he had ſo much more intereſt than I, that
if he could not prevail upon him, it was not likely I
ſhould. Indeed he had been an old acquaintance of
his Father as well as I, and beſides that, the Poſt he
was in (he was the Head Ranger of that part of the
Country) gave him ſuch a particular authority, that
all the Gentlemen of the Country took care to keep in
with him. Monſieur <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> was perplext at
this new Propoſal; for on one hand 'twas not Prudence
in him to make ſuch a man as he his Enemy, and on
the other hand the pleaſure of revenging the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Father, urg'd him againſt all manner of
accommodation. So in hopes to perſwade the other to
deſiſt from his ſollicitation, which to ſay the truth, as
the Caſe ſtood, was a little uncivil; he told him, that
if there had been no other quarrel, but that which
lately happen'd, between his Family and Mr. <hi>de Melun,</hi>
he ſhould have had ſo little occaſion to uſe intreaties
with him, that he would have return'd him thanks for
concerning himſelf in it; but his Quarrel to the Count
<hi>de Melun</hi> was upon another account, and of a nature
not to be forgot; that he would comply with any
thing for his ſake, but he beſought him to reflect upon
the reaſon he had to ſeek revenge, and what the world
would ſay of him, when having ſo fair an occaſion, he
ſhould have had more regard to the Interceſſion of
Friends than the Blood of his Father; that he begg'd
of him to conſider, that what he deſir'd of him was
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57806:189"/>
againſt the Law of Nature, and would be a blot upon
his Honour, of which he himſelf ſhould be the Judge;
wherefore he did not queſtion, but that inſtead of
taking it ill, he would have the greater Friendſhip for
him, tho in this point it was not poſſible for him to grant
what he deſir'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the reaſons he oppos'd to Monſieur <hi>de
St Heran</hi>'s ſolicitations, which I leave to the judgment
of any, if they were not very juſt and equitable.
However Mr. <hi>de St Heran,</hi> not contented with this, ſtrove
all he could to make him alter his mind, and with me
alſo, to perſwade him to it; but finding he gain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
neither upon one nor t'other, he told the Count
<hi>de la Chappelle</hi> that he would entertain no ill will
againſt him for this denial, becauſe he ſaw his Paſſion
had got the aſcendant over him ſo much, that he was
not at preſent capable of taking the advice of his
Friends; that indeed he expected to find him pretty
warm, but that a little time perhaps would allay his
fury, and he would then be better diſpos'd to take his
advice; that therefore he only deſir'd him to reſolve
on no meaſures for 24 hours, during which time he
deſir'd him to remember, that God had commanded us
to forgive our Enemies, and that nothing procur'd
greater peace of mind, than to practice the Duty in
the very Letter of it; that he hop'd he would grant
him that ſmall requeſt without any difficulty; and that
it might not be prejudicial to his intereſt he gave him
his word, the Viſcount <hi>de Melun</hi> ſhould do nothing
on his part.</p>
            <p>By this means the Marquis <hi>de St Heran,</hi> without
taking any notice, did the Viſcount <hi>de Melun</hi> the
greateſt piece of ſervice imaginable; for the Count <hi>de
la Chappelle</hi> could not refuſe ſo fair a requeſt, eſpecially
on the aſſurance that his Enemy ſhould take no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the delay: ſo he let it reſt for two days; in
which time the Marquis <hi>de St Heran</hi> ſent away to Court,
and informing the King of a quarrel in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and that it happen'd about matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Game, deſir'd power from the King to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57806:190"/>
hear and determine it, and, no body being by to ſpeak
for the Count <hi>de la Chapelle,</hi> eaſily obtain'd the Grant:
So that inſtead of a Mediator, which he pretended
to be, he made himſelf a Judge. My Friend was very
much ſurpriz'd at this <hi>Fineneſs;</hi> and very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
with it: But we ſaw there was no manner of
remedy, for now 'twas too late to apply to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchals
of <hi>France,</hi> and 'twas to no purpoſe to attempt
the Kings revoking his Order. My Friend was then
forc'd at laſt to go to <hi>Fountain-bleau</hi> to ſee what Juſtice
he would do him, which indeed was but very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The Viſcount <hi>de Melun</hi> only askt his pardon for
what had happen'd, telling him that 'twas not by any
deſign of his that his Hounds had broke into his Park;
and if he had found his Huntſman there, 'twas only to
fetch them back; that it was an accident, that the
Hare took over his ground; and for his coming up to
the Draw-bridge of the Caſtle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>twas only to ask him
for his Dogs which were loſt, as he himſelf could wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and not to offer him any affront: However, that
if he thought he would have been affronted at it, he
would never have done it; for he was ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
any quarrel with him, that he ſhould be very
glad of any opportunity to ſhow how much he was
his Friend; that in the mean time he promis'd him to
obſerve more ſtrictly the conditions which the King
had oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their Families to; to which end, if ever
he was hunting, and the Game took the ſame way that
his did, he would immediately call off his Hounds and
a great deal of this ſort, which Monſieur <hi>de le Chappelle</hi>
was forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to be content with, and to tell him, that
ſince he had made ſo much acknowledgment, he was
very ſorry he had kill'd any of his Dogs.</p>
            <p>This was the concluſion of that affair, and 'twas a
long time before we could come to know, what it was
occaſion'd the Marquis <hi>de St Heran</hi> to be ſo induſtrious
to oblige one rather than t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>other: But a Gentleman of
the Country, who was of neither party told us, it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of Mr. <hi>de Beſons,</hi> whom <hi>Melun</hi> was related
to by Marriage. We could hardly believe it at firſt,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57806:190"/>
becauſe that Match was made againſt his conſent; but
we underſtand by another hand that it was certainly
true, and quickly after we had poſitive proof of it.
This Monſieur <hi>de Beſons</hi> was a perſon of extraordinary
wit, and had by his rare Genius gain'd himſelf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Friends; but the beſt of them all was <hi>Monſieur</hi>
the Chancellor, who procur'd for him the place of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> tho he had not been yet Maſter
of Requeſts, which was not cuſtomary; and he had
not only enjoy'd that Poſt three years, as is uſual for the
Intendants of Juſtice in the Provinces, but had, by the
ſame favour, been continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d there five or ſix times. In
which time he had gain'd ſo much credit and reſpect in
the Country, that the King himſelf could not have
more; for indeed I have heard him ſay, that the King
might publiſh an Edict, but he muſt have his Warrant
to it, if he expected to have it punctually executed. I
have heard him ſay one thing alſo more extraordinary
than that, and I think I have ventur'd to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
'tis grown a Cuſtom in thoſe Provinces for the
Intendants to join their Warrants to every Order that
comes from the King, but whether it be ſo or no I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m not
certain: I'le relate the ſtory as he told it me, which
was, that having receiv'd an Order to make out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
againſt one <hi>Roule,</hi> who had been an Agent in the
Rebellion of <hi>Vivares,</hi> he caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d his Head to be ſet up
upon the Gate of <hi>Aubenas,</hi> but ſome of the Relations
of the perſon that was executed took it down in the
Night; upon which he publiſht an Order the next day,
that they who had taken down the Head ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay, carry it back to the ſame place in 24 hours
time, which was obey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and the Head carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d back
accordingly. I don't know whether all people may be
of my mind, but I think it is very ſeldom a Governor
has influence enough to make himſelf obey'd in ſuch
a caſe: But if it be ever ſo, it is by ſome unuſual Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
rather than from the Love of the People. Yet
this I muſt ſay of him, that if he was fear'd he
was alſo lov'd, eſpecially by all thoſe who lov'd
diſpatch in their buſineſs; for never had man a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57806:191"/>
greater Vivacity of Spirit, which made that Province
ſo much concern'd at his removal; and the more,
ſince Mr. <hi>d' Agueſſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> who ſucceeded him, was juſt in
the other extreme. I have ſeen him dictate to three
Secretaries at once, and yet entertain me at the ſame
time without any interruption: It was not for ſuch a
man to be long unpreferr'd. After he was call'd to
Court the King truſted him in affairs of the greateſt
Intricacy: And the Chancellor, as great a man as he
was, did not at all think it below him to take meaſures
from his advice. He had indeed the greateſt Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Councellors of State; ſo that 'twas no
ſtrange thing that Mr. <hi>de St Heran</hi> ſhould be ſo willing
to oblige him, he being already in a condition to return
favours to any man, tho his Fortune was nothing yet
to what he hop'd it would be; and it was for what he
expected perhaps, rather than any gratitude for what
was paſt, that he appear'd ſo ready to ſerve the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
or any of his Family; for he conſider'd, that the
King having ſuch confidence in them, as he really had,
the only way to advance himſelf was to gain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation:
And yet he was deceiv'd in this point,
for tho Mr. the Chancellor, and the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi>
his Son, gave him great Teſtimony of their friendſhip
in ſome caſes, they fail'd him in one where he moſt
deſir'd it. At Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi>'s death, his Ambition
prompted him to no leſs than to ſucceed him in that
place, and no queſtion but he was capable enough to

and beſtow'd upon another, the grief of it broke his
heart and kill'd him.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel that happen'd at the Count <hi>de la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle</hi>'s,
having detain'd me longer there than I intended,
I had opportunity to be acquainted with all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
for there was hardly a Gentleman that knew of
the affair but came to viſit him, and offer him their
ſervice, and amongſt them ſome of all ſorts, rich and
poor; and among the latter the Count <hi>de Kermeno,</hi>
who was not of that Country, as his Name will inform
you, but who happen'd to be thereabouts; drawn not
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57806:191"/>
by the Charms of a certain Lady (for I ſhould belye
her to ſay ſhe had any) but ſhe had been an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
which to him was in lieu of all other
Charms. I knew him well enough, the Count <hi>de la
Chapelle</hi> had no need to tell me who he was, for I had
ſeen him both at the Court, and in the Army, and he
was not one jot more eſteem'd at the one than in the
other; not but that he was a very good Gentleman
born, but he made the meaneſt figure that ever was
ſeen: He had taken up the Trade of a Soldier, which
did not become him at all. His Brother the Marquis <hi>du
Garrot</hi> had done the like, and both had found the
means to be very fairly caſheer'd, after they had run
out an Eſtate of about a Million of Livres.</p>
            <p>Having known all theſe things before, it was the reaſon
I took no great notice of him; which the Count <hi>de la
Chapelle</hi> obſerving, askt me when he was gone what
that man was, ſince he had never ſeen him till he came
into thoſe parts. I told him what I knew, in which I
can ſay, I neither added nor diminiſht any thing from
the truth. I acquainted him alſo of the adventure of
his Brother, of which ſomething was ſo odd, that
the like was hardly ever heard. The Marquis <hi>du
Garrot</hi> after having ſpent all his Eſtate, and not
knowing what courſe to take, bethought himſelf of
an Expedient, by which he pretended to raiſe at
leaſt twelve or fifteen thouſand Livres a year, for the
laying down of about a thouſand Crowns in ready
Money. The Project he had for doing this, was to go
and publiſh among the Herb Women, and ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Market, that he would lend them Money at
the rate of a penny a day for every Crown, which was
the uſual Intereſt among thoſe people, and deſir'd them
to acquaint their friends of it, for that all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he had in the Bank ſhould be at their ſervice; and
that his Office ſhould be open at ſuch and ſuch conſtant
hours, and a true Regiſter ſhould be kept, as well
of Payment as Receipt. Such news as this ſoon ſpread
about, and brought multitudes to his Office; and he
gave his Money ſo ſtrangely to every body that came
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57806:192"/>
for it, that people thought he was be, divell'd. The
Commiſſary of that quarter hearing of it, goes to
the place, but could not come near for the Crowd,
till having made way thro the people, he comes in,
and there found the Marquis <hi>du Garrot</hi> himſelf, who
endeavour'd to diſguiſe himſelf, that he might not be
known, but coming up to him he demands of him what
he was a doing; the Marquis askt him what he had to do
to ask that queſtion; adding that if he had a mind to
give his Money away to whom he pleas'd, he hop'd he
might have the liberty to do it, without his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
himſelf to diſturb him. The Commiſſary not
us'd to ſuch rough Anſwers, and ſeeing what a ſorry
figure he made, was a going to carry him to Priſon;
and he, not being very willing to go, told him who
he was, hoping his Name would make ſome amends
for his ill Mein; but finding he had to do with a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that valu'd no body's quality, he was oblig'd to
muſter up all his Titles, and tell him he had marry'd
Mr. <hi>de Courcelle</hi>'s Daughter, Councellor of the Grand
Chamber; at which the Commiſſary, who ſtood more
in fear of a Councellor than of a Marquis, begun to uſe
him more civilly, and told him, that in reſpect to his
Father-in-law he would not put that affront upon him,
but that he muſt lay down his new Trade, for it had
made too much noiſe already to be continu'd; and
admitting no reply, made him ſhut up his Coffer and
his Regiſter. The Marquis ſeeing the Commiſſary in
earneſt, askt him what he muſt do for all his Money
he had given out; to which he gave him this anſwer,
that having ſo freely given about his Money to he did
not know who, it was for him to find out the way how
to get it again. In ſhort, he ſeem'd like the Man
who they ſay, obtain'd a Grant of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
for a certain Tax upon all ſuch as had ſeen a certain
Comet, that had appear'd a little before, for as he was
never the richer for it, becauſe he could never make
it out who had ſeen it, and who had not; ſo our
Marquis neither knew who they were that had taken
his Money, nor where they dwelt, nor whether they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57806:192"/>
had taken it in their own Names, or in others.</p>
            <p>At my return to <hi>Paris</hi> I fell ſick of an Ague, which
I believe might come from my eating more freely tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
I us'd to do; for the Table was always ſpread at the
Count <hi>de la Chapelle</hi>'s, and I, who had us'd my ſelf to
a very regular life, could not but be indiſpos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with ſo
unuſual a cuſtom; for being oblig'd to do as others did,
I was ill ſeveral times before I came away. I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the ordinary remedies in ſuch caſes, of
Diet and Bleeding; but my Ague ſtill encraſing
upon me, I was advis'd to change my Doctor, and
they directed me to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight, who was mighty
famous for Cures of that kind. Indeed, there was no
ſort of Agues or Feavors almoſt but he could ſtop them;
he cur'd all people that went to him, and there was no
doubt but I ſhould have had the ſame benefit: But I
underſtood, that almoſt all the people that came to him
had their Diſtemper return'd upon them again in two
or three months, ſo I did not care for meddling with
him. But however to ſatisfy my friends I ſent to him,
and deſir'd him to do me the favour to come and ſee
me; which he did: And among other things he made
me laugh heartily at a ſtory he told me of the Marquis
<hi>de Hautefort,</hi> one of the Querries to the Queen, a man
of about a hundred thouſand Livres a year Eſtate, but
ſo miſerably covetous, that tho he had neither Wife
nor Child to provide for, yet he was afraid of every body
that came near him. He was much in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as I was, and ſent to this Doctor to tell him, he
had occaſion to make uſe of his Phyſick, and therefore
deſir'd him to come and ſee him. When the Doctor
came to him he found him extraordinary bad; but
having felt his Pulſe, lookt on his Tongue, and
the like, he bid him not be diſcourag'd, for he
did not queſtion but with Gods bleſſing he ſhould
cure him, and that he would have him make uſe
of his remedy. But the Marquis reply'd, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he meddled with it, he would know what the
price of it was, for he had been told by ſome who had
to do with him, that he was a very dear man; that as
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57806:193"/>
               <hi>Moliere</hi> has it, he ought to be ſo conſcionable in his
prices, that poor ſick folks might live, who could not
elſe afford to be ſick. The Doctor was amaz'd, he ſaid,
to hear him talk at that rate, conſidering too what an
Eſtate he had, and told him, he hop'd he was but in
jeſt to talk at that rate to one who was ſo much his
humble Servant; that he ſhould be very glad if he
could but cure him; he did not uſe to talk of price to
perſons of his quality, and he ſhould do what he pleas'd
with him, as to that they would not differ; but all this
ſignify'd nothing, he would have the price fixt, or he
would talk no further of it: The Doctor thinking he
ought to obey him, told him, that perſons of his figure
never us'd to offer him leſs than 50 Piſtoles, but that
as he had ſaid before, he ſhould do what he pleas'd with
him; at which words the Marquis roar'd out as if he
had been kill'd, that he was afraid the people of the
Houſe would have thought he had offer'd him ſome
inſolence; that ſeeing him in ſuch a paſſion he left him
to vent it by himſelf; when after having rav'd for a
good while, he call'd for him again, and offer'd him
four Piſtoles; but the Doctor telling him as before,
that he would leave it to him, he flew out in a paſſion
again, and bid him get him out of his Houſe, he would
have nothing to do with him nor his Phyſick; upon
which the Doctor immediately ſhow'd him his back,
and went away; but was no ſooner got home,
but he was follow'd by a Lacquey from the Marquis to
offer him one Piſtole more; and ſo for four days ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
he ſent the ſame Meſſenger to chaffer with
him for his Phyſick, ſtill off'ring him every day a
Piſtole more, till at laſt he was pleas'd to dye before
the bargain was made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I gave the more faith to this ſtory, becauſe I knew
a great many ſordid tricks of his before, and had
ſeen one among the reſt, than which I never ſaw
a worſe, which was in the Progreſs we made at
the Marriage of the Dauphin, for I ſtill endeavour'd
to live in the beſt figure I could; and tho I had but a
ſmall Eſtate, yet I always follow'd the Court. In this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57806:193"/>
I happen'd to lodge in the ſame Houſe with this
Marquis</hi> de Hautefort, <hi>and the Landlord one day had
caught the Marquis's Coachman ſtealing his Oats;
upon which he came to tell his Maſter of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſatisfaction.</hi> For what? <hi>reply'd the Marquis,</hi>
Why you ſay your ſelf, that you only took him ſtealing your
Corn, and that you made him give it you back again. Yes
truly, <hi>ſays the good man,</hi> what I found upon him I made
him return, but I have loſt half the Oats that were in the
Cheſt; for I know how many were put in, and there are
not above half ſo many left now. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſays the Marquis
very coldly,</hi> they might be eaten by your own Horſes;
bring me Witneſſes that 'twas my Coachman ſtole them, and
he ſhall make you ſatisfaction. But, Sir, <hi>ſays the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,</hi>
is not this Witneſs enough that I catcht him in the
fact, I have no other Witneſſes; but I have brought him to
you. More ſhame for thee, <hi>reply'd the Marquis;</hi> Don't
you know well enough, that without Witneſs there's nothing
to be done at Law? Look you friend, ſince you have no
Witneſs, pray go about your buſineſs, and trouble me no
more with ſuch impertinent ſtories.</p>
            <p>This was all the Juſtice the poor man could get of
him, and ſo he came to make his complaint to me,
of the wrong he had done him; but I could ſay
nothing to it, but ſhrugging up my ſhoulders told
him, there was no remedy but patience, which
he was forc'd to uſe; and indeed he had more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for that Vertue afterward: for when he went
away, he was ſo far from paying him for what
his men had ſpoil'd, that he hardly paid him for their
Diet; or if he did, 'twas at ſuch a ſcandalous price,
that the man never receiv'd the Money it coſt him.
But ſince I am got into this Journey, I muſt tell one
ſtory, which is very pleaſant, of what

a Miſtreſs in a Town where the King and
the whole Court lodg'd, and happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be there when the Quarter-maſter General came
to the Town, he made friends to have that Houſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted:
this Intendant had the misfortune to be a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57806:194"/>
little like the Meſſieurs <hi>du Garrot,</hi> that is, to make but
a very indifferent figure, which made the Quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
not knowing who he was, tell him by way of
banter, Yes, yes, he ſhould be excus'd, indeed, and
why not; but at the ſame time taking his Chalk,
markt that Houſe as he had done the others. The
Intendant was not diſcourag'd, but perſiſted in his
ſuit, hoping to do it without diſcovering himſelf, for
he was then <hi>incognito;</hi> he ſpoke to him again, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
him to exempt that Lady, aſſuring him, that if
he knew her, he would think it worth his while; but
finding that he did not take much notice of that, he
told him his quality, and that it might lye in his way
to return his kindneſs. The Quarter-maſter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his character, askt his pardon, that he had
not done it at firſt, and immediately granted his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
both on account of the Lady, and alſo of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
A little before this, juſt ſuch an adventure hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to me. A Gentleman of my acquainta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, who
had ſome buſineſs with the Preſident <hi>de Bretonvilliers,</hi>
writ to me to wait upon him from him. I went to him
to his fine Country Houſe in the <hi>Iſle de Noſtre Dame,</hi>
and the Porter telling me he was in his Chamber, I
went croſs the Court-yard to go up to him: I did not
know him in the leaſt, whether he was old or young,
or what manner of man he was; however, I happen'd
to light on him, as I was going up the ſtairs, with a
wooden Candleſtick in his hand, juſt as if he had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down into the Celler; I askt him which was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
Chamber, he told me he was the man; and if
my buſineſs was to ſpeak with him, I need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I was ſo ſurpriz'd with this ſudden reply, that I
ſtood like one that had been caught in ſome ill fact, but
he very civilly helpt me out of my confuſion himſelf,
asking me if there was any thing he could ſerve me in;
ſo that finding he was not affronted, I ſoon recover'd
my ſelf. One would infer from what I have ſaid, that
the Preſident was no very gentile man that I ſhould
miſtake him ſo; but I muſt ſay this to his advantage,
that he was a perſon of a great deal of Honour. This
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57806:194"/>
accident introduc'd me into his acquaintance, and was
the occaſion that we were afterwards very familiar;
and this I can ſay of my own knowledge of him, that
tho every body now adays ſeem to regard nothing but
their own intereſt, yet I have ſeen him do thoſe things
which ſhow him of a truly generous diſpoſition, tho he
was Son of one of the Farmers of the Kings Revenues,
a ſort of people not very famous for their Honeſty or
Generoſity.</p>
            <p>It is not every body would ſo eaſily have paſt by ſuch
a miſtake, eſpecially when a man is ſurpriz'd in any
figure below his character, of which I had a proof a
little before that in another caſe; going to ſee a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of the Inqueſts, call'd <hi>Machaut,</hi> who liv'd in
<hi>La Rue Michael de Comte,</hi> I had a little proceſs before
him, and going by accident by his door, I took that
opportunity to ask him, if he would pleaſe to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the trouble to examine it. He that open'd the
door told me he was at home, and deſir'd me to walk
in, and he would tell him there was one to ſpeak with
him. I did ſo, and coming to a door that lookt into
the Garden I open'd it, and thro it I ſaw a man in his
Drawers, with a Night Cap on, hard at work till he
ſweat again: Who ſhould this be, but my Lawyer, who
was a mighty great Floriſt, and one indeed that ſeem'd
fitter to ſet Tulips than to try Cauſes. I lookt on him a
good while before he turn'd about, he was ſo intent upon
what he was a doing; but at laſt being forc'd to raiſe
himſelf up to take breath a little, he ſpy'd me, and
coming up briskly, askt me who I would ſpeak with, I
told him with Mr. <hi>de Machaut,</hi> little thinking I ſpoke
to him himſelf; but he preſently made me know it,
asking me more briskly than before, What I would
have with him; <hi>Give him a Brief,</hi> ſaid I, with a little
heat, not being very well pleas'd to be us'd ſo; <hi>Give it
me then,</hi> ſaid he, in the ſame tone he began with, <hi>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> I
am the perſon you would ſpeak with, and that you ſhall
know ſoon enough to teach you to take a better time to ſpeak
to your Judge.</hi> Nothing could be pleaſanter than our
converſation; for my Cauſe being but a trifling matter,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57806:195"/>
that I did not much care which way it went, I did not
ſpare him at all; 'twould have made any body laugh
to hear us. However, tho I was now ſo much affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I gave him my Brief, and he vouchſaf'd to read it;
and he was no ſooner come to my Name in it, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
changing both his countenance and his ſtile,
he askt me what Family I was of, and if I was not of
ſuch and ſuch a Family, and a kin to ſuch and ſuch,
naming their qualities and offices, more than ever I
had heard of, tho I thought I knew perfectly all the
Preferments had belong'd to any of our Family; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I anſwer'd yes to all, the ſooner to be rid of his
enquiry; upon which he embrac'd me, and told me
that we were Relations, and began to reckon up our
Genealogy in ſuch a manner, that for my life I could
make nothing at all of it; however I confirm'd every
thing he deſir'd, and ſo from that time forward he
would needs call me Couſin; telling me tho, I
ſhould not mention to any body, that I had ſpoken to
him before the judgment of my Suit, becauſe if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
party ſhould hear of it, 'twere enough to make
them reflect on him. I told him, that he might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
I would not, and ſo we parted as good friends as
any in the world; and four or five days after he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
my Cauſe, tho 'twas almoſt a Proverb of him,
that to put a Cauſe into his hands was the only way to
have it never ended.</p>
            <p>But in mentioning of Monſieur <hi>Hautefort,</hi> I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
engag'd in ſtories which I had not deſign'd, and
am gone off from the ſtory of the Dauphins Marriage,
which I intended, and which perhaps may be as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
as any, to thoſe who are pleas'd to hear of the
motions of great perſons, which is a humor much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
now. The Princeſs being arriv'd at <hi>Sermaiſes,</hi> and
the King and the Dauphin at <hi>Chalons,</hi> 'twas reſolv'd the
firſt interview ſhould be about the mid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>way. In the
mean time the King taking no notice of any thing, ſent
the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> who was the Dauphins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
to compliment her in the name of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;
but withal to obſerve, if ſhe was ſo reſerv'd
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57806:195"/>
as ſhe was ſaid to be, for there was ſome who
had reported, that ſhe was a Princeſs not at all of a
humour agreeable to the Genius of the <hi>French</hi> Nation,
who are the moſt pleaſant and obliging people in the
world; and deſirous above all things, that the perſons
who they are oblig'd to obey ſhould agree with them in
humour and diſpoſition. He had orders alſo, in caſe he
found it ſo as was reported, to inſinuate gently in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to her, that the manners of the <hi>French</hi> were quite
different from thoſe of the <hi>Germans;</hi> ſo if it were poſſible
to move her to comply with the <hi>French</hi> air as much
as ſhe could, that ſhe might not only oblige the King
and her Husband, but alſo the whole Nation, among
whom ſhe had already a very good character, by
what they had heard of her, as a Princeſs of the
greateſt Wit and Gallantry in <hi>Europe;</hi> but he brought
the King word, that ſhe needed none of thoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for excepting that ſhe lov'd ſometimes to be
private, there was nothing more civil or obliging in
the world. The King himſelf alſo when he came two
leagues from <hi>Chalons,</hi> had the firſt rencounter with her
to his infinite ſatisfaction. Aſſoon as the King appear'd,
and before he could come to ſalute her, ſhe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of her Coach; which when the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and that ſhe was coming towards him, he alſo
alighted, follow'd by the Dauphin at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as it had without doubt been all appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the King, who gave orders in all ſuch caſes
himſelf. After the King had ſpoke a few words to the
Princeſs, who kneel'd at his feet, he preſented the
Dauphin to her, and after that all the perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Train. This firſt Enterview was in the
open field, which being not a place to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Boot of the Coach. Being arriv'd at <hi>Chalons,</hi> the
Ceremonies of the Marriage were ſolemnized. In the

with the young Lady, and had taken her from the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57806:196"/>
Queen, whom ſhe waited upon before, knowing her to
be the moſt capable perſon in the Kingdom. It was
thought ſtrange tho, that being Lady of Honour to the
Queen, ſhe could be in no higher quality to the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phineſs,
which ſeem'd rather to degrade, than advance
her. But ſhe, who was a Lady of great Wit, did not
take it ſo, for ſhe lookt more upon the confidence the
King plac'd in her, than the Title; and in endeavouring
to pleaſe her new Miſtreſs, and in obliging alſo the
King himſelf, ſhe let us know, that Diſcretion
makes all things eaſy to perſons who underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The King made no ſtay at <hi>Chalons,</hi> the Queen
waiting for them at <hi>Villers Cotterets;</hi> and every hour
was a year to her, till ſhe ſaw the Lady who was to be
her Sons Wife; and the King alſo, being willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to gratify her in ſo juſt a deſire, loſt no time any
where till he came thither, where they had prepar'd
all manner of diverſions to entertain them with; Balls,
Muſick, Comedies, and every thing they could deviſe;
and tho it was in <hi>Lent,</hi> yet 'twas thought, no time
could diſpence them from demonſtrating that joy which
every body was toucht with, to ſee the Heir of ſo
mighty a Kingdom wedded to a Princeſs of ſo great
merit. They ſtay'd here fifteen days; after which the
King went for <hi>Paris.</hi> I cannot forbear here to give an
account of my own folly, for I cannot give a better
name to that ſtrong fancy I had to be always following
the Court. I ſtaid at <hi>Villers Cotterets</hi> all the while the
King was there, tho with ſo little accommodation, that
I was fain to lye upon Straw. Indeed, the place not
being able to lodge the tenth part of the company,
ſome were fain to go 2 or 3 leagues every night for a
Lodging; others encampt in the Fields. For my part,
I was ſo crippled with my hard Lodging, that when
I came to get a Horſeback I found my ſelf very
uneaſy. One of thoſe who had danc'd at the Ball,
ſeeing me in ſuch a caſe, told me, that if I would
lend him my Horſe, he would give me his place
in the Coach. I took him at his word, for nothing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57806:196"/>
could have pleas'd me better: But being got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the company of all the great Dancers of the Town,
there was a parcel of diſcourſe which was ſo far
from diverting me, that I was more uneaſy there than
I ſhould have been upon my Horſe; and the weather
too prov'd ſo bad, that we could take but very ſhort
Stages; and at laſt, to make up all, the Coach over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and in ſo dirty a place, that it was half a
day before we could get out, for we were forc'd for
help to go to the neighbouring Villages; all this while
I ſtorm'd, and call'd my ſelf a hundred fools for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my ſelf into this needleſs trouble. We had ſet
out ſomething before the reſt, that we might be at
<hi>S. Germain</hi> as ſoon as the King, but now we were like
to be left a long way behind. When the King paſt by
us, in that condition, he ſent to ſee who we were
that were in ſuch a pickle? and when he was told
it was the Dancers, he laught heartily, and ſaid, <hi>He
had rather it were they than any others, for they had the
beſt Legs; but he doubted they would find it hard to dance
handſomely upon ſuch a Stage as that.</hi> This was told us
by a Gentleman of the Wardrobe, who had a relation
among us; and tho it is the cuſtom to admire every
thing the King ſays, we diſpenc'd with doing it now,
being too dull at our misfortune to laugh at any thing:
at laſt, after a great deal of patience, we got out of
that ugly place, and were forc'd to get ſix freſh Horſes
for the Coach. We were all <hi>French-men,</hi> and ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
apt to forget our paſt miſchances; we thought of
them no more after we once got to <hi>Senlis;</hi> we talkt
of nothing there but making good cheer, and our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
finding the Wine very good, drank as much
as inclin'd them all to go to ſleep.</p>
            <p>The next day we reacht our Journeys end, and when
I came home found a man at my Lodgings that ſtay'd
for me, with whom I once took a longer Journey than
this, tho not ſo unpleaſant. 'Twas while I was with the
Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu.</hi> He had ſent me into <hi>Languedoc</hi>
to carry ſome diſpatches to the Duke <hi>de Montmorenci,</hi>
Governour of that Province; and as I was riding poſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57806:197"/>
back again, I met with ſuch a bad Horſe a little beyon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Peage</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> that I think if a man was to be
flea'd alive, he could not endure more than I did. I
had done better a thouſand times, aſſoon as I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this unlucky chance, to have got upon the Poſt-boys
Horſe, or have gone on Foot; but thinking that
by ſpurring and whipping I ſhould get him along, I
fatigu'd my ſelf ſo, as I think I never felt ſo much
pain in my life. In the mean time the Poſt-boy, whom
I had ſwore at, and threatned hard enough, run away,
for fear I ſhould be as good as my word; ſo I was left
in the middle of a great Plain, like a Vagabond; then
I try'd to light and walk a foot, but that brought me
into another perplexity, for the Jade would not lead,
but hung back, till I was afraid ſhe would have
lugg'd my Arm of. I thought I would cure that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo I turn'd her afore, and let her go looſe; but then
ſhe would ſtand ſtock ſtill till I came up to drive her;
and then inſtead of going forward ſhe would
do nothing, but go from one ſide to the other;
ſo being ſoon tir'd with that ſport I got up again: but
then I was put to the torture again. I ſhort, I believe
I ſhould never have reacht the next Stage, if I had not
with the help of Whip and Spur overtook a Horſe Litter
going my way, where the perſon who was in it, prov'd
the very Man, that, as I ſaid, ſtaid for me at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with one of his Brothers. I askt them how far
it was to <hi>Peage,</hi> and the Man ſeeing what a ſorrowful
condition I was in, told me if I pleas'd I might come
into the Horſe Litter, and his Brother ſhould get up on
my Horſe, and then the way would not ſeem half ſo
long to me. He could not have offer'd me a greater
kindneſs; then taking him at his word I got up preſently,
and really I found him a Man of ſuch an excellent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that tho I was intollerable weary, yet I was
mightily pleas'd with his converſation. Being arriv'd
at <hi>Peage</hi> we ſupp'd together, and the next day I made uſe
of his Carriage to <hi>Vienne,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lyons,</hi>
where (being in no great haſte) I ſtaid 3 or 4 days to
reſt me. This Man came to <hi>Lyons</hi> to have a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57806:197"/>
of Phyſitians for an old Diſtemper which he had
had upon him a long time, and his Brother came with
him only to keep him company; but it was the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Conſultation, I believe, that ever was heard of; and
I can ſpeak with the more certainty of it, becauſe I was
there my ſelf. He told the Doctors, he did not come
to them to know if he ſhould recover his health, by
obſerving thoſe forms and rules of living which they
generally impoſe upon their Patients, but whether or
no he might be cur'd, and yet live on at his own old
rate; that he had always eat well, and drunk hard, and
lov'd a Woman, and intended to do ſo ſtill; and if
they could undertake to cure him upon thoſe terms well
and good. The Doctors ſtar'd upon one another,
hearing him talk at this rate, and all with one voice
condemn'd him to dye; ſince he was reſolv'd to live his
own way, in contempt of Science and their Rules. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
becauſe he ſhould not altogether loſe his labour,
they told him, tho they could ſay little to him, ſince he
would not refrain from thoſe Debauches; yet they
would give him ſome ſmall thing to take, and order him
to bleed often. This was indeed the ready way to kill
the Man, and ſo it prov'd, for he dy'd the latter end of
that year. He had a Benefice of about a thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
a year, which is conſiderable in that Country, and
when he dy'd became vacant. His Brother immediately
takes Poſt, and comes away to me, to deſire me to uſe
any intereſt to get it for him. I had no great intereſt
truly, but having the honour to belong to the Prime
Miniſter, made me have ſome reſpect more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in the world: I went to the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi>
in whoſe Gift it was, and he granted it me at the firſt
word; and ever ſince the poor Man is ſo grateful to
me, that every year he ſends me a Preſent of ſome
thing or other that's rare in the Country; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he comes to <hi>Paris,</hi> I am always the firſt perſon he
makes a viſit to. He was come this time, about a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
he had with the Marquis <hi>de Riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rolles,</hi> Colonel
of the Royal Regiment of <hi>Piemont,</hi> one of the Grand
Priors of the Order of <hi>St. Lazarus;</hi> and it was upon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57806:198"/>
the account of this laſt dignity of the Marquis, that he
came to have a diſpute with him; for having ſome
Dues, where the Marquis alſo had a Claim, their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who liv'd there agreed ſo ill, that their Maſters
were fain to be concern'd in it, and were now juſt on
the point of going to Law. I told him preſently he
had better never begin it, if he could avoid it, becauſe
he would have a very powerful Adverſary, not becauſe
of the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> who had no more friends
than other folks, but becauſe of Monſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi>
who muſt be a Party, as he was Vicar General of the
Order: he told me he was of my opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was come directly to me to beg my aſſiſtance,
for that he thought he had heard me ſay, I was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
acquainted with Monſieur <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and
having had ſo much experience of my friendſhip, he
did not queſtion but I would aſſiſt him to the beſt of
my power. I told him he was very much in the right,
for ſo I would, but that it was not in my power to do
him any ſervice in this Caſe, for that on certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
which I could tell him, Monſieur <hi>de Rivarolles</hi>
and I had fallen out, and I had no intereſt in him at all.
Indeed Monſieur <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> was a perſon of a thouſand
good qualities; he was a very gentile man, and a man
of Wit and Bravery enough, but withal ſo very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
that he would quarrel with the beſt friend he
had for the value of Six-pence; by which humour he
embroyl'd himſelf in a multitude of brangles and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels:
But as this did not concern me, ſo I ſhould not
have toucht upon it, if he had but ſhown himſelf a man
of honour, and kept his word with me. The difference I
had with him was on this account. Meeting him one day
at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> he came up to me and embrac'd me,
and after a croud of Careſſes askt me, what I had done
for my Nephew. I told him I had plac'd him in the
Kings Regiment; for at that time he was in that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He told me, that if I would let him have him, he
would help him to a Company in his own Regiment, and
it ſhould not coſt him a Farthing, for he had a Captain
who he did not like, and if it were poſſible he would
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57806:198"/>
have him caſheer'd; and if I would joyn with him, aſſoon
as ever 'twas done he would acquaint me with it, that
I might uſe my intereſt to get it; that he did not care
to ask it himſelf, leſt it ſhould be thought he had
pickt a quarrel with t'other on purpoſe to oblige me;
but to be ſure they at the Office would ſpeak with him
before it was granted to any body, and then he would
do his part.</p>
            <p>There could be nothing more generous than ſuch a
diſcourſe as this; and therefore thinking my ſelf oblig'd
to acknowledge it, I took my Nephew along with me to
wait upon him, to whom alſo he renew'd the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
he had made to me; but he was never able to
bring it to paſs, and the Captain had ſo many friends,
that 'twas not in his power to turn him out, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
However, I thought my ſelf extreamly oblig'd to
him for what he had done; and as my Nephew was grown
weary of ſerving any longer in the Infantry, I advis'd
him to buy a Company in his Regiment; then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
if there was any Captain in that Regiment
diſpos'd to ſell, and I underſtood the Baron <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſquiou</hi>
had an inclination to lay down. I went to the
Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and told him, that my Nephew
having ſo much experience of his Friendſhip, was
reſolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to ſerve under him; and that there being no
Company to be got <hi>gratis,</hi> he was reſolv'd to buy one;
that Monſieur <hi>de Monteſquiou</hi> was reſolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to part with
his; but before we treated with him I was willing to
acquaint him of it, and ask his advice. He told me, I
was to blame to be ſo forward, he was ſorry that my
Nephew had not patience to ſtay a little longer, that
certainly one or other would drop, which it might be
in his power to procure for him without paying for it;
but if he was ſo willing to part with his Money, he
thought himſelf very much oblig'd to me for asking his
advice, and giving him an opportunity to ſerve him,
and he would endeavour he ſhould have no cauſe
to repent it; that they would be Companions, and a
great many fine things he ſaid to me of this ſort, and
made me ſtay and dine with him. The Marquis <hi>de
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57806:199"/>
Teilon,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Merodes,</hi> who marry'd the
Marchioneſs <hi>de Vervi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> din'd with us, they having
come together from <hi>Aveſnes,</hi> where his Regiment was
in Garriſon. We drank together all four in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
friendſhip in the world; and there he told me a
ſtory how Monſieur <hi>de Teilons</hi> man dropt a Bag with
500 Piſtoles in it as they came along, and going back
immediately, light of the man that found them. In
ſhort, I had all the reaſon in the world to think my
ſelf oblig'd to him, and ſo had my Nephew, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made no more words of it, but went about our
Bargain with Mr. <hi>de Monteſquiou;</hi> and I immediately
went to his Lodgings to ſpeak with him. He was the
only Son, and Heir to an Eſtate of ſeven or eight
thouſand Livres a year, and the Inclination he had to go
and ſee his Eſtate made him the eaſier to treat with, ſo
that our Bargain was ſoon concluded, and I went back
to acquaint Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> who told me he was very
glad of it, and to teſtify that he was indeed willing to
do us all the ſervice he could, he told me he would
manage the buſineſs of the Office for us himſelf, which
was eaſy enough for him to do, by acquainting Mr. <hi>de
St. Pouange,</hi> that it was with his conſent my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
enter'd into his Regiment. That this was the beſt
courſe, and if I pleas'd to be at <hi>St. Germains</hi> ſuch a
day, I ſhould ſee with my own eyes what pains he
would take to ſerve me.</p>
            <p>I had heard a great many people talk of this Monſieur
<hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and of ill things done by him; but ſeeing
him ſo very gentile to us, I began to ſay to my Friends
that he had certainly very hard meaſure, and that I
never met with an honeſter Gentleman in my Life.
Indeed, who would have thought otherwiſe of a man,
from whom one had never receiv'd any thing but good
will; at leaſt till ſome cauſe had appear'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
But it was not long before I had cauſe enough
to alter my opinion; for coming to <hi>St. Germains</hi> at the
time appointed, and finding him out, he told me he
had heard ſome News that very much ſurpriz'd him;
that Monſieur <hi>de St. Pouange</hi> having underſtood that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57806:199"/>
               <hi>Monteſquiou</hi> had a deſign to quit, had diſpos'd of his
Company to the eldeſt Son of the Count <hi>de Grand Pre,</hi>
and he being Nephew to Monſieur <hi>de Joyeuſe,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General of the Army, he durſt not ſpeak againſt
it for fear of breaking with him; that he was
mightily concern'd on my account, but the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that became vacant he would take ſuch meaſures,
that we ſhould not be diſappointed again. I gueſt
preſently he had trickt me, and leaving him with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs ceremony than I us'd to do, I met Monſieur
<hi>de Monteſquiou,</hi> who was come on purpoſe to give his
conſent. Aſſoon as I had told him what had happen'd.
<hi>Ay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this is one of Mr.</hi> de Rivarolles <hi>uſual
tricks: I could have told you before, that he would put
ſome ſham or other upon you, when I ſaw you ſo confident
of his Friendſhip; but I thought you would not be long before
you found him the worſt of Villains. This is juſt as he
ſerv'd poor</hi> Clauſel, <hi>who was his Lieutenant, and who is
now a Captain in the Regiment call'd</hi> Chevelier Duc. <hi>It
is about two years ago that he got him leave himſelf to
go home; but while he was there he wrote to him, in ſhort,
that he ſhould not trouble himſelf to come again, but
to ſend him his Commiſſion (which by the way he had
ſold for a thouſand Crowns) but</hi> Clauſel <hi>baulkt him; for
having made the General acquainted with it, he was forc'd
to give him the Money, which</hi> Clauſel <hi>had more mind to
than the Office, being not very willing to ſerve, under a Man,
that had ſhown himſelf ſo baſe. But for my part,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
he, <hi>either your Nephew ſhall have my Company,
or no body ſhall have it. Monſieur</hi> de St. Pouange <hi>muſt
not think to diſpoſe of it without my conſent; and I will
ſpeak to the King about it if there be occaſion, who I don't
doubt will do me juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was mighty glad to hear him talk thus; for I was ſo
vext at this wheadle of Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> that I was
very well pleas'd to think he ſhould meet with ſome
little mortification, which made me prompt him the
more to it. I got him then to go directly to Mr. <hi>de St.
Pouange;</hi> whom he told, that he was ſurpriz'd to hear he
had given away his Company, ſince he had always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57806:200"/>
ſerv'd the King, without ſo much as the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
in his duty; that ſince he had been in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he had always kept his Company full, and in
good condition, and perhaps he could ſay, the beſt in
the Army; that if he had a deſign to quit, he hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d he
might have the ſame priviledge as others had, who
were always allow'd to carry off a little Money; that
he had ſpent ten thouſand Crowns of his own in the
ſervice, and 'twas but reaſonable he ſhould have the
advantage of reimburſing himſelf a little; that he had
treated with my Nephew by the Kings permiſſion, at
a price both parties were content with; and if he
pleas'd to execute the Agreement, he was there ready to
make his Reſignation: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f not; he would ſpend twice
as much more, before he would be bubbled by the
Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles.</hi> Mr. <hi>de St. Pouange</hi> was ſurpriz'd
at this diſcourſe, for Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> had told him,
that <hi>Monteſquiou</hi> was content, that the Marquis <hi>de Grand
Pre</hi> ſhould have his Company; however, being a friend
of Mr. <hi>de Joyeuſe,</hi> who had ſpoke in favour of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
he return'd, that he could ſay nothing to it, but
that he ſhould have ſpoke ſooner; the thing being now
done, it was paſt remedy, for the Commiſſion was
ſealed, and wanted nothing but to be deliver'd. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Commiſſion lay upon the Table, and to put
it out of queſtion he ſhow'd it us. <hi>Monteſquiou</hi> reply'd
reſolutely, that its being diſpatcht or not ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him; that it was upon the account of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no mind to ſerve any longer, that the King had
gratified Monſieur <hi>de Grand Pre;</hi> but now his mind
was alter'd, and he declar'd the contrary; and if it
muſt be ſo he would keep it himſelf, and to convince
him, he would immediately return to Garriſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Mr. <hi>de St. Pouange</hi> was not us'd to be talkt to at this
rate, and therefore was very much affronted, and fell
out in a violent paſſion, telling us, that ſince he would
ſerve again, Monſieur <hi>de Grand Pre</hi> ſhould not have his
Company, but that he would take care alſo, that my
Nephew ſhould never have it, and that he ſhould
look that he did his Duty very well, for he
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57806:200"/>
would have an Eye upon his Conduct; bidding him
take notice, that if he receiv'd any affront, it
ſhould come from no body but himſelf. With theſe
words he took up the Commiſſion, and tearing it in
three or four pieces, threw it upon the ground, letting
us know by this action, what we had heard of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was true, that when he did eſpouſe any mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
he did it with a great deal of warmth. We made
no queſtion, but all this huff was upon the account of
Mr. <hi>de Joyeuſe.</hi> In the mean time, Monſieur <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſquiou,</hi>
being oblig'd to keep his Company, gave us an
example, that it is impoſſible to avoid our Deſtiny,
being kill'd the next Campaign in <hi>Germany.</hi> And this
obligation his Father had to Mr. <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> whom
he had ſerv'd in ſeveral occaſions to the utmoſt; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
when he had his Leg ſhot off by a Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
before <hi>Puicerda,</hi> and was carry'd to <hi>Tholouſe;</hi>
where he omitted nothing either for his Recovery or
his Diverſion; and aſſoon as he ſaw it would not be
prejudicial to his health, brought him ſome of the fineſt
Women in the Town to entertain him. Yet at the ſame
time, tho he was in a condition fitter to think of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world than of this, he could not forbear his old
Trade of defaming people, and amongſt the reſt of a
Gentleman in the Army, call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>Madaillan,</hi> a perſon
of quality, who having ſome friends in the company
that heard it, and inform'd him what the Marquis
<hi>de Rivarolles</hi> had ſaid of him; this made him come
Poſt from <hi>Paris</hi> to demand ſatisfaction; and was
the occaſion of a very pleaſant adventure. <hi>Madail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
at his arrival ſent him a Challenge, without
informing himſelf, whether he was in a condition to
fight or not. In ſhort, he that carry'd the Challenge
found him in bed, as 'twas likely enough he ſhould, a
Cannon-ſhot being not ſo ſoon cur'd, (for he lay by it
above ſix weeks after that.) However, making ſhew
as if he was very ready to give him ſatisfaction, he
only told the Meſſenger that he had taken Phyſick that
day; ſo that it was impoſſible he could go out; but the
next he did not queſtion, but he ſhould be able,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57806:201"/>
when he would ſend word where, and at what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
he would fight him. This anſwer being carry'd to
<hi>Madaillan</hi> he was mighty glad, and waited the time
appointed with a great deal of impatience. He was
awake very early in the morning, when his Servants,
who knew nothing of the matter, came and told him,
there was a Man below would ſpeak with him from
the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles.</hi> He made no queſtion, but
it was to appoint the place, and manner of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and ſo order'd them to bring
him in, and to leave them together. The man, as ſoon
as he was come in, inſtead of going to the Bed-ſide to
ſpeak with him, as he expected, goes directly to the
Table, where he laid down ſome things which he had
under his Coat; <hi>Madaillan</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and lifting himſelf up to look what it was he laid
down, he was amaz'd to ſee all the Table cover'd over
with surgeons Inſtruments: But imagining that the
man might have made ſome miſtake, he askt him, if
he was ſure he was right? and if he had not ſaid he
came from the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles? No, Sir,</hi> ſays the
man, <hi>it is no miſtake, I did ſay I came from him, and do
ſo ſtill, for he ſent me to deſire you to let me cut off one of
your Legs; for having ſent him a Challenge to fight
to day, he ſuppoſes you are more of a Gentleman than to
fight him at an advantage; and he has loſt one of his Legs
at</hi> Puicerda, <hi>of which he is not yet cur'd; and being not
ſuch a fool as to fight, maim'd as he is, againſt
a man that has all his Limbs; he deſires you would
either go firſt and loſe one of your Legs as he did, or
if you have ſuch a mind to fight, to let me cut off one for
you, for 'tis my buſineſs.</hi> The man that made him
this compliment was really a Surgeon; and <hi>Madail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
for fear he ſhould be laught at if he abus'd him,
took no notice, but bid him take up his Tools and go
about his buſineſs; but 'twas never a jot the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
for that, for the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> took care
to make it publick enough; and it being impoſſible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that to conceal the quarrel, the Deputies of the
Mareſchals of <hi>France</hi> prohibited them fighting, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made them friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:57806:201"/>
'Tis eaſie to judge from hence what a condition I
was in to aſſiſt my friend in his diſpute with Monſieur
<hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> and he being a man of ſenſe, that knew I
had good will enough for him, knew I did not ſpeak
to refuſe him my aſſiſtance. He apply'd himſelf elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and having found one who had more Intereſt
in the Marquis than I, he deſir'd him to tell the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
that he had no inclination to go to Law unleſs he
was forc'd to it, and therefore begg'd of him he would
do him juſtice; and if he would not be Judge in his
own caſe, that then he would leave it to any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
perſon whom he himſelf would chooſe. But the
Marquis would be brought to no terms, nothing would
ſerve him but the relinquiſhing all his Dues; which the
other being not willing to do, was forc'd to go to Law
with him: In the proſecution of which, I endeavour'd,
with ſome other of his friends, to ſerve him as well as
we could with the Judges. At laſt there comes a
perſon to him, who told him he ſhould not be afraid
to deal with him, for he ſhould not fail either in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
or in making Friends; and that the Marquis
himſelf ſhould not make better; and in particular, he
would undertake that Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> ſhould not
intereſt himſelf in his Cauſe, and that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon this notice. He brought me this news him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
at the ſame time telling me that he knew not
who this man was, nor whence he came, nor would
he ever let him know him; but when he askt him who
he was, and told him 'twould be a greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him to believe what he ſaid; he anſwer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
that he had Orders to do what he did, but he ſhould
ſee that he would not forſake him when he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>I was at a loſs, nor could I imagin for my life, who
it ſhould be that had ſent him this meſſage; for tho I
knew the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> had made himſelf a
great many enemies, yet I could not gueſs who it ſhould
be, that durſt undertake for ſuch a powerful protection:
If they had us'd more Modeſty, I ſhould have thought
it had been the Marquis <hi>de Carman,</hi> who had been
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57806:202"/>
Collonel of the Regiment of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and who had
more cauſe to hate him than any body; and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it will give a true character of the man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall give a diſtinct account of it, in all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and yet as ſhort as I can. The Marquis
<hi>de Rivarolles</hi> fell in love with Madam <hi>de Carman,</hi> who
dwelt then at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi>
but made no advances in her favour; till at laſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
by one of her Women, that ſhe wanted
Money, he brings a hundred Piſtoles with him in a
Purſe; with this he comes himſelf, at a time when he
knew ſhe was in Bed; whether it was, that he thought
at that time ſhe would be moſt inclin'd to pleaſure, or
that he thought he might oblige her to comply with
him with leſs difficulty; and being admitted into her
Chamber, and after ſome time having diſcover'd his
paſſion, he at the ſame time preſented her the Purſe,
which render'd his diſcourſe the more perſwaſive;
the Lady making as if ſhe had been yeilding, and yet,
that if ſhe did, it was not for the ſake of his Money,
bid him lay the Purſe upon the <hi>Toilette,</hi> thinking ſhe
ſhould get thoſe hundred <hi>Louis d' Or</hi> very cheap; but
the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> after he had done what he
pleas'd, ſeeing the Purſe upon the <hi>Toilette</hi> as he went
out, caught it up again, and took it with him without
being ſeen. When the Lady roſe, ſhe went to pleaſe
herſelf with what ſhe thought herſelf ſure of, but was
ſtrangely ſurpriz'd when ſhe found 'twas gone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be in ſtrange fears what ſhould become of her,
having heard often enough what kind of a Man the
Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> was, which indeed might be the
reaſon ſhe would be paid before-hand; but this ſhe ſaw
had not ſucceeded. She conceal'd her reſentment; but
took up the ſtrangeſt reſolutions poſſible, and ſuch, as
had ſhe had power ſuitable to her courage, might have
had very ill effects. In the mean time, he, as if it had
not been enough to have abus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d her, made it as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
as he could, and made ſport of it in all company.
Such a ſtory as this ſoon ſpread all over the Country,
which when ſhe came to hear of it again, it is an eaſy
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57806:202"/>
matter to imagin what condition ſhe was in; ſhe was
a thouſand times about to have expos'd herſelf to the
firſt that would revenge her upon him; but while ſhe
thus meditated miſchief, ſhe receiv'd a Letter from her
Husband, who by this time had heard of it too, which
bid her expect to live no longer than he ſhould return,
which joyn'd to her guilty Conſcience put her into a
grievous fright; and as if ſhe was not yet unhappy
enough, ſhe finds that ſhe was with Child by this fact,
which aggravated her grief to the laſt extremity, and
made her take up a reſolution which I cannot relate
without horror; for tho I did not know her, yet I had
the honour to be acquainted with her Father, who
was a uſeful man, and very well in eſteem with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarine.</hi> In ſhort, ſhe poiſon'd herſelf, aſſoon
as ſhe knew her Husband was on his return from the
Army; ſo he was diſappointed in his furious deſign,
which I think he ought rather to have vented upon
him who was the Author of his diſgrace. But tho
he was high enough in threatning his Wife, he had not
courage enough to revenge it upon the Adulterer; and
tho he came into his company a thouſand times, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
durſt take notice of it.</p>
            <p>All the world knew this ſtory, and that made me
think, that tho Monſieur <hi>Carman</hi> durſt not openly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with him, yet he would have been glad to have ſome
miſchief befal him, and ſo had ſent privately to my friend
about his Suit; but a little after I alter'd my opinion,
and rather thought it might be the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi>
with whom he had ſome difference but a little before.
However, he was not to blame in this affair; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my quarrel was at him, I muſt tell the truth, and
will do ſo. They had been at play together ſeveral
times, and the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi> had loſt 3 or 400
Piſtoles to him, which he had very honeſtly paid him,
and having won back about one hundred and fifty,
could not get one penny of it; when at laſt, having
askt him for the Money a great many times, and he
had made him a great many promiſes, but never kept
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57806:203"/>
one, he goes away to his Tent and ſeizes upon his
Horſes, and one of his Grooms making ſome oppoſition,
he Can'd him very handſomely. The Marquis <hi>de Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres</hi>
being a perſon of quality, ſuch an affront as
this went very near him; and tho there was afterwards
an Accommodation, yet 'twas thought he had ſtill a
grudge in his mind againſt him, at leaſt I thought ſo;
and having told my friend this ſtory, we concluded
that it muſt be from him, and that if it was, his
buſineſs would certainly go well, for Mr. <hi>de Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres</hi>
was a perſon who had Relations and Friends of
very good credit; but that which gave me the greateſt
hope was the aſſurance he gave him, that Mr. <hi>de Louvois</hi>
ſhould not be againſt him.</p>
            <p>However, to know whether this was a thing to be
truſted to or not, I advis'd him to go and ſee this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
and acquaint him, that Monſieur <hi>de Rivarolles</hi>
had forc'd him to a Proceſs which was very cruel and
unjuſt, and that before he did any thing in it, he was
come to throw himſelf and his concerns into his hands;
that as it was a thing which had ſome relation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Order of <hi>Saint Lazarus,</hi> he knew his duty
too well to do any thing before he had askt his leave;
that he deſir'd no better Judge than himſelf, if he could
admit himſelf from his more weighty affairs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it; and if not, he ſhould be infinitely oblig'd to
him, that he would appoint any fit perſon to hear it.
Mr. <hi>de Louvois</hi> receiv'd him very kindly, and told him
he would leave it to the ordinary Judges, but promis'd
him he would not any way hinder him from having
juſtice done. So the Proceedings began, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Rivarolles,</hi> who knew he was at a diſtance from
home, made at firſt a great many ſhifts and tricks to
tire him out. In the mean time, the man who had
promis'd to ſollicit for him was as good as his word,
and aſſiſted him conſiderably. However, ſeeing that
do whatever he could, and his friend too, the affair
went on very ſlowly, he began to be ſick of the Town,
and very impatient; ſo that at laſt, being overcome
with a violent deſire to return into the Country again,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57806:203"/>
and live in quiet, he offer'd the Marquis <hi>de Rivarolles</hi>
two hundred Piſtoles to make an end of it. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
who ſaw the ſtream run againſt him in the Court,
and that the King, who every year took the field,
was now preparing to form a Camp, whether
'twas very likely he ſhould be oblig'd to go, was
overjoy'd at the Propoſal; eſpecially for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſo much ready Money too, which he had no
ſmall occaſion for.</p>
            <p>My Lodgings were in the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Germain.</hi> In
the morning it was my conſtant employment to viſit
my friends, and after Dinner to divert my ſelf at play;
for tho I knew well enough, that Gaming is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Exerciſe, yet being too old for the Ladies, there
was a neceſſity I ſhould do ſomething to paſs away the
time. One day a friend of mine carry'd me to a famous
Gaming Houſe, which was not far from my Lodging,
at the little <hi>Hotel deCrequi.</hi> A dangerous place it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but eſpecially for young folks, who have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
experience in the world. In ſhort, 'twas a meer
publick cheat, and I wonder'd that in ſo orderly a City
as <hi>Paris,</hi> the Government did not take notice of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and above all, I admir'd the Duke <hi>de Crequi,</hi> under
whoſe name they kept it, and who had had a thouſand
complaints made to him of it, ſhould never take any
notice of it. But he left the management to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his Guards, whoſe Fees it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
covetous, that tho he has a prodigious Eſtate,
and no Children to leave it to but an only Daughter;
yet rather than put himſelf to any charge, he lets
them do what they will, not regarding the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
effect, ſo he can but ſave the Sallaries of his
two wicked Officers. One of whom methinks he ſhould
not be fond to retain, conſidering how little it is for his
credit to keep ſuch a fellow in his Houſe, who was
before only a ſorry Exempt, and us'd to be hir'd to
guard Malefactors to the place of Execution, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſhould have been carry'd himſelf long before,
if he had had his due. For the other I can't ſay
much, being of another ſort, having never ſaw any
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57806:204"/>
great harm by him. He was a Cadet too, ſo it was more
pardonable for him to get Money by any method, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Maſter practice it before him.</p>
            <p>Under the conduct of theſe two Gentlemen, this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Tricks and Shams was manag'd, and the very
firſt day I went among them I ſaw ſo many hanging
countenances, that I was afraid, inſtead of bringing
me into a Houſe, he had brought me into a Wood to
be robb'd; my friend perceiving my concern told me,
the Rogues that us'd to frequent that place were fled;
for ſome of the gang having been taken and ſeverely
puniſh'd but a little before, had frighted away the reſt,
ſo I needed not be apprehenſive of any thing. Indeed
there had been two of them taken, who having loſt
all their Money, had took to the High-way, and
were broken upon the Wheel; one was the Count
<hi>de la Salle,</hi> and the other the Chevalier <hi>Deſpine,</hi> but
their Titles could not ſave them. All this however
did not give me much ſatisfaction, no more than the
Guards of Monſ. <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who were plac'd in the
Anti-Chamber, but I went with a great deal of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
into the place where the Scene lay, and where my
friend preſenting me to the Directors as a man very fit
to aſſiſt them in their affairs, I was complimented at a
great rate. However, all this did not pleaſe me,
and I believe, if it had been poſſible, I had immediately
came out again, if I had not ſeen the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi>
a Gentleman of <hi>Burgogndy,</hi> who was at play in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Room with one whom I did not know. I
knew him to be a very honeſt Gentleman, and a Man
of a good Eſtate; ſo I went to ſeat my ſelf by him, but
there being no room, I was forc'd to ſit by him that plaid
with him. They were playing at <hi>Picquet,</hi> for no ſort
of Game came amiſs to them here, tho that which the
Directors lik'd beſt was <hi>Lanſquenet,</hi> becauſe they got
moſt by it; but now they were at <hi>Picquet.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who plaid with the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> was one
of thoſe Gameſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, who have no better fortune than
others in an honeſt way; but I am perſwaded he was
the fineſt fellow in the world at cheating. I muſt have
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57806:204"/>
been very incredulous indeed if I had not been of that
opinion, ſeeing him, as I did, perform a notable piece
of dexterity. I believe he was not very well pleas'd
with my ſitting ſo near him, which was the reaſon,
that for ſome time he durſt not play any of his tricks;
but fortune inclining to the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> made
him venture at all hazards, and ſeeing he was like to
loſe perhaps all he had in the world, he car'd not what
pranks he plaid to recover himſelf. They were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now for the Set, the two games before he loſt; the
ſtake I believe might be about four and twenty Piſtoles,
and the Count <hi>de Rouvray,</hi> who was eldeſt hand, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but fourteen of being up, and he nine. After diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding,
the Count <hi>de Rouvray</hi> found that he had got
the <hi>point,</hi> which being but five to him, he cou'd not
reckon up; the other cou'd, if he had three Queens in
his hand, but he had laid out one, yet perceiving the
game was loſt if the Count <hi>de Rouvray</hi> Dealt, whoſe
turn it was, he made bold to reckon them. I thought
this had been only a miſtake, and was juſt a going to
tell him of it; but as I was obſerving very attentively
how this Comedy would end, a Maſter Cheat who
lookt on, as well as I, and was of the gang, taking up
the Card that was laid out, and fooling with it in his
hand, at laſt let it drop down. The other, in a great
deal of haſte, as if he had been afraid the Count ſhould
ſee it, took it up, which was the Card he wanted, and
clapt down another in the room of it. He did this
with that ſlight of hand, that I never was more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
in my Life than I was to ſee that Card in his
hand, which I had ſeen him lay out. The name of one
of theſe two Sparks was <hi>Guetart,</hi> and the other was
call'd the Chevalier <hi>de Lignerac,</hi> two famous Sharpers.
Tho I think all their Tricks made them never a jot the
richer; for the firſt, who had a good Eſtate of his own,
had ſpent it every Groat, tho he was not above five
and thirty; and the other, after having plaid his
Pranks with every body he could, was forc'd to ſculk
about in priviledg'd places, and Gentlemens houſes for
protection, for fear of a Goal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:57806:205"/>
Any body may gueſs what opinion I had of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
place. The next morning, before I was up, came
a Man to my Lodgings, one I had never ſeen in my
Life; but he told me he had ſeen me in ſuch a place,
and believing me to be a Gameſter, he waited on me to
acquaint me who underſtood things, and who did
not: You muſt note, he meant by thoſe that underſtood
things, thoſe that could cheat and trick, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
them; and thoſe who he term'd ignorant, were
ſuch as play'd fairly. He told me, if I pleas'd, he
would teach me all their Tricks; not that he thought
I would practice them, but that I might know them,
and prevent being put upon my ſelf. I thankt him for
his offer; and tho I did not think fit to make uſe of
him, yet like the Lawyers, who expect their Fees tho
they do no buſineſs, he askt me for ſomething, but
very modeſtly truly; telling me he was a Gentleman,
that he did not uſe to be in the condition he was now
in, and hop'd it would be ſoon otherwiſe; and if I
would lend him but four Piſtoles, he promis'd me on
the word of a Man of Honour to repay me. This being at
my own Lodgings, and not at <hi>L' Hotel de Crequi,</hi> I
thought I might eaſily ſtand this ſort of an attack; but
he was ſo importunate, that whatever I could ſay to
the point, I could not get off from him, tho I ſcap'd
cheaper than four Piſtoles too; for ſeeing it impoſſible
to bring me up ſo high he fell to three, and then to
two, and one, and at laſt to half a Crown, which I
was glad to give away to be rid of him. He gave me
a thouſand thanks; and was hardly gone out of doors,
but in comes another figure, who I knew no better
than I did the laſt; and his Compliment was of
another ſort, he came to invite me to Dinner; and
his buſineſs it ſeems was, when he had loſt all
his own Money, to get people together to make a
Company at <hi>Lanſquenet.</hi> Then he began to tell me
the Hiſtory of his good fortune at play; that as mean
a condition as I ſaw him in now, he had kept his Coach
and Horſes, with four Footmen, and ſuch an Equipage,
as no Ambaſſador had a greater; that he us'd to wear a
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57806:205"/>
different Suit of Cloaths every day, with his Sword-hilt
and Buttons of Maſſy Gold; and he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but to live to ſee himſelf in the ſame condition
again, for all this.</p>
            <p>After he had run on at this rate a while, he would
needs ſhow me, what an Artiſt he was at play; and
pulling a Pack of Cards out of his Pocket, he ſhow'd
me the Tricks and Slights with which they uſe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their Game. I expected however, that the bottom
of all this would be only the ſame with the t'other, a
Petition for ſome Money; but it ſeems I had to do
with one now, that was not quite ſo low and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
as the laſt; and whoſe place it ſeems did bring
him in ſomething, for he had a quarter part of the
Profit of the Box Charges deducted; the other three
parts being divided between <hi>Dugas,</hi> Lieutenant of the
Guards to Monſieur <hi>de Crequi; Du Four,</hi> an Enſign of
the ſame Guards; and one <hi>Bragalogne,</hi> a fellow that
was once in great credit for theſe ſort of Gaming-Houſes:
But the King had prohibited him from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any ſuch Houſe any more, ever ſince Monſieur <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi>
a Councellor of the Parliament, and one that loſt
all his Eſtate at gaming, was kill'd at his Houſe. This
<hi>Bragalogne</hi> had in his time, all the perſons of quality in
the Court came to him; and the other hoping, that he
having ſuch a great acquaintance, would bring a great
deal of company to their Houſe, took him into their
Partnerſhip: But the Houſe was grown ſo infamous,
that people of quality would not come near it; and
beſides he had quite loſt his credit too, particularly in
a buſineſs about the Abbot <hi>de Lignerac,</hi> Brother to the
<hi>Chevalier</hi> I mention'd before. This Abbot had a mind
to counterfeit a little honeſty, tho he lov'd it no better
than his Brother; and being much in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
had the good Fortune, or rather the Art, to win
four or five hundred thouſand Francs; for he underſtood
things (to uſe the Term my Gentleman taught me.)
At laſt, having got a great deal of Money among
them, but not ſo honeſtly but he was afraid he ſhould
be oblig'd to make reſtitution; meeting therefore one
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57806:206"/>
day with a Gentleman whoſe name is <hi>Erouard,</hi> of whom
he had got ſeven or eight hundred Piſtoles; he told him,
that if he would releaſe him for threeſcore Piſtoles, of
what he might owe him, he would give him them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.
<hi>Erouard,</hi> taking this for raillery, and that he
only jeer'd him, becauſe he had won his Money, told
him, he demanded nothing of him, nor knew of any
thing he ow'd him. Upon which the Abbot pretending
to inform him, told him, that he had ſome ſcruple
upon his mind about it; that he had taken the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his Age, which made him remiſs, and not mind
his Play as he ought to have done; which made him
fear, that the Money he had won of him, when they
play'd together at <hi>Bregalogne</hi>'s, was not honeſtly gain'd;
that 'tis true many people would not be ſo ſcrupulous,
but for his part, rather than have any thing of that
kind lye upon his conſcience, he choſe to make him
the reſtitution he had offer'd. <hi>Erouard,</hi> as old as he
was, yet underſtood the meaning of all this, and ſeeing
it was better to have 60 Piſtoles of his Money than
nothing, readily took them, and gave him a diſcharge.
The Abbot telling the Money out, told him alſo, that
he ſhould go to <hi>Bragalogne,</hi> and if he manag'd him
rightly, he would make him refund too; that he had
always gone halves when they play'd together, and his
own guilt would make him comply. But it would
not take with <hi>Bragalogne,</hi> who was us'd to win, but
not to return it again; he told him plainly, the
Abbot <hi>de Lignerac</hi> might well make him ſuch a Preſent,
becauſe he had a very good Eſtate; but as for him, his
circumſtances were not ſo well, and in ſhort, he had
neither Inclination nor Ability.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Gentlemen, not content to get all the
Gameſters Money at the years end, by their Impoſition
and Tax upon Play, which they call'd by the name of
<hi>de Ronde;</hi> endeavour'd alſo to ſecure it by other means
more ſhort and expeditious. In fine, he that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
me thither the day before, coming in juſt as the
Man invited me to Dinner, they got me away in ſpight
of my reſolution; where I ſaw Monſieur <hi>de Four</hi> was
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57806:206"/>
not far behind <hi>Bragalogne:</hi> he was at play with a young
Coxcomb newly come from Sea, and had ſet a Rogue
to look on his game, and give him notice by ſigns
what Cards he had in his hand. Every body ſaw it, as
well as I, and talkt of it publickly, the thing was ſo
plain. I askt them what this Cully's Name was, and
ſomebody telling me it was the Chevalier <hi>de Liſſac,</hi> I
enquir'd whence he came, for I remembred there was
once a Man of that Name that did me a particular
kindneſs; they told me he was of the County of <hi>Foix,</hi>
and the party I meant being of thoſe parts, I imagin'd
he might be of that Family; and being concern'd to
ſee him there, I told him, if he would take my advice I
would have him play no more. <hi>Du Four</hi> was in ſome
confuſion at my ſaying ſo, imagining I ſuppoſe that I
had perceiv'd ſomething. However <hi>Liſſac</hi> would not
leave off; but <hi>du Four</hi> left off himſelf, for fear, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I ſhould tell at laſt what I had obſerv'd. In
ſhort, I took Monſieur <hi>de Liſſac</hi> aſide, and telling him
who I was, I convinc'd him how much he had been
abus'd; which put him into ſuch a rage as made him
almoſt mad; for he not only ventur'd to quarrel with
him in the place, which was indeed a madneſs, he
being in the midſt of his Guards and of his Gang, but
dar'd him to his very Teeth when he came out. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
there was no miſchief done then, becauſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
being by, and I took him away with me, and told
him, that if he was well advis'd, he ſhould never ſet
his foot within that Cut-throat place again; that as
for me, I'd tell him plainly, I would be content to be
hang'd if ever they catcht me there again, tho I
had come off without loſing my Money, and I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he could ſay the ſame: But he, deaf to all my advice,
and tranſported with rage, would needs go back again.
The affair being already come to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet he gave orders when he ſhould come again to

ſhut the door againſt him. <hi>Liſſac</hi> durſt ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to all this, for fear of making Monſieur <hi>de
Crequi</hi> his Enemy: 'Twas very hard to ſee himſelf
thus dealt with by a Raſcal, yet he was forc'd to
take it patiently. If this was a ſenſible affront, it
prov'd however a good fortune to him, ſince it ſav'd
his Money, which he had certainly loſt if he had ſtay'd,
for immediately after he had made up his Company,
he was oblig'd to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo avoided a ruine
which a great many young Gentlemen fell into. I
might be excus'd to ſeek in this manner to paſs away
the time, for 'tis the misfortune of men of my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to have a great many idle hours lye upon our
hands; and tho I took all the ways I could to divert
my ſelf, ſometimes reading, otherwhile gaming, and
ſometimes walking abroad, yet putting all together,
I muſt acknowledge no condition is ſo unhappy as a
Gentleman's; if I had been religiouſly inclin'd it had
been a great happineſs to me, having ſo much leiſure
for reflection; but indeed I had no manner of motion
that way, a diſpoſition conformable to the ſtrictneſs of
Religion is not given to every body, and I was one to
whom it was deny'd. I had a Relation of mine who
was marry'd, about 12 or 15 Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> on
<hi>Normandy</hi> ſide, who had many times invited me to her
Houſe, and now I ſent her word, if ſhe would ſend her
Coach ſuch a day for me, as far as <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> I would
wait on her: She not only ſent her Coach, as I deſir'd,
but came her ſelf too; and being arriv'd at the <hi>Great
Hart</hi> Inn pretty early, ſhe walk'd out of the Town a
little, to ſee if ſhe could meet the <hi>Roan</hi> Stage Coach, by
which I ſent her word I ſhould come down. She was
no handſome Woman, ſhe would have been to blame
to pretend to it; but however, a good air which ſhe
had, and the care ſhe took to ſet herſelf off, made her
well eſteem'd, and ſeveral Admirers ſhe had. Among
the reſt two Gentlemen, both Strangers to her, tho
they were both of that County, taking her for another
ſort of Lady than ſhe was, made their Court to her,
and behav'd themſelves civilly enough at firſt; ſhe did
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:57806:207"/>
not refuſe them her company. Her freedom of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
confirm'd them in their opinion of her; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, while ſhe was at the Inn, they reſolv'd to
puſh on the matter. If one may believe herſelf, ſhe only
intended to banter them, and every body elſe on that
account. However, ſhe brought herſelf into a broil
with them: For refuſing to conſent, and they preſſing
upon her, ſhe ſtood upon her guard, and put herſelf into a
poſture of defence, and the buſineſs was carry'd ſo high,
that her Corne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re off her head, and all the
Houſe was in an uproar about it, juſt when I came in.
Aſſoon as I got out of the Coach, and had enquir'd
what the matter was, I was very much ſurpriz'd; and
running up to her Chamber, I found her upon the Bed,
and telling her how much I was concern'd at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
askt her, if ſhe had order'd any courſe to be
taken with the perſons who had offer'd her this affront.
She told me, ſhe had no body to adviſe with about it,
or to direct her what was fit to be done, and therefore
ſhe had done nothing at all; but that now I was come,
ſhe deſir'd me to inform her, what I thought proper
for her to do. I blam'd her for having omitted it, and
telling her ſhe ought to have given notice of it to the
Officers of Juſtice; I went immediately and did it for
her. The young Sparks, who had offer'd this violence
to her, found themſelves in an ill caſe, when they ſaw
what meaſures we were going to take with them; and
eſpecially perceiving they had to do with a perſon of
quality, who wanted neither Money nor Friends to
proſecute them; and ſome body advis'd them to come
and ask pardon of the Lady; and accordingly a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was ſent to know, if that would be accepted; but
I told the Meſſenger, that would not ſerve their turn
for an action ſo notoriouſly foul as this was. 'Tis true,
I took a falſe ſtep in applying my ſelf to the ordinary
courſe of Juſtice; I ſhould rather have made my
Complaint before the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> where we
ſhould have had more juſtice, and been ſooner diſpatcht.
But my paſſion tranſported me ſo far, that I never
thought of that, till I had begun their proceſs a little
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57806:208"/>
too haſtily; not conſidering that we were bringing our
ſelves into a tedious Suit, that we could not
quit when we pleas'd. In ſhort, our Adverſaries
taking advantage of this occaſion, got before us, and
made a Complaint there themſelves; and tho they
could pretend nothing in that Court againſt a Woman,
yet they ſo entangled things with their tricks and
turns, that they got an Arreſt to ſtop a Judgment
which we had obtain'd againſt them in the other
Court.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs was then brought before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that Court not being in haſte to end mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this nature, took care to keep this alive, by
bringing up againſt this Lady and her Husband, (who
was now made a party) every thing that could be
thought of in all the courſe of their lives, and a great
many invented things that had never been acted, that
they might, if poſſible, tire them into an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This Gentleman and his Lady had one misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which is but too common in this age, their
Daughter had been a little too free with her Brothers
Tutor, and there was a Child in the caſe; the Father
was ſo enrag'd at it, that once he had like to have
ſtabb'd her, and I believe he had done it, if I had not
advis'd him to ſend her away to the Plantations in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and give out that ſhe was dead; he lik'd
the propoſal well enough, and ſo it was firſt told
abroad that his Daughter was very ſick, and then that
ſhe was dead, and a formal Funeral was made for her;
in the mean time ſhe was ſent away in the night to
<hi>Rochelle</hi> to be ſhipt off: however this could not be
done ſo privately, but ſome whiſperings of it got
abroad, and theſe people got ſome knowledge of it in
general, as that it was but a ſham Funeral, upon which
they immediately ſuppos'd the Girl had been murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and entred a proceſs for the diſcovery, requiring
to have the Coffin taken up again, and open'd in the
preſence of the Magiſtrate; which being granted,
ſtrangely perplext my Couſins, and they try'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
tricks of the Law to avoid bringing an affair upon
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57806:208"/>
the ſtage ſo much to their diſhonour: and truly they
were got among ſuch a parcel of Lawyers both of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and <hi>Roan,</hi> that no tricks were to be plaid of that
kind, but they could have them done. However, all
ſignified nothing, the Coffin was opened, and there
was found a Log of Wood, inſtead of a Corps; and
Teſtification of this being made, they had now the
Sollicitor General upon their backs, who demanded to
know what they had done with their Daughter. If it
was a Mortification to have the whole ſtory of this
brought before the Parliament, which the adverſe
Lawyers did not fail to do with all the aggravations
they could, 'twas worſe to them to find out a way
how to give an account of the Girl herſelf. For it
ſeems, inſtead of going to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother thought ſhe had done, truly ſhe had
got another fellow, that falling in love with her,
had procured her liberty, on conditions much like
what ſhe had formerly granted the Tutor. 'Twas a
hard Chapter to tell this to a Court of Juſtice, and
yet harder to prove it, if it was not believed. In
ſhort, the Court was not at all ſatisfy'd with it, but
they were order'd to produce the Young Woman, or to
anſwer for her; at which, knowing not what either to
do, or ſay, they ſtood as if they had been amaz'd;
which the Court taking as an effect of guilt, order'd
them both to be taken up, and put into the <hi>Conciergeric.</hi>
I was ſenſibly afflicted when I heard this news, and the
more, becauſe I was fooliſhly the occaſion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
this unhappy proceſs, and thinking my ſelf
obliged, whatever it coſt me, to relieve them in this
diſtreſs, I enquir'd, as privately as I could poſſibly, of
a certain ſort of Women, whoſe Employment is not
very honeſt, and which you may gueſs at, I ſuppoſe,
without naming. I askt them, I ſay, if they had not
among their Virgins, ſuch and ſuch a young Lady,
deſcribing her as well as I could; the great reward I
promis'd them, made them beſtir themſelves a little
for the diſcovery: For indeed, I did not know who
elſe to apply my ſelf to; imagining, and that as I
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:57806:209"/>
thought not without reaſon, that a young Girl, caſt
off by her Father and Mother, and who had already
been that way given, would preſently apply herſelf
to ſuch people as thoſe: tho 'twas really a hard caſe,
that any perſon of quality ſhould be forc'd to ſuch a
ſearch, and that their misfortunes ſhould oblige them
to ſave their Lives by the expoſing the diſhonour of
their Family upon Record. In the mean time, theſe
good Women, taking no notice on what account it
was, procur'd me the ſight of a great number of young
Ladies. I had always heard indeed, that <hi>Paris</hi> was full
of ſuch people, but I never thought it was poſſible there
could be ſo many of them. It took me up at leaſt a
month to viſit all theſe houſes, and there was never leſs
than ten or twelve at a place, and yet among them all
I could not find out her I wanted; but all I could learn
of her was, that ſhe had been ſeen at a certain Tire-womans
call'd <hi>La Marchand;</hi> that a Gentleman being
in love with her, had taken her a private Lodging, and
kept her, but no body could tell me who this man was,
nor where he liv'd; ſo that, in ſhort, one had as good
look a Needle in a Bottle of Hay, as the Proverb ſays,
as to expect to find them out in ſuch a large place as
<hi>Paris:</hi> I put an end to my ſearch. However, ſince I
knew this part of the ſtory was true, both by ſome
circumſtances, as alſo that ſhe had diſcover'd herſelf to
a friend, who had told us of it. The Advocates, to
defer the Proceedings againſt my Kinſman and his
Wife, thought it proper to have her heard in Court, for
the Judges could not but know, that ſuch perſons as
we would not come to a diſcovery of that nature, if
there was nothing at all in it; but this Womans Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
becauſe of her Infamy, not being allow'd for
lawful Witneſs, all my labour was loſt, and I was
forc'd to take new meaſures.</p>
            <p>Our Adverſaries triumpht at all this, and carry'd it
ſo inſolently, that had we liv'd in other times, as old
as I was, I am ſure I had handled them after another
manner. But the King, among a multitude of great
actions, like himſelf, has done nothing ſo great, or ſo
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57806:209"/>
much to his glory, as the abſolute prohibiting of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;
which is ſo ſevere on that point, that he is certain
to ruine himſelf that attempts it; and yet I had much
ado to refrain from it, when I ſaw them at the Palace;
but I could not paſs by them, without joſtling them,
tho they did not take notice of it; and that which
madded me worſt was, that they were a parcel of Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
we had to do with. In the mean time nothing was
done, and the Judges told me plainly, that unleſs we
could get ſome better proofs, that the young Lady was
alive, her Father and Mother both was in great danger.
Upon this I went to the Dean of the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<hi>du Chatelet,</hi> and pray'd them to publiſh an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
to all their Officers, that when people came
to regiſter Lodgings and Chambers to lett, they ſhould
examine the Landlords and Landladies, whether they
had not ſuch a perſon came to lodge with them; and I
promis'd a hundred Piſtoles to whoever ſhould make
the diſcovery. This made them do their beſt, and by
this means I came to underſtand, that a young Lady,
ſomething like what I had deſcrib'd, lodg'd in <hi>la Rue
Calande,</hi> near <hi>la Place Maubert;</hi> and immediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither and pretending to take Lodgings, I was
admitted up ſtairs, and there I found the party I lookt
for, but in ſuch a miſerable condition, that had I not
ſeen her a great many times, it had been impoſſible to
have known her.</p>
            <p>She was ſurpriz'd at the ſight of me, eſpecially when
calling her by her name, I began to reproach her with
what ſhe had done; and fancying ſhe might eaſily get
away from ſuch an old fellow as I was, ſhe ſeem'd to
cry, but watcht an opportunity to give me the ſlip,
and get out of the door; but I had my Eyes about me,
and lookt ſo narrowly to her, as ſhe could not poſſibly
do it; and having thus perceiv'd her deſign, I ſtaid
with her till I had more company; and her Father and
Mother having got an Order for me to lay her faſt, if I
ſhould have the good fortune to find her; I made uſe
of that Warrant, and carry'd her to the <hi>Madelonet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi>
a Priſon appointed for Women of ill fame. It was a
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57806:210"/>
ſingular good fortune to us all, the finding out this
young Jilt, her Father and Mother being upon the very
point of being condemn'd; and I know not what
might have come of it, if this diſcovery had not been
made. But now their Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being produc'd, all
the projects their Adverſaries laid to ruin them were
vain, and their meaſures broken. They would have
ſtill procur'd them to be detain'd, upon pretence of
having offer'd an abuſe to the Ceremonies of the
Church, in making a ſolemn Burial for a Log of Wood,
and having the uſual Prayer ſaid over it, as if it had
been a Chriſtian. In ſhort, they were fain to make
friends to get rid of this Accuſation; and yet they
could not come off without a Fine neither. However,
the Judges could not but ſee, that all this was Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Malice; and tho they could not avoid the
Sentence which was paſt, yet aſſoon as that was over,
they took into conſideration the Caſe of my Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and began to think of doing her ſome Juſtice. In
ſhort, they condemn'd the two fellows, firſt to pay all
the charges of the Proceſs, which was very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and afterwards to be baniſht, which was a great
diſhonour to their Families, who made ſome figure in
the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madame</hi> ... were ſatisfied with ſo juſt
a Decree; and at their return home were congratulated
by their Friends and Relations upon the happy iſſue of
this troubleſome affair. They would needs have my
company down with them into the Country; where
they endeavour'd by the kindeſt Treatment in the
world to make me amends, for all the pains I had
taken upon their account. <hi>Monſieur</hi> ... knowing that I
lov'd Hawking paſſionately, ſhew'd me all the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
poſſible of that ſott; ſo that in my life, I never paſt
any time more pleaſantly than I did a fortnight there:
and ſo obliging they were, that when I offer'd to take
my leave, they would by no means ſuffer me to ſtir. I
had no great buſineſs at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo was eaſily overcome
by their perſwaſions. In ſhort, I continu'd there two
months longer; not that at firſt I had any thoughts of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57806:210"/>
ſtaying, but was detain'd by a particular occaſion;
which was, that in my Doting Age I had like to have
committed a folly, from which all the reſt of my days
I had believ'd my ſelf ſecure enough. About five or ſix
leagues from thence liv'd a young Lady, the Charms
of whoſe Beauty and Wit it was impoſſible to reſiſt,
who coming to viſit <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi> ... I ſaw, and
from the firſt moment felt my ſelf ſo ſenſibly toucht,
that I could not have been more at five and twenty.
The two days ſhe ſtaid there, I paſt ſighing at her feet;
and ſhe (who had little fortune of her own, and judg'd
of mine by the figure I made) treated me in ſuch a
manner, as gave me no cauſe to deſpair. We are all
naturally apt to flatter our ſelves: I had my ſhare of
this vanity, when I thought one of my years, gay and
vigorous enough to inſpire Love in ſo young and
charming a Creature. I had promis'd to wait on her
in a few days, but before ſhe could well be got half way
home, I was preparing to make my viſit. <hi>Monſieur</hi>
and <hi>Madam</hi> ... rally'd me very heartily upon this; but
I, who could hearken to nothing but my paſſion, took
Horſe immediately, and tho I engag'd not to ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two days at fartheſt, yet I ſtaid there a fortnight:
And then return'd ſo tranſported, or rather ſo damn'd
fooliſhly in Love, that when I but reflect on it now, it
puts me into extream confuſion. <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
... who knew nothing of my circumſtances, but
imagin'd, becauſe I had been formerly pretty well at
Court, that I muſt haye laid up ſomething conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
told me, that I ought to marry this young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
and make her fortune; that ſhe was a
perſon of condition, and of great vertue; and it would
be much better to leave her what I had, than leave it
to thoſe whom perhaps I did not care for; that as to
matter of Eſtate, I ought not to conſider it, at my
Age, when I was not likely to have many Children;
and the few I might have would be no great charge to
me, ſince I ſhould never live to ſee 'em grown up. If
they had known all, they had not needed to have us'd
theſe arguments with me, for I had before hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57806:211"/>
to gratify my inclinations at any rate; and tho
I was ſenſible, that marrying a Woman with my ſmall
fortune, was a certain way to bring her to miſery;
yet all theſe conſiderations were not powerful enough
to reduce me to reaſon. The only thing then that
ſeem'd to ſtick with me was my Age, which I objected;
but they told me, I ought not to inſiſt upon that,
ſince I did not look to be above Forty; and ſo, in ſhort,
if I were diſpos'd to it, they would ſerve me in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Match about. I made 'em no anſwer; but
two or three days after, going to viſit the Lady again,
I propos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d it to her my ſelf, aſſuring her, at the ſame
time, that I would deal ingenuouſly with her. I told
her, I muſt confeſs it was my own fault I was not
richer, ſince I had been a very bad Husband, and had
choſe to make other peoples fortune rather than my
own; that I had a Mother-in-law who had ruin'd me
by reviving the old Debts of the Family, and laying
her claim to them; by which means it happen'd, that
I could make an Offer of no great matter, when I
offer'd her my ſelf: That what I had now was an
Annuity for Life out of the Bank of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which had
been formerly a thouſand Crowns a year, but was now
reduc'd to half of it. This Income, I told her, with
about 14 or 15 thouſand Livres, which I had put into
the hands of ſome particular friends, was my whole
Eſtate; and it was for her to conſider, whither ſhe
would accept of a Man, who if he had 20 thouſand a
year, lov'd her well enough to lay it all at her feet,
but whoſe misfortune it was to have a great deal leſs.
For all the ſincerity I pretended to, you may ſee; I
told her, I had more than what really I had, ſince I
reckon'd into the account, the Money I gave Meſſieurs
<hi>de Saillant,</hi> and <hi>la Jonche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> which was gone to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and purpoſes. Yet I did not queſtion, but to
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me off handſomely with her, and at laſt to have
ſatisfy'd her, when ſhe ſhould have known all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of this misfortune. Thus had Love got the
aſcendant over my Reaſon, and made me act, as if I
had not been my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:57806:211"/>
However, the young Lady lik'd my Propoſals;
which compliance of hers ſo perfectly charm'd me, that
I thought I could never do enough for her. She had
dependance upon none but a Mother, with whom ſhe
could do what ſhe pleas'd, ſo that our Marriage was
ſoon concluded on, and the report of it ſpreading
round the Country, we were complimented by all the
People of Quality thereabouts. She, who now began
to look upon me as her Husband, made no ſcruple to
allow me thoſe Liberties that ſhe might do with honour
enough, but which inflam'd and tranſported me ſo,
that ſome things happen'd to me, which good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
oblige me to conceal. This effect, tho I may ſay
they had, as to convince her, that I was not ſo old as
ſhe took me to be; for ſuch Raptures I was in, that
no Young man, with all his vigour and inclination,
could have expreſt more force of nature, or warmth
of imagination, than I did upon ſome occaſions. I
mention this to let you ſee, that Women do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
declare what they think, for tho ſhe had often
perceiv'd the ſame thing, ſhe never took the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, till one day ſhe happen'd to diſcover it, to
the good fortune of us both. We had been at <hi>Veſpers</hi>
together, but her Devotion not ſatisfy'd with that, ſhe
would oblige me to ſtay the other ſervice that follows
preſently after. I was content, and when they
came to ſing that Hymn, in which there is this paſſage,
<hi>Ne polluantur corpora,</hi> ſhe jogg'd me, and at the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe words bid me, that I ſhould take care I
was not guilty of that frailty any more. I was ſtrangely
ſurpriz'd to find her ſo knowing, and askt her who it
was that had ſo well inform'd her, at which ſhe only
bluſht, and was in an extreme confuſion. The more I
obſerv'd her confuſion, the more I ſuſpected ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in it; and not caring to have a young Woman too
knowing in thoſe matters, eſpecially one I deſign'd to
make my Wife, I told her plainly, and in ſome paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too, that I would be ſatisfy'd how ſhe came ſo well
inſtructed. She told me then, with the greateſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
poſſible, that being once at a Gentlemans, one
<pb facs="tcp:57806:213"/>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:57806:213"/>
that marry'd a Relation of hers, and whom ſhe nam'd;
he came up one morning and caught her in Bed, where
he behav'd himſelf with that Indecency, that ſhe could
not but take notice of ſome things, to which before
ſhe had been a perfect ſtranger. This was enough to
poſſeſs me, that he lov'd her. He was a man of a very
good Eſtate, and one to whom ſhe ſhow'd a great deal
of reſpect, which ſtill I miſtook, and imputed to a
quite different cauſe than what ſhe pretended; which
was, ſhe ſaid, for fear of ever having an occaſion to
make proof of his generoſity. In fine, I grew jealous
of him as a Rival, or to ſpeak more plainly, I thought
I ſhould have nothing but his Leavings; for which ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
I muſt humbly ask her pardon, and confeſs I
wrong'd her, whoſe Vertue even exceeded her own
admirable Beauty. The wedding day was agreed on,
and all things provided; when under pretence of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
orders about ſomething that was to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
I took Horſe and left her, but not without
writing her a long and paſſionate Letter, in which
appear'd the conteſt of my Love and Jealouſy, each by
turns ſeeming to have got the better in my divided
heart; at laſt, I concluded it with a thouſand aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
that I ſhould ever love and honour her, tho I
could not think of her for a Wife. <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
—ſoon perceiv'd the eſtrangement, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not from whence it ſhould proceed, would have
endeavour'd to reconcile us; but beſides, that her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
would not ſuffer her to hearken to ſuch a
Propoſal, I was too nice to offer it: I deſir'd 'em
therefore, not to give themſelves any trouble, in an
affair which I was ſenſible would never ſucceed. If I
had had to do with ſome Women, I ſhould not have
eſcap'd a Proceſs for ſuch an abuſe, and without doubt
ſhould have paid for it; but ſhe carry'd herſelf like a
true perſon of honour, and not only diſdaining ſuch
mean courſes of revenge, but much more to be oblig'd
to me, return'd all the Preſents I had ever made her,
At firſt, I would by no means take 'em, and told the
perſon that brought 'em, that he muſt even carry back
<pb facs="tcp:57806:212"/>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:57806:212"/>
thoſe trifles, which were given without condition to
the Woman I once lov'd above the world. Yet would
ſhe not accept of them, tho they were of the value of
2 or 300 Piſtoles, but ſent them back again with orders
to leave them with <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—if I
ſhould perſiſt to refuſe them.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this affair, which I ſhould have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a thouſand times that I miſt, if I had an Eſtate to
have made that Woman happy. But Reaſon coming
to the aſſiſtance of my Jealouſy, (which my paſſion
might perhaps have conquer'd in time) I began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
ſeriouſly on the conſequences of ſuch a Marriage,
and the miſerable condition I muſt have left a Wife
and Children in, after my death. Upon all which I
concluded, that it was infinitely the beſt as it was, and
that ſhe had eſcap'd a misfortune, which it had been a
pity a perſon of her merit ſhould have ever prov'd: I
had no deſign to live all my days at <hi>Monſieurs</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
—ſo that now I thought it was high time to
take my leave: But they, who ſtill continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their
civility, would keep me, tho it was by meer force. I
made all the pretences poſſible, and told them, that I
had buſineſs of moment at <hi>Paris,</hi> which I muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
attend, but all in vain, for they took them all
for Excuſes, and caus'd the Saddles of my Horſes to
be laid out of the way; that when I inſiſted upon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
'em, and was juſt a going, the Saddles were no
where to be found. I perceiv'd the conſequence, and
that it would be in vain to reſiſt their kindneſs, I told
'em then, I would conſent to ſtay, if they would fix
the time how long, and after that would not ſtop me.
They nam'd eight days; in which time, as if they had
known what ſhould happen, or had reſolv'd I ſhould
be at a Wedding, tho not my own, fell out the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of their Daughter; who, after all that I have
mention'd of her, was yet ſo fortunate, as to meet with
a Husband of a very plentiful fortune, and one who
not only loves, but dotes on her, and admires her.
My time was juſt expiring, when the very day before
I was to go, about 3 or 4 a Clock in the afternoon,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57806:214"/>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—had word brought them,
that there was a ſtrange Gentleman without, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
to ſpeak with them: The Servants had order to
pray him to walk in; and immediately there enters the
Room a man of a very good Mien, but whom I gueſt,
the firſt minute, to be a Foreigner by his Dreſs. I was
not miſtaken it ſeems, for he was a <hi>Swiſs;</hi> and that
we all knew well enough aſſoon as he began to ſpeak.
He told <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—in a language half
<hi>French</hi> and half gibberiſh, that he was their moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Servant before ever he ſaw them, and that upon the
account of their good character; but now, ſince he
had the honour to kiſs their hands, he deſign'd himſelf
a far greater honour, if they pleas'd to permit him to
render them his moſt humble Services. This Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was a little ſtrain'd I fancy'd, but yet he deliver'd
it with ſomething of that air, as made me have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion of him, than I had of thoſe Countrymen of
his, who took <hi>Biroche</hi>'s Puppets for young Devils;
and for his ſake I might have been induc'd to believe,
that there were ſome men of. Wit amongſt the <hi>Swiſs,</hi>
as amongſt other Nations, if it had not been for what
happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d afterwards, which chang'd my mind, or at
leaſt made me conclude, that if they had wit, 'twas
af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er their own faſhion, and was not attended with
very much honour. For after the Compliment I told
you of, he deſir'd to diſcourſe <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—in
private, where he told them, that having ſeen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle</hi>
their Daughter, he was fallen deſperately in
love with her, and that if they would give conſent to
his marrying of her, he ſhould be extreamly oblig'd to
them; that he might perhaps have done this without
asking them leave, but he knew his duty better than
that came to, tho he was a Foreigner; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the reſpect which was due to perſons of their
rank and merit: That he did not ask what they would
give with their Daughter; becauſe he choſe rather out
of a prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Land, but he had a Company of Foot,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57806:214"/>
which was as good to him as an Eſtate, and 50000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
beſides he had in ready Money: That tho 'twas true,
he met with her in a place, from whence others might
make ſome ſcruple of taking a Wife; yet he was not
apt to believe ill of any, and ſo it could never enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his head, that ſome reports he had heard of her were
any thing but calumnies: That if there ſhould be
ſomething true in them, he was ſenſible a poor young
Girl was naturally weak, and a failure in one of them
was not minded in his Country; tho a marry'd Woman,
who tranſgreſt the Rules of Honour, was infinitely
blam'd, becauſe ſhe had a Husband to ſupply all her
neceſſities; and a Gallant upon that account was into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
In fine, that there were ſome cenſorious
people in the world, whom he could not approve, who
becauſe a Woman had committed a fault once, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
had been ſeen to uſe a little gaiety more than
ordinary in mens company, concluded preſently, that
ſhe was lewd, and abandon'd; and Lewdneſs indeed
was never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>He added a great deal more of this nature, to prove
that what ever a woman did before Marriage ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
nothing, and urg'd it from the practice of ſeveral
very honeſt Gentlemen, whom he would have nam'd,
if they had not been too many to enumerate; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he would inſtance, he ſaid, in two or three, who
perhaps they might know; as the Count <hi>du Bours,</hi> a
Collonel of Horſe, St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> and <hi>Mountfabes.</hi> The
firſt marry'd a Woman that had a Child by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the ſecond marry'd a Caſt Miſtreſs of the Duke
of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and the third, one of ſo notorious a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that ſhe had a Tryal before the Parliament:
Yet there was none that could deny, but the two firſt
were men of Honour, and if the other was not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch, it 'twas his own fault, and not his Wives;
that theſe were <hi>French;</hi> but for his own Countrymen;
he ſcarce knew one that had not done the ſame; that
Monſieur <hi>Stoup</hi> took his Wife from a place, where he
had been himſelf witneſs of her Vertue, and yet he
liv'd in great eſteem here, and in his own Country;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57806:215"/>
and was in favour with the King, who had conferr'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Honours upon him; that tho at firſt Madam
<hi>Stoup</hi>'s reputation was a little call'd in queſtion, yet
now ſhe was no leſs reſpected, than if ſhe had never
kept company with any, but Dutcheſſes and Ladies of
the firſt quality: That Madam <hi>Renold,</hi> Wife to a
Captain in the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards, was one of the ſame
Character, which ſhe tok care to publiſh her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Marriage; ſo that in ſhort, all things conſider'd,
too much a nicety in theſe caſes, was ridiculous and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fit for Coxcombs to inſiſt on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—could not chooſe but be
pleas'd to hear him talk at this rate, and from ſuch
juſt reaſoning, and ſo moving a diſcourſe; thought if he
ſhould ever have the misfortue to be caſhier'd, that he
was ſufficiently qualified with Retorick to make a very
able Pleader. Having no mind therefore to loſe ſuch a
Son-in-law, they were not long in giving their conſent,
and that without any further enquiry who he was,
than upon his own word and honour. This was ſo
great a favour, that the thanks he return'd 'em, were
enough to convince 'em how highly ſenſible he was
of it. However there aroſe a little difficulty; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
that before all was concluded on, his Miſtreſs
might be brought home, that he might marry her in a
more honourable place than where he found her. But
this they excus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as well as they could, looking upon
it as a pretence to leave her on their hands: All had
like to have been ruin'd by this means, till commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
to me this matter; I put 'em in a way
which I was ſure would leave 'em no room to doubt
of his ſincerity. I advis'd 'em then to oblige him to
buy an Eſtate near them, which if he did, it was a
certain ſign he meant 'em no foul play. I thought I
had propos'd an admirable expedient, but was anſwer'd,
that they had rather while they liv'd, pay their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an Annuity, than be troubled with ſuch neighbours.
That they had better purchaſe near the Count <hi>du
Bourg</hi> 15 or 20 leagues off, who was as ſcandalous as
themſelves, and ſo might be ſuppos'd to agree well
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57806:215"/>
enough together. When I ſaw this I told 'em plainly,
they were to blame to trifle in this matter; that there
was a neceſſity to riſque ſomething on that occaſion,
and tho their fears ſhould prove juſt, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was not ſo great but it might be remedy'd;
for if they ſhould ſend for their Daughter home,
and the man ſhould go back from his word, at worſt,
it was but putting her into her Convent again. And
ſo I advis'd em upon ſo groundleſs a fear, not to
let ſlip ſuch an advantageous offer, which they would
repent of before they dy'd, if they did not embrace:
When indeed at any rate they ought to diſcharge
themſelves of one that was a burden and diſgrace to
the Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—had not a word to ſay
to this, but yeilded to my reaſons, yet told me ſince
it was at my perſwaſions, that they reſolv'd to make
this Venture, I ſhould not leave 'em till the affair
was perfectly concluded. I had a great mind, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
to ſee how our <hi>Swiſs</hi> would behave himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the Kindred, that was to be there upon
this occaſion; and whether the next Morning he
would appear as well ſatisfy'd with the Bride, as
the day before his Wedding. Upon this account
therefore, I aſſur'd <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—that
I was at their ſervice, and they might command me
what they pleas'd. The next thing then to be done,
was to go to <hi>Paris</hi> and find out the Bride; where
they carry'd me in their own Coach. She, who
was very deſirous to get out of her Convent, and was
now more in hopes than ever, had taken a world of
pains to make herſelf look fair; ſo that we found her
very agreeable when we came there. Our Lover di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
us upon the Road with a hundred ſuch like
ſtories as he had told <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Madam</hi>—in
private, which were ſo very ſimple, that tho I had
ſome little knowledge of his Countrymen, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have believ'd from any bodys mouth but his. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all this, to give us the laſt proof of his ſincerity,
he deſir'd before we lite any where, to carry him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:57806:216"/>
to his Inn, where begging the favour of his
Father and Mother-in-law to go up with him; he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a little Box, and took out a Bill for 50000
Livres upon the Bankers, which he ſhew'd 'em for
their ſatisfaction: He would needs that I ſhould ſee
it too, and brings it to me in the Coach where I was,
being taken ſuddenly ill with a pain ſomething like
the Gout, that I was not able to ſtir, but which
however the next day I got rid off.</p>
            <p>We ſtay'd eight days at <hi>Paris,</hi> before we return'd to
conclude this Marriage; in which time <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi>—receiv'd
a great many preſents from her Lover. I
could not ſufficiently admire her good fortune,
when I conſider'd that an honeſter woman perhaps,
could not have got ſuch luck in a Husband. He was
not above eight or nine and twenty, and for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the Guards, which he ſaid indeed, was as
good as an Eſtate in Land, brought him in one year
with another four and twenty thouſand Livres. When
I found he was a man of that ſubſtance, I began to
pity him: His condition tho I knew was happy,
while he was ignorant, and it came into my head to
do him a piece of ſignal ſervice. He had repeated a
thouſand times how that he ſhould never have the
worſe opinion of his Wife, for finding her in ſuch a
a ſuſpicious place. To continue him therefore in theſe
good ſentiments, I bethought my ſelf of the Pomatum
I found in the Lodgings of the Queens Maids of
Honour, which I told you of: I endeavoured all I
could to get ſome of the ſame ſort, to make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of it to his Lady; but as fortune would have it,
when I did not want it, that I ſhould ſtumble upon
it, ſo now I could meet with none when I had ſo
great an occaſion for it. But <hi>Madamoiſelle de</hi>—God
be thanked, had been long enough in too good
a School, to be ignorant of any of thoſe kind of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
if ſhe knew not that ſecret, ſhe was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with another, that did the buſineſs as well; for
with the white of Eggs as ſhe manag'd them, ſhe
rectify'd all diſorders in the caſe, and ſo perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57806:216"/>
the good Husband, that he got up early the
next morning, and came tranſported to tell us, that
it was not without reaſon that he could aſſure us now
of what he had ſo often told us. We gave him joy of
his good fortune, whilſt he was ſo charm'd with his
Spouſe, that he forgot no fondneſs or complaiſance for
her, which made us all conclude, that if there are ſuch
things as good Husbands in the world, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
to be found among the <hi>Swiſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Country was ſurpriz'd at this Marriage,
knowing the hiſtory of the young Lady, which was
too publick to be conceal'd; and every body, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of congratulating the new marry'd couple, came
to ſee them, to obſerve how the Bridegroom lookt,
but they could not perceive, but that a Cuckold looks
juſt like other folks. As for the Bride, ſhe told thoſe
with whom ſhe was intimate, that they ſhould not
wonder her Husband appear'd ſo well ſatisfy'd, for the
people of his Country were not troubled with too
much Wit, and that he was but too happy for a <hi>Swiſs;</hi>
many a Woman, I don't queſtion, who had as much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for ſuch a well-meaning Husband as ſhe had, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
her happineſs, eſpecially when they ſaw her ride
in her Coach with an Equipage and every thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable.
The young Lady that I was like to have
marry'd was not here all this while, tho ſhe was very
well acquainted in the Family, and I heard <hi>Monſieur</hi>
and <hi>Madam</hi>—often ſaying, they wondred at it;
but for my part, I did not wonder at it at all, for I
gueſt at the reaſon of it. Indeed, ſhe hearing, that I
was not only at the Wedding, but that I ſtay'd ſtill at
the Houſe, had never ſet her foot within the door,
while I ſtaid there, if a perſon of quality of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
had not trepann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d her thither, without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her know where ſhe was: ſhe found the Coach
juſt going in at the Caſtle gate, before ſhe diſcover'd
at what place ſhe was got, ſhe appear'd very much
diſſatisfy'd; but the Lady making her the beſt excuſes
ſhe could, ſhe was oblig'd to go in with her. I was
never ſo ſurpriz'd in my life as when I ſaw her, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57806:217"/>
being very well acquainted with her humour, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
gueſt ſome violence had been offer'd her, and
my old Wounds were not ſo well cur'd, but that they
began to bleed afreſh. I could not caſt my eyes on a
perſon I had ſo paſſionately lov'd, and whom perhaps
I lov'd ſtill, as well as ever I did, without ſome diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in my ſoul: I wiſht a thouſand times I had been a
<hi>Swiſs,</hi> that I might not have been ſo nice; and in ſhort,
I was ſo near being overcome, that had any body but
prompted me in the leaſt to the thing, I had fallen
under the temptation, and run into all the paſt follies
again; but ſome body having ſo little diſcretion, as to
ſpeak of that affair before her, ſhe roſe up, and with a
ſcornful countenance, giving them a hearty frown,
turn'd out of the room without ſpeaking a word, and
went into the Garden; which being perceiv'd, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
after that offer'd to open their mouths about it,
and ſhe going away the ſame day, put a ſtop to the
diſorder that it procur'd to us both.</p>
            <p>The Wedding being over I return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
like thoſe Ladies of pleaſure, who never lodge three
months in a place, I took a Lodging now at a Barbers
near <hi>St. Pauls;</hi> my Landlord was a little brisk man,
and fit for any thing, but ſo lewd a Rake, that he had
not his fellow, and ſo ſtrangely addicted to gaming,
that he would loſe in an hour more than he could get
in a month. I laid great part of the fault to his
Wife, who inſtead of winning him by ſoft and gentle
methods, did nothing but ſcold, and rail, and make
ſuch a noiſe at him, as made him ſo uneaſie at home,
that he would never be there any more than needs
muſt. I knew him firſt when he was Servant
to <hi>Dupin,</hi> who liv'd in the <hi>Rue St. Antoine,</hi> who
was of the ſame Trade, and where I had lodg'd at
leaſt five or ſix years at times; ſeveral perſons
of quality lodg'd at his Houſe at the ſame time,
and while I ſtaid there, there happen'd an adventure
which had ſomething in it ſurprizing enough, as the
Reader will acknowledge, if he pleaſe to give credit to
the relation; <hi>Dupin</hi> is ſtill alive, and the people I am
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57806:217"/>
going to tell of, belong to perſons of ſuch quality, that
their names are not unknown even to ſtrangers, and it
is eaſy to know of them, whether the ſtory I tell be true
or no: However, I ſhall blame no bodies incredulity,
till they have made ſome enquiry, for the thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſo extraordinary, that I could hardly believe my
own eyes. There were two men of quality who
were very intimate friends, one was the Marquis <hi>de
Rambouillet,</hi> eldeſt Brother to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauſier,</hi>
and the other was the Marquis <hi>de Preci,</hi> the
eldeſt Son of the Family of <hi>Nantouillet;</hi> one of whom
had been Chancellor of the Kingdom, and in ſo great
favour in the Reign of one of our Kings, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
his Maſter, while he govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the State with an

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s Cap. Theſe
two Gentlemen went both into the Army, as all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

but jumpt out of Bed to embrace his friend, believing
he had done this only to amuſe him, but he embrac'd
nothing but the air; and <hi>Rambouillet</hi> ſeeing he would
not believe him, ſhow'd him the place where he was
ſhot, which was in the reins, and lookt as if it were all
bloody, and then he vaniſh'd. <hi>Preci,</hi> who was not
much diſturb'd before, was now perfectly confounded
and frighted, and throwing himſelf down again upon
the Bed, he cry'd out at ſuch a rate, as put all the
houſe in an uproar: I got up among the reſt, and
running up into his Chamber with <hi>Dupin,</hi> to ſee what
the matter was; when he told us the ſtory, we thought
it was only the violence of his Fever (which ſtill was
upon him) which made him light-headed, and ſo
pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him to lye down again, telling him, that this
was nothing but fancy. He was very angry to ſee we
took him to be dilirious; and to convince us, told us
all the particulars as I have related them. However,
he might ſay what he would, we were of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and ſo continu'd till the Poſt came in from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
which bringing an account that the Marquis was
really kill'd, we began to look upon one another, and
to think there muſt be ſomething in it, eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with the particulars he had told us. The
News of this paſſage being ſpread about the Town,
folks took it for a made ſtory; but others, deſirous to
know the truth of it, came to the houſe to enquire:
I believe I had a hundred Notes ſent to me about it,
and as many Viſiters; for my acquaintance knowing I
lodg'd in the houſe, thought to have a more particular
account of it from me: But for all I could ſay, they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57806:218"/>
could hardly be perſwaded to believe it, and the truth
of it all ſeem'd to depend upon what the Apparition
had told <hi>Preci</hi> ſhould befal him, that he ſhould
be kill'd in the firſt action he was engag'd in;
and ſo people had their eyes upon that, as the
effectual proof of the ſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as a convincing
argument that what we hear from the Pulpit of
thoſe things, is not all Prieſtcraft, as our Modern
Atheiſts would have us believe; which the event ſoon
confirm'd it. The Civil War being begun, he would
needs go to the Battel of <hi>St. Antoine,</hi> tho his Father
and his Mother begg'd of him as it were on their knees
not to go, being afraid of the Propheſie the Spectre
had left of him; but he would go, and was kill'd, to
the great regret of all his Relations, who had much
more hopes of his advancing their Family than he who
was to ſucceed him, who had marry'd a Wife of a mean
Birth and no Fortune, and one that had none of the
beſt Characters beſides. But 'tis the fate of
good Families ſometimes to have diſhonour reflected
on them by ſome of the unworthy members, and he is
not the firſt that has plaid the Fool; tho that does not
excuſe him.</p>
            <p>But to return to my new Landlord: His Wife ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her complaints to me of his gaming, I made bold,
one time when he was trimming me to tell him of it;
but inſtead of giving heed to what I ſaid, tho I thought
I knew enough of the world to be able to adviſe him,
he told me he got as much by it as he loſt; that he
play'd at nothing but Tennis, which was a game he
underſtood as well as any body; that he did not drink,
ſo he might very well allow himſelf this diverſion.
I told him this ſort of talk was well enough for a man
of ten thouſand Livres a year Eſtate, but for him who
had a Family to maintain, and nothing to live upon
but his Trade, 'twas a very ill courſe of life; that if he
did not loſe his money, yet he always loſt his time
which was not a thing of ſmall conſequence to a man
in his circumſtances, to whom diligence in his buſineſs
was more proper, and without which he could never
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57806:219"/>
expect to make any thing of it; that what I ſpoke
to him was in good will, and for his benefit, ſince
the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> would be his own, if he did not make
his advantage of it. Thus I left it to him; but he
continuing his old trade, his Wife came to me one
day in a ſad condition, begging me to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

on her; that her Husband was at play at
an houſe hard by, where he was ſquandring away
his Money; and if I would be ſo kind to go to
him, and perſwade him to leave off, I ſhould ſave
him loſing a great deal of Money. I did not care to
go to ſuch places, eſpecially ſince I was too old for
thoſe ſort of diverſions, I had lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d them well enough
formerly, but I was part it now. However, the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Court, being as it were next door to us, I went
thither as if I had come in by accident; where I ſaw a
man who play'd ſo ill, that tho I had not handled a
Racket in twenty year, I durſt have given him odds
and plaid with him. I did then what his Wife deſir'd
me, and he not daring to contradict me, I brought
him home along with me. The next morning he
came to wait on me at my Levee, and when I told him
that I wonder'd how he could have the confidence to
commend his play, when, by what I ſaw of it, I would
lay him a Wager, as old as I was, if I would give my
ſelf the trouble, I would beat him. He told me
he would give me fifteen if I durſt venture to play
with him; and having a great mind to let him ſee
what a Coxcomb he was, I took him at his word, and
went away immediately in my Gown as I was; but as
I told him, I would not play for a ſmall Summ, ſo I
made him car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y all the Money he had in the Houſe
with him. We play'd at ten Piſtoles every eight
games; and I ſo far maſter'd him, that I never let
him get but when I pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, yet he would ſtill hold
me at fifteen; but I told him no, I was able enough to
deal with him, and if he would play upon the ſquare
I'd hold him; he was glad at the offer, and ſtaking
down 20 Piſtoles, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt them as eaſily as he had
done the others. He was ſurpriz'd to find himſelf in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57806:219"/>
for thirty Piſtoles ſo quickly; but having ſtill ſome
left, he askt me if I would play for the reſt, I told
him with all my heart, and I would give him fifteen;
he fancy'd by this I had no mind to go away with his
Money, and being mighty glad to have to do with one
that was ſo generous, he cut ſeveral Capers for joy, at
which he was more dexterous than at Tennis; but his
joy laſted but a ſhort while, for I minded my play ſo
that I might not fateigue my ſelf, and having beat him
again, I broke him of threeſcore Piſtoles, and left him
in the greateſt confuſion imaginable.</p>
            <p>He pray'd me to ſay nothing to his Wife, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him, but with a deſign not to perform it, for I
had a mind ſhe ſhould have the pleaſure of ſcolding at
him for loſing his Money. In ſhort, I told her aſſoon
as ever I came home, how I had found out a ſecret
that would reclaim her Husband, that I was deceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if ever he plaid any more as long as he liv'd, after the
accident that had befallen him to day; that I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

of him, and ſo I told her the whole ſtory, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
I added, that I did not deſign to make uſe of the
advantage I had got, but had done it to let him ſee,
that he was but a Novice at play, and to beat him off
of it; that I would give her the Piſtoles, but ſhe
ſhould not ſpeak a word to him of it, till I gave her
leave; ſhe thankt me, as indeed I deſerv'd; and yet
the diſorder the firſt part of my ſtory put her in, could
not be ſtopt, till ſhe ſaw the effect of my words by the
reſtitution of the Money, but then ſhe begun to laugh,
and told me, that ſhe would ſee him reduc'd to the
greateſt neceſſities, before ſhe would let him have a
farthing of it again; that ſhe would ſee what courſe he
would take to maintain his Children, of which he had
a great many, now he had thrown away his Money;
and ſhe kept her word ſo punctually with him, that
the Family was without any Victuals for a day or two,
for he was ſo well known, that no body would lend
him a Farthing; ſeeing him in ſuch a ſtrait as this, I
took occaſion one day, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d him a ſecond lecture
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57806:220"/>
upon the old ſubject, and the miſery he was reduc'd to
made him a little more tractable than he was before,
but the iſſue was but a dull compliment to me, and in
which I had moſt need of ſchooling; for upon the
whole he deſir'd me to lend him ten Piſtoles, and I
like a Fool could not refuſe him, having but juſt before
won ſixty of him, unleſs I would have told him, that
I had given them all to his Wife, which I was not
willing to do; a little while after he came for ten
more, and I being in already, and beſides being ſenſible
it was for the ſubſiſtance of his Family, let him have it
again, for I thought, that having given his Wife all
the Money before, I ſhould have it again at any time,
when I thought fit to acquaint him with what I had
done. In ſhort, he got forty <hi>Louis d' Ors</hi> of me at four
ſeveral times, and all I had to ſhow for it was a
Note under his hand. In the mean time, he promis'd
me every day to be wiſer for the future; and indeed
he did take up a little, whether 'twas that having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of me made him diſſemble, becauſe he would
not diſoblige me, or that the loſs he had met with had
ſtill ſome effect upon him; but his Wife found ſuch a
change in him, that ſhe thankt me for it every day
with a great many acknowledgments of her obligation
to me. At laſt, I told her of the Money I had let him
have, letting her know how it was for the neceſſity of
their Family, to which ſhe made me no anſwer, but
that I was too kind to him.</p>
            <p>'Tis no ſuch ſtrange thing in <hi>Paris</hi> for a man not to
know the perſons that lodge in the ſame houſe with
him; under my Chamber lodg'd a man that made a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
good enough, but liv'd ſo extravagantly, that
tho he had ſomething of an Eſtate, yet he ſeldom had
a penny in his pocket: This fellow hearing my <hi>Valet
de Chambre</hi> talking how I had won above two hundred
Piſtoles at <hi>Tric-trac,</hi> which was true enough, reſolv'd
to ſet upon me and rob me; and having communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his deſign to his <hi>Valet,</hi> who had liv'd with him a
great while, he agreed to do it for him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
laid his meaſures for the execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:57806:220"/>
My man and he being Companions, he took his time
when I was gone out, feigning to be in a paſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſomething to come up to the Window,
and break a ſquare of the Glaſs as near the opening of
the Caſement as he could; he made as if he had done
this by accident, and only told my man he would paſte a
piece of paper over it to keep out the wind, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
pulls out a piece of paper, and goes to work on
it himſelf; he did this that he might open my Window
on the outſide as often as he pleas'd, for there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Saſhes, without either Shutters or Bars; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus made way for his intended miſchief, the
next day he makes a bargain with my man to go to
the Tavern to drink, and ſeeming to be very kind to
him he treated him, and kept him there from 3 a clock
in the afternoon till ten at night. I generally ſtaid
out pretty late a nights, but happen'd to come home
that night ſooner than I us'd to do, and wonder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d my
man was not to be found. I enquir'd if they had ſeen
him lately; but they told me he went out preſently
after me: I had a mind to go to bed, ſo I call'd a Boy
I kept to undreſs me, and being juſt going into bed, my
man came home; I askt him where he had been, and
why he ſtaid out ſo late? he askt my pardon, and told
me, that an acquaintance of his had come to invite
him to Supper, and not thinking I would come home
ſooner than I us'd to do, he had ſtaid there, but that
he would take care not to let it be ſo any more, I ſaid
little to him; for I ever was an ill Maſter to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
nor ever ſtruck one in my life; but I went into
bed, and fell aſleep immediately, and ſo did my man,
who ſlept ſo ſoundly, that I had much ado to wake
him, as I'm going to tell you. About midnight the fellow
that had broke my Window, taking this opportunity,
gets up to the ſide of my Chamber, for there was a
Window out of the Stair-caſe, that was not above 4 or
5 foot diſtant from mine; he had provided a board
which he laid croſs, and getting out upon it, pull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d off
the Paper, and putting in but two fingers, eaſily open'd
the Caſement, and ſo ſlipt himſelf into my Chamber,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57806:221"/>
and immediately ſtept to the Door to let in 2 or 3 ſuch
Rogues as himſelf, who he had ready for the purpoſe; as
it happen'd my man, who lay upon a Palate Bed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
3 ſteps from mine had barr'd the door, ſo that pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to get the door open, with unbarring it, he made ſuch
a noiſe as wak'd me: I thought, the Houſe being full of
Lodgers, ſome or other of them having found the
Key on the outſide, had open'd the Door to bid me
good night; ſo I call'd and askt, <hi>Who is there?</hi> but no
body anſwering, I call'd my <hi>Valet,</hi> who was dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
and ſnoring, and I had a hard task to wake him.
In the mean time, the noiſe I made had frighted thoſe
without, as well as him that was got in; as for him,
he knew every corner of the Chamber ſo well, that he
ſlipt ſoftly back in the dark, and hid himſelf in the
Chimney, and the reſt run away over the tops of the
Houſes; his Maſter had poſted himſelf half a ſcore
ſteps out of his door, to be ready as there ſhould be
occaſion; but finding his project had fail'd, retreated
into his Chamber, very much diſturb'd for fear of his
man, who was got into my Chamber. Aſſoon as I had
wak'd my man, I bid him go to the door, and ſee who
it was, for I was ſo far from apprehending the danger
I was in, that I ſtill thought it was ſome of my friends;
my man being got up, open'd the door, and telling
me there was no body there, went back again to bed,
and I went to ſleep again; as for him, when I had thus
wak'd him, it pleas'd God he could not go to ſleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ſo that when the fellow, who had hid himſelf in
the Chamber, attempted to get out again he heard
him, and being frighted, gets under the Bed, and cry'd
out to me to have a care of my ſelf, for there were
Thieves in the room. This indeed made me afraid,
remembring what had happen'd before I went to ſleep,
and taking hold of my Sword, which I always had at
hand, I askt him what it was? By this time my man
was got to the Window, and finding it open, ſpy'd
the board that was laid croſs, by which the fellow had
got in: He threw it down into the Court, leſt any
more Rogues ſhould get in there, and come behind
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57806:221"/>
him, and then told me what he had done, and that
for certain the Thieves came in that way, and he was
ſure there was ſome body in the Chamber ſtill; for
which reaſon he deſir'd me to defend the Door, and he
wou'd guard the Window. I leave the Reader to
gueſs what condition the fellow was in all this while,
who was in the Chamber; he had made his retreat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
the Chimney again as ſoftly as 'twas poſſible, but that
was of no uſe to him but only to hide him a little: I
bid my man cry Thieves, and he, being at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
preſently gave the alarm to the whole Houſe:
The Rogue, perceiving that he muſt of neceſſity be
taken, came out of the Chimney, reſolving to be kill'd
rather than to be brought to the light; but as we
made paſſes with our Swords every way at random,
my man happen'd to give him a wound in the Thigh;
and thinking he had light upon ſome body, he call'd to
me to have a care of my ſelf for he had wounded
ſome body he believ'd. The Thief not at all terrify'd,
ſought more than before to throw himſelf upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and receiv'd another thruſt in the body, which
however did not hinder him from cloſing in with my
man, with whom by this time he began to be warmly
engag'd; I was too near them not to know how it was
with them, but durſt not in the dark make uſe of my
Sword, not knowing which was which, ſo that all I
could do was to encourage my man, telling him the
people of the houſe were coming, and we ſhould have
help immediately: Indeed I heard them up, and the
noiſe they heard in my Chamber made them make the
more haſte; however I thought it very long, and my
Valet had a great deal of difficulty to maſter that
wretch, who fought with the utmoſt fury of a man in
deſpair; but at laſt he eas'd my mind, by telling me he
was ſure now he could not eſcape him, for he had got
him faſt by the Throat; and indeed he needed not have
told me ſo, for I could hear him draw his breath as if
he were almoſt throttled, which was what he was in a
fair way to be in reality; in the interim, the Barber
and his Wife came up with a Light, and knockt at the
door, and being very well ſatisfy'd it was they, I let
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57806:222"/>
them in, and then going to ſee who it was my man
had got hold of, I was ſurpriz'd to ſee it was one of
the houſe, and ſo was the Barber and his Wife: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, my <hi>Valet</hi> was the moſt concern'd, who but
juſt before came from the Tavern with him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not valuing the letting me know what he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from me before, <hi>O you Dog!</hi> ſays he, <hi>was it to
rob my Maſter then that you carry'd me to the Tavern to
night, and did all you could to make me drunk; you thought,
I warrant you, I ſhould ſleep ſo ſoundly, I ſhould not be in
a condition to help him.</hi> Theſe words made me plainly
ſee what I had eſcap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, eſpecially when I was inform'd
alſo that 'twas he broke the Square of Glaſs in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and that it was a premeditated deſign: I had
certainly run my Sword immediately through him, if
I had been leſs amazed; but my aſtoniſhment ſtruck
me ſenceleſs, therefore I only turn'd to the Barber and
his Wife, and askt them if they could have believ'd
it? they ſhook their heads at it; and examining the
fellow, I heard him two or three times over ſay very
ſoftly to himſelf, <hi>Ah! Dogs, one half hour ſooner and it
had been done.</hi> I askt him what he meant, but he would
not explain himſelf; and all I could gather from it,
was, that he had appointed his Comrades to come
ſooner than they did, they I mean, who had made
their eſcape over the Tiles, where we could ſee their
footſteps in a Guttur, by which they got away; all this
while the fellows blood run about the Chamber, as if
one had kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d an Ox; and being afraid he ſhould die
in our hands before he was examin'd, I bid them ſend
for the Commiſſair; they told me, if I would have it ſo,
they would do it; but they pray'd me to conſider, and
take heed, I did not bring my ſelf into an affair which
might coſt me a great deal of Money; that I was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wounded nor robb'd, and that if I ſhou'd hang
that wretch it wou'd do me no good: I did not diſlike
the advice, and the rather, becauſe the fellow had no
Weapons about him; and, to juſtifie himſelf, ſaid he
came only to have ſatisfaction of my man, with whom
he had quarrell'd at the Tavern. Indeed, he being a
cunning fellow, had ſome words with him before they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57806:222"/>
went out; to the end, if he was taken, he might have
that for his excuſe: but the Glaſs, which had been
broke at leaſt three days before that, ſhew'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
and if I had carry'd him before the Judges, he
muſt have ſung another Song. In ſhort, I ſuffer'd my
ſelf to be prevail'd on by the intreaties of the Barber
and his Wife, who begg'd hard for him; which they
were ſorry for afterwards, having been cheated by his
Maſter, who they diſcover'd to be in the plot with him.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs being over in this manner, I began to
think of leaving a houſe, where I had been in ſo much
danger; and having ſent my things to a place where I
had formerly lodg'd in the <hi>Fauxbourg Saint Germain,</hi>
I askt the Barber to make up accounts with me; he told
me the account was very eaſie to make up, but that to
give me any Money, truly he had none, and therefore
deſir'd me to have patience; I told him ſmiling, that I
wou'd, but that I wou'd not ſtay long; and that I
had given his Wife the ſixty Piſtoles I had won of him;
and if we had not told him of it, 'twas only that he
might ſuffer a little for his folly, and make
him out of love with play: He gave me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thanks, and I dare ſwear with all his heart, and
immediately call'd his Wife to pay me what he ow'd
me; but truly ſhe told him, ſhe had nothing to do
with his debt, for ſhe was by herſelf, and all the
things in the houſe belong'd to her.</p>
            <p>I ſaw ſhe was in earneſt, which indeed ſurpriz'd me,
conſidering how I had oblig'd her, wherefore I bid her
think on it a little, for if ſhe us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me ſo, I ſhou'd give
her ſuch a character, that no body wou'd come near
her Houſe; that ſhe knew in her own Conſcience the
Money I had given her was in compaſſion to her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to ſupply her neceſſities; and that I had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
told her ſo, that ſhe might not plead Ignorance:
that this was far enough from acknowledging my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which I did not ſay to reproach her, but ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
not deſerve to be us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ſo generouſly as I had us'd her;
and I askt no more than the forty Piſtoles I had lent
him; however, ſay what I could I was not able to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57806:223"/>
perſwade her to pay me; and her Husband, tho he was
in a violent paſſion, could do no more good with her
than I; I muſt do him this juſtice, that I believe he
did his beſt, for he not only ſtorm'd at her, but bang'd
her too; and if I had not parted them I believe it might
have come to a ſet battle, for ſhe did not take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
at all, but gave him as good as he brought, and
any body but I, would have given his Money for ſuch
a ſight: her Husband finding I would not let him
handle her as he had begun to do, told me, he was
mightily troubled, that his Wife was ſo baſe to him,
and ſo unreaſonable to me, but that I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by him, and that as faſt as Money came in he
would bring it me. I was forc'd to be contented with
his fair words, and went my way, but to promiſe and
perform is always two things, and ſo 'twas with him,
for he not only took no care to perform, but would
always avoid me if he ſaw me in the ſtreet. I ſent to
him two or three times to put him in mind, that an
honeſt man is always as good as his word; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
'twas that he took no care about it, or that he was
really not able, he always put the Meſſenger off with
ſuch ſilly excuſes, that I ſaw 'twas to no purpoſe to
expect any thing of him; but the pleaſanteſt jeſt was,
that his Wife one day, when one of my Servants had
been there for Money, bid him get out of doors, or
ſhe would claw his eyes out, that 'twas long of his
Maſter that no body came to their houſe, and that
ſince that damn'd buſineſs of his, every body ſhunn'd
her houſe, as if they ſhould have their throats cut
there.</p>
            <p>I did not ſtay long at my new Lodgings at <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
a friend of mine that was newly marry'd in the
Country, having ſent for me, I went down to ſee him,
where I found a great deal of good company. The
Gentleman I went to ſee was not only very rich, but
was one that deſign'd to continue ſo too; to which end
he had taken up a certain reſolution, which is ſince
grown very much in faſhion among perſons of quality,
which was to treat very generouſly all his friends, but
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57806:223"/>
never to entertain either Servants or Horſes; and that
his friends might not pretend a neceſſity to intrude
upon him, and break his new cuſtom for lack of a
place of entertainment, he built a good large Inn about
200 yards from his Houſe, which beſides the profit of
of it, rid him of the company of thoſe poorer ſort
of Gentry which are numerous; for they having not
always Money in their Pockets to defray the charge of
their Equipage, choſe rather to live as they could them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
than to pay for their good chear at ſo dear a
rate; they grumbled, and made ſome reflections, but
they were not worth taking notice of; for Gentlemen
of any quality lik'd the way very well, and found it
much for their convenience. I am ſure I made no
ſcruple of it, but ſent my Horſes and my Servants thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as other people did, and went away to ſee my
friend. I never was better pleas'd in any company in
my life, for we had all manner of diverſions, and
which was better than all of it, I won four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtoles at play. They ſay Fortune never ſides
with old age, and ſome folks will believe no other;
and yet as old as I was, I had no reaſon to ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo,
for if I had kept account of the loſs and gain I had
made at play, I am ſure I ſhould find I had clear'd
a thouſand Piſtoles. And now, that I might put my
ſelf out of a condition to loſe it back again, I reſolv'd
to put it out to the Bankers, knowing that then there
was no danger; to which purpoſe, a Gentleman
going to <hi>Paris,</hi> I deſir'd him to take me with him in
the Coach, reſolving to come back again aſſoon as I had
done my buſineſs, and therefore took but only a Boy
with me, leaving my Lacquay at the Inn with my
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> giving them order however to meet
me at a certain time and place, but they having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to rob me, as-it afterward appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, march'd
quite away, ſo that when I came to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
there was neither Horſe nor Men, nor no
news to be had of them: I could not imagin what
ſhould hinder them, and never dreamt of what really
was the cauſe. I fancy'd ſome accident had happen'd
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57806:224"/>
to my Equipage, or that ſome hunting match having
been made in the Country, my friend might make
bold with my Horſes, having not enough in his Stable
for all the company.</p>
            <p>Thus I thought with my ſelf, tho with very little
reaſon, for I might have conſider'd, if my friend had
had never ſo much occaſion, he would not have taken
my Horſes, becauſe I was to come back on them; and
then as to any accident befalling my Equipage, they
would be ſure to have ſent me word, and ſend me
other Horſes. However, as we are often moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
in deceiving our ſelves, I pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d my ſelf
with theſe imaginations till the next morning,
and from thence to night again; but hearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then, I began to miſtruſt ſome miſchief was
in it. Indeed I muſt ſay it was my own fault, for
I had known enough by that <hi>Valet</hi> of mine to give me
cauſe of miſtruſt, if I had but taken notice of it. He
was one of the impudenteſt Rogues alive; and as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
ſince I catcht him, us'd to take his time, and
go upon the Pad, and ſtrip People upon the Road.
Indeed, the behaving himſelf ſo well in that accident,
which, as I have told you, befel me in my Chamber,
made me the more confident in him, but I never
thought he had been ſuch a Raſcal. Having waited
thus till my patience was quite worn out, I diſpatcht
away a Meſſenger to the Inn where I left them, and he
brought me word, they had been gone five days afore
to meet me, as they ſaid. This was enough to put me
out of my pain, I preſently then concluded what was
befallen me, and away I went back again to <hi>Paris,</hi> to
adviſe what was beſt to be done in the caſe. In the
interim, my Lacquay having a Brother who liv'd in
the <hi>Fauxboug St. Antoine,</hi> I went to him, and deſir'd
him to give me notice if his Brother came to ſee him,
and that I would pardon him upon his diſcovering the
other, for I knew it was no contrivance of his, but
that he was wheedled and drawn in by the t'other,
who I knew was a Raſcal; that I was very ſorry he
ſhould be ſo led aſide, having a great kindneſs for the
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57806:224"/>
young man; I bid him tell him all this, and withal
that 'twas the only way to ſave his life, to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon my kindneſs, that he had liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d five or ſix years
with me, and he knew I was a man of my word; and
that if he did not, he would be in a great deal of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>I told him indeed nothing but the truth, for I
never had a prettier Servant, nor one that was more
faithful, and I think the other Rogue bewitcht
him, or he would never have plaid this extravagant
prank. In a fit of ſickneſs which he had, not above
five or ſix months before, I had taken as much care of
him, as if he had been my own Child; and fancying
if he was brought to recollect all my kindneſs ſhew'd
to him, it might work upon him, and the more too,
when he ſhould know how eaſy I was to forgive him,
if he had been led to commit this folly only out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Wine. This courſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I took, and the ſucceſs was
anſwerable, tho I dare ſay, it would not have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo well to a great many others; for certainly there
are few people uſe a Servant ſo gently as I, but every
body does in that as ſuits with their humour; and the
method moſt us'd is not always the beſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in the confidence the fellow put in my promiſe;
for coming to ſee his Brother, and hearing what I had
ſaid, and that I, would forgive him, he comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to find me out, and asking my pardon, told me,
he was drawn into the fact by ill counſel, and he knew
no way to convince me of it better, than by coming
to throw himſelf at my feet, as he now did; that he
knew his life was in my hand, and he acknowledg'd
he had deſerv'd death, but hop'd, ſince I had given my
word to his Brother, I would not be ſevere upon him.
I told him he ſhould fear nothing, provided he would
do but what I deſir'd him; that I believ'd my <hi>Valet
de Chambre</hi> had debauch'd him, and if he expected any
favour from me, he muſt find him for me, for unleſs I
could take him, he had as good do nothing. Then I
askt him where he was, and what they had done with
my Horſes? He told me, that for the moſt ſecurity
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57806:225"/>
they had taken their opportunity to come to Town the
evening before me, and ſo knowing I was out of the
way, had carry'd them to Market publickly, and
ſold one to a Horſe-Courſer in <hi>La Rue St. Martin,</hi> a
little below <hi>St. Nicholas</hi> in the Fields, and the t'other
two were in <hi>la Cimitiere St. Jean,</hi> in an Inn where they
had taken up their Lodging.</p>
            <p>This account pleas'd me ſo well, that I confirm'd
my promiſe to pardon him, but I order'd him to go
back again to his Comrade, that he might not ſuſpect
any thing, being reſolv'd to take him the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Bed; to which purpoſe I order'd him to
come to me by break of day, to a certain place which
I nam'd to him; if there was no danger of being ſeen
in the Houſe; ſo I got ready the Provoſts men over
night, and poſting them in the mid way, I would
needs go my ſelf to ſee him taken. Being come to the
place, my Footman came exactly as I appointed him,
but told me, that he did not lodge at home that night,
and deſir'd me to take great care leſt I ſhould be ſeen,
for if the leaſt notice ſhould be taken of my deſign, I
ſhould never catch him. I approv'd what he ſaid well
enough, and therefore ſending the Provoſts men away
to a Tavern, I reſted upon his care in the matter. I
fancy'd the fellow would certainly come in two or
three hours, but the Rogue having got the Money in his
Pocket that he made of my Horſe, was reſolv'd to live
well while it laſted; and noon being paſt without any
diſcovery, I began to ſuſpect my Footman had been
falſe to me, and had given him notice; and when he
came to me, as he did every now and then, for fear I
ſhould be impatient, I told him plainly what I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
of him, and withal, that if he had trickt me, I
ſhould find it out firſt or laſt, and then I ſhould ſhow
him no mercy; but he aſſur'd me of his fidelity with
ſuch proteſtations, as fully ſatisfy'd me, and I
reſolv'd to wait till night; but 'twas all one, the fellow
lik'd his ſport too well where he was, and there he
ſtay'd all the next day, all which time I was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
with waiting. Then it was that I concluded the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57806:225"/>
Lacquay had without doubt deluded me, and the very
thought of it put me in ſuch a paſſion, that I was juſt
upon the point of arreſting him: but he told me, he
was content I ſhould hang him if I found it ſo; that
he began to think himſelf, the fellow was fled,
but at the ſame time he could not imagin, how he
ſhould get any notice of our deſign. Indeed, I was
ſo far ſatisfy'd, that I went to the Inn my ſelf to ſeize
upon my Horſes, and as I was ordering them ſome
Corn before I took them away, they came running in
to me to ask me if my Valet had not ſuch a ſort of a
Belt on, for they ſaw a fellow coming a good way off
that lookt like him, as I had deſcrib'd him; I ſent my
Lacquay, who was ordering the Horſes, to ſee if it was
the right, and order'd him to go and accoſt him, that
they might not be miſtaken, for that was the ſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on. In ſhort, being ſatisfy'd it was he, he comes
up to him, and tells him, how if he had come a little
ſooner, he had met with ſome Cuſtomers for the Horſes.
While he kept him thus in ſuſpence, the Provoſts men
ſeized upon him, and he ſtruggling to clear himſelf
from them, the noiſe brought me out, thinking they
might want help; before he ſaw me he laid about him
with all his might, but when I appear'd he made no
more reſiſtance; ſo true it is, that the Face of the man
one has really injur'd, diſpirits the mind, and the reproach
of a mans conſcience takes away all his reſolution;
therefore putting himſelf in a poſture of ſubmiſſion,
<hi>Ah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Maſter, Maſter,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I beg your pardon heartily.</hi>
I forgot to tell you, that with my Horſes he had carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
away all my Clothes, and my Linnen, all which he
either ſold or pawn'd. Having ſecur'd my man, I
had him to a Magiſtrate of my acquaintance, where,
when I had brought him, I told him, that it was now
in my power to proſecute, and perhaps to hang him;
but however, that I would be ſo kind to ſpare him,
provided he would reſtore the things he had ſtole from
me; that he ſhould tell me where my things were, and
carry the man his Money again who had bought my
Horſe, that when I ſhould oblige him to reſtore the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57806:226"/>
Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe, he ſhould not oblige me to proſecute him. This
was without queſtion a very kind propoſal on my part,
but the poor fellow unhappily had met with a ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
accident: In the little time he had been gone, he
had gotten into a gang of ſharping Pick Pocket Rogues,
who had drawn him into play, and had cheated him
of all his Money; ſo that inſtead of refunding the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for the Horſe, he had not one Farthing in his
Pocket; he durſt not tell me how it was, and begun to
make excuſes; but ſeeing how it was, and giving no
credit to his pretences, I let him go to Priſon, In the
mean time, that I might get my Horſe, without being
oblig'd to proſecute the fellow, I went to the man who
had bought him, and pretending to buy a Horſe,
among the reſt he ſhow'd me my own. I made no
great difficulty of agreeing to his price, knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
what he coſt him, I bid him profit enough, and
we ſoon agreed, ſo I deſir'd him to ſend him to my
Lodging, and come and fetch his Money; but when
he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me to be paid, I told him how it was, that it was
my own Horſe, and that he had been ſtolen from me,
and that he who was a Jocky by Trade, ought to know
a little better who he bought Horſes of. The Man
was very much ſupriz'd, for he was an honeſt Man,
and knew nothing of the matter. However, he told
me I was a ſtranger to him, and he deſir'd to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
that what I alledg'd was true. I told him 'twas
eaſy enough for me to ſatisfy him of that, for the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that ſtole him from me, and ſold him to him, was
now actually in the <hi>Chaſtelet,</hi> and if he pleas'd, I
would go along with him, and ſhow him the Man,
who was my <hi>Valet de Chambre;</hi> he agreed, and we
went directly to the Priſon, where he had the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of ſeeing that it was even ſo, and that he could
have no more claim to the Horſe. However, after this,
ſome Attorney having advis'd him to preſent a Petition,
in which he made his complaint, that I came and
took the Horſe away by main force, he got leave
to ſeize him again, and ſent an Officer at a time,
when he knew I was not at home: he that came de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57806:226"/>
to ſee him out, under pretence of carrying him to
a place where goods are attacht, but indeed to give the
Horſe Merchant poſſeſſion, after which I had no remedy
but againſt the poor Stable-keeper, whoſe Wife it may be
would have paid me with a ſham of her being a <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me
Sole,</hi> as the Barbers Wife had done; but my Landlord
would not ſuffer that, and choſe rather to be the Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre,
and to take it into his keeping. This Proceeding of
the Jockeys brought me into a Suit at Law, which I
would have willingly declin'd, and going to Council
about it, they advis'd me to demand a Warrant. I
went then to the new <hi>Chatellet</hi> in the <hi>Fauxbourg St.
Germain,</hi> where I lodg'd, and Monſieur <hi>Girardin</hi> being
Chief in that Court of Judicature, I needed not go
twice to him to be heard, for he is a perſon always very
obliging to perſons of any quality. My Cauſe was ſo
clear, that he granted what I askt at firſt word; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I was forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to give ſecurity till the Proceſs ſhould
be made out againſt my <hi>Valet,</hi> who was proſecuted by
the Sollicitor General at the Kings Suit, for one
of my friends, who underſtood thoſe things better than
I, had taken care to order that for me, telling me the
King was better able to bear the Charges than I was;
by which he ſav'd me three or four hundred Franks
in my pocket, and I was very much oblig'd to him
for it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I brought a Citizen of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
to be Security, and having entred into a
Recognizance to the Regiſtry, I thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t all was over;
but it prov'd a ſtrange Suit for me. My <hi>Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
before he came to me, belong'd to the Marquis <hi>de
l' Aigle,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y'd the
Marquis <hi>de Rarcy</hi>'s Daughter, a Gentleman of but a
mean quality, but being ally'd to a Family of good
Repute, and of great perſonal Merit, he liv'd all his
days in a great deal of Credit; I was acquainted with
him, and his Daughter, who had ſeen me ſeveral times
at his Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and knew I was the fellows Maſter, who
had formerly liv'd with her Husband, came to me to
ſpeak in his behalf, and pray'd me to be favourable to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57806:227"/>
him, and ſhe would ſo order it, that I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it, ſhe would give me her word for it; I told
her I deſir'd no more, and before ſhe came to me, I
had offer'd ſo much to the Priſoner; that I was ſorry
ſhe had no Requeſt of greater conſequence to make to
me, that I might have the honour to oblige her; that
I was an old friend of her Fathers, and ſo much hers
alſo, that ſhe might depend upon any thing which lay
in my pow'r to be done: however, I told her, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
there might be ſome difficulty now in the
thing; that the Man being put into the hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ſhe could not take him out when ſhe would,
and we ought to take advice of thoſe who underſtood
thoſe things, what was to be done; ſhe approv'd of
what I ſaid, and taking me into her Coach, we went
to the Regiſter, who was a friend of hers. He told us
indeed, 'twould be a hard matter to bring the fellow
off now; that if I had not committed him it might
have been done, but however he would try; he ſaid
the thing depended on the Depoſition of the Witneſſes
who ſhould come in againſt him, and they having not
been examin'd yet, it lay in my power to direct them
what they ſhould ſay.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de l' Aigle</hi> was mighty glad of this expedient,
telling me, that now it was all in my power, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
her promiſes as ſhe had before, that I ſhould
loſe nothing, I parted from her, upon condition ſhe
ſhould come forthwith and perform them; but two
or three days after ſhe came to me again, and told me,
ſhe was extreamly troubled, that ſhe had promis'd me
what ſhe could not perform; that what ſhe had ſaid,
was upon Propoſals made to her by the Priſoner; and
that now when it was come to the point, he could not
find Money but juſt to ſatisfie the Horſe Merchant, and
that if I was not inclin'd to ſhow him ſome pity, he was
a dead man. This pretty fetch ſurpriz'd me extreamly,
eſpecially coming from ſuch a Woman as ſhe, who
ought to have had all her meaſures ready-before hand,
and beſides I thought indeed, ſhe had intended to have
done ſo much for the poor fellow herſelf, and ſo I told
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57806:227"/>
her; upon which ſhe reply'd, ſhe had done more for
him than I thought of, that 'twas ſhe helpt him to the
Money to pay the Horſe Courſer, and that ſhe could
not do any more, and begg'd me to bear a little of the
loſs to ſave a poor Wretch from the Gallows. I proteſt,
I was very unwilling to do any thing, after her having
broke the promiſes ſhe made me at firſt, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that I ſhould not be much the better for hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a poor fellow, I told her I would do any thing
for her ſake, and ſince ſhe would have it ſo, it was
granted. So we parted, after her giving me a great
many thanks for my generoſity, and the like. Things
being iſſued thus far, I thought I might venture to go
a ſmall Journey into the Country, which I had deferr'd
for ſome time upon this account. I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that I had my Arm put out of joynt, going to
ſee Father <hi>d' Aviano;</hi> and that falling into the
hands of an ignorant Surgeon, I was forc'd to go to the
Hangman of <hi>Ruremond,</hi> who had given me eaſe; but
whether it was that he had not perfectly cur'd it, or
that ſuch accidents as thoſe generally leave pains and
aches which are felt when one comes to be old, I have
had ſince that, every now and then, a pain there, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
againſt the change of weather. I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with the whole College of Phyſitians, and with
thoſe of <hi>Saint Come,</hi> and they all advis'd me to go to
<hi>Barbottans,</hi> near the <hi>Pyrennees,</hi> a place nam'd from the
Baths that are there, which are different from all Baths,
for they are not of clear water, but very muddy;
yet of ſuch virtue, that ſtrange cures are done by them,
upon ſuch as are troubled with weakneſſes in the
Nerves and Joynts, or the remains of any diſlocated
part, as mine was. Before I went away I took my leave
of Madam <hi>de l' Aigle,</hi> and told her, my going out of
Town ſhould not hinder the doing what ſhe deſir'd,
that I would leave order for the Witneſſes to come to
her for directions before they were examin'd; and
ſince the Regiſter had told us, that all depended upon
their depoſitions, ſhe might be ſatisfy'd the thing
would be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:57806:228"/>
Upon this I went my way, reſting upon her promiſe,
not dreaming in the leaſt, that a Woman of her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and who I had dealt ſo fairly with, could be ſo
baſe as to break her word a ſecond time; but ſhe had
marry'd a <hi>Norman,</hi> the Maxim of whoſe Country
it is, that a Man ought not to be a Slave to his Word.
She had no ſooner ſeen me clear of <hi>Paris,</hi> but ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
that ſhe had alſo marry'd the Manners and
Cuſtoms of the <hi>Normans;</hi> for after ſhe had order'd
every thing as ſhe deſir'd it, with the Witneſſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the orders I had left, inſtead of performing
her agreement with me, ſhe goes to the Priſoner, and
tells him ſhe would bring him off well enough, that he
ſhould now ſtand in his own juſtification, and tell the
Court, that inſtead of robbing his Maſter, he had done
nothing but what he order'd him; that having not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to ſend him to defray the charges of my Horſes
and Servants, I had left him a verbal order to ſell my
Equipage and Cloaths if I wanted; and if he had ſold
one Horſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> it was only to pay for the keeping
of the other two, having not found me at <hi>Paris</hi> as I
appointed. If I had been upon the ſpot, it had been an
eaſy matter for me to have confuted all theſe ſham ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but my Sollicitor, and the Witneſſes too, having
had orders from me to ſpeak nothing of him but what
ſhe directed, I could not blame them if they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to clear him; and ſhe, inſtead of bearing me
harmleſs, left me in the lurch, to be caſt in the Coſt
and Damages of the Tryal, and to pay to the Horſe
Merchant the ſumm of four hundred and fifty Livres,
which was the price of the Horſe, with intereſt from
the time I bought him. 'Twas certainly as ſtrange a thing
as ever befel a man, in ſo plain a caſe as mine was,
and a great cauſe of triumph to a Raſcal who ought to
have been hang'd; and yet all this was nothing to
what follow'd. The Horſe Courſer having gotten judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt me, and I not being to be found, he gave
notice to the Man who was ſecurity for me, to prepare
to pay the Money in my room; and this demand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, juſt at a time when he had a great man
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57806:228"/>
Bills to pay, and at the ſame time one came to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
for non-payment, the Man was quite ruin'd,
having neither Money nor Friends to ſtand by him at
ſuch a pinch. I confeſs, I cannot ſpeak of this part of
the ſtory without being mov'd at Madam <hi>de l' Aigle,</hi>
whoſe baſe dealing was the occaſion of all this
confuſion; and had it been a Man, I ſhould not
have fail'd to have reveng'd it, when I firſt heard
of it, one way or t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>other. But to go on with the ſtory
of this Raſcal, which was, I think, the worſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happen'd to me in my life, tho I have had a pretty
many troubleſome buſineſſes too. Within two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
notice given to my Security, as before, they ſeiz'd
his Goods, and he having no body to redeem them,
they carry'd them off, and expos'd them to ſale in the
place appointed for Sale of Goods ſeiz'd in Execution.
I leave it to any body to judge, what a fraction this
made in the affairs of a Shop-keeper; all the remedy he
had, was to ſummon me to ſtop the Proceedings, and
for default of appearing, to proteſt againſt me for all
the Coſts, Damages and Intereſts.</p>
            <p>I was upon the road when all this happen'd, going
to the Bath, and not imagining any ſuch thing could
befal me, I had not left directions to write to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came to my Journeys end, ſo that tho a great
many Letters were ſent to places where it was probable
I might come, yet having no notice of any ſuch thing,
I met with none of them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Twas very ſtrange, I
thought, that among ſuch a multitude of people, that
uſe to call themſelves my Friends, and humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
there was not one to be found would lay down
fifty Piſtoles for me in my abſence, to have ſtopt all
this Villany, and above all, to ſave the poor Man that
was bound for me, who was but in a very ill caſe; for
ſuch people who live by Trade, are never without a
number of Creditors, and theſe came all upon him,
hearing what had happen'd, and believing he was pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
remedy, ſeeing he could not ſtop ſuch a ſmall thing as
that, ſo falling in with the Horſe Courſer they proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Sale of the Goods, and the poor Man loſt all
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57806:229"/>
that ever he had in one days time, and ſpoil'd his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
too, which was worſe than all the reſt. However,
as I was really innocent of all that had happen'd, all
my anger was bent againſt Madam <hi>de l <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Aigle.</hi> I will
not pretend to deſcribe what a paſſion I was in at her,
for indeed 'tis impoſſible; you muſt think I thought of
nothing but revenge, and I was very deeply toucht to
do what I did. I had not undertaken ſuch a long
Journey, as I ſaid before, but in hopes of recovering
my health; now I was upon the ſpot, and ought to
expect the ſucceſs, yet upon the news of this I made
back again immediately, reſolving to do my utmoſt
rather than to be thus fool'd. I have given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
already how I had been inform'd, that my <hi>Valet
de Chambre</hi> had us'd to rob on the High-way. I now
made enquiry to find out what proof I could have of it,
and finding I had too plain proof to fail bringing him
to the Gallows, I had nothing to do then but to find
him out, which as it happen'd was not ſo difficult as I
thought it was: having given order to one of my Boys
to put off his Livery, and go to the Marquis <hi>de l' Aigle</hi>'s,
upon pretence of getting a place, he preſently learnt,
that the fellow was got into his ſervice again; this
<hi>Norman</hi> not mattering wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were his Servants, ſo he
could but get them for little or no Wages. In ſhort,
he took him on that very ſcore, for he was a Man that
never miſt his advantage, if he had an opportunity.</p>
            <p>Having learnt where this Rogue had hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d himſelf,
I got a Decree againſt him, and reſolv'd not only to
take him, but to take him out of his new Maſters
Houſe, that the affront might be the greater to him; to
which end I got every thing ready, and taking no leſs
than a Gang of thirty Provoſts Men, that I might be
provided in caſe of reſiſtance, we went to the Houſe
betimes in the morning, and the Door being open'd,
we took the Rogue out of his Bed. The Marquis <hi>de
l' Aigle</hi> hearing a great noiſe, got up to ſee what was
the matter, and ſo did his Lady, and hufft at the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
theatning them for daring to enter the Houſe of
a perſon of their quality: but ſuch ſort of people don't
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57806:229"/>
uſe to trouble their heads about folks quality, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
neither, and the ſhe had like to have found to her coſt,
one or two of them having offer'd the butt end of their
pieces at her, and perhaps had done her a miſchief,
but that the Magiſtrate who was at the head of them
prevented it; but at the ſame time the Commiſſary
(for there is not much difference between one of thoſe
Magiſtrates, and one of their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, as to their civility)
told her, that if ſhe had been hurt ſhe had no more
than ſhe deſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, that ſhe ſhould know her ſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than to threaten thoſe that came to execute
the Law; and if ſhe had any thing to ſay, ſhe might
make her complaint where ſhe ought. This was a
great mortification to a Woman of her ſpirit, but ſhe
was forc'd to bear it, and alſo ſomething more, which
I had inſtructed one of the Officers to ſay to her, if ſhe
appear'd, that made her preſently know it was I had
brought this about, and thereupon ſhe and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
began to contrive, which way to defeat me again,
(for they were both as excellent at tricking as Lawyers)
thinking it was all on the old buſineſs. 'Tis true, as
to the crime, a Man could not be tried twice for the
ſame fact, nor would further Evidence ſignify any
thing, and this was what they built upon, and ſo
making it a point of honour, away they went in their
Coach to ſeach the Jaylors Book of the Priſoners Names,
but they were ſent back again with a vengeance, when
they underſtood there was more in it than they had
heard of; and as great as they were they durſt not
meddle with it, nor ſo much as appear, when they heard
of a High-way Robbery in the caſe; they did what they
could, indeed, by their friends, and underhand, but
all was to no purpoſe, nor much to their credit neither,
for all would not do to ſave a Rogue, whoſe crime was
as plain as the Sun at noon day; but he was condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
to be broken upon the Wheel, and all they could do for
him was, that inſtead of being broken alive, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
(for he had been an Aſſaſſinate too) he had the
favour to be ſtrangled firſt.</p>
            <p>This however, did not hinder me from endeavouring
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57806:230"/>
to make up the matter with the Man that had been
bound for me, and had ſuffer'd ſo deeply for it. He had
proteſted, as before, againſt me, for the Charges, Damages,
and Intereſts, and it was but juſt indeed that I ſhould
give him ſomething, and that conſiderable too: indeed
tho I was not the cauſe of his Creditors coming upon
him, yet I was of the confuſion of his affairs, which
brought them upon him, and in conſideration of this I
offer'd him 2000 Franks, and after that 1000 Crowns,
but he flew out at me as if I had done him ſome great
injury, telling me ſix times as much would not make him
ſatisfaction; that on my account his Goods had been ſold
for half the value, and that I was oblig'd to bear the loſs,
which was at leaſt 4000 Crowns; that beſides, I had
been the occaſion of his ſhutting up his Shop, where he
got his Livelihood, and I ought to give him a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for that; that it would require a great deal of time
before he could ſet up again, and get into credit as he
was before, and the like, and theſe he call'd his Damages
and Intereſts; and he hop'd I would not ſee his Wife and
Children turn'd into the ſtreet a begging for his good
will in doing me a kindneſs. But indeed he would have
ſent me a begging if I ſhould have done as he deſir'd;
ſo I was forc'd to go to Law with him, his Demands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo extravagant, which ended ſo much to my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that inſtead of 1000 Crowns, which I had offer'd
him, I was awarded to pay him juſt half the ſumm;
but becauſe I would be generous, he having really ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
on my account, I gave him the thouſand Crowns
I had tender'd him before.</p>
            <p>And thus ended this affair, which I ſhould ſtill
call unfortunate, had it not very much conducd to
ſhow me the vanity of this world; and indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that nothing is to be met with here but Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Croſſes and Diſcontent, I began to reſolve to do, what
I had a long time intended: And ſo at laſt I am retir'd
into a Religious Houſe, where burthen'd with years, and
depreſt with the infirmities that inſeparably attend
old Age, I am waiting with patience the good hour, when
it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God to take me to himſelf.</p>
