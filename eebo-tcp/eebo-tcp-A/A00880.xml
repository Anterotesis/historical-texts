         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29068:36"/>
IT is now seene for the conseruation of the
peace, what persons by the common lawe
had authority therein, before the making of
the Statutes whereby the Iusticers of the
peace are ordayned.</p>
            <p>And it seemeth that by the common lawe
dyuers persons were conseruatours of
the peace, for at the common law there was
one perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> which is called thiefe Iustice of
England, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mitted his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of iustice for things
touching his crowne, &amp; for the conseruation
of hys peace among his subiectes through
out al his realme, And that is proued by the
writ which the K. se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>deth to him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should
hold his place in the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of Iustice
to his subiectes in the forme aboue saide,
throughout all his realme, wherby it doth
appeare that the same chiefe Iustice is high
conseruatour of the peace throughout all
the countyes of England, and in euery part
of the Realme where he goeth. Also there
be other persons conseruators of the peace
throughout the Realme, as the steward of
England, the Marshall, and the Constable
of England. Also the Constable of euerye
towne were and bee keepers of the peace
by the common law: likewyse the high Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stables
<pb facs="tcp:29068:37"/>
of hundreds, wapentakes, lathes,
or tithinges were and bee conseruatours of
the peace by the common lawe within the
townes or hundreds, and within their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes.
And before the making of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
whereby Iusticers of the peace are
ordayned, the king by his commission made
conseruatours of the peace in those cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ties
&amp; places (where hym thought best) to keepe
his peace, and the authority which conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatours
of the peace, had by the common
law, is the same authority that a Constable
of a towne or wapentake hath at this day,
which I shall partly touch.</p>
            <p>If one make assault vppon the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>stable,
the Constable may defend hym and maye
take him, and commit him to the Iaile, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

            <p>AS concerning Ordinaries, yee shall
vnderstand that it is ordayned by a
statute made in the xxi. yere of king
Henry y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> eyght, that no Ordinary shal take
any thinge for the probate of the testament
of such a person, whose goods amounte not

aboue the value of a C.s. vnto .xi. pounde,
iij.s.vj.d: And the Scribe to haue .xij.d. of
the summe. And for the probate of a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of goods aboue the value of .xl.l'.v.s:
whereof the Scribe to haue .ij.s.vj.d. or
for euery lyne beinge. 10. Inches in length
one peny. And such summes for Letters of
administration, where such persons die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate,
&amp; the Testament to bee registered, &amp;
delyuered to the party wythout delay; and
letters of administration to bee graunted
to the wyfe or next of the bloude of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deceassed or to bothe: And for the probate
of a Testament, or letter of administration
of goods, vnder the summe of a hundreth .s.
the Ordinary shall take nothing. Moreouer
<pb facs="tcp:29068:57"/>
it is the office of the Ordinary to deface the
seale of the testatour wherewyth the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was sealed and to deliuer it agayne
to the party. And if the Ordinary take any
more then afore is limitted, hee shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayte
so much as hee taketh, and ten pound
more besides that, whereof the moyty shall
bee to the party greeued.</p>
            <p>If the Ordinary cite any person to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the Spirituall courte to depose in
any matter there, as a witnesse: that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
aud wronge to the party.</p>
            <p>If any Ordinary; Person, or Uicar take
any mortuary after the death of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whych had not goods to the value of .x.
Markes, that is extortion. And lykewise it
is, where they take a mortuary in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where it hath not bene accustomed to
pay mortuaries. And euen so it is where
a Person, or Uicar taketh more then .iij.s.
iiij.d. in the name of a mortuary. If y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> goods
amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t aboue .x. markes, and vnder the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of .xxx.li. for that is extortion.</p>
            <p>Also if hee take more then .vj.s.viij.d. for
a mortuary where the goods bee aboue the
value of .xxx.li. and vnder the summe of .xl.
pound the debts payd, that is extortion.</p>
            <p>And if they take of them whose goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb facs="tcp:29068:57"/>
to .xl.li. aboue the debts, payd more
then .x.s. for a mortuary: that is extortion.</p>
            <p>And if they take any mortuary for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
maryed, or one that is wythin age, or
for a man that keepeth no house, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion.
And if any mortuary bee taken in
Wales it is extortion, except Bishops that
shall take mortuaries thereof priestes and
Curates, and the Archdeacon of Chester
shall take mortuaryes of Priestes within
the county of Chester.</p>
            <p>And whosoeuer taketh for a Mortuarye
more then hee ought, shall forfayte asmuch
in value as hee taketh, and .rl.s. besides
