         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Who were conseruatours of the peace
at the common lawe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29068:36"/>
IT is now seene for the conseruation of the
peace, what persons by the common lawe
had authority therein, before the making of
the Statutes whereby the Iusticers of the
peace are ordayned.</p>
            <p>And it seemeth that by the common lawe
dyuers persons were conseruatours of
the peace, for at the common law there was
one perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is called thiefe Iustice of
England, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iustice for things
touching his crowne, &amp; for the conseruation
of hys peace among his subiectes through
out al his realme, And that is proued by the
writ which the K. se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should
hold his place in the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iustice
to his subiectes in the forme aboue saide,
throughout all his realme, wherby it doth
appeare that the same chiefe Iustice is high
conseruatour of the peace throughout all
the countyes of England, and in euery part
of the Realme where he goeth. Also there
be other persons conseruators of the peace
throughout the Realme, as the steward of
England, the Marshall, and the Constable
of England. Also the Constable of euerye
towne were and bee keepers of the peace
by the common law: likewyse the high Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stables
<pb facs="tcp:29068:37"/>
of hundreds, wapentakes, lathes,
or tithinges were and bee conseruatours of
the peace by the common lawe within the
townes or hundreds, and within their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes.
And before the making of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
whereby Iusticers of the peace are
ordayned, the king by his commission made
conseruatours of the peace in those cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ties
&amp; places (where hym thought best) to keepe
his peace, and the authority which conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatours
of the peace, had by the common
law, is the same authority that a Constable
of a towne or wapentake hath at this day,
which I shall partly touch.</p>
            <p>If one make assault vppon the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stable,
the Constable may defend hym and maye
take him, and commit him to the Iaile, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
he haue found surety to keepe the peace,
though that the assaulte were made vppon
him selfe. As it appeareth Micha. v. Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci.
vii. in the tytle Bar. Much more then if
a Constable see one making assult vppon
a straunge person, he may take hym and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to prison, or to the Iaile, vntill he
haue found surety to keepe the peace.</p>
            <p>And if one man threate another wherev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hee that is threatned commeth to the
Constable, and sheweth his matter, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:29068:37"/>
hym to compell hym that so threatned
him to find surety: in this case the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stable
and the party that is threatned may goe and
compell him that so did make such threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to fynd surety to keepe the peace, and
yf he wil not: they may commit him toward
vntill hee haue founde such suretye as you
may see Mich. 44. Edwardi 3. in the tytle of
Bar.</p>
            <p>And if one be stricken in perill of death, it
is the office of the Constable of the Towne
to arrest the offender, and to keepe hym in
prison vntill it be knowen whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
so stricken shall liue or dye vntill that hee
haue found suretie to appear before the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticers
of Iayle deliuery, or at such tyme as
he shalbe called vppon to appeare before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Iusticers at their discretion.</p>
            <p>And if one flee for felony it is the office of
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stable of the town to sease his goods
