            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This Order brought me under a Necessity of Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my dispatch, but perceiving my Business to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance very slowly, and my Father lying at that time Ill of his Death-Sickness; I did my endeavour to hasten my Discharge what I could, that I might pay my Duty to my Father, (whom I had not seen for many years before) and receive his last Blessing. Mr. <hi>Strickland</hi> was one of the Commissioners appointed for my Examination; and the Person from whom (in the Judgment of my Friends) I was to expect the least of Courtesie. Wherefore the better to dispose him to my Convenience, I gave him the Respect of a Visit, telling him franckly, that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd upon the Invitation of the Act of Indempnity; and laying before him how much it concern'd me both in poynt of <hi>Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> to see my dying Father.

               <p>From That time, matters beginning to look worse and worse, I concluded upon it as my best course to speak to <hi>Cromwell himself.</hi> After Several disappointments (for want of Opportunity) I spake to him at last in the <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> and the Sum of my Desire was either a <hi>Speedy Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or that it might be deferr'd till I had seen my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  <q>Hee told me of the Restlesness of our Party; that Rigour was not at all his Inclination; that he was but one Man, and could do little by Himself; and that Our Party should do well to give some better Testimony of their quiet and Peaceable Intentions.</q>
I told him, that every man was to Answer for his <hi>own Actions,</hi> at his <hi>own Perill</hi>: and so he went his way. A while after, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd to be called, and Mr. <hi>Strickland,</hi> with another Gentleman (whose name I have forgotten) were my <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers</hi>; but the Latter press'd nothing against me: Mr. <hi>Strickland</hi> indeed insisted upon my Condemnation, and would have cast me out of the Compass of the Act; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me at last, that I had given no Evidence of the Change of my mind, without which I was not to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My final Answer was to this Effect: That it was my <hi>Interest</hi> to Change my Opinion, if I <hi>could</hi>; and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I found Reason so to do, I would do it. Some few dayes after This, I was discharg'd according to the Tenor of This Ensuing Order.</p>

               <p>During the dependency of This Affair, I might well be seen at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> but that I spake to <hi>Cromwell</hi> of any other Business then This; That I either sought, or pretended to any Privacy with him, or that I ever spake to him after This Time, I do absolutely disown; and Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> will find as much <hi>Difficulty</hi> to prove the Contrary, as to Deny Those Treasonous and Schismatical Principles which I have now raised in Judgment against him, out of his own Papers.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Story of the <hi>Fiddle,</hi> This I suppose might be the Rise of it.</p>
               <p>Being in St. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Parke,</hi> I heard an <hi>Organ</hi> Touch'd in a little Low Room of one Mr. <hi>Hinckson</hi>'s.

               </p>
               <p>[<hi>Often</hi>] he says; which is <hi>False,</hi> for 'twas never but This <hi>Once. [Bringing of my Fiddle]</hi> That's Right again. I neither <hi>Brought</hi> it, nor was it <hi>My</hi> Fiddle. [<hi>Under my Cloke</hi>] That's <hi>Licentia Presbyteriana. [To Facilitate my Entry]</hi> Whereas instead of <hi>my going</hi> to <hi>Oliver, Hee came</hi> to <hi>Mee.</hi> After All; I do profess here, that I would have made no Scruple on the Earth to have given <hi>Cromwell</hi> a <hi>Lesson</hi> for my <hi>Liberty.</hi> But I affirm, that <hi>I did it not</hi> however.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>the Bribing of his Attendants</hi>; I disclaim it. I never spake to Mr. <hi>Thurloe</hi> but <hi>Once,</hi> in my Life; and That was about my <hi>Discharge.</hi> Nor did I ever give <hi>Bribe, Little</hi> or <hi>Great,</hi> in the <hi>Family.</hi>
