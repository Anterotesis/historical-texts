            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF Antiquity and Duration, wealth and riches, ſtrength and power, can make a City famous: If an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable renown, viſible grandeur, and unparallel'd priviledges may render her glorous in the eyes of the World: If the Spirit of her Citizens, influence of her actions, and a continued train of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes can juſtly give her the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powerful; Then may this great ancient, and renowned City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> deſervedly be eſteem'd one of the eminenteſt Cities of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, unleſs the Lie be given to the moſt Authentick of all our Engliſh Hiſtorians, and we muſt not, like the Papiſts, believe our own eyes, nor give credit to our ears, but bid adieu to all rational knowledge, and deny the force of true Logical Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, inferences, and concluſions.
<pb facs="tcp:40944:4"/>
Such being the ſubject, of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, purpoſely deſign'd for a demonſtration of <hi>Londons</hi> power, and a convincing argument of the irreſiſtible influence of her actions over all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for many hundreds of years, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded on undeniable Truths, and throughout carried on, in an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſeries of affairs, by a train of inflances and examples, and an unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken chain of inductions: And being conſcious to my ſelf of no baſe ſlurs nor abuſes ingentilely impos'd upon the faith of any one, by falſe quotations, corrupting of Authors, or wilful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, as knowing my ſelf eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd if guilty, and therefore ſo much the more cautious, by how much the more certain, that theſe Papers would be made to undergo the ſevere Ordeal of a ſtrict and rigid examination from a critical age, I am apt to flatter my ſelf into the hopes of being accepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the lovers and admirers of this Honourable City, and of having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb facs="tcp:40944:4"/>
the worthy Citizens with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what grateful, pleaſing, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their palates, becauſe treating of their Anceſtors glory and renown, their own power, and the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, the grand influence of their publick actions and fixt reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Councils of this Kingdom. But whether my truſt and confidence in my own poor abilities, and my hopes are ſo good, as my ambition is great to ſerve this Honourable City, and I have any ſound reaſons to believe it within the ſphear of my Capacity, and the power of my pen, to lay any thing look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like an obligation upon the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Citizens thereof, others are the moſt proper judges, and the event will beſt ſhew. If any, out of prejudice to the ſubject and a cenſorious Spirit, ſhall lay it to my charge; that the whole book looks reflective, in anſwer to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I ſhall humbly deſire this favour at his hands, that he would be pleas'd to give himſelf the trouble of turning to
<pb facs="tcp:40944:5"/>
the Authors, to whom I ſo often refer, and thence he may be abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of my honeſty and ſincerity, if he be not over much prejudic'd already, or of ſo narrow a Soul, as to be wholly and altogether byaſs'd to the intereſt of any one particular party againſt the plaineſt evidence of ſenſe, reaſon, and truth. Beſides in my further vindication I can aſſure him, that a great part hereof was drawn up the laſt <hi>Autumn,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably prove it too, by demonſtrative Arguments, if need were. So that if it had appear'd in the world ſo early, as was at firſt deſigned, though I have been unwillingly hindered hitherto, ſome on the other ſide might have been by this time ready to have term'd it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive: Though it was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the off-ſpring of Prophecy or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, but only the reſult of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary judgment, and common foreſight, grounded on eaſy unforc'd deductions from plain hiſtorical truths, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent conſequences of things acted on
<pb facs="tcp:40944:5"/>
the Engliſh ſtage heretofore. Therefore I ſhall not value the impertinence of weekly obſervations, nor dread the doughty remarks of the whole tribe of common ordinary Scriblers, as thinking my ſelf ſecure within the ſtrength of the argument, and the authorities here produc'd to confirm and illuſtrate it; whereupon I am bold to defy the art and malice of evil minded men to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove me in any thing neceſſarily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial as to the ſubſtantial part thereof, though as to what concerns any of the leſſer Errata, I hope the courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be ſo much a Gentleman, as to look on them but as venial errors, and favourably paſs over thoſe ſlips of my Pen, if he apprehend any ſuch, as unavoidable weakneſſes always incident to human frailty. For I profeſs my ſelf rather a Tranſcriber than an Author, and eſteem this Relation the product of my reading more than the iſſue of my brain: Which if it may be in any wiſe advantagious to the publick, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

to the Learned and Ingenious, I know not but, upon good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I may be ready enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſomewhat elſe more extenſive, than to the Rights of one particular City, though it be acknowledged time out of mind to have been the Epitome and Abridgment of the Kingdom, as well as the head both of King and Laws.</p>

            <p>HOW conſiderable a Figure the City of <hi>London</hi> makes in the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is conceal'd (I ſuppoſe) but from few in the Land: But the Influence its Actions have had upon the Affairs of the Nation in paſt Ages, is not ſo generally known. The Glory and Splendor of this Noble City, is ſo obvious to the Eyes of the Curious, that they cannot rationally conceive it to be the Work of a Day, or an Age; but that, like other Cities emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Story, it hath riſen up by Degrees from ſmall Beginnings, to its preſent Greatneſs, through a long Tract of Time, and the Concurrence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable Circumſtances to make it Famous. The Original of this City is ſufficiently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be Antient; but where to fix the true and certain Bounds of its Antiquity, is not ſo eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by Writers. What one ſets down for a Truth, another many times eſteems to be Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Scarce any thing being more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Learned, than to have different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the Original of Things, and be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance amongſt themſelves about the firſt Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Times and Places. True indeed, we can deduce the very firſt Origine of the World, from the Sacred Leaves of Holy Writ; but They, who have not had the Benefit of thoſe Heavenly Oracles,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40944:7"/>
or do not with Us believe their Divine Verity, are compell'd to grope in the Miſts of Darkneſs and Confuſion, while they ſearch after the Firſt Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of all Things in the Writings of Prophane Authors. The prime Pieces of Antiquity, that we meet with amongſt the <hi>Heathens,</hi> are the <hi>Theban,</hi> and the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wars; and thoſe too ſullied with the Fabulous Narrations of their Poetical Writers. Beſides which, we ſcarce find amongſt them any thing deſerving Credence and Belief, except the mention of the <hi>Argonaut</hi>'s Voyage, and a few Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages more: All the reſt are hudled up in ſuch a confuſed Maſs of Fables and Fictions. And yet theſe ſo celebrated Pieces bear Date ſome hundreds of Years after the <hi>Flood.</hi> So ſhort do the Prophane Writings fall of the Divine, even in Time, as well as Truth; unleſs we account the <hi>Dynaſtyes</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptian Kings,</hi> (mentioned by ſome Writers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily eſteem'd Fabulous) for true <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and make any Reckoning of ſome Men's Relations; who tell us of <hi>Chronologies</hi> amongſt the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Years before the <hi>Creation,</hi> according to our Account: The whole Tranfactions whereof, they would do well to produce in our <hi>European World,</hi> that we might be able to judge, what Credit ought to be given to their Words; and not any longer ſuſpect, that they ſhield themſelves under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Priviledge antiently allow'd to <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Travellers.</hi>

            <p>Seeing then, in theſe Humane Writings, we are left ſo much in the Dark, in what concerns the Firſt Being of the Univerſe; we have little Reaſon to wonder at the variety of Men's Opinions about the Settling of Nations, and firſt Inhabiting of Countries: Much leſs are we to admire, that the Foundations of Antient Cities are involv'd in ſo

much Obſcurity, that we can ſcarce trace them up to their Original, without being often put to the ſtand in our Searches; as finding but little certain Truth, mix't with a great deal of apparent Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

Wherefore, rather chuſing the Part of a Faithful <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> than courting Men's Favour and Applauſe, I ſhall deliver ſome of the moſt material Paſſages, which I find of this Antient City upon Record: Only, with this Requeſt unto the <hi>Reader,</hi> That as he ſees Cauſe, he would judge of me as an <hi>Impartial Relater,</hi> without thinking me over ready to give Credit to all, that Authors have ſaid of thoſe Elderly Times.</p>

            <p>What Repute and Eſteem this City was of in thoſe Days, as being Builded by the Firſt Founder of the <hi>Britiſh Empire,</hi> I ſhall leave to the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Conſideration; who may find it honoured with the Sepulture of many of their Kings, as of <hi>Brute</hi> himſelf, and his Eldeſt Son <hi>Locrine,</hi> to whom in the Diviſion made by his Father, fell Middle <hi>England</hi> for his Share; wherein <hi>Troynovant</hi> was ſituated: To whom may be added <hi>Cunedagius,</hi> and <hi>Gorbodug</hi> the Father of <hi>Ferrex</hi> and <hi>Porrex,</hi> the Laſt of <hi>Brute</hi>'s Line.</p>

His Fame is much increas'd by the many good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances he made, which were called <hi>Mulmutius</hi>'s Laws, and uſed long after his Deceaſe.</p>
            <p>That this City of <hi>Troynovant,</hi> was of Repute and Renown in this ſo Famous a Man's Days, is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be doubted of by him, that conſiders ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a Circumſtance, as the Building of a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Peace</hi> within the Circuit of this City, as an Effect of that Peace he had ſo happily ſettled in the Land; and, it may be, in Gratitude to the Citizens, who probably favour'd his Cauſe, and ſo might much influence his Actions and Enterprizes.

            <p>Here was a turn of Affairs effected by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult at <hi>London.</hi> Another Change we find, not long after, through the Treachery of <hi>Vortiger,</hi> and the <hi>Pict,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Conſtantinus</hi>'s Son, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> then King, and preſented his Head to the aforenam'd <hi>Vortiger,</hi> then at <hi>London.</hi> Which City doubtleſs, in thoſe Days, was of much Eſteem and Regard; and thereupon <hi>Vortiger</hi> (who bare the Chief Rule in the Kingdom at that time, though the other had the Name of <hi>King)</hi> probably was much reſident therein; expecting, it may be, and waiting for the Performance of this Treaſonable Act; that he, being on the Place, might have the better Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to careſs the Chief of that Eminent City. 'Tis certain, we find him afterwards endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to cajole the People, by the great Sorrow and Heavineſs he made ſhew of for the Kings Death, and by putting the accurſed Traytors to Death, for their Wicked Fact, according to the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>Thus many Love the Treaſon well enough, when ſucceſsful, who nevertheleſs hate the Traytors, after their own Turns be ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Vortiger,</hi> ſo Infamous in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Story, for his own Vices; as Inceſt with his own Daughter, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Vices of the Times under him. For we read, that Vice was then accounted of ſmall, or no Offence. Leachery reigned amongſt the Spiritualty and Temporalty. Every one turned the Point of his Spear againſt the true and innocent Man; and the Commons gave them all to Idleneſs and Drunkenneſs; whence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued Fighting, Strife, and much Envy.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The coming in of theſe Strangers prov'd but (as it were) the beginning of Miſeries. For being once let in, they ſoon began to Play their Reakes in the Land; and never left, till by introduceing more Colonies, they had ſettled themſelves, and diſpoſſeſſed the <hi>Britains</hi> of the beſt of the Country.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40944:12"/>
Neither was it any great wonder, that the poor Commons endur'd ſuch Miſeries from theſe New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gueſts, when as their Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Guides were ſo given up to all manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. One of <hi>Hengist's</hi> Pranks we find to be, his Treacherous ſlaying of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lords at <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> on <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plains, under pretence of a Treaty for Peace. But the better to work out his own Ends, he is ſaid to have ſav'd the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, whom he knew to have become his Enemy in ſhew, more out of Conſtraint for fear of his <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lords, than for any Hatred towards him; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him ſufficiently intangled in the Snares of his Daughter <hi>Rowens</hi> Beauty. So common a thing is it for crafty ſubtle Men, to ſerve their own Ends, by working upon anothers Luſts, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of an handſome Face, and Proſtitute Body.</p>
            <p>We read of the <hi>Saxon's</hi> having got <hi>London</hi> under their Rule; but whether by their own Power, or the King's Gift, I find not clearly mention'd. That he gave <hi>Kent,</hi> and other Counties to <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> is declar'd by the Hiſtorian. It may be, that he gave them alſo <hi>London</hi> to curb it; for fear leaſt the Citizens ſhould joyn with <hi>Constantinus</hi>'s Sons (whoſe Return he much dreaded) and aſſiſt them to regain their Fathers Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Henceforward, for ſome time, we are not to expect to find <hi>London</hi> ſo Conſiderable in Power, under the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy,</hi> as it was before, and after. But when all the Seven were reduc'd into one Kingdome, and the Affairs of the Land ſettled in a little more Peace and Quietneſs, <hi>London</hi> began again more and more to Flouriſh, and ſoon roſe up to ſuch an height, that it became the fixt Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40944:13"/>
Yet in the Time of the <hi>Saxon's Heptarchy,</hi> we find mention made of this Noble City ſeveral times, and on ſeveral Occaſions. As upon account of <hi>Mordred</hi>'s chooſing this City to be Crown'd in, when he rebell'd againſt King <hi>Arthur:</hi> The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by <hi>Mordred's</hi> Son againſt <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> Son of <hi>Cador,</hi> till he was ſlain: The Flying away of the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and other Miniſters, with their Goods and Reliques, for fear of the <hi>Saxon's</hi> Cruelty under <hi>Ethelfride;</hi> Whereby the Commonalty were left without Spiritual Guides, the City without Her chief Paſtors: The ſetting up an Arch-Biſhoprick there, by <hi>Austine</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> and the making of <hi>Melitus</hi> Biſhop of the ſame, in <hi>Ethelbert's</hi> Days: The Building of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſame <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> or elſe by <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> as ſome affirm.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Ethelbert's</hi> Time, we read in <hi>Fabian,</hi> of the Building the Firſt Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in Honour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> in the Weſt-End of <hi>London,</hi> in a Place called <hi>Thorny,</hi> (now <hi>Weſtminſter)</hi> which before was over-grown with Buſhes and Briars. But <hi>Stow</hi> affirms <hi>Sebert,</hi> King of the Eaſt <hi>Saxons,</hi> to have Built it.</p>
            <p>In the Time of <hi>Ethelwolph,</hi> Son of <hi>Egbert,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons, London</hi> is ſaid to be ſpoild by the <hi>Danes;</hi> and ſo not likely then to be of any great Strength, though we find the <hi>Danes</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves thitherward, in <hi>Alured</hi> or <hi>Alfred's</hi> Days, after an Agreement concluded between them.</p>
            <p>But now again, begins this City to be often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Story, and grows more Famous every Day, after that King <hi>Alured,</hi> having Victoriouſly repeal'd the <hi>Danes,</hi> return'd thereunto, repair'd thoſe Places, that before had been injur'd by the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40944:13"/>
               <hi>Danes,</hi> and committed it to the Guiding of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> Earl or Duke of <hi>Mercia,</hi> who was his Son-in-Law, by Marrying his Daughter <hi>Elfleda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence may we date another Beginning, as it were, of it's Glory and Luſtre, from this new Reſurrection out of the Aſhes of its former Ruines. Some of the next News we hear of this Honourable City, is of the <hi>Londoner's</hi> beating away the <hi>Danes;</hi> who Landing in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and comeing to the Town of <hi>Lewes,</hi> and thence towards <hi>London,</hi> had Builded a Caſtle near the River of <hi>Lewes,</hi> the more to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the Country; but the Citizens Valour, with the Countrys Help, ſoon demoliſhed it.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Edward,</hi> the Eldeſt Son to the forenamed <hi>Alured,</hi> we find <hi>London</hi> thought ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that the King took it under his own Rule, not entruſting even his own Siſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; thinking it probably too important a Charge, to be committed to any Subject, never ſo nearly related to him; becauſe of the Power that would accrue to the Poſſeſſor thereof, and the Danger might thereby happen to him (the King) in thoſe troubleſome Times, upon any the leaſt Difference ariſing between them.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Egelred</hi> or <hi>Etheldred,</hi> Son of <hi>Edgar,</hi> rul'd the Land, we read of the <hi>Danes</hi> coming to <hi>London</hi> (they being ready enough to haunt any Place, that could afford them Spoil and Pillage) but we find that then they were repel'd by the Citizens. The City it ſeems, was ſtrong enough to defend their own.</p>
            <p>But ſoon after that, another ſad Accident befell the City, againſt which it was not ſo well able to defend it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> A great Fire, whereby a large Part of it was deſtroyed. So rare is it, for any thing great in this World, to arrive at it's Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40944:14"/>
from ſmall Beginnings, without being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many Miſchances, and meeting with many Turns and Changes of Fortune, before it can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the height of its Grandeur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabian</hi> tells us in his Chronicle, that the City had then the moſt Building from <hi>Ludgate</hi> towards <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and little or none where the Chief, or Heart of it now is; except that in diverſe Places there were Houſes; but they ſtood without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This he profeſſes to have known by an Old Book, in the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> named <hi>Domeſday.</hi> But where-ever the Building ſtood in thoſe Days, or how great Harm ſoever the Fire did it, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it continued of ſuch Strength and Riches, that the <hi>Danes</hi> were willing to have got it into their own Power; and in Order thereunto, beſieged it; but that they took it at that ſeaſon, I read not. Yet ſome Years after, I find the <hi>Londoners</hi> ſending Gifts and Pledges to the <hi>Danes,</hi> to divert them then coming towards <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas in <hi>Egelred's</hi> Days, that the <hi>Danes</hi> thus har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed the Land, and did almoſt whatever they pleaſed; ſelling the <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> Peace for their Money, and then breaking it again at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to get a greater Sum. This gave the firſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Impoſition of that Tax upon the Land, called <hi>Danegelt.</hi> And the Pride, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Imperiouſneſs of the inſulting <hi>Danes,</hi> gave Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to the opprobrious Name of <hi>Lurdane,</hi> as now it is eſteem'd; though then it was <hi>Lord Dane;</hi> a Term the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were for fear compell'd to give thoſe proud lazy <hi>Danes,</hi> that Rul'd and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd in many of their Houſes, at the right Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's coſt.</p>
            <p>Neither is it much to be wondred at, that this Land was brought into ſo great Miſery by theſe

Hectoring Strangers, when as we fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

are found much to vary.

            <p>That <hi>London</hi> was, in thoſe Days, of very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Strength, we have much reaſon to believe; ſince that by Help thereof chiefly, <hi>Edmund</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear up ſo valiantly againſt the Fortunate <hi>Canutus;</hi> whom moſt of the Lords, eſpecially o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Mercia,</hi> the other of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> after <hi>Harold</hi> Death came to <hi>London,</hi> and ſolicited the Citizen
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40944:18"/>
to erect one of them to the Kingdom. Though this their enterpriſe was fruſtrated, yet doubtleſs it may prove <hi>Londons</hi> Power; otherwiſe 'tis hard to believe, theſe two potent Earls would have applied themſelves to the Citizens, that they would chuſe one of them for King, and upon the Failure of their Deſign would have quietly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without ſhewing ſome reſentment, had not the City been too ſtrong, eaſily to be dealt with, or ſlightly to be anger'd, with Safety and Security. The other more rightful Heir was the Perſon pitch'd upon. But the other Nobles of the Realm not powerfully aſſiſting, and <hi>Edward Atheling</hi> not being (it ſeems) of Ability ſufficient to manage his own Concerns himſelf, and undertake ſo great a Charge, 'tis no wonder that this Renowned City (ſuffering it ſelf to be born down the Stream with the Times) ſubmitted it Self (with the reſt of the Land) to <hi>Duke William,</hi> who made ſome pretence to a Title; Whereas <hi>Harold</hi> could ſhew nothing for his, but his Sword; And therefore it may be 'tis, that we read not in antient Hiſtories, (that I remember) of this Citys aſſiſting him, to defend himſelf againſt <hi>Duke William</hi>'s Power.</p>
            <p>Here now is a great Change indeed. The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Strength of the Kingdom turned from both the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and devolved upon the <hi>Normans</hi> by means of this <hi>King William;</hi> the Date of whoſe Reign begins, reckoning immediately after <hi>Harold's</hi> Death, <hi>October</hi> the Fourteenth, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1066, according to Chronology.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>King</hi> (who himſelf, by the General con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Writers, was baſely Born) is founded the Succeſſion; for higher they care not much to go, who keep ſuch a ſtir about our Princes inheriting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Birth-right. Though, if this be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40944:19"/>
made the fixt unalterable Rule, of Twenty Six Kings and Queens reigning Succeſſively, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recourſe to the Hiſtory of their Reigns, we ſhall meet with a dozen (at leaſt) of them, who cannot be denied, but to have come to their Crowns with Flaws in their Titles. Nay, if we reckon in the Number, ſuch as may have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted upon that Account, we may ſafely add the other <hi>Half dozen.</hi> That from the general Rules there are many exceptions, we learnt almoſt as ſoon as we went to our <hi>Grammar-School.</hi> This King <hi>William</hi> is commonly called the <hi>Conquerour</hi> in Hiſtory; which acquaints us, That he came in with an Army, and conquered <hi>Harold;</hi> who is eſteemed little leſs than an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi> But that from thence we ſhould conclude him a <hi>Conquerour</hi> of the whole Land, and look on it as a Nation totally ſubjected by Force of Arms, it ſeems to me to lack a little better Proof, than I have yet met with.</p>
            <p>That King <hi>William,</hi> after he was well fixt in the Government, might reckon this Conqueſt amongſt his other Titles and Claims, (whether by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold's</hi> Oath, the <hi>Pope's</hi> Gift, the <hi>King's</hi> Teſtament, and a little of Kindred) I ſhall not deny. For I have read, that King <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi> had a mind to put in for this Title alſo; but 'twas after he had well and ſurely gained the main point, <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi> But upon peruſal of the Hiſtories about thoſe Times, it appears a little unlikely, that this Duke <hi>William</hi> ſhould get the Land into his own Power ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Conqueſt, as ſome would inſinuate, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intents poſſibly, and purpoſes of their own.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Harold</hi> was Conquered by that one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, yet I do not think, the Land was: For beſides <hi>Londons</hi> Strength (where <hi>William</hi> was forced to yield Conditions, before he could paſs through, as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40944:19"/>
afore) the Earls of <hi>Mercia</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> then of conſiderable Power, are ſaid to have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves and their People to that City, without ſo much as being preſent at the Battel. How alſo the <hi>Kentiſhmen</hi> encloſed Duke <hi>William,</hi> and his Victorious Army, and compelled him to grant them the continuance of their Old Laws and Cuſtoms, is ſufficiently manifeſted, if only by the ſingle Evidence of their Antient Law of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velkind,</hi> yet continued amongſt them.</p>
            <p>If this be Conqueſt, to be forced to yield Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; What is it to be Conquered? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may better (I believe) from theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Conſiderations conclude, That the Chief of the Nation, knowing him to be a Man of Strength and Ability, and of great Fame, choſe rather to ſubmit to him upon fitting (reaſonable) Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than hazard the running into the Miſeries of War, by committing themſelves to the Guidance of ſo young and weak an Head, as <hi>Edgar Atheling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That King <hi>William</hi> made a League with ſuch as ſubmitted, and ſwore Fealty to him, ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>Stow</hi>'s Annals. True indeed, after he was well fixt in the Throne, he might not much mind his former promiſes; but contrary to them, might do many irregular Acts to ſtrengthen himſelf, as he thought, and ſettle the Crown the ſurer upon his own Head. Whereof we find mentioned in Story, his endeavour to raiſe his <hi>Normans,</hi> by introducing them into the chief Places in Church and State; and impoveriſh the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by ſetting grievous Impoſitions and Taxes on them. One we read of very conſiderable, in the Nineteenth Year of his Reign, when he made to be gathered Six Shillings of every Hide of Land, which would riſe high, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Authors reckoning; who ſays, an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40944:20"/>
Hide contains Five Yards; a Yard Four Acres; an Acre Forty Perch in length; Four in bredth; Eight of theſe Hides make a <hi>Knights-Fee</hi> or <hi>Ploughtill.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Eight <hi>ſhillings</hi> upon Eightſcore Acres, was a great matter in thoſe Days; though it ſounds but a ſmall Sum with Us, who have lived to hear of the Wealth of a New World, brought into the Old One.</p>
            <p>To this may be added, his Craft in inrolling his <hi>Baro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xes he pleaſed, without being very eaſily deceived by concealments.</p>
            <p>More inſtances of <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be obſerved, which nevertheleſs are not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly eſteemed Tokens and Markes of Conqueſt. That great Perſons, in the height of their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, often forget former Covenants and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is no ſuch wonder; it is ſo common, ſo uſual, for ſome Men to promiſe more in half an hour, when they conceive it for their preſent Advantage, than others find performed in Seven Years. If Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Acts of Rule are able to prove King <hi>William</hi> a Conquerour of this whole Land, I do not know but many others may alſo be eſteemed Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who paſſed for good Ruling Kings in the days of their Power.</p>
            <p>Though King <hi>William</hi> held the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſo low, that in his days there was almoſt no <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that bare an Office of Honour or Rule (if <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> may be credited; for ſome others deny it, as to ſome particulars:) This being certainly the too too common Effect of letting in a Forreign Power into a Land, where thoſe that were the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of the Forreigners as Friends, have hardly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40944:20"/>

            <p>This may be conſtrued to be done, either in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the City, for giving place ſo eaſily to his Fortune, or becauſe he found the Citizens ſo pliable to his Will, or rather in policy to have ſo conſiderable a Place the more at his Devotion, and ſix it the ſtronger to his Intereſt: So ſubtle a <hi>King</hi> as he was, being in no wiſe ignorant (I preſume) of the great Impreſſion, the Actions of the chief City in a Conntry uſually makes upon the whole Nation.

            <p>In St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> was kept that Synod of the Clergy, in <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Firſt's</hi> days; which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd many Biſhop's Sees to be tranſlated from ſmall Villages, and ſuch obſcure petty Places, to the greater Cities. For by this time, the Policy of the <hi>Popes of Rome,</hi> in diverſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> had introduc'd a diſtinct Government in the Church, different from that of the State: And ſo founded (as it were) one Empire within another, to have the whole the better at their Devotion. So that, if Kings or Rulers of States were not as ſubmiſſive to their Imperious Commands, as they deſir'd, they had the Church in the Land to overaw thoſe, who bore the Temporall Sword; and leſt the chief Church-men (being often preferr'd by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates means, through the <hi>Popes</hi> great Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they would have it thought) ſhould prove a little Refractory, they had the <hi>Monasteries, Abbies, Priories, Nunneries,</hi> and ſuch like, in a manner, under the <hi>Popes</hi> peculiar Juriſdiction, to curb them, by the Power they could raiſe out of their Tennants, Friends and Kindred. <hi>Romes</hi> high and lofty Prelates, thus ſtriving to have their Spoons in every Ones Diſh: which Deſire of theirs, we do not find at all diminiſhed, though now their Wings be much clipt.

Whence elſe come all thoſe Wars, Maſſacres, Perſecutions, <hi>Plots,</hi> Conſpiracies, Deſignes, Intreagues, Frauds, Deceits, raiſing of Publick Jealouſies, fomenting of Private Feares, exaſperating of Mens minds, heightning their Animoſities, debauching their Moralls, and Corrupting Religion it ſelf, with the reſt of thoſe Curſed Arts and <hi>Seed-Plots</hi> of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where with our Ears have been ſo long filled, that the ſound is not yet gone out of them; nor know we when ever it will, as long as they can meet with ſo many fooliſh Bigots, and prophane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees among the Sons of Men: The One to be gull'd with the Hopes of Heaven, for the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch Meritorious Acts, as they will put them upon; the Other to be purchaſed with a Bag of Money, or a Plump Whore, to favour their Deſignes, falicitate their Purpoſes, carry on their Projects, and protect their Crimes, if detected, from Publick Juſtice.</p>
            <p>As <hi>London</hi> was favoured by the firſt <hi>William,</hi> ſo I find no great reaſon otherwiſe to believe, but that it continued in favour and fame under the Second <hi>William</hi>'s Reign.

            <p>In <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d's Time, we read of the founding of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s<hi>-Church, Priory</hi> and <hi>Hoſpital</hi> in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> which was begun ('tis ſaid) by <hi>Rayer,</hi> one of this Kings Minſtrells, but ended by ſome good and well diſpoſed Citizens of <hi>London:</hi> This <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> was then a Place for the caſting out of filth, where alſo Felons and other Tranſgreſſours were executed; and not put it ſeems to the uſe that now it is.

Another Addition of Strength might be, his not impoſing heavy Taxes upon the People; which, it may be, increaſed their Love to him, and made ſo many ſide with him: As indeed we find upon his firſt Admiſſion, that he ſware among other things, before the Lords at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to forgive his People the Tax of <hi>Danegelt.</hi> Neither do I read of any Taxes, that he raiſed upon the <hi>Commons:</hi> It is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed poſitively, in the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Enterprize: So accordingly we find, that the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtucks</hi> ſtuck as cloſe to him, as any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in his Adverſity. For in his Return from the <hi>Holy War</hi> (as 'twas term'd) <hi>Richard</hi> being Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack't, took and impriſon'd by the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:40944:27"/>
and long detain'd by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> he was compell'd to redeem himſelf, after a Year and three Month's Impriſonment, at a large Ranſom: An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Pounds were either preſently paid, or good Pledges left behind him to aſcertain the full and true Payment. A vaſt Sum in thoſe days, when <hi>Wheat</hi> was eſteem'd at a high Price, being ſold at fifteen Shillings the Quarter; as we find it in the fifth Year of King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign, about half a dozen Years after. So that, for this Ranſom, were ſold the Ornaments of the <hi>Church, Prelate's</hi> Rings and Croſſes, with the Veſſels and <hi>Chalices</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> throughout the Land, Wool of <hi>White Monks</hi> and <hi>Cannons,</hi> and alſo twenty ſeven Shrines ſcrap't and ſpoil'd of the Gold and Silver laid on them in former Times: No Priviledge of <hi>Church</hi> then regarded, no Perſon ſpar'd. A coſtly Voyage indeed it prov'd to the Land, undertaken to ſatisfie the <hi>Clergy-men</hi>'s Ambition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might well be content to bear much of the Charges, and uſe their utmoſt Endeavours in the Impriſon'd <hi>King</hi>'s Vindication. And ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> did, as far as Curſes would go; to which was imputed thoſe Miſchiefs, that befel the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and his Country a little after, as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Indignation.</p>
            <p>The Power, and Eſteem of this <hi>City</hi>'s Favour, in thoſe Times of the <hi>King</hi>'s Captivity, we need but remark out of <hi>Neubrigenſis;</hi> who acquaints us, That when the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> being then <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> and Governour of the Land, dreaded the Force of the oppoſite Lords, who ſtrove to ſuppreſs him for his Inſolency, and ill Government, he retir'd to <hi>London;</hi> and humbly intreated the <hi>Citizens,</hi> not to be wanting to him in that point of time: But they being not unmindful of his former Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40944:28"/>
rather favour'd the other Party; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the proud haughty <hi>Prelate</hi> was compell'd to reſign his Office, which he had ſo ill manag'd, and depart, to the no ſmall Benefit to the Land in thoſe troubleſome Times.</p>
            <p>At <hi>London</hi> likewiſe was it, that the <hi>Lords</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted together, for the ordering the Land in the <hi>King</hi>'s Abſence; which, after the late ill Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had been diſcarded, and after an Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their Riches grow and increaſe, by importing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting her Citizens Wares. 'Tis alſo a faſt friend even in adverſity, which the power and malice of her Enemies have never yet depriv'd her of, and yet you here find that ſhe ſometimes receives damage even from ſo good a friend. If the beſt friends may ſometimes accidentally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us, what would our Enemies do, were their power as large as their malice? For theſe two laſt years paſt, you may here perceive the favour K. <hi>Henry</hi> openly ſhew'd to the City, by the beneficial Grants he made her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Yet in the 38th that Tyde is turn'd by procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rich.</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the King's Brother, for diſpleaſure he bare to the City, for exchange of certain Ground to the ſame belonging: So that the King, under colour that the Mayor had not done due Execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bakers, for default in their Sizes, ſeized the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the City. The offence pretended in the 25th year, was, that the Mayor had received a certain Sum of Money of Bakers, Brewers, and other Victuallers, which his Predeceſſors alſo had done before him. In this 38th year here is another pretence found out. What an eaſie matter is it, for ſuch to pretend faults, who muſt not be contradicted, or at leaſt not without a great deal of caution and circumſpection?</p>
            <p>The manner of this Seizure, according to the Author, is thus to be underſtood, That whereas the Mayor and Commonalty of the City had by the King's Grant, the City to Farm, with divers Cuſtoms and Offices, for a ſtinted aſcertained Sum, the King at this time ſet in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers at his pleaſure, which were accountable to him for all Revenues and Profits accruing and ariſing within the City. But about the 19th of <hi>Novemb.</hi> the Citizens ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving agreed with the foreſaid Earl for 600 Marks, they were ſoon after reſtor'd unto their Liberties.

For being taxt by the King for the eſcape of one, that had ſlain a Prior related to the King, he put off the charge of this matter from himſelf to the Sheriffs, for ſo much as to them belong'd the keeping of the City-Priſons. Whereupon he returned home, and the Sheriffs, <hi>Rob. Belyngton,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Aſchewye</hi> were detain'd for a ſpace P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the 39th year <hi>Edw.</hi> the King's Son's Wife was honourably received at <hi>London</hi> by the Citizens, and the City adorn'd with rich Cloaths for the more ſtate. Yet notwithſtanding all this Reſpect, it was not long before the King ſeiz'd their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties anew for certain Money, which the Q. claim'd for her right of them. So that about <hi>Martins-tyde</hi> they were in a manner neceſſitated to give her 400 Marks, before their Liberties were reſtor'd them, and the King's Under-Treaſurer diſcharg'd, who for the time was made <hi>Cuſtos</hi> or Keeper of the City. What, had ſhe no other way to recover her Money, if it was due, but the Cities Liberties muſt preſently be ſeized on? The King's Brother had got well the laſt year, by falling out with the City, and getting their Liberties ſeiz'd. Was it not then, do ye think, cunningly done of the Queen, to try the ſame trick over again? 'Twas, it ſeems, too gainful a project, to ſuffer it quietly to lye ſtill without further proſecution, before it grew too ſtale.

            <p>Upon the morrow the Folk-moot being at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs Aſſembled, theſe ſix. Aldermen hearing the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of the common people, and knowing that the Aldermen, or Worſhipful of the City ſhould have little or no ſaying in this matter, and fearing their Cauſe, they went into a Canon's houſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, where at that time <hi>John Manſell</hi> and others ſent from the King, tarryed the Aſſembling of the People, and ſhewed them, that they intended not any longer to plead with the K. but were contented to put themſelves fully in the King's grace and mercy, ſaving alwaies to themſelves and all other Citizens their Liberty and Franchiſe of the City.

            <p>That theſe Acts might be kept firm and ſtable, we read of 12 Peers then choſen, to whom Authority was given, to correct all ſuch as offended in breaking of theſe Ordinances and others, by the ſaid Peers to be deviſed and ordered, touching and concerning the ſame matter and purpoſe. It was not long after the end of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, before ſtrife and variance began to kindle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40944:58"/>
the King and the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> by reaſon of ſuch Officers as the Earls had removed, and put others in their room. Amongſt which <hi>John Manſell</hi> (of whom enough is mentioned above) was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his Office, and Sir <hi>Hugh Bygot</hi> admitted for him. Upon occaſion of this difference beginning to ariſe between the King and his Barons, we meet with an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtance of the City's Power and eſteem, for when the Peers heard of the murmur at Court, fearing that the King would be adviſed to alter his Promiſe, to make their party the ſtronger, they are ſaid to have come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Maudlintide</hi> to the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> where the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the City were aſſembled, to whom they ſhewed an Inſtrument or Writing, (at which hung many Labels with Seals, as the King's Seal, <hi>Edward</hi> his Son's Seal, with many others of the Nobles of the Land.) wherein were contained the Articles ordained and made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> willing (as ſaith the Book) the Mayor and Aldermen, (conſidering the ſaid Acts were made to the Honour of God, Fidelity to the King, and profit of the Realm,) that they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in upholding of the ſame ſet their common Seal of the City thereto. After this Requeſt the Mayor and Citizens at firſt indeed deſired to be excuſed, till they knew the Kings Pleaſure; but no excuſe at that time being to be granted, at laſt, by the labour of the Lords, and ſuch ſolicitors as they had within the City, the common Seal was put to the forementioned Writing, and the Mayor, with divers of the City, ſworn to maintain the ſame, their Allegiance ſaved to the King, with preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Liberties and Franchiſes.</p>
            <p>After this obtain'd we find the 12 Peers aſſembling day by day, (as if now they feared no colours, the City being on their ſide, and valued no ones Threats,) keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Councils and Courts for the Reformation of old grievances, removing from the King divers of his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40944:59"/>
Menial Servants, and ſetting others in their places; and moreover a Proclamation comes forth, that none of the Kings Takers ſhould take any thing within the City without the owners will, (except a ſmall cuſtomary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein excepted) upon which what the Kings Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers took, was ſtraight paid for within the City and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſame, and ſo continued to be for a while Can any one then deſire a better proof of the City's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in thoſe days? Yet within few years following we ſhall meet with more Inſtances of her power in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.

in the ſame Writ it was commanded, that if within the Precincts of the City were any perſon or perſons known, that would withſtand the foreſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Statutes, that all ſuch ſhould be attached and put in Priſon, and their Goods alſo attached for the King, till they knew his further Pleaſure. Well had it been for many great perſons, if this agreement had laſted longer; but, like other Worldly things, this new peace was alſo tranſitory. However here we meet with another inſtance of the Cities Concern, of the Cities Power, of the Cities Influence. 'Twas the Citizens concern to keep the Peace thus happily and quietly made. 'Twas their Power you here find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſee to it. And their Influence upon either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you may gueſs by the due care taken to inform them of the late mutual Agreement. In theſe days of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, and time of the Barons reſiding in the City, we are given to underſtand, that many Robberies were committed by divers therein, and much harm done, but little corrected, they were ſo born out and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their Maſters. Such is the too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon effect of Civil broils. The Commons of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were far out of Rule by the incenſing of riotous Perſons, ſo that in the Aſſemblies and Courts kept at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> or other places, Worſhipful men were little or nothing regarded, and ſimple, indiſcrcet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons carried away the voice.</p>
            <p>As the City was in thoſe days powerful, ſo the Lords ſeem well to have known it, when, to obtain the more favour of the Citizens, they willed them to ſhew them, if they had any of their Liberties withdrawn, that they might again to them be reſtored, and alſo to think of ſome new ones to their Weal and Profit, and they would labour to the King to have them granted. Can any one deſire greater Evidence than Ocular Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration? The City had a great many good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40944:72"/>
Liberties and Franchiſes already granted, to the Emulation and Envy of many of her ill-willers. Yet here our own Eyes may eaſily certifie us of a large offer voluntarily made to her Citizens, by ſuch as had Power to encreaſe them, had they had the diſcretion at that time to have made a good uſe of it. For the Mayor having upon this kind offer aſſembled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and willed the Officers to deviſe ſuch things as might be beneficial to the City, they counſelling together, are ſaid to have made ſuch a note of Statutes, Proviſions, and Ordinances, to their own ſingular Profit, and ſo prejudicial to all other Foreign Merchants coming to the City, to all other Fairs, and Markets of <hi>England,</hi> and the univerſal Weal of the Realm, that upon overſeeing them the Heads told them, they were neither lawful nor charitable, and ſuch as they knew would not be admitted. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is it in too too many concerns for private Intereſt to be brought up in the Van, while the publick is left lagging behind, as it were a loof off, in the Rear. The Heads of the City willing the Commons to deviſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances, their firſt being ſo uncharitably or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and they,. I know not upon what account, nor upon whoſe Incitation, proving refractory and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, both thoſe and others, right neceſſary for the Common-Weal of the City, were rejected and put off, ſaith my Author. For men to go to logging of Bills, when they cannot otherwiſe hinder their paſſing, is a known Practice.</p>
            <p>After St. <hi>James</hi>'s day we hear of the Barons depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>London</hi> towards <hi>Windſor,</hi> where they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the Aliens, before plac'd therein by the King's Son <hi>Edward,</hi> who thereupon, with other aſſociates, rode to the King with Complaints in their Mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Barons, for ſpoiling them of their Goods: But theſe being then put off by the King with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

of Juſtice, till more of his Council were with him, he, with other Attendants, ſailed into <hi>France,</hi> whence being returned after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> there paſſed an Inqueſt of Twelve Knights of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> ſworn upon a Jury, between the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and the City, for certain Priviledges the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> claimed within <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where, by the ſaid Jury, it was found before the Chief Baron of the Kings Exchequer, that the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> at thoſe days, might lawfully enter into the Town of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and all other Tenements, that the Abbot had within <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and unto the Gate of the ſaid Abby, and there to make Summons, and diſtrain, for lack of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, all and every Tenant of the ſaid Abbot. 'Tis not now adays only that the <hi>Londone's</hi> ſtand ſo ſtrong for their Priviledges, whatſoever ſome may think of it, as if out of ſtubbornneſs and oppoſition. Their Fore-Fathers were like-minded, and ſtood up cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly in defence of their juſt Rights and Liberties againſt Arbitrary Encroachers above Four Hundred years ago, <hi>Anno</hi> 1262. After this the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Aliens, and others, was declared before the King and his Lords in the Parliament at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> This is the Term <hi>Fabian</hi> gives it, but whether on the ſame account as he did before, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a Parliament by a Council of Lords in the 43d Year, <hi>pag.</hi> I am not ſo certain as poſitively to determine. Here the Chronicle tell us it was at laſt ſentenced, (but by what means and Inducements is not there ſet down) that the Barons ſhould reſtore all ſuch Goods, as they and their Company had taken from all Perſons before that day, as well to Aliens as other men, both Spiritual and Temporal, and alſo that ſuch Meni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Servants as ſhould be daily in the Kings Houſe, and about his Perſon, ſhould be ſuch as the King would chooſe and admit himſelf: But the diſſenting Barons
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40944:73"/>
utterly rejected theſe Articles, whereupon the Fire of Diſſention was again kindled between the King and thoſe his Lords.</p>
            <p>In the 47th Year, by procurement of the Barons, we are told that the Commons of <hi>London</hi> choſe unto their Mayor for that Year <hi>Thomas Fiz Thomas, [Robert Moumphere</hi> and <hi>Robert de Suffolk</hi> were Sheriffs] and without Counſel of the Aldermen ſwore him at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> upon <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi>'s day, and made no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of him the morrow following to the King, nor to the Barons of the Exchequer, as had been the cuſtom: For which we may eaſily ſuppoſe the King was much diſcontented with the City. Whereupon the King perceiving the City would take the Barons part, having cauſed his Son to ſeiſe <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle by a Train, early in a Morning, a little before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> he rode thither from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whither ſhortly after came alſo many of the Lords that were upon the King's party. As faſt likewiſe the Lords and Knights on the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s ſide drew towards <hi>London:</hi> ſo that on either part was much People aſſembled. In the mean time ſome well diſpoſed Mediators endeavouring a Concord between the King and his Lords, it was final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed by both parties, that all matters concerning the foreſaid Articles of the Statutes and Ordinances made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and afterwards by the 12 Peers, ſhould be referred to the <hi>French</hi> King, to judge which ſhould be held, and which not. Upon this Agreement were Copies made of the ſaid Statutes, with Letters ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffect of the former Agreement, and ſent unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King. Over ſails the King, with his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n <hi>Edward,</hi> and others of his Council on one ſide: On the other were ſent Sir <hi>Peter de Mountford,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as ſo many Sollicitors for their mutual Parties: So that the Statutes were ſtrongly argued before the <hi>French</hi> King by both ſides. In the end, the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:40944:73"/>
King <hi>Lewis,</hi> calling before him both Parties on <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> the 24th, and ſitting in Judgment, gave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Sentence, that all and every of the ſaid Statutes and Ordinances ſhould be from that day forward ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void and ſet at nought, and all ſuch Bonds and Promiſes, that the King or any other had made for the maintenance of the ſame, ſhould be annulled and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, and the King and all others, for any matter concerning thoſe Statutes, ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>After this Sentence thus given, the King returned into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London, February</hi> the 15th. This King <hi>Lewis</hi> is named a Saint, for that he was not (I ſuppoſe) ſo bad as other Princes too too commonly are, or more probably for ſome deeds of his pleaſing to the Popiſh Clergy, as his ſending to deſtroy the (then accounted) Heretical <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> his taking a Voyage once into the Holy Land, and undertaking a ſecond towards the ſame place at the Popes requeſt: For at that time the Holy War (as 'tis generally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) was cried up in theſe Weſtern parts of the World, as a high piece of Devotion. But whatever eſteem <hi>Lewis</hi> had got in the World, the Barons (it ſeems) continued not to have the ſame Veneration for him, but were contrary wiſe much moved with his Sentence, noting great Partiality in him, thus to diſannul all the foreſaid Acts, which were at firſt made in Parliament, the King agreeing to them, and had been variouſly confirmed, by the Kings Grant, his Oath, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Promiſes, together with a ſolemn Curſe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt ſuch as would attempt in word and deed to break them. It may be 'twas the Fame of this King <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Goodneſs, that made the Barons conſent to have him the Umpire, as one concerned on neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But what could be expected in the Caſe? Could it be ſuppoſed, that he, a King, would not favour his Brother King what he might, rather than by confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40944:74"/>
theſe Acts, pretended ſo prejudicial to all Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, give Example to his own Subjects to require the like at his hands, or attempt to compel him thereto by force? Had the Lords gotten an Umpire from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome diſintereſted Subjects of ſome other Land, he perhaps would have adjuſted the buſineſs wholly in their favour. So hard had it been to have met with a juſt Arbitrator in the caſe, who would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to one or the other Party, for fear nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> having thus got a Verdict on his ſide, and the Barons noting Partiality, and therefore refuſing to ſtand to the Judgment, (though the Chronicle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to us, that they had promiſed aſſuredly to abide the <hi>French</hi> Kings Arbitration:) For King <hi>Lewis</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excepting King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter before granted, the Barons perſiſted in defence of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Statutes, as founded on that Charter. What then remains, but to commit all to the laſt Deciſion of the Sword, and ſo the whole Arbitrement ſhall be caſt more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into the hands of Providence? Away from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> go the Lords Weſtward, into the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> where drawing to them great Power, they war upon the Lands and Caſtles of Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> to whoſe aid <hi>Edward</hi> the King's Son coming, his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were diſtreſſed, and he himſelf almoſt taken. To redreſs theſe grievances a new Parliament was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which <hi>Fabian</hi> ſays never came to effect: Yet he mentions another Chronicle, which affirms this Parliament to have been there kept, and that the King and his Lords parted thence all at Diſcord. Beſides the mutual Strength of People on either ſide, The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons had the Acts of Parliament made by the King, Lords, and Commons (for of ſuch I have elſewhere read theſe Aſſemblies were compoſed in thoſe days) to fight for, which to obſerve the King, and many
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40944:74"/>
others had been ſworn, beſides a ſolemn Curſe denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the Attempters to break them. The King with his Party had the Popes Bull of Abſolution, the Sentence of the Council of Lords at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Judgment given on the Kings ſide by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King for their Incitement. Such then being the cauſe contended for, theſe being the mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to ſtrengthen either ſide, the difference is brought in the Spring into the Field to be decided.</p>
            <p>All things in a manner thus tending to War, the Barons drew towards <hi>London,</hi> that's their Place of Rendezvous: where new Aſſurances by Writing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented was made between them and the Commonalty of the City, without Conſent of many of the Rulers thereof. Whether they were ſwayed in their minds to the other ſide by Reaſons they carried in their Pockets, I find not, or thinking they had moſt to loſe, they feared to be the greateſt Sufferers, if the chance of War ſhould fall croſs, or elſe out of Envy and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation to the Commons, who had already been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with ſo much Power by the ſo often named Statutes, and were in probability likely to get more, if the Barons ſhould prevail, or at leaſt keep what they had gotten. Hence 'tis plain, that the Commons of the City were the men that ſtood by the Lords in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Parliament Acts: Many of the Rulers ſeem not to have appeared. Wherefore the Commons, as men enraged, made to themſelves Two Captains, <hi>Thomas de Pywelden,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Bukkerel,</hi> whom they named Conſtables of the City. At whoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by tolling the great Bell of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be ready in Arms, to give Attendance upon the ſaid Captains.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> the Conſtable of the Tower, Sir <hi>Hugh Le Spencer,</hi> came with a fair Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men at Arms into the City, and deſired Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40944:75"/>
of the forenamed Conſtables, who commanded the ſaid Bell to be toll'd. By means whereof the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhut their Shops and came out in Arms in great Multitudes, who, after Proclamation made that they ſhould follow their Captains, without knowledge what to do, or whither to go, followed them unto <hi>Thyſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> beyond <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there ſpoiled the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King of the <hi>Romans, (Richard</hi> the King's Brother) ſetting it on Fire; and afterwards with great noiſe and cry returned unto <hi>London.</hi> This <hi>Richard,</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> appears to have been a Mediator of Peace between the Two Parties, but after this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, what elſe could be expected, but that he ſhould become the Barons Enemy to the utmoſt of his Power? Though 'tis commonly ſeen, that from War moſt come home by Weeping Croſs, yet there are ſtill too too many found, that deſire to fiſh in troubled Waters. Would any, but ſuch as were in Love with Blood and Wounds, have counſelled ſuch a Fact as this, in the midſt of Civil broils, thus to compel the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Peace, likely to prevail, to become a man of War, and which was worſe, an Enemy, a powerful Enemy, inſtead of a peaceable Friend?</p>
            <p>In the time of theſe inteſtine Jarrs between Men of the ſame Country and Religion, 'twas much if the Jews ſhould have eſcaped free, who were ſtrangers, of different Rites and Cuſtoms, and ſo odious to the Common People. That they did not eſcape the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Multitudes Fury, we find, by mention made of Five Hundred of them ſaid to be ſlain at one time in <hi>London,</hi> on <hi>Palmſunday</hi> week. The occaſion is related to be for that a Jew would have forced a Chriſtian to have given him more than Two Pence a Week for the uſe of Twenty Shillings. This being the ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Uſury then permitted the Jews, by the King's Grant: According to which rate they might take i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:40944:75"/>
any Summ lent, greater or leſſer. A reaſonable man would have thought, this might have ſatisfied the greedy Minds of moſt ordinary griping Extortioners, Eight Shillings Eight Pence by the Year in the Pound, Forty three Pounds Six Shillings Eight Pence in the Hundred: Uſury unconſcionable enough of any ſenſe. While the Land ſtood thus divided into Parties, the Jews felt the Peoples rage in the City, and the Country did not altogether ſcape taſting the miſeries of Civil Wars; King <hi>Henry</hi> by divers places came at length into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> with a ſtrong Power, whereof the Lords hearing made preparation to go towards him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in the end of <hi>April,</hi> the Barons, with many of the Citizens in the vaward, departed from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> taking their Journey towards the King, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was at <hi>Lewes</hi> with a great power, by common conſent drawing up a Letter, ſent it in the name of all the Barons to the King: But the Anſwers were ſo rough, and in ſuch a ſtile, that it plainly ſhewed that the Sword could be the only decider of the Quarrel, and final determiner of the Conteſt, ſo much were their Minds exaſperated each towards other, though of the ſame Nation and Kindred.</p>
            <p>The Barons well perceiving by theſe Anſwers, that there was no other way, but to decide the Quarrel by dint of Sword, they went forward towards the King. <hi>Wedneſday May</hi> the 24th, 1263. is the day that may be writ in Red Letters, for the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood ſpilt thereon, in the Battle fought at <hi>Lewes</hi> between the King and his Barons, wherein by the Will of Providence, the Victory ſell to the Barons, with ſuch a total rout to the other Party, that they took Priſoners the King, his Brother, his Son, with many other Noble-Men, to the number of Twenty five Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Banerets, above Twenty Thouſand being ſlain, according to my Author's Account. After this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40944:76"/>
ſo compleat a Victory, the other Priſoners being ſent elſewhere, the Barons kept the King, his Brother, and Son, till they came to <hi>London.</hi> This was the place wherein they had found Shelter, and had had ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Aſſiſtance from the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of Obligation lying on them, and it implied ſomwhat of a Recompence due to the City, there to ſhew the Trophies of their Victory. Now we may eaſily conclude, that the forenamed Statutes are to ſtand in full force even by the Kings Conſent. And ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ccordingly we find a Grant made, and an Agreement, that if any were thought unreaſonable, they were to be corrected and amended by four Noble Men of the Realm, Two of the Spiritualty and Two of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty: And if the four accorded not, the Earl of <hi>Anjou</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brittain</hi> were to be Judges in the caſe. To continue this accord the firmer, the King's Son, and his Brother, were to remain the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Priſoners till it was compleated. A Parliament was alſo appointed to be held at <hi>London</hi> within a ſhort ſpace, though my Author writes, that this never came to purpoſe. So it ſeems, that in thoſe elder times a Parliament was the Subjects deſire, and as it were the laſt Refuge, and means of Reconciliation, to eſtabliſh Peace and quietneſs in the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> before <hi>Aſcenſion-Day</hi> is the time named, whereon the acceptable news of Peace were proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the King and his Barons in <hi>London,</hi> and next day thither they came with the King, his Brother, and Son, and the Two Princely Pledges were ſent into ſafe Cuſtody, firſt to the Tower, afterwards to <hi>Dover</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. In the time of theſe civil Diſtractions, and before the Battle, we find that the Wardens of the Cinqueports kept the Sea with Ships, that no Stranger might enter the Land, to the Kings aid againſt the Barons. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after the Battel we hear of Souldiers coming in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40944:76"/>
great numbers unto <hi>Dover,</hi> there to land: But King <hi>Henry</hi> was induced to ride thither, with a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and force thoſe Strangers to go back again, and the Kings Brother ſent Priſoner to <hi>Berkhamſtead</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, till thoſe Aliens were returned. It ſtands upon Record in my Author, that he and the Queen had ſent over the Sea for them. So that hence it had been manifeſt, though the Relation of King <hi>John</hi>'s Reign had not been extant, that it is no late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor new Practice, for Perſons of Arbitrary Pretences to call in outlandiſh Souldiers, when they fear they cannot raiſe aſſiſtance enough at home, in their own Native Country, to ſupport and bring to effect their ill intended deſigns. The Barons ſide ſtood firm for the Obſervation of the Parliament Acts: The Kings party deſired to have infringed them. The Barons grew powerful and formidable, the other ſide ſeem fearful that they ſhould not be able to compaſs ſtrength enough at home, ſuitable to their Deſigns and deſires, and therefore ſent abroad. There being idle men enough to be had for mony in moſt places, Soldiers were waged, but there was a Sea to paſs, (which required much time, and a ſuitable Sail of Ships to waft them over,) and a conſiderable ſtrength lay in the way to intercept them, if they came not well provided for an attaque. So that it was a day as it were after the Fair before they came, and that was many hours too late, whereupon they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to return again without, and againſt their firſt Intent.</p>
            <p>This is the inconvenience, ſome may think, the great advantage, others may conclude of an Iſland's ſcituation, that it cannot eaſily be over-run with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Forces, as Lands upon the continent often are, and with more facility. If the ſhooing of themſelves
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40944:77"/>
and their Horſes with Cork would do the feat, then they might happen more eaſily to paſs the Sea, but as things go in this Age of the World much time as well as a great Navy is requiſite to tranſport an Army, though little or no oppoſitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At <hi>Candlemas,</hi> by diſcreet and wiſe peaceable means, the forenamed Sir <hi>Walter Harvy</hi> was ſet in Authority as Major, and ſo remained the whole year after. In the third year the King confirmed the Liberties of the City, and granted ſome new.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee after a ſtorm comes fair weather. In this year we meet with a Relation concerning <hi>Walter Harvy,</hi> how that in the firſt year of this King, after long controverſy and ſtrife with the Aldermen, he was made Major of <hi>London,</hi> at a Folkmoot or Common-Hall at Pauls-Croſs, and ſo continued that year; but in this third year occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was found to remember, and (as the event ſeems to intimate) revenge it. For being accuſed of divers perjuries and other deteſtable deeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Oath, for them and for making Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Commons, who favour'd him, he was depriv'd of his Aldermanſhip, and turn'd out of the City Council for ever, and for keeping the Kings peace within the City for the term of his life, was bound to the good behaviour upon the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip of twelve perſons. 'Tis not unuſual for the Commonalty and heads of the City to be at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence each with other. Here's one, who ſeems a promoter of the Commons power, over-power'd himſelf by his Enemies, for making aſſemblies of the Commons, and other Crimes objected to him, true or feigned I know not, however thence was taken a pretence to thruſt him out of his former power.

had power allotted them by the Parliament, at their Folkmoot or Common-hal, to grant the King Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to depart out of the Land for a Seaſon: 'Twere they, who moſt firmly adher'd to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons ſtanding up in defence of thoſe Parliament Statues made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> but few of the chief Rulers of the City comparatively are noted to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd openly in that fam'd conteſt of the Barons War.</p>
            <p>In the fourth year occaſion was taken againſt <hi>Michael Tony,</hi> upon ſome demeaours of his in the <hi>Welch</hi> War, to accuſe him of Treaſon, of which he was arraign'd, judg'd and condemn'd, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drawn, hang'd and quartered. This man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs had been a noted ſtickler in the Barons War, for I find one of that Name among the five perſons ſo long kept in Priſon in <hi>Windſor</hi> Tower after the Barons overthrow, till mony bought them out, as is before related. Princes once highly offended may openly profeſs to forgive the offending party, but they do not however ſo ſoon forget him. Tho <hi>David</hi> pardoned <hi>Shimei</hi> during his life, and ſwore to him not to put him to death with the Sword, yet as good a Man as he was, he charg'd his Son <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to bring down his hoary head to the grave with blood; and ſo accordingly we find an occaſion was afterwards taken by <hi>Solomon</hi> to revenge his former curſing his Father <hi>David,</hi> by commanding <hi>Benaiah</hi> who went out and fell upon him that he dyed. This year was the famous Statute of <hi>Mortmain</hi> firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that no man ſhould give Lands or Rents to the Church without the Kings Special Licence, which Statute had afterwards many additions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to it to make it the ſtronger. For the Lay-fee was in great danger to be devour'd by the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, ſuch Arts did the Clergy uſe on mens minds to augment their power and Riches. Tho now

our Courts of Law are fixt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> yet in theſe Ancient times it was not ſo, for we read that this King in his ſixth year remov'd his Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench, Chancery, Common-Pleas</hi> and <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and afterwards return'd them back again, to the no ſmall damage of the Records thus carried to and fro. This King held his Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> in his ſeventh year, for Reformation of his Coyn, much clip't and diminiſh'd. This ſtorm fell chiefly upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt charg'd in <hi>London</hi> to enquire of this matter. Whereupon were caſt two hundred and ninety ſeven perſons before the Major and other Juſtices ſitting at <hi>London,</hi> and afterwards Executed at ſundry times and places.

               </gap>ands upon Record charg'd for the reſidue of the year. My Author writes that the cauſe of this diſpleaſure, the King bore to the City, is not ſhewn of a certainty. He mentions an old Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, whereby it appears that the Major took bribes of the Bakers, and ſuffer'd them to ſell bread lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix ounces in a penny Loaf, for which the King was ſore diſpleaſed, but to him this ſeem'd no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient cauſe, that the Liberties of the City ſhould be ſeiz'd for one man's offence: Wherefore he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſeth it was for a more grievous cauſe. However it is obſervable from Hiſtory, that it was a Common thing in Elder times to ſeize the Cities Charters on pretences ſlight enough of any ſenſe, till the Citizens grew ſo wiſe, as at convenient ſeaſons to procure new grants and graces, to prevent ſuch ſeizures for the future: And that it is not ſtill ſo feaſable and practicable, is the grief, I believe, and heart-burning of ſome in the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>14th.</hi> year of this King may be accounted famous for the Statutes, called <hi>Additamenta Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtriae,</hi> made at a Parliament holden at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But in theſe preſent papers I think it may be more noted, for what I am going now to relate <hi>verbatim</hi> out of <hi>Fabian.</hi> In this year a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> Named <hi>Thomas Pywelyſdon,</hi> (the which in the time of the Barons War, before in the ſtory of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſhew'd, had been a Captain and a great ſtirrer of the Commons of the ſaid City, for to maintain
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40944:98"/>
the Baron's party againſt the Kings,) was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed, that he, with others of evil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſhould make Conventicles and Aſſemblies to the new diſturbance of the City, whereof Report was made unto the King, the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the inquiry thereof unto Sir <hi>Ralph Sande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wych,</hi> then Cuſtos or Guardian of the City. Then the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> with others was put in ſure keeping, till the matter was duly enquired of. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Inquiſition made and found, report was made unto the King. Then the King ſent down a Writ, and commanded it to be proclaimed ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after within the bounds of the City, whereof the Effect was thus, that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Pywelyſdon, William de Heywood, Richard de Coundris, Richard le Cofferre, Robert de Derby, Albyne de Darby, William Mayo</hi> Mercer, and <hi>Ivo Lyng</hi> Draper, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the number of fifty Perſons, ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the City for ever. And if any of the ſaid fifty eight Perſons were at that time of the Proclamation voided the City, for fear or otherwiſe, that they ſhould ſo remain, and not return unto the City upon pain of Life loſing. Theſe being thus diſcarded, and exiled the City, who it may be would have ſtood firm to the City's old Liberties and Priviledges, the reſt of the Chief remaining might perchance hope the eafier to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in aw, whatſoever new Cuſtoms they ſhould introduce for their own lucre and advantage, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to ſome perſons in the World, though their open buſineſs there is moſtly to drink, ſmoke, talk, trade and the like. By the aforeſaid relation we may likewiſe obſerve; Once counted an Offender and ever thought ſo. Here <hi>Thomas Pyweldon</hi> or <hi>Pywelyſdon</hi> (for his name I find diverſly Written, though the ſame man be meant) a noted man in the Barons War, for which he had ſuffered deeply after their overthrow, by long impriſonment, and the charge of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Liberty for a great Sum of money of this ſame King <hi>Edward,</hi> then only Prince, was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, after about ſixteen years reſpite, baniſhed the City for ever, on an accuſation of attempting a new diſturbance. That any thing was prov'd againſt him, I have not read, beſides the mention here of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſemblies or Meetings. Had there been any thing material found againſt him, I ſcarce believe he ſhould have ſcap't ſo well with his Life, ſeeing old Crimes ſeem to have been remembred, though new faults were pretended. An Act of Oblivion is a very good Plaiſter in a publique Univerſal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But whatever Offender of Note, thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, out-lives the greateſt number of thoſe qually reputed guilty with him, and times be ſo much turned, that the ballance of the Nation leans very much on the governing ſide, I think that man's life hangs but by a very ſlender thread, whoſe ſafety and ſecurity depends only upon Pen, Ink, and Paper, and not upon the Governours natural inclination to juſtice and honeſty, in the conſtant keeping and obſerving of his word and promiſe. When in the late Wars on this ſide the World, <hi>Meſſina</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> was reduc'd under the Spaniſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by the French's forſaking it, to whom the <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> had before ſubjected themſelves, tho a general pardon was by the Spaniards publickly

               </gap> yet, if my memory deceive me not, there paſſed no long time, before the publick news told us of the accuſing and (I think) condemning of a Principal Man of that City, for a new endeavour to ſtir up another Rebellion and Revolt therein. New accuſations and new offences pretended, how unlikely ſoever, may ſometimes ſerve to blind the unthinking vulgar Herd, but a man of thought doubtleſs will be apt to ſuſpect, that the old grudge lies at the bottom.

            <p>The Citizens were accuſtom'd, before this year, to make good advantage to themſelves by lodging Merchant ſtrangers, and ſelling their Merchandize for them, for which they received ſo much in the pound. But at this time, by means of thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſtrangers, it was brought to paſs, that they hired Houſes for themſelves and their Wares, ſo that no Citizen ſhould intermeddle with them, which was to the damage of many particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, as well as to the hindrance of the Kings Cuſtom, and prejudicial (as affirms the Book) to the Realm in general by many deceits and frauds uſed by them. Here was a new Cuſtom diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to many of the Citizens introduc'd, but for what reaſon at firſt permitted, whether to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Trade by drawing more Forreigners to the City, or elſe to weaken their power, and bring down lower the Citizens high ſtomachs, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off ſome of their gain, and parting their Trade with others, I pretend not to deliver, until I meet

with better Information my ſelf, than hitherto I have in the point. Certain it is from the ſtory, that the King much advantag'd himſelf by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their fraudulent and deceitful dealings, and puniſhing them for thoſe offences by a conſiderable fine. The <hi>15th.</hi> year was chargeable to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were fain to pay great ſums of mony to the King, which they were aſſeſſed at, ſaith the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle; but out of an other Author it is recorded, that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> granted to the King the fifth part of their movables, to have the <hi>Jews</hi> baniſhed out of the Land, which to prevent, the <hi>Jews</hi> of their own Wills gave the King great ſums of mony.

As this King had many Wars, eſpecially with <hi>Scotland,</hi> which put him to great charges, and had much money granted him by his Subjects, ſo he ceaſed not to deviſe other ways to raiſe more, and get what was denied him. For as much as divers men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Though this was a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Prince, and oft ſucceſsful in his undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet the Clergy's power ſo over-top't the Laity's, that he choſe rather to make uſe of his Wits, than his Arms in dealing with them.

and clapt him in hold, whereby he caught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged himſelf on the Biſhop too, without openly pretending to meddle with a Clergy Man. An of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence eſteem'd piacular in thoſe days; to ſuch an height of Pride were the Popiſh Clergy grown. An other practice of King <hi>Edward,</hi> was his ſuddain Condemning certain Coines of Mony call'd <hi>Pollards, Crocardes</hi> and <hi>Roſaries,</hi> in his twenty ſeventh year, and cauſing them to be brought to a new Coynage to his great advantage, as teſtifies the Hiſtorian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Among others may be alſo numbred that Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he caus'd to be made throughout the Land in the twenty eighth year, which was after nam'd <hi>Trailbaſton.</hi> This we find made upon Officers, as Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Eſcheators and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who had misborn themſelves in their Offices, and had us'd Extortion, or treated the people other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than was according to the order of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So vigilant appeared this Prince, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his people, that they might not be abuſed nor oppreſſed by their fellow Subjects, when got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to power, under pretence of being his Majeſties Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, a thing we know common enough in the world.</p>
            <p>In the twenty eighth year, we have mention made of the City of <hi>London</hi>'s Splendor and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, upon the account of their receiving the new Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> Siſter to the <hi>French</hi> King. Thus runs my Authors ſhort Relation hereof. The Citizens to the number of ſix hundred Rode in one Livery of Red and White, with the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of divers Miſteries broidered upon their ſleeves, and received her four Miles without the City, and ſo conveyed her through the City, which then was garniſhed and hanged with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, and Arras, and other Cloths of Silk, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40944:101"/>
Riches in moſt goodly wiſe, unto <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> This is the year, wherein <hi>Fabian</hi> makes the firſt mention of <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Gaviſton</hi> in his Chronicle, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Occaſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſters</hi> complaining to the King of him, his Eldeſt Son <hi>Edward,</hi> and others, for breaking the Biſhops Park, and riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſtroying the Game therein. For this was the aforeſaid <hi>Edward</hi> and his Accomplices Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned. So that under this famous King, the very next Heir apparent ſcap'd not the Laſh of the Law, when he had offended, even to an actual Impriſonment; ſo far were men in thoſe days from aſſerting him to be above the Law, and not Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to condign puniſhment, becauſe the next Heir. Afterwards the King Baniſhed the aforeſaid <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſton</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> for fear leſt he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch his Son: But this Baniſhment was after his death annulled by his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> when King, to the great trouble and vexation of the Land afterwards. The twenty ninth may be eſteemed not unworthy of remark, for the Kings giving to <hi>Edward</hi> his Son the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> whereunto he likewis'd joyn'd the Earldom of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> newly Vacant, and return'd to the Crown.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>33d.</hi> year we read of the taking, arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawing, hanging, and quartering of <hi>William Waleys,</hi> who, of an unknown low birth, became the head Leader of the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt the Kings Power, and had Created him no little trouble in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but now in revenge was his head ſet upon <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and his four quarters ſent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be ſet upon the Gates of ſome Towns in that Land. About this time we hear likewiſe of ſeveral Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> coming to the Kings Parliament, at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there voluntarily
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40944:102"/>
Sworn, in the Preſence of the King and his Lords, to be true to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to keep the ſaid Land to his uſe againſt all other Perſons. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe is named <hi>Robert le Bruce,</hi> who not long after ſends to the Pope for a diſpenſation of his Oath, raiſes more Commotions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and gets to be Crowned King thereof at Saint <hi>Johnſtons: Anno</hi> Thirty four. But when King <hi>Edward</hi> had overthrown the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, and taken many of the Nobles, he ſent the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Baſtoon,</hi> with the Abbot of <hi>Scoon,</hi> to the Pope, with report of their Perjury, and how they were taken Armed in the field to ſhed the blood of Chriſtian men. And the Temporal Lords he ſent into <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who were afterwards Arraigned at <hi>London,</hi> and put to death, and their Heads ſet upon <hi>London-Bridge.</hi> The longeſt Sword carries away the Bell. If the <hi>Scots</hi> had prevail'd in the like ſort againſt King <hi>Edward,</hi> it's a queſtion whether they would not have done much after the ſame manner. How would they have then vaunted themſelves and their Cauſe for the moſt rightful, whereas being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd they ſuffer'd as Rebels? That the weakeſt goes to the Wall, is a known ſaying. Yet as ſtrong, powerful, and ſuccesful as this King <hi>Edward</hi> was, we find he cared not to meddle himſelf with the Spiritual Lords taken in the field fighting againſt him, but rather choſe publikely to ſend them to the Pope, with an high offence laid to their charge, to be puniſhed at his pleaſure. Whereby we may preſume he gratified the Popes Ambition, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as it were the ſole Judge of their offences, and yet thereby doubtleſs ſufficiently ſecur'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt thoſe men of the Church, his late Enemies, for the future. Could the Pope in Civility and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40944:102"/>
Gratitude refuſe to revenge the King in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Clergy-men for fighting againſt him, who had thus highly mounted the power, and Authority of the Triple Crown above his own, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the publick view of the world? If the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Clergy in thoſe times were grown ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, that this Triumphant King, in the midſt of his Victorious Arms, thought it ſafer to remit theſe Clergy-men's offences to the Popes Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, than puniſh them himſelf, (for I think it was policy more than zeal that made him act thus) what weak matches were the other Puny Princes to them in thoſe days of their worldly Proſperity Pomp and Grandeur? Now their wings are pretty well clipt, by the eſcape of ſo many people, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Countries out of this Popiſh Houſe of Bondage, let Crowned Heads and free States be careful, that they ſuffer not the Popes wings to grow again, or permit their Sworn Vaſſals the Jeſuits to imp them anew with freſh Feathers, leſt they mount up again over their heads to their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient greatneſs, or take a flight higher than ever they did. Now the <hi>French</hi> King through the baſe connivance of ſome, others Treachery, and many great Mens careleſs negligence, is become <hi>Europe's</hi> Terror, if Popiſh Plots and deſigns ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Scarce was old <hi>Edwards</hi> Obſequies fully finiſhed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Author, but the young King ſends in all haſt for his old Companion <hi>Piers</hi> of <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him with all joy and gladneſs, and advances him to much honour, gives him the Earldom of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and Lordſhip of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> rules all by his wanton Councel, and follows the appetite and pleaſure of his body, not guiding things by order of Law or Juſtice. Then he Revenges himſelf, and his favourite <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> on the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> (who had before complained of them and their Outrages in his Fathers Reign) by commanding him to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and keeping him there ſtrictly many days after. When by the means, motions, and words of many potent Lords of the Realm, <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was again ſent out of the Land, though contrary to the King's pleaſure, and baniſh'd into <hi>Ireland:</hi> Yet thither we hear of the Kings ſending him oftentimes ſecret Meſſeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and comſorting him with many rich gifts, and the next year we read of his being fetch'd home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſtill the grudges ſpringing up between the King and his Nobles, and continue amity amongſt them, which prov'd but ſo much the more miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Realm: For this exorbitant Favourite's power more and more encreaſing, he, having the keeping of the Kings Treaſure and Jewels, convey'd
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40944:104"/>
many of them, ſome of great value, out of the Land, and brought the King by means of his wanton Conditions to manifold Vices, as Adultery and others, whereupon by the Lords Counſel and Reſolution taken at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he was ſhortly after exil'd into <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Kings great diſpleaſure. In comes <hi>Gaveſton</hi> again, though he had before ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd the Realm, with this condition by the Barons added, that if he were found again in any Lands ſubject to the King's dominions, he ſhould be taken as a Common Enemy and Condemned. But being recall'd by the King, he ventures on his favour, and afterwards demeans himſelf worſe and worſe. In ſo much that we read, that he diſdain'd the Lords of <hi>England,</hi> and of them had many ſpiteful and ſlanderous words, ſo that there's the leſs wonder, that the Queen and the whole Court were ſorrowful, becauſe they ſaw the King (as <hi>Stow</hi> words it) not very ſound, ſo great was his Joy and Jollity for his receiving him in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereupon the Lords of one mind (ſaith my Author) conſented to put him to death, which they ſoon after effected by taking the Caſtle wherein he was, and ſo having him in their hands ſmote off his Head. For this was the King grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly diſpleas'd with thoſe Lords, and vow'd, we hear, to revenge his Death, ſo that after this he ſought occaſion againſt them, to grieve and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them. If the foremention'd diſorders, with many before expreſs'd by Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to have fallen out under this King: If Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Robberies, Rapes, Extortions, Diviſions, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſcords at home, ſlights, contempts, and loſſes abroad, and much blood-ſhed in Battels, fought and loſt, both at home and abroad: If murrain of Beaſts and ſcarcity of Grain, dearneſs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40944:104"/>
ſickneſs and mortality of Men, ravages and outrages of cruel inſulting Enemies, and almoſt a general deſolation, in ſeveral places of the Land, be glories, that can eternize a Man's memory to ſucceeding Generations, I know not whether this Kings Name and Reign may ever be forgotten, as long as <hi>England</hi> ſtands a fixt Iſland in the midſt of the Ocean. In the midſt of theſe troubles and croſſes, you are not to ſuppoſe, the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſcap't free from partaking in the Common miſery of the Land. In the firſt of this King's Reign, I find that he, and his new Married Bride were received joyfully by the Citizens, and ſo conveyed to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but the times afterwards grew ſo cloudy, and full of ſtorms, that I don't think they had over much reaſon to rejoyce, more than the reſt of their poor diſtreſſed fellow Subjects. Yet Providence in good time delivered the City out of theſe troubles, and with advantage too, as may be obſerved and remark't in the end of this, and beginning of the next Kings Reign. Twice more particularly, in this Kings Reign, do we read of a breach made on the Cities Priviledges, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the Citizens, at their own charges, to raiſe and maintain a certain number of Soldiers, and ſend them whether they were appointed, but the laſt time, it ſeems, it was conditionally, that it ſhould not be made a Preſident, which poſſibly was to appeaſe them, when they refuſed to go out of the City to fight, unleſs they might according to their liberties (as <hi>Stow</hi> ſays) return home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſame day before Sun-ſet. For 'tis plain, how great ſoever their reſpect was towards their Soveraign, that they had no great kindneſs for ſome about him: And therefore, when aid and aſſiſtance was requeſted of them againſt the Queen,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40944:105"/>
who with her Son <hi>Edward</hi> was newly Landed, and pretended Reformation of abuſes, they made this plea or excuſe, as favouring rather Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers than makers of Grievances, yet with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of due obedience and Honour to the King, the Queen, and their Son, who was after his Father the Right and Lawful Heir to the Crown.</p>
            <p>At the Parliament of <hi>Whitebands,</hi> held in the twefth of this King, whether the Barons came in Arms, the Citizens were the Keepers of the Kings peace in the City; a thouſand of them well Armed, by the Majors order, watching by day, and as many by night, in divers Wards, and at ſeveral Gates thereof, under the inſpection of two Aldermen, with Officers aſſigned to Ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every night to overſee them, and the reſt of the Citizens were enjoyned to have their Arms in readineſs upon a very ſhort warning for more ſurety. And what pray now was the effect of all this, but that the peace was kept, the City guarded it, and no diſturbance hapned that I read of, notwithſtanding there was ſo great an Army then on foot? Ill men were removed, ſeveral things were ordained for the good of the Realm, Tranſactions were carried on without violence, or blood-ſhed, the Parliament was peaceably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and every one returned home in quietneſs, ſafety and ſecurity. But on the contrary, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the later end of this Kings Reign, when the Courtiers were much diſguſted in the City, by reaſon of many violences committed, and much harſh dealing uſed by ſome towards their fellow Subjects, in the time of their power, under the wings of Authority, and pretence of Law and Juſtice, the Citizens were ſo far from keeping the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40944:105"/>
King's peace, as before, that they ſoon ſhew'd openly their favour, good will, and kindneſs for the Queen, who, under the glozing pretence of reforming the ill Government, was come into the Land with a conſiderable force of Soldiers, and had ſent to the Mayor and Commonalty for their aid, help, and aſſiſtance in carrying on this her pretended Reformation; A work generally highly acceptable to all ſuch, as think themſelves oppreſſed, and glorious in the Eyes of the people; but ſuch is the miſery, fate, and infelicity, the frailty and imperfection incident to all ſublunary attempts, that it very ſeldom, if ever, fully anſwers the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of every one concern'd. Neither was the Citizens affection to the Queen, and her Party, barely ſhewn in words and expreſſions, but it went much farther, and was publickly brought into Act by beheading ſuch, as they took to be the Queens enemies, not ſo much as ſparing the Biſhop of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelf, a great man among the ſpiritualty, who had been there left by the King to have the Rule of the City in his abſence. The occaſion is ſaid to have ſprung from his ſtiff and peremptory demanding of the Keys of the City Gates by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Commiſſion, which highly exaſperated the Commons againſt him, and ſo much the more, becauſe (as was the ſaying) he had rais'd an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to withſtand the Queen, a fault then thought unpardonable by the Londoners, who in words and deeds eſpouſed the Queen's Cauſe, ſeis'd on the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and kept it for the Queens uſe, and not long afterwards received her into their City with great Joy and Honour. A demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evidence in my opinion of the City's ſtrength and power. For if <hi>London,</hi> when ſhe pleas'd, could maintain the King's peace in the midſt of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40944:106"/>
Arms (as was ſhewn above) ſo inviolably, as that none dar'd in oppoſition to break it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the very ſame age, and within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of half a dozen years, did actually aſſert the Qeens cauſe, and aſſiſt her in her proceedings (as was pretended) for Reformation of the Realm, tho the Conſequence thereof was in truth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Kings reſignation, what greater inſtance can there be, to ſhew her great influence upon the whole Nation in thoſe unſetled times?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London</hi> having ſo viſibly appeared in favour of the Queen, the Prince, and his party, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed ſo much towards this notable revolution of affairs, we have no reaſon to think, but that, out of Common gratitude, her Citizens were to be aboundantly rewarded, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, out of ſelf intereſt and natural Prudence, would ſo well and wiſely look to their own affairs, as to make hay while the Sun ſhines, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing new grants and Graces, and ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find the event. For in the firſt year of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third, <hi>Fabian</hi> tells us, he confirmed the Liberties and Franchizes of the City, making the Major Chief Juſtice in all places of Judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame, next the King, every Alderman, that had been Major, Juſtice of Peace in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Midleſex,</hi> and ſuch, as had not been, Juſtice in his own Ward: Granting them alſo the Fee-farm of <hi>London</hi> for three hundred pounds, and that they ſhould not be conſtrained to go out of the City to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o fight, or defend the Land for any need. A priviledge greater, than what was claimed, as their liberty, in his Fathers days, when unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to engage againſt the Queen and Prince, they refuſed not to go out, on condition of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame day, as is related before. But the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40944:106"/>
moſt beneficial of all the grants was, that the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of the City ſhould not be ſeized into the Kings hands, but only for Treaſon or Rebellion done by the whole City. It having before been a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing to have their Liberties ſeized on, (as hath been plainly manifeſted in the Precedent Relation) on almoſt every petty diſguſt, conceived by the Court againſt them, were it but for the pretended offence of a particular Officer, or for mony alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be owing by the City to ſome great ones at Court, or ſome ſuch like ſmall trivial pretence. But now at this time they took ſuch care, to have their Liberties ſetled and ſecured by this Royal Grant, that it may be thought almoſt, if not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a thing impoſſible for the City to forfeit her Charter, and have it juſtly, according to that grant, taken from her. The bringing of <hi>Southwark</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Rule of the City, and the power allowed their Major to appoint ſuch a Bailiff there, as lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him beſt, was a very advantagious favour, at the ſame time, by this King <hi>Edward</hi> beſtowed on <hi>London,</hi> but not comparable with the former grant, which may moſt deſervedly be eſteemed Paramount to all others. A particular Officer may offend, and oftentimes does, nay many may; but for a City, a whole City, ſo great and glorious a City, as <hi>London,</hi> Traiterouſly to Rebel, and ſo forfeit all her Liberties, Priviledges, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes at one clap, ſeems to me ſo great a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as to imply little leſs than an Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in Nature, not to go a ſtep or two higher.</p>
            <p>This King being one of the moſt powerful Princes of his time, and in the ſtrength of his age very ſuccesful in his Wars againſt the French King, 'tis not for us haſtily to imagine, there was any occaſion given for ſo wiſe and good a King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40944:107"/>
with his Subjects, much leſs with his Loyal Citizens. We are rather to expect to hear of the City's Triumphs and glory, the Joy and rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherewith ſhe often received her Victorious King returning Conquerour from <hi>France,</hi> the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Juſtings, Tiltings, and Tournaments ſhewn thereat for his Recreation and entertainment, the Wealth, Riches, and Ability of her head Officers, (whereof one, to <hi>Londons</hi> great glory, is ſaid to have ſumptuouſly feaſted four Kings at once, in the thirty firſt of this Kings Reign, beſides the famous Black Prince, many Noble Knights and others, to whom with the King he gave many Rich Gifts) the ſplendor of the Citizens in general o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This King may be ſuppoſed too great and too good, either to create, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit differences and diſcord at home. He had wherewithal to exerciſe his Wiſdom and valour abroad in forreign Countries, and ſuch ſucceſs too in his Enterprizes, as might make him, both feared, and beloved, by his Subjects, at one and the ſame time. Yet notwithſtanding, ſuch ſtill was <hi>Londons</hi> power, ſtrength, and reſolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Liberties, that this Victorious Prince, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over others, having ſent out Juſtices into the Shires, to make enquiry about his Officers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and delinquences, and the City of <hi>London</hi> not ſuffering (as <hi>Stow</hi> tells us) any ſuch Officers to ſit, as Juſtices, in their City, as Inquiſitors of ſuch matters, contrary to their Liberties, he thought good rather to appoint thoſe Juſtices their Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the <hi>Tower,</hi> for Inquiſition of the damages of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and they refuſing, unleſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,

to anſwer there, and a tumult thereupon ariſing among the meaner ſort, claiming their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, he eſteemed it greater prudence, to wave the Juſtices ſitting, as to that place, and forgive all offences, than to enter into a conteſt with ſuch powerful, tho Loyal Subjects, as the <hi>Londoners</hi> were, and ſuch undaunted aſſertors of their own rights, priviledges, franchiſes and liberties. For as 'tis plain the City was very potent, ſo we may, as certainly perhaps, conclude the Citizens no leſs ſuſpicious of any thing done, under the ſhadow of this Kings Authority, if but looking towards the leaſt breach of their Priviledges, as the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in general ſeem to have appeared jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their Common liberty, when, upon this Kings laying claim to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> they procured a Law, whereby it was enacted, that the King ſhould not Rule <hi>England</hi> as King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo Subject them to the inſolencies of a fellow-Subjects Deputyſhip.</p>

But when was that, and how hapned it? 'Twas when the King was grown old, near to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, after his good Queen <hi>Philippa</hi> was dead, and he himſelf, amidſt the Infirmities of ſickneſs and old age, indulg'd his own luſtful pleaſures in the laſcivious Embraces of a wanton Miſs, leaving the guidance of his Realm, and all things about him, to ſo ambitious a ſpirit, as, under the Wings of his Authority, durſt aſpire ſo high as to the hopes of the Crown, againſt the good Will of the people, and the Title of a perſon much more affected and beloved at <hi>London.</hi> The conteſt was ſhort and ſharp, as may be ſeen in <hi>Stows</hi> Annals, where it is plac'd in the fifty firſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the laſt year of the Kings Reign: So ſhort, as not taking up the whole ſpace of time, between <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and the latter part of <hi>June,</hi> wherein the King died; and yet ſo ſharp, that the Cities Priviledges were in great danger, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces there were of depoſing the Major, (which was at length actually done,) and of Creating a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in his Room, with many other things threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt their Liberties: And all by the arts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> devices, and contrivances of the aſpiring Uncle,

who would fain have mounted up into the Throne of the Kingdom, over his young Nephews head, but that the <hi>Londoners</hi> oppoſed him in his deſigns, both honourably, and ſuccesfully too. So far were they from being Hector'd, or trapan'd, into a baſe Compliance with this Ambitious pretender, and his flattering favourites deſires, who thought to have carried all before 'em, becauſe they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd themſelves ſure of the Kings Authority, and ſo lookt upon the principals of the oppoſite party, if not under a Cloud, at leaſt under a great diſadvantage comparatively, ſuch were their fond hopes and pretenſions.</p>
            <p>In the good Parliament, (as it was commonly called) held in the fiftieth of this Kings Reign, ſeveral Reformations had been made, and divers, at the Commons ſuit, remov'd from about the King, as evil Counſellors, by the Mediation of the Black-Prince; but the Parliament being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he dying, the old King, contrary to his promiſe, ſoon recalled the former perſons, before removed, and Committed the Government of the Realm again to his third Son; <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> that aſpiring Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whereby the Tide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turn'd at Court, the ſtorm fell heavy upon ſome Patriots of the late Parliament, who had been the greateſt promoters and occaſioners of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whether or no it was to pull down the Engliſh Biſhops, the better to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate his own intents and purpoſes, that he was a favourer of the fam'd <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> (as <hi>Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a great Papiſt, and alſo a Monk, affirms) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence out of the Dukes ſinful Ambition raiſing Protection for the Maintainers of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or elſe that being convinced of the Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Doctrine to Truth and Godlineſs, He, like <hi>Herod,</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, and did many things at his inſtance, I ſhall not now pretend to determine. But moſt certain it is from the ſtory, that 'twas <hi>London,</hi> not the Engliſh Clergy, that put the greateſt ſtop to the Dukes aſpiring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and daſh'd all his Ambitious Intreagues in pieces, to his, and his Favourites no ſmall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Londoners</hi> being enraged at the Dukes threats, and their fury increaſed againſt him, for that in the Parliament, the Duke being Preſident, a motion had been made in the Kings name, (over whom at that time 'tis well known how great an aſcendant the Duke had) that there ſhould be no more Major of <hi>London,</hi> according to the Ancient Cuſtom, but a Captain appointed over it,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40944:110"/>
and the Marſhal of <hi>England</hi> might therein arreſt Offenders, as in other places, (ſo that 'twas in the Military Officers that the Duke ſeems to have plac'd moſt of his Truſt and Confidence, as doubtleſs his Creatures and Favourites in <hi>eſſe aut poſſe)</hi> with many other things manifeſtly contrary to the City's Liberties, at the encouragement of the Lord <hi>Fitzwalter</hi> (who claim'd to be their Standard Bearer by inheritance) they put themſelves in Arms, and acted with ſuch an exceſs of rage and violence, that had it not been for their own Biſhop, who pacified them for the time, the Duke and his great favourite <hi>Piercy</hi> had that day (ſaith the book) loſt their lives. But they having time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice, fled from the people, and applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſafety to the young Prince, and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who undertook the buſineſs, and ſent to the Londoners, to make peace with the Duke; ſo kind and gracious was the good Princeſs, as to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate in his behalf, who deſir'd in his heart to diſpoſſeſs her own Son of his right. To her Meſſenger Anſwer was return'd by the Citizens, that for her honour, they would perform her Commands, but as to what concern'd the Duke, injunctions were laid on them to will him, that he ſhould ſuffer the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to come to his anſwer, and to be try'd by his Peers, and alſo permit <hi>Peter de la More</hi> [Speaker of the laſt Parliament] then by the Duke's means imprison'd to anſwer for himſelf, after the Cuſtom of the Law; and as for the third, they ſaid they would account a Traitor, whereſoever he ſhould be found. So run the words in <hi>Stow,</hi> which being to the Duke reported, he became not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and not without reaſon in my opinion, at the Citizen's Anſwer, and their indignation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40944:110"/>
againſt him, ſince that he interpreted, what they had ſpoken of a Traytor to be meant by them of himſelf, though as to that particular he denied himſelf to be one. He had been mad, I ſhould have thought, or fooliſh, if he had preſently confeſs'd, and own'd the imputation. However, from the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens meſſage, and the Dukes interpretation thereof, 'tis eaſie to conclude, how little they lov'd him, and he ſoon found it to his trouble and vexation. Jealouſies and ſuſpicions generally go a great way among the common people, and are almoſt as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent as proofs, eſpecially when there is a great man in the Caſe, whom they dare not openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and impeach, and cannot try for lack of ſafety and a good opportunity, and he himſelf is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to put himſelf upon a fair trial, and thereby wipe-off all aſperſions in the common le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal way of his Country. All his Tergiverſations do foment, rather than diminiſh, the Heats of the people, who have but the more opportunity and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to think, (and will commonly too think ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily) the leſs they have to act.</p>
            <p>The rough Meſſage, the Londoners ſent the Duke, we have heard, but that was not all: They would away to the King too, and acquaint him with the late proceedings. And ſo accordingly, upon a Councel held thereabouts, they ſent ſome of their chief Citizens, either to juſtifie (ſaith the Annaliſt) or excuſe what had hapned. Long were theſe a ſuing to come to the Kings preſcnce, the Duke keeps them back: For they might be apt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o tell Tales, or at leaſt remove the prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherewith the Duke and his party doubt-leſs had fill'd the credulous King's Head. The Duke would fain have ſtopt their entrance, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40944:111"/>
put them off, but they would not be ſo ſerv'd. The Duke tells them, that the King was very ill at eaſe, and his ſickneſs might be encreaſt, if he were mov'd to anger by their Speech. A fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but 'twould not paſs. The <hi>Londoners</hi> were reſolved on't. They were not come to encreaſe, but mitigate his grief, and their Commiſſion from their fellow Citizens, they ſayd, was not to be Communicated to any, but to their Liege Lord the King himſelf. They were for no Proxies, Advocates, nor Attorney-Generals of the Dukes providing: They would be their own Spokeſmen. Well then, at laſt after much ado they gain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and ſhew the King, what had been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament, as his Will, againſt their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and priviledges: They excus'd likewiſe themſelves of ſome of the Commonalties behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the late Commotion, as being the effect of ſome ill men among the rabble, whereto they were, neither privy, nor conſenting; whereupon the King, a little cheer'd up with their coming, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that he would not the diminiſhing of their Liberties, No, he was rather ready, if need were, to augment them, neither did any ſuch Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ever come out of his Mouth, and therefore willed them not to fear, but to return and appeaſe the Citizens, and to keep them in Peace. The Dukes faction would have made uſe of the Kings Name and Authority, to deprive the City of her Charter of Liberties, and endeavour'd to perſwade the Parliament Men, that it was the Kings good Will and pleaſure to have it ſo; but, upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens application to the King, they hear an other tale, the King own'd no ſuch thing, never any ſuch thing came out of his Mouth, he tells them expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

by the chiefeſt and richeſt of the Citizens, the meaner commonalty diſdaining to be preſent at ſuch a proceſſion, and therefore with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion departing home, when they heard the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and knew the occaſion of their being call'd together. But neither did this condeſcention of the greateſt give the Duke content; he threatned them, look't upon it as a reproach, and took it in great ſcorn, that they had offer'd thus his Arms in a Wax Taper while he was alive, and in good health; notwithſtanding they affirm'd, they had expreſly done that which his Father, the King, had Commanded them, and would have done any thing, that might have pleaſed him, <hi>i. e.</hi> in reaſon. For peace and quietneſs ſake poſſibly, and out of reſpect to the Kings Majeſty, they would not have refus'd the trouble of putting forth a few honorary Proclamations, nor denied him the Complement of a volley or two of Holla's and Huzza's, if that would have pleas'd. But this did not anſwer the Dukes Expectations, nor ſatisfie his Ambitious deſires, they knew, he ſayd, his mind, and were not ignorant how to make ſatisfaction. Ay; there 'twas: He would have us, ſayd the troubled Citizens amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Proclaim him King, but this ſhall never be done, and ſo they parted worſe friends than they were before. So much ado was there with one proud, haughty Duke, moſt injuriouſly aſpiring to the Crown, to the prejudice of his better belov'd Nephew, whoſe claim, title, and right had been ſometime before (if I miſtake not in my reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſettled expreſly by the Parliament, or at leaſt he had been declar'd by his Grand-Father his Heir and Lawful Succeſſor; Yet this the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40944:114"/>
Uncle thought probably eaſily to have evaded and deluded, though beſides the affections, and contrary to the inclination of the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could he but have prevailed upon the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners,</hi> by threats, or fair words, to have ſided with him; But their oppoſition quite ſpoil'd the Game, and kept the Duke off the Cuſhion, a Duke ſtil, ſo Tryumphant were they in Power, Prudence, and Loyalty. Wherefore to ſatisfie his reſtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven geful Spirit, the Duke ceas'd not, till he had got the old Major put out, and a new one Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Aldermen depos'd, and others ſet in their places: So little did their late Complicance, and humble Proceſſion, avail them, while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty remain ſtiff, firm, and unſhaken, as well by the Dukes power and greatneſs, as by his Threats and Menaces. He had gain'd a great Aſcendent over the weak Kings affections, but yet for all that could not ſway this Honourable City to his Intereſts, and the Intereſt of his, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, Faction at Court.</p>
            <p>The Citizens Loyalty is plainly ſhewn, beyond denial, in Couragiouſly adhering to the Juſter claim and Title of the abus'd Nephew, and preferring his Birthright before the Pretenſions of his Uncle, who, Ruling the King and thoſe about him, thought alſo to have over-rul'd the City too. Their Prudence is manifeſt, in that they wiſely choſe to yield many things to the times, for peace ſake, but when neck and all was in danger, they would not budg a foot, nor ſtir one ſtep further, to humour all the Dukes in <hi>Kent</hi> or Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Neither is their power leſs conſpicuous, who not only dar'd, but did oppoſe this high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Duke in the Days of his Viſible Grandeur,

               </gap>hus entred upon the Government, it was thought good by the King, or thoſe about him, to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ome care taken to accommodate former differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, eſpecially ſuch as had hapned between this potent Duke and the more powerful City. Wherefore ſeveral perſons of Eminency were
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40944:115"/>
ſpeedily ſent to <hi>London,</hi> to ſalute the Citizens in the new King's name, and acquaint them, how the Duke in all things had ſubmitted himſelf to the Kings will, ('twas time, for 'tis certain he had loſt the day, though not perhaps his high-tow'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ambition) and that they ſhould do ſo in like manner, and then the King would endeavour a Reconciliation to the City's honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Fair words and large promiſes. But the worthy Citizens were not Birds to be caught with chaff, much leſs to be hamper'd in a Nooſe of their own making. They were for no Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it ſeems at Diſcretion, though to the deareſt Friend alive. They knew the King to be but young, and weak to help them in ſuch a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome buſineſs, if they ſhould ſo heedleſly deſert their own Cauſe, and put the ſtaff out of their own hands, by their own Conſent. They had ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies enough ſtill, they might think, at Court, as long as the Duke was there, and his flattering fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, who might poſſibly over-rule at leaſt, (if not over-aw) the King to their prejudice, ſhould they render all they had at pleaſure into his hand, by their own voluntary Act and Deed, when as they knew themſelves well able to defend their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and properties in a legal way, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding them upon ſo intire a ſubmiſſion, as was required, without Reſerve. Wherefore, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, this Medium was at length found out, that if the noble perſons, ſent to them with that meſſage, would be bound to the Citizens, that their ſubmiſſion ſhould not redound to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral loſs or bodily harm of any Citizen, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their City, they would gladly obey the King's Commandment. This thoſe eminent perſons
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40944:115"/>
of quality undertook by Oath, and upon their Knighthood: And ſo, upon this ſurety, away go the Citizens to Court, and being ſoon brought before the King, beſought him (as the Annaliſt words it) to reform the peace betwixt the Duke and them, affirming that they were ready in all things to ſubmit themſelves unto his will and pleaſure, not as though they confeſſed they had made any fault againſt the Duke, (conſider this) but as men that came at this time for the benefit of peace, and honour, as well to the King, as the Duke, to pacifie the hearts, and mitigate the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of both. That this was their intent is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough from their own requeſt before made to the King, that he would vouchſafe to make a good and profitable end of this diſcord. For that they fear'd not the Duke, is moſt certain from the precedent paſſages, and that they were all of a ſuddain fallen deeply in love with him and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I can hardly believe. No, no, They love the Nephew too well, to dote upon the Uncle; and may they always be ſo minded upon a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The Citizens having thus prudently (though we ſee not without great caution) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd themſelves to the King, the Duke readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of this form of peace (as not hoping poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for ſuch an other opportunity, nor expecting ſo honourable Conditions a ſecond time, if refus'd the firſt); and upon his knees became Interceſſor to the King, to take the cauſe in hand under the form by the Londoners expreſſed, and ſo a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was made between theſe two conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties, the Duke with an Oath promiſing them his friendſhip for the future, and in token thereof beſtowing a kiſs of peace upon each of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40944:116"/>
them before the King at the ſame time: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Citizens return'd home with joy and gladneſs, rejoycing that the Duke was brought to ſuch humility, who a little before had, in great Pride, demanded of them, for his favour, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Hogſheads of Wine, and an infinite number of precious Stones. So great a value did this high-flown Duke ſet upon his grace and favour, till the Citizens of this honourable City, by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and prudence, had brought down his haughty ſpirit a Peg or two lower: and that viſibly too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For we don't find him, as ambitious as he ſtill continued, ſo openly aſpiring to <hi>Englands</hi> Crown for the future, how ſucceſsfully ſoever his Son made a Rape thereon at the end of this Princes Reign, under the pretence of I know not what hidden right accruing to him from his Mother. We read indeed, I confeſs, in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Abridgment of the Records, that, in the ſeventeenth of this King, the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> laid ſeveral things to the Dukes charge, as not honourable for the King to ſuffer in him, nor fit for him to do, being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as that he went Arm in Arm with the King and his Men wear the ſame Livery the Kings did, (which ſeems to ſhew much of Arrogancy, and Ambition, to ſay no more) beſides ſome other Objections, but herein he was ſo far juſtified by the King himſelf, that the Earl was ordered to crave the Dukes Pardon in full Parliament, in a certain form of words appointed him. In <hi>Stows Annals</hi> alſo we meet with an Accuſation brought againſt him, in the ſeventh of this Kings Reign, tending to prove his intent and deſign ſuddainly to oppreſs the King, and take upon himſelf the Kingdom, but it ſeems little notice was taken
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40944:116"/>
of it by the King himſelf, who was to have loſt moſt, had it been attempted Succeſsfully, and doubtleſs as little believ'd; otherwiſe ſurely the <hi>Schedule,</hi> containing the time, place, and other Circumſtances, had not been preſently delivered into the Dukes hands, nor the accuſer committed at his requeſt to the charge of his near Kinſman, nor the occaſion of his violent Death ſo little inquired into afterwards. The Duke was not ſo powerful, nor ſo great a Terror, but the City was as well able ſtill to deal with him, and his whole party, and make as vigorous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as ever, in defence of their Soveraign Lord the King, if occaſion ſhould have offered it ſelf. This we have reaſon to believe was known in thoſe days to all the Nation, much more to the Duke himſelf, from former experience, who therefore may be ſuppos'd not any more to have aſpir'd openly, whatever ſecret fires of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay hidden within his breaſt; whether or no he deſign'd and attempted ought by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Plots and Conſpiracies, I leave to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader to believe or not, as he pleaſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking to or for in the caſe. Beſides the decree of an over-ruling Providence, Common equity in ſiding with what was reputed the juſter title, natural humanity in defending the young and weak, and a well grounded affection to the Prince, for his Father and Grand-Fathers ſake, (one the famous Black Prince, the other the Glorious <hi>Edward</hi> the third their King and Sovereign,) we may conclude the generality of the Citizens had the greater averſion to the Duke and his faction, becauſe he was a known favourer of <hi>Wickliff</hi> and his Doctrines, (whether on a good

As indeed for many of the ages paſt, from our ever-bleſſed Saviours Birth, through which I have drawn the thread of this diſcourſe, and under the ſucceeding Kings, for above an hundred years, Popery continued the National Religion, under the power and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of which perſwaſion was the body of the Citizens bred up, who prov'd ſo famous in their Generations for their powerful influence on the grand concerns of the Nation, in every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able turn and change of the times before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: And when <hi>England</hi> was made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with this bleſſed alteration, the Cities Power, Strength, and Eſteem remain'd the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as ever, the change of her Religion intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing no change therein, unleſs for the better, ſhe encreaſing proportionably in every age in Wealth, Riches and Honour, as the Nation grew ſtronger and ſtronger: And ſtill continues as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conſpicuous under Proteſtantiſm, as before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Romiſh Faith; a thing eaſy to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in due time and place.</p>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40944:118"/>
of the Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> revis'd by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Prynne</hi> Eſq;, that, in the firſt Parliament of this King in his firſt year, among other Petitions of the Commons, there is to be found one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diviſion, under the Title of Petitions for the City of <hi>London,</hi> wherein the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons become expreſs Petitioners (ſo great was the Cities influence over their Debates, and ſo high a reſpect had they for her) to the King for many conſiderable Grants in favour of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and to them very advantagious and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial: As that all their Liberties may be confirm'd with a <hi>Non obſtante:</hi> That they attend upon no Commandment of any of the Kings Officers, but only at the Kings Sute, Sealed with the Great or Privy Seal, except the Kings Juſtices, according to their Charter: That they ſhall by themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Cuſtoms and impoſitions hapning or ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the City: That the Major and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain for the time being ſhall have the keeping of the City Orphans Lands and Goods; [No ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in thoſe times, when the Court of Wards was in being, and greatly beneficial ſtill, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Deceits many poor Orphans meet with from Cheating, or Inſolvent Guardians and Truſtees, whereas the City's ſecurity is unqueſtionable and her Credit not in the leaſt to be doubted of:] That the Interpretation of any word or Sentence touching their ſaid Liberties, which may ſeverally be taken, may be taken according to the intent and Claim of the ſaid Citizens: That the City may enjoy all ſuch Liberties as any other Town in the Realm, if they have any other than the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens have; That no protection Royal be allowed in Debt, Account or Treſpaſs, wherein a Freeman
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40944:118"/>
of <hi>London</hi> is ten pounds, with ſeveral others: By the Anſwers whereunto we find the Kings Will was, that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſhould in no wiſe be reſtrained of any of their Liberties or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtoms approv'd: Such as were moſt uſeful, and advantagious at the preſent time, were by his Majeſty granted, and if any appear to have been denyed, the denyal ſeems rather condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, than plain and direct in down right terms: So cautious was the King in his Anſwers, ſo careful not to diſpleaſe this powerful Coporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo well advis'd, as not to ſhew himſelf Ungrateful at his firſt coming to the Crown, to thoſe, who had ſo Cordially erewhile eſpous'd his intereſt, and ſo ſtoutly defended his cauſe but a little before.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth of this King, at the requeſt of the Commons the Abridgment tells us, it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould enjoy all ſuch Liberties, as they had in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, or as were to them confirm'd by the King now; and that Victuallers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the ſeventh we find it among the Commons Petitions enacted, that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> ſhall enjoy all their whole Liberties whatſoever, with this Clauſe, <hi>licet uſi non fuerunt, vel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>buſi fuerunt,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Statute to the Contrary. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then 'tis poſſible for any Corporate body, endowed with ſo tranſcendent Priviledges by the publick Act and Deed of the known Legiſlators of the Land, to forfeit and loſe them all of a ſudden, Judge ye. At the ſame time we read of a grant made by the ſame Authority, that the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40944:119"/>
Mayor and Aldermen ſhould take no other Oath in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> than they did in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third. How careful were the Commons, do we ſee in this Age, to prevent the Citizens from being enſlav'd in either their Bodies or their Souls? They ſha'nt be impos'd upon, by their good Wills, in ſo much as an Oath, much leſs have Creeds, Articles and Oaths, by the dozens thruſt upon them to Swear and ſubſcribe to. In the ſame year we have the Commons pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning the King again in the Cities behalf, (ſo Sollicitous were they for her good and welfare) That free choice may be made of the moſt able men for Aldermen, as well of ſuch as were the year before, as of others yearly. See we here the Houſe of Commons pleading for a free choice, an Election without diſturbance, threats, or menaces, and that particular Citizens ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon, nor overaw'd: And if they had formerly choſen good Men, and found them ſo by experience, that they ſhould not be oblig'd next year to paſs them by, and chooſe others, ſuch as poſſibly might prove friends to them the backward way, and over the left ſhoulders. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors might pick and chooſe as they pleaſe, which is the benefit of a free Election. And as the Commons pray, ſo the King grants, as long as there is good Government in the City thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What could be deſir'd more? As long as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen were lyable to be paſs'd by every year, as well as the Common-Council-Men, 'tis very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that they ſhould diſpleaſe the City, much leſs thwart and contradict the Common voice o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis not the place that makes our <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Conventions ſo mindful of her, but her Merit, her Power, her Influence, the reſpect and eſteem they have for her Glory, Honour and Renown, to ſee her ever continue, the fixt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable Defendreſs of the Proteſtant Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Defender of the Faith.</p>
            <p>In the Ninth, the Commons require, at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Mayor and Commonalty of <hi>London,</hi> that the Patent lately made to the Conſtable of the <hi>Tower</hi> may be Revok'd. The reaſon is plain, 'twas prejudicial to the City, to have the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als brought to her, upon her deareſt and beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Thames,</hi> made to pay Toll and Cuſtom to another. How Glorious and Gracious muſt we needs think that City to be in the peoples Eyes, when we find their Repreſentatives, not once nor twice, but ſo conſtantly, almoſt at every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, pleading her Cauſe, vindicating her Liberties, and aſſerting her Rights? And theſe we know are part of the Legiſlative power. A general act of Oblivion is a Royal Grant not every day beſtow'd upon the Subject, and a grace not often obtain'd without much importunity and interceſſion. We have reaſon therefore to believe the Londoners look't upon it as no ſmall favour, that at the Common's requeſt the King granted a Pardon to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> in the Eleventh of his Reign, of all Treaſons, Felonies, and other offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of loſs of life. For ſo Pardons run, whether the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40944:120"/>
parties were guilty of ſuch crimes and delinquences, or not; and 'tis a ſalvo that Wiſe men diſdain not ſometimes to make uſe of, and why ſhould they not, unleſs a Pardon muſt of neceſſity imply a Crime?</p>
            <p>We have heard how careful the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were, under this King, to ſecure the Cities Liberties, aſcertain her Rights, defend her Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and keep off encroachments, that ſhe might not be abus'd nor impos'd on: Let me next have leave, before I paſs forwards, to give a hint or two to intimate, how ready the Commons were to free the City from Annoyances, in order both to the Citizens health and the Cities Ornament, that nothing offenſive, either to the Eyes or the Noſtrils, might be found therein. 'Tis to be ſeen Enacted, among the Commons Petitions in the ſixteenth of this King, that all the filth upon <hi>Thames</hi> ſide, in a certain place there mentioned, be utterly remov'd againſt a ſhort time particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd: That the Butchers of <hi>London</hi> build con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Houſes, to hold whatſoever they had noiſome in their Calling, thence in due time to be carried in Boats into the middle of the <hi>Thames</hi> at high-water, there to be caſt at it's beginning to Ebb, ſo to be born away with the Tide. And that no Rubbiſh or the like be caſt into <hi>Thames</hi> between <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and the <hi>Tower</hi> on a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able forfeiture. Small ſlight trivial matters ſome may haply think theſe to be, and not worth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a remark: Yet to me it ſeems a manifeſt ſign of the Citizens care and eſteem, the Houſe of Commons reſpect for them, and the influence the City had upon their debates, that they ſhew'd themſelves ſo willing and ready, at all times, to take into more eſpecial conſideration the ſlighteſt
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40944:120"/>
and minuteſt things, ſo it came recommended to them from the City of <hi>London,</hi> or appeared in their Eyes advantagious to her Inhabitants: And that theſe had an equal ſhare in making Laws with the Lords, or even with the King himſelf, is as evident as the ſhining of the Sun in a hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers-day.</p>
            <p>From the Commons let us paſs to the King and Lords joyntly conſider'd. For the eſteem the Lords had for the City, when lookt upon as ſingle in themſelves, and not expreſly united with the King, may beſt be ſhewn either when we come to touch upon the Civil diſtractions of theſe times, whereof the whole Nation were partakers, or the more immediate afflictions of the City in particular, (as ſome we may be ſure they had in a General Del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge of miſeries) my Subject being as yet principally of Proceedings and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions carried on in a Parliamentary way, that is or ought to be, in meekneſs and calmneſs. What I have chiefly to obſerve here is in plain words out of the Abridgment of the Records Relating to the Parliament of the ſeventeenth of this King, where we read it enacted, that it is not the Kings meaning or intent, nor meaning of the Statute made in the twenty eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, (touching Errors and miſpriſions in the City of <hi>London)</hi> that the Mayors, Sheriffs and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of <hi>London,</hi> that now are, heretofore have been, or hereafter ſhall be, ſhould incur, or bear the pain contained in the ſaid Statute, for any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Judgment given, or to be given in the ſaid City. This is one of the three Acts there noted, to be enacted by the King, by the aſſent of the Lords only: And therefore makes good my
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40944:121"/>
aſſertion of the reſpect ſhewn the City by the King and Lords, as may be made to appear more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious by giving the Reader the ſubſtance of the forecited Statute, ſtill to be ſeen, among the Printed Statutes, in the twenty eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, Chapter tenth, where we find it ordain'd and eſtabliſhed, that the Mayor, Sheriffs and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, which have the Governance of the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſhall cauſe to be redreſſed and corrected the defaults errors and miſpriſions above named, and the ſame duly puniſh from time to time upon a certain Pain: That is to ſay, at the firſt default a thouſand Marks to the King, and at the ſecond default two thouſand Marks, and at the third default that the Franchiſe and Liberty of the City be taken into the Kings hand: And it is likewiſe enacted, that enquiries ſhall be made of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults by Enqueſts of people of theſe Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Suſſex, Hertford, Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Berks:</hi> And the receiving and execution of the Writs, as well Originals as Judicials, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Conſtable of the <hi>Tower,</hi> or his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, in place of the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> ſo runs the Statute: Whence occaſion might ſeem likely enough to be taken, one time or other, by the Cities deſigning adverſaries, to Hector the Mayor Sheriffs and Aldermen into compliance, by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſue that Act upon them, or opportunity given to treacherous friends, (foſter'd within her Walls, bred up under the ſhadow of her wings, rais'd and enrich'd through the benefit of her Franchiſes and Priviledges, and crept into Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by the overflowings of her favour) for a lick or two at the publick hony-pot, wilfully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the forfeitures, that her Liberties might be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40944:121"/>
ſeiz'd, and her good old Charter, as far as in them lies, wholly loſt. But ſuch an Honourable reſpect had both the King and his Nobles at that ſeaſon for this moſt deſerving City, and ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appear'd ſhe in their Eyes, that they ſeem in a manner reſolv'd, as well as highly deſirous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their power, to prevent the very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſuch ill conſequences by this favourable interpretation, that after-ages might not rue for the overſights of former times, if they could help it. For this rather looks like an explanation of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute than a Repeal, an Act Declaratory of their good Will and intentions, more than a reſult of the whole Legiſlative power of the Nation; here being only the King and his Lords aſſent mention'd, and not a word of the Commons. And yet poſſibly this Declaration may amount to little leſs than a vertual, tho not a formal repeal, if it be joyntly conſider'd with what hath been before related, in the ſeventh of this Kings Reign, concerning the Clauſe, <hi>licet uſi non fuerunt, vel abuſi fuerunt,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Statute to the contrary, to be found enacted among the Commons Petitions of that year, in favour of the Cities Liberties. So that upon this account we find Authority in every part of it concurring in the point. And that it was in favour of the City in General, as well as in behalf of particular perſons, is plain from the ſenſe and ſubſtance of the original Statute, and the conſequential adjuncts thereto belonging. But if any one ſhall think this concluſion will not clearly follow from the premiſes, I don't think but I am able to prove it undeniably (as to the part at leaſt of ſeveral of the Lords) from Statute Law: As ſtrong an aſſurance, as we Engliſh-men
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40944:122"/>
can expect, as being the boundary of our Lives and Liberties, and giving us the ſecurity of all we enjoy, or can properly call our own. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is to be found in the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, Chapter <hi>15th.</hi> where after a recital of the before-mention'd Statute of 28 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. (though through a miſtake or miſprint, it is ſaid there to to be made in the ſeven and twentieth year) we find as follows; <q>Our Lord the King conſidering the good and lawful behaviour of the Mayor, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and Aldermen, and all the Commonalty of the City of <hi>London</hi> towards him, and therefore willing to eaſe and mitigate the Penalty aforeſaid by the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons aforeſaid, hath ordained and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, that the penalty aforeſaid, as well of the thouſand Marks, and of the two thouſand Marks, and of the Seiſure of the Franchiſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the ſame Statute, ſhall not be limited in a certainty, but that the Penalty in this Caſe be by the advice and diſcretion of the Juſtices thereto aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</q> To mitigate it doubtleſs, not inhance it at pleaſure, to ruin particular perſons and annihilate the City's Liberties, by pretending the loſs of her Charter.</p>
            <p>How reſpectful King, Lords and Commons, in Parliament aſſembl'd, ſhew'd themſelves to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable City hath been ſufficiently declar'd, prov'd, and made manifeſt, I preſume, already in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Relation. Let us now call off our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from this particular point, and fix our thoughts upon an other Argument, highly demonſtrative of the City's power, drawn from no leſs uncouth a Topick than tumults and diſorders, inſurrections and Outrages of unruly people. There having
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40944:122"/>
paſs'd an Act of Parliament in the fourth of this King, to impower him to Collect and Gather Poll money throughout the Land, and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions thereupon, and incivilities being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the new Collectors and other Officers, (ſome of the Courtiers having procur'd the Kings Commiſſions for a review, and a more exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, under the notion of the Kings being cheated and defrauded through the unfaithfulneſs of his former Tax gatherers) the Commons thought themſelves ſo abus'd and oppreſs'd, that in many places they took Counſel together to make reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and in ſeveral Counties aſſembled themſelves in great numbers, to the no ſmall diſturbance of the Land. Amongſt theſe the Commons of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> are reckon'd the greateſt bodies, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together under ſuch heads, as <hi>Wat Tyler, Jack Straw,</hi> and the like obſcure Fellows. Theſe we find quickly coming to <hi>London,</hi> where they ſoon obtain entrance, notwithſtanding the Mayors intended op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and then quickly carry all before them, behead whom they thought good, do what they would, burn great mens Palaces at their Pleaſure, the Gates of the <hi>Tower</hi> are ſet open to them, the King rides to'm in fear, unarm'd, and ill guarded, at their ſending for, and grants them as large Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they deſired, none of his Courtiers daring to oppoſe or reſiſt their Inſolencies, ſo that they ſeem to have had all things for a ſmall ſeaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſole Power, Direction, and Command, as remaining Maſters of the Field, without a ſtroak ſtricken by any oppoſite Party: ſuch a terrour did their numbers and boldneſs ſtrike into mens minds at the firſt, and ſo effectual was their ſucceſs in getting within the Walls of <hi>London:</hi> either through
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40944:123"/>
the joynt aſſiſtance of many Commons there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting, or elſe rather under the repute of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole City at their beck. But when the firſt brunt was over, and it was viſible, that the greateſt, beſt, and moſt of the Citizens joyn'd not with the Country Commons, to approve or abet them in their furious outrages and violences, the tide was ſoon turn'd, and deliverance brought, both to the King and Court, by the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of this Loyal City. The Mayor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as their Head, made the firſt open begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was ſeconded by his Brethren the Aldermen, and quickly followed by the worthy Citizens. He being a man of great boldneſs, by the Kings permiſſion, firſt arreſted, and afterwards grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded one of the chiefeſt of the Rebells, <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> ſaith <hi>Fabian, Wat Tyler,</hi> ſaith <hi>Stow,</hi> to the great encouragement of thoſe about the King, (among whom this Arch Rebel receiv'd his death) and daunting of the Rebellious Commons; to which valiant Deed the City is indebted for <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi> Dagger, ſome ſay, inſerted upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in her Coat of Arms. After this Act away rides the Mayor with one Servant only (the Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt tell us) into the City, and crying out to the Citizens to come ſpeedily to the Kings aſſiſtance, raiſes a conſiderable ſtrength, who well arm'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leading of Sir <hi>Robert Knowles,</hi> came in good time into the Field, where the King was, among the tumultuous Commons, not ſo well attended, but that the unexpected coming of the Mayor, and the armed Citizens, is expreſly ſaid to have caus'd rejoycing in the minds of the King, and thoſe few Knights and Eſquires then about him; and the Iſſue acquaints us with the great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40944:123"/>
hereof, when we read of the Commons throwing down their weapons immediately, falling alſo themſelves upon the ground, and beſeeching pardon, who but a little before gloried, that they had the Kings life in their own power, and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly might have continued boaſting, had not the Citizens thus rous'd up themſelves to the Kings relief, and timely diſpers't theſe ſeditious Rioters in the midſt of their inſulting Pride. That this was a piece of Loyalty, as well as valour, moſt timely and ſeaſonably ſhewn, is evident, from the great influence what was but barely done at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> though without <hi>London</hi>'s conſent, had upon the Countrey. For from the Annaliſt we are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to underſtand, that there were the like Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> and in expreſs words told, that theſe overthrew Houſe and Mannors of great Men, and of Lawyers, ſlew the Students of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the manner of them at <hi>London,</hi> having for their Captain an ungracious Prieſt, nam'd <hi>John Wraw,</hi> who had been at <hi>London</hi> juſt before, had ſeen what was done there, and came thence with Inſtructions from <hi>Wat Tyler.</hi> So that what's done in the City is very likely to be imitated in the Countrey. A diſorderly Rout of people were got together round about and within the City, and committed many unſufferable Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and ſeveral parts of the Country were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to follow the Faſhion, and do the like. The Citizens courage quel'd theſe Tumultuous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in <hi>London,</hi> and then they were quickly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, we hear, in other Places. Then had the King reaſon to reward the Mayor, and ſeveral Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, with the honour of Knighthood and other recompences, and time to aſſemble an Army of his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40944:124"/>
Loyal Friends and Subjects at <hi>London,</hi> to guard him, till the Principals of theſe diſperſed Rebels were brought to condign Puniſhment by Law, which was quickly done, thanks to the worthy Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who had thus vigorouſly aſſerted the Kings Right, defended his Royalty, reſcued his Perſon, and regained him the exerciſe of his Kingly Power, well near loſt before, through the Rebellion of his meaner Commons, and cowardly Fainthearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Courtiers; Men it ſeems that could ſpeak big at the Council-board, and talk high upon the Bench, under the ſhelter of the Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but when they were to come into the Field of War, to fight for their Prince, they prov'd meer Courtiers, all words and no deeds. The Citizens were the Men of valour. They lay ſtill, the King was like to be undone, and the Court ruin'd. They appear'd to oppoſe the vaunting Enemies, they fled before them, and the King regain'd his own.</p>
            <p>This one famous City, the terror of her Enemies, the joy of her Friends, cooperates in the grand turns and changes of affairs in the Brittiſh world, or elſe ſuch attempts, for the moſt part at leaſt, if not always, prove vain, fruitleſs, and inſignificant. And where's the wonder of this? The whole City, as a compact Body with Strength and Beauty fitly united, may well be eſteemed moſt amiable, and counted highly powerful, ſince ſhe is to be admired for the goodneſs and greatneſs (under which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the large Riches, Power and Spirit) of particular Citizens incorporated into Her. For the firſt, let me inſtance in the commendable diligence of her Mayor <hi>Adam Baume,</hi> who, upon a very great ſcarcity of Corn in the fifteenth of this King,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40944:124"/>
providently took care to have Corn brought to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>don</hi> from forreign Parts, to the relief of the whole Realm; and add hereunto the Charity of the Aldermen, who, for the furtherance of ſo good a Work, laid out each of them a ſum of mony, in thoſe days very conſiderable, to the ſame purpoſe, and beſtow'd the Corn thus procur'd in convenient places, where the Poor might buy at an appointed price, and ſuch, as had no ready mony, upon Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pay the year following, beſides the common Act of the Mayor and Citizens in taking two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Marks out of the Orphans Cheſt in <hi>Guildhall</hi> for the ſame intent. In Proof of the later, <hi>viz.</hi> The Greatneſs, Riches, Power and Spirit of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Citizens, I challenge all the Cities in the world beſides, to ſhew me ſuch another Example, as that of <hi>John Philpot</hi> Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Orator to this King in the beginning of his Reign, who in the ſecond year, obſerving the young Kings inability, the Nobles neglect, and the oppreſſions of the poor Commons; voluntarily hir'd Souldiers with his own mony, rig'd out a Fleet at his own charge, and hazarded his own Perſon, to defend the Realm from Pirates, Robbers, and incurſions of Enemies, and therewith ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took in a little time <hi>Mercer</hi> the Scot with all his Ships, which he had before violently taken from <hi>Scarborow,</hi> and fifteen Spaniſh Ships beſides laden with much Riches, which came to his Aid. Can <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf ſhew me a like Parallel? As for the <hi>Fabij,</hi> they were a whole Family among the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and <hi>Craſſus</hi> himſelf a great Magiſtrate in the heigth of that Common-wealths Grandeur amidſt Equals and Inferiors, whereas this publick-ſpirited Perſon liv'd ſtill a Subject, under a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40944:125"/>
none of the greateſt nor the ſtrongeſt then in the World. This noble Act ſome would have thought ſhould have deſerved great praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and ſo it had among the Common People, but among the great Lords and Earls it met with Reproach and Detraction, as being a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reproof of their careleſneſs and negligence, and he himſelf was endanger'd thereby, they ſpeaking openly againſt it, as done unlawfully without the Councel of the King and his Realm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign could not be denyed to have been very honeſt in the general. Had he ſuffered for that unpreſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Act, becauſe it was deficient in ſome formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required by Law, the Stateſmen of the times, therein inſtrumental, without all peradventure had appeared as odious in the Eyes of the Commons, as ſome of the chief Epiſcopal Clergy-men, in a Proteſtant Country, within the Memory of Man, would have made themſelves obnoxious to the Peoples Cenſure, ſhould they have publickly burnt <hi>Vindiciae Pietatis, i. e.</hi> a Vindication of Godlineſs from the imputation of folly and fancy, (which I have heard intimated as if thought of) becauſe it wanted ſuch an Imprimatur as the Law demanded, and was writ poſſibly by an Author not altogether Epiſcopal in his declared Judgment.</p>
            <p>But to paſs on, If ſuch were the ſuperemient and ſupererogating Acts of particular Citizens ſo many Ages ago, to what an height of Wealth, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſplendor muſt we needs think the City to have arriv'd at this day, ſome Centuries of years ſince that time? If ten thouſand Pounds was a Mayors Eſtate heretofore, we may give a ſhrew'd gueſs at the Cities advancement and encreaſe in Riches ſince, now that the ſame is made the limited ſum, for
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40944:125"/>
the Citizens to ſwear themſelves not worth, who deſire to avoid the chargeable Honour, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable charge, of the Shrievalry. Nay, to go a ſtep or two further, now adays we find her Sheriffs Revenue commonly reputed at double the value, and others of her Citizens thought able to number their thouſands by ſcores. What if I had alſo added, that ſome are eſteem'd ſo wealthy, as not to know an end of their Riches? Certainly ſuch, if any, muſt needs come under the denomination of men vaſtly rich in worldly goods. So that this glorious and Triumphant City ſeems in many things able to vy with, if not out-vy, the <hi>Quondam</hi> Miſtreſs of the World, <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf. She exceeds her in Antiquity, as being founded (in <hi>Fabian</hi>'s Compute) above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before her, and hath this advantage of her now, that whereas <hi>Rome</hi> is confeſt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be in the wane of her power and Greatneſs, both as to her Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Authority, <hi>London</hi> ſtill continues on the riſing hand. <hi>Rome</hi> 'tis viſible hath ſuffer'd a conſiderable dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, as to her former extent and Jurisdiction, in both capacities, whether ſhe be lookt upon, as, once head of the world, or now pretended head of the Church, but <hi>London</hi> plainly appears to be dayly getting ground both in Fame and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as building: And whereto ſhe may come in time, belongs to a Prophet not an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to declare. She is already become the Fam'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of this our little World, and <hi>Rome</hi> was but Empreſs in a greater: Neither was ſhe anear ſo influential over the greateſt part of that, how much ſoever thereof ſhe had under her Dominion, as <hi>London</hi> is known to be at preſent over all ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:40944:126"/>
Having thus ſhewn the influence this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able City had upon the Commons of this Land in Peace and amidſt tumultuous diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the great reſpect both King and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in Conjunction had for her, I ſhould now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to diſengage my ſelf of an obligation, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, lying on me, from part of a promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made, to declare the eſteem the Lords, when ſingly conſider'd, had of her ſtrength and power. But before I paſs on more immediately thereto, I crave leave to obſerve the great variety and difference in Parliamentary tranſactions and proceedings under this King, within the compaſs of whoſe Reign we find but two years on Record, <hi>viz</hi> the nineteenth and twenty ſecond, wherein there was not a Parliament called and aſſembled in one place or other by his Authority, ſometimes oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo thoſe Acts of <hi>Edward</hi> the third were exactly kept for eighteen years running, <hi>wherein it is ordained and eſtabliſhed, that a Parliament ſhall be holden once every year, and more often if need be,</hi> which being omitted but one year in twenty one, and not obſerved in the twenty ſecond, we may eaſily think it prov'd fatal to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate King, that in the next Parliament he ſhould be depos'd by his own Subjects and the Crown ſet upon anothers head. And is it any wonder, to ſee things ſo injurious and unjuſt ſometimes done in National Aſſemblies, when in a vein of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction they make Ordinances ſo diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite each to other, as was done in this Kings time? For we find parties mutually claſhing in publick, and what was ordain'd in one Parliament for the Commons good (as was then pretended) by an other repealed in favour of the other ſide,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40944:126"/>
former Laws Annull'd, Pardons revok't, Grants recall'd, and new puniſhments inflicted for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d offences. And yet in an other Revolution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very ſmall ſpace of time, the laſt Parliaments Acts were caſher'd and thrown out of doors to make room for the revival and Eſtabliſhing the Elder Parliament Statutes. Such changes were then Rung, and ſo much conteſting between Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and Prerogative, as if the differences were wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly and altogether irreconcilable, or at leaſt made to ſeem ſo by ſome mens poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to carry on their own more particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues. And therefore, when fair words were fear'd not likely to prevail, Arms were prepar'd to force, and there was danger o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ving Swords drawn, Bows bended, and Arrows ſhot for the promoting the deſigns on foot.</p>
            <p>But of all Statutes, Acts, Ordinances, Laws, and Grants, moſt memorable and obſervable is the Petition of the Commons, and the Anſwer thereto given, in the Parliament begun at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, April 25th.</hi> in the ſecond of this Kings Reign. The Petition is to be ſeen among the Commons Petitions in <hi>Cottons</hi> Abridgment of the Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſo often mention'd, and Printed 1657. pag. 169. <hi>Tit.</hi> 28. in theſe words, That Anſwer reaſonably may be given to all their Petitions now, or hereafter to be moved; and that Statutes be thereupon made before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of every Parliament. The Anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to runs thus, ſuch Bills as Remedy cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be had but in Parliament, reaſonable Anſwer ſhall be thereto made before ſuch Departure. Now we are to underſtand, that Petitions, in the old, are Bills, according to the new Stile, which in this Parliament were thus ordained to be produc'd at
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40944:127"/>
leaſt for the Royal Aſſent, if not to be paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly into Laws. So that if the Houſes were ſo minded, by ſtraining this grant to its utmoſt bounds (though perhaps further than was deſign'd at the firſt) 'twas no hard matter for them to ſit e'n as long, in a manner, as they pleas'd; and the old King of late Memory, his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Royal Father, may hereby very eaſily be vindicated from the Cenſures of thoſe undutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who pretend to blame his conduct, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, if not condemn, his Judgment for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the continuing Act in the Parliament of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby he more plainly and immediately put the diſſolution thereof out of his own hands; whereas before he had been haply lyable to have been trickt out of it, with greater affront to his Prerogative, by the quirks that nimble wits would have been apt enough at that conjuncture, to have ſtarted out of this Grant. For what would not they have attempted in that poſture of affairs, who actually did ſo much afterwards by the noiſe of an Ordinance, a term new to the vulgar, but weil enough known (though poſſibly never in that uſe and extent before) to the Learned Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who can eaſily inform the Queſtioniſt, out of the Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that in the thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third they met with the name and nature in a demand of the Chancellors to the whole Eſtates, whether they would have ſuch things as they agreed on, to be by way of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or of Statute; and in the Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to made, by way of Ordinance, with this reaſon then and there given, that they might amend the ſame at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>If we wonder at this grant, which ſeems to trail after it ſuch inconveniencies to the Regal Power,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40944:127"/>
as were before hinted, or at leaſt might be made an Inlet to pretences, as prejudicial to the Royal Prerogative, we are to underſtand, that this was obtain'd in the Kings Nonage, though not perhaps in times abſolutely factious, for I don't read but that things were carried then calmly and quietly enough. But when the King came to full Age, then we may obſerve that he or his boſome Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, were not well pleaſed with this or other Grants, that confined the Regal Power within ſtricter Boundaries, than their own deſires pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to like, and therefore there was ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amain to remove the ancient Landmarks, and the Court effected it at laſt for a ſhort ſpace, but with ſo ill an event, that the iſſue proved as fatal to the King himſelf, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſ counterplottings had been d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtructive to many others before. People hereupon may ſay what they think fit, and paſs their Verdicts as they pleaſe: But can any blame that mans Will and Deſire, to diſintangle himſelf from Fetters and Chains, who thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf born free, and ſo would fain live according to his own pleaſure and good liking? 'Tis his Judgment rather, that is to be queſſioned, when it ſuggeſts to him, that he may command, and ought to be obeyed, in ſuch things where no obedience was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore due, by nature, or conſent; and the goodneſs of his Intellectuals are liable to be doubted of, when they make him to fancy he may be abſolute, where known Laws and long continued Cuſtom hath authoriz'd the contrary.</p>
            <p>Such ſeems to have been <hi>Englands</hi> Caſe of old, where the Subjects have oft put on Arms to prevent encroachments upon their dearly belov'd, and many times dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to his full Age, when ſeveral of the Barons, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> his Uncle, thought it their main intereſt and concern, to ſpeak high and look big, with Armour on their backs and Swords by their ſides, though it ſubjected them to much ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>quy and diſpleaſure at Court, and brought themſelves and all theirs into much hazard and danger. But this it ſeems they little thought of, or as little valued: That the Court highly reſented the actings of ſuch, as indeavoured in Parliament time to bring ſome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The King calls all the High Sheriffs of the Counties before him, and demands, what ſtrength they could make for him againſt the Lords, if there ſhould be occaſion? But they anſwered, that the Common People did ſo favour the Lords, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them to be loyal and true to the King, that it was not in their power to raiſe any great Force againſt them. Then they were commanded to take care, that no Knight nor Burgeſs ſhould afterwards be choſen to any Parliament, but thoſe whom the King and Council ſhould name; whereto they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, It was an hard matter, in thoſe times of Jealouſy and Suſpicion, to deprive the People of their ancient Liberties in chooſing their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives. Then were the Judges conſulted, (Men,

            <p>After this was my Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to give an account, how many able men he could raiſe in the City? who anſwered, that he thought they could make fifty thouſand men at an hours warning: But when he went about it in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, the Citizens cried out, they would never fight againſt the Kings Friends, and the Defenders of the Realm. Then were there endeavours pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily to apprehend the oppoſing Lords ſingly by themſelves, but this deſign was diſappointed, and the Lords were quickly up in Arms to defend themſelves. When theſe devices would not hold water, by the interpoſition of Mediators it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the Lords ſhould come to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the King upon a day appointed them, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality and Credit taking Oaths on the Kings part, that no fraud or deceit ſhould be uſed, whereupon the Lords prepared themſelves to come up according to agreement, but ſoon ſtopt their Journy, upon notice given them of an Ambuſment laid for them in the <hi>Mews,</hi> which made the King ready almoſt to tax them of breach of Covenant, till he was told the reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ambuſment
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40944:129"/>
laid for them, and then to clear himſelf (as <hi>Stow</hi> relates it) ſware he knew of no ſuch thing. He might poſſibly be as innocent as the Child unborn, as to any particular knowledge of this matter, but certainly his Courtiers were much to blame, and very bold, thus to act in direct oppoſition to the former Agreement; for that there was ſuch a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous piece o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When theſe tricks would not do, then fair words and promiſes were come in faſhion again, to ſooth up the angry Lords, who at laſt were come to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with a ſufficient Guard of Attendants, and in the upſhot the ſpeedy calling of a Parliament was concluded on, where the Accuſers and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed might meet face to face. But the favourite Lords durſt not attend the conſequence of ſuch a Meeting, and therefore the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reſt of the Faction, left the Court to be out of the way, and an Army was after raiſed to conduct the Duke up to Court, with which he haſted as faſt as he could towards <hi>London,</hi> but was miſerably overthrown at <hi>Radcoat Bridge</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> by the conteſting Lords, and ſo e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Upon this defeat the Lords thought they had matter enough to juſtifie their Arms; with forty thouſand men up come they to <hi>London</hi> and were there received, the King then keeping his Chriſtmas in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to whom they ſhew the Letter he had ſent to the aforeſaid Duke to raiſe an Army for their deſtruction, and the Letters the French King had written to him to come into <hi>France,</hi> there to do acts to his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40944:129"/>
and the Kingdoms. Theſe things we may well conclude bred a great deal of ill blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his Lords, and that their Pulſes beat extraordinary high is plain from the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory meſſage they ſent the King, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his mind was alter'd as to keeping his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe before made to them, That if he came not according to his word, they would chuſe another King, who ſhould hearken to the faithful Counſel of his Lords. This, 'tis eaſie to be thought, toucht the King to the quick, but being not then ſtrong enough to oppoſe, he eſteem'd it his ſafeſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt courſe to condeſcend to the Lords deſires, and order the calling of a Parliament. A Parliament comes and then it wrought wonders.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Stow</hi> we meet with a Story, coincident with theſe times, concerning the Londoners, how that they underſtanding, that the French King had got together a great Navy, aſſembled an Army, and ſet his purpoſe firmly to come into <hi>England,</hi> trembling like Leverets, fearful as Mice they ſought ſtarting holes to hide themſelves in, even as if the City had been ready to be taken, and they, that in times paſt, brag'd they would blow all the French men out of <hi>England,</hi> hearing a vain Rumour of the Enemies coming, ran to the Walls, brake down the houſes adjoyning, deſtroyed and laid them flat, and did all things in great fear, not one French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having then ſet foot on Shipboard. But there's not one word of the Author, whence this was extracted, which we commonly find in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in other Relations. What ground now there was for this pannick fear, I cannot deviſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, for the relating of ſuch a heedleſs ſtory, looking more like a conjectural report, than an hiſtorical relation, as if the Writer himſelf had

               </gap>ck Alarum. How then the Londoners ſhould come to be affraid of them ſo all of a ſudden is a Riddle to me. 'Tis certain enough of late years, that, when they were burnt out of houſe and home, and had little more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to loſe beſides their lives, upon an Alarum of the French coming and Papiſts riſing, they were like inraged Bears, robb'd of their young Ones, much more ready to fall on than the others to ſet upon them, ſo far were they from ſtanding in fear of the whole power of France, though it ſhould have been united with all their Popiſh Friends, Favourers, and Penſioners in <hi>England.</hi> And that they had little or no grounds for ſuch fear in thoſe elderly times, the long train of Victories gain'd heretofore in France puts us out of doubt. Beſides methinks the Inſtances in this Story, which the Writer ſets down as Arguments of fear, are rather proofs of a provident care and foreſight. For what elſe can the running to the Walls, and breaking down the Houſes adjoyning import, but a deſign and reſolution to ſtand upon their own Guard, which is the property of Courage not of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. That there were intentions, ſuitable to men of valour, of ſtanding up vigorouſly in their own defence againſt the forreign Enemy, may be prov'd out of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

then at <hi>London,</hi> and the Lord Chancellors calling men of Arms, out of almoſt every part of the Realm, to the Marches about <hi>London,</hi> to beat back the Frenchmen with their King, had they come. Let this therefore ſerve to diſprove the Annaliſts ſuggeſtions out of his own mouth, and ſhew the Nobles care for the Cities ſafeguard, in drawing ſuch forces thitherward, and their hopes of conſiderable aſſiſtance from the City to help them in the Common cauſe of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe, without granting it, that there were ſome ſparks of fear amongſt them, 'tis queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, whether they did not ſpring from the miſtruſt of their principal Magiſtrates, not out of any diffidence and diſtruſt of their own ſtrength, or dread of a Foreign Enemies power and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance. For to me 'tis an Argument that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of <hi>London</hi> this year look't Courtward, ſince that we read of an endeavour to ingage him in ſuch an horrid deſign, as hath been before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, to deſtroy the principals of the oppoſite party at a private Supper in <hi>London.</hi> Certainly the King would not have utter'd a ſyllable of an intreague of this importance to ſo powerful a Magiſtrate; as my Author affirms he did, had there not been hopes of prevailing on him in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence at leaſt to the Kings word and deſire: But upon the Tryal it ſeems he prov'd himſelf an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter man in that point; (whatever his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and inclinations otherwiſe were) than his Predeceſſor, whom we read of as deeply concern'd in that Plot. Much about this time 'tis likewiſe that a Modern writer tells us, that the <hi>Londoners</hi> incur'd much obloquy, for that having before been Pardoned by the King of ſome Crimes laid to their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40944:131"/>
charge, (but what nor when committed I find not by him mentioned) they were ready to comply with his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſires, and a Jury of them being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannell'd, indited ſome Lords of many Crimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt them. But this alſo is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Magiſtrates influence and power in calling out men fit for the purpoſe, and not to the whole body of the Citizens. For we read juſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that when the Mayor thought to have rais'd them againſt the conteſting Lords, they reſolutely, refus'd, and abſolutely rejected the Motion as is before related. So that 'twas not having the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yor at their Beck, nor the Power, they thought, they had among the high Sheriffs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to procure ſuch men return'd up to ſerve in Parliament, as were nominated by the King and his Council, that could ſhelter the guilty favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites at Cour from the cenſure of that <hi>Auguſt</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, well known afterwards by the name of the Parliament that wrought wonders.</p>
            <p>For on the very firſt day thereof all the Judges, but one, were Arreſted as they ſat in their places, queſtion'd for their extrajudicial opinions and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary actings, and ſeverely puniſh'd by Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Confiſcation of their Eſtates: The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treſilian</hi> loſt his Life at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and the reſt, my Author ſays, had all dyed, had it not been for the Queens interceſſion. As the Judges were thus brought under the Laſh of thoſe Laws, which before they had ſo much abus'd to humour Arbitrary mens deſigns, the better thereby to ſecure to themſelves their own Stations and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judicature, ſo the Patrons themſelves, and reputed promoters of theſe Arbitrary and illegal Actings, were reduc't into the ſame Predicament, Several of the chief were impeach'd of no leſs
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40944:131"/>
than High Treaſon in open Parliament, the abſent for ever baniſh'd, and many of them in hold ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hang'd, or Beheaded, upon <hi>Tower-hil,</hi> or at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> notwithſtanding they had been ere while Men of Name, Power and Authority, and in great favour at Court but juſt before. So uncertain is the State of Mortality, and ſo ſlippery is walking in <hi>high places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongſt all thoſe, who fell under the ſtroak of an angry Deity, and ſo ſhamefully loſt their lives by the hands of Juſtice, moſt memorable is the fate, that befel Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> Grocer, late Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who, for many oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſeditions by him caus'd in the City, was Beheaded (as <hi>Stow</hi> informs us) the Morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Execution of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and, which is more remarkable, with the ſame Ax, he had before prepared for others of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens. So juſt is Providence to ſuffer the wicked to be inſnared by the devices of their own hearts, and to fall headlong into the Pit they had dig'd for others. <hi>Stow</hi> tells us the King had oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made him Mayor of <hi>London</hi> againſt the mind of the Citizens. But in <hi>Fabian</hi> (who methinks, being once Sheriff of this Honourable City, ſhould know beſt what had been formerly Tranſacted in that City, of whoſe good order, Policy, and Government he hath expreſly Treated in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle) I don't find but that he was Elected and Choſen. Poſſibly there might be an order made at Court, Preſent the King, and ſent into the City to further and promote his Election, which by the one might be eſteem'd an impoſing him on the City, while the other only took notice of the meeting of the Citizens in order to an Election, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating how the matter was carried, or whether he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40944:132"/>
came in fairly by a Majority, or elſe by a ſtrong hand, through the working of Court Favourites, who influencing the Judges might make that paſs for Law, which was contrary thereto, let the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of voices be never ſo great on the other ſide. So have I heard of a place, where it was carried by thirteen againſt twenty one, and when the buſineſs came to be ſcan'd over anew, it was adjudg'd by vote againſt the Majority: But this was rather the effect of Greatneſs and Power, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling, than the reſult of Equity and Juſtice dividing to every one his right.</p>
            <p>That this Man, when Mayor, met with great oppoſition from the moſt eminent of the Citizens, I preſume concludable from his Reſentments, and what is in plain words delivered of him by the Annaliſt, how that, whilſt he was in the full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Mayoralty, he caus'd a Common pair of Stocks in every Ward, and a Common Ax to be made, to behead all ſuch, as ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and had Indited eight thouſand and more of the beſt and greateſt of the City, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd was he to carry on the deſign right or wrong to pleaſe his Maſters and Abettors. What kind of principled Man he was we may eaſily gueſs, as from the aforementioned paſſages, ſo from the Hiſtorians Relations before hinted of him, as being deeply concern'd in the Plot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated, to aſſaſſinate the conteſting Lords, and alſo afterwards one of the Chief Men, that had a hand in laying the Ambuſcade, ſpoken of above, unwilling the King, (as he ſwore) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them, who, upon promiſe of ſafe conduct, confirm'd by the Oaths of ſome perſons of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were coming up to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to the King, which he and Sir <hi>Thomas Trivet</hi> privately ſent
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40944:132"/>
away to <hi>London</hi> upon the diſcovery thereof. That he was a ſutable Tool to carry on great mens intreagues, or at leaſt thought fit enough to be made a Property to work upon, why may we not conclude, in that we find him elected, at the latter part of the laſt Kings Reign, and admitted at the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> into the Mayoralty, when the proud haughty Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had got the other Mayor put out of his Office, as not quick enough it ſeems to run along with that aſpiring Dukes deſigns, who aimed at that time to have put by his Nephew from the Throne, and have intruded thereunto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, contrary to right, reaſon and juſtice, and the publick intereſt of the Nation? Who knows like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by whoſe influence, and for what intents, he was kept in the Office of Mayor for three years together, , in the ſeventh, eighth, and nineth of this King? What a vaſt difference was there, as to Principles and Practices, between this man and the fam'd <hi>John Philpot,</hi> his fellow Sheriff in the forty ſixth of the precedent King? The one prov'd as great a Patriot to his Country before, in, and after his Mayoralty, as the other ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an ambitious Courtier under a Gold Chain in the City. But what great wonder is this, to ſee men once joyn Partners in an Office, vaſtly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each from other in their Judgments and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when raiſed to places of higher Dignity and Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis ſaid of this Sir <hi>Nicholas Brembar,</hi> that if he had liv'd, he had been created Duke of <hi>Troy,</hi> or of <hi>London</hi> by the name of Troy. What a pity 'twas that he had not had a Patent, ready ſign'd and ſeal'd lying by him, to have ſhrowded himſelf and all his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40944:133"/>
old crimes, under this new Dignity upon Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But this I Fancy would never have paſt upon that Parliament, either Lords or Commons, to have ſheltred him from the Law of the Land, though he had become really, in act, as well as deſire and deſign, a Peer of the Realm. However this intention of his, if truly related, ſufficiently ſhews us his Ambition to become a Titulado, unleſs we ſhall venture upon a conjecture, that ſome of the Courtiers ſham'd upon him, with the empty promiſe of this titulary honour, when they whead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him out of the directions they had before ſent him, for the better management of their deſigns, which they were unwilling to let remain in his hands, (after they had made as much uſe of his Place and Power, as opportunity would permit) that they might not be produc'd as Evidences againſt them in a day of Tryal, which they, probably fear'd, might one time or other come upon them, and did it ſeems in this Parliament with a Vengeance. For I will take the boldneſs to conclude, that it was ſome other more skilful hand, hid behind the Curtain, that order'd the Scenes, and manag'd the Machines, though he was made the publick ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king horſe, to deceive the vulgar Herd, the Skreen, to ſhelter other mens heads from the violence of popular fury, the open Actor in the face of the world, the common Engine, to ſet the Wheels of more politick mens contrivances a going, though againſt Water, Wind, and Tide: It being very unbecoming the Apes ſubtilty to put her own foot into the fire, when ſhe may make uſe of the Cats.

to pay ſo dear for his own folly and imprudence? And that ſuch is the ominous fate of leſs wary men, who venture upon Actions, not warranted by Law, to ſerve a preſent turn, and humour their own ambitious deſires, or other mens greatneſs, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrable, as in general from Hiſtory and Experience, ſo more particularly from an inſtance in <hi>Spain,</hi> under one of the <hi>Philips,</hi> of a certain Officer of that Kings, who having by the Kings Order done an Act, for which he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards queſtioned and thrown into Priſon, and upon fair words and promiſes parted with the Kings Letter, which he could have produc'd for his Warrant, was ſoon after left in the lurch, and ſuffer'd to fall a Sacrifice to his own imprudent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, and the Law of the Land. Whether I have been exact, as to all circumſtances of the ſtory, I ſhall not poſitively affirm, as not being fully ſure, but my Memory may deceive me in twelve or thirteen years ſpace, and being uncertain in what Book to look for it now, or where I read it at firſt, unleſs in ſome of the famous <hi>Fullers</hi> works, perhaps in his holy or prophane State; but as to the ſubſtance and truth hereof, I dare aver it from Hiſtorical Relation, and leave the Application to more Philoſophical Logicians, that I may preſs further forwards towards the mark, the end, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſcope of this my preſent undertaking, viz.

So fatal was the Citizens Example to the reſt of the Land, and ſo little gain'd they themſelves in theſe Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures by their Submiſſions, Reſignations, and other like compliances to the Court, beſides expence, charge, and much trouble, and the continual fears of greater moleſtations for the future.</p>
            <p>But when was this and how was it brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? If we trace the Serids of times and affairs a little backwards, by the unerring Clue of Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Hiſtory, we ſhall find theſe tranſactions to bear date ſome years after the end of the Parliament, that wrought wonders, when poſſibly 'twas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot, and it's Statutes, by ſome Mens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, ſlighted through diſuſe and inexecution. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were indeed theſe latter proceedings attempted, till after that, by ſeveral tricks and devices (as naming Sheriffs fit to ſerve turns, and impoſing ſuch Repreſentatives on the Borough Towns, as would be byaſs'd to betray their Country, beſides a violent ſeizure of the Country Lords likely to oppoſe) the Court had got a Parliament to their minds, that would do their own buſineſs, not the Nations, and prefer the private gain of ſome few, before the publick benefit of the whole Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>What ſort of Parliament this was, and how fairly things were carried, we may inform our ſelves out of <hi>Stow's</hi> Annals, where we find it upon Record, in the twenty firſt year of this King, how that all of a ſuddain, in the midſt of a great calm and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſerenity, the King caus'd the principals of the party, thought moſt oppoſite to Court deſignes, to

            <p>Such being the Acts of this Aſſembly, and the conſequences of the Courts preſent ſucceſs (in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the Heads of the other Party, who durſt at every turn conteſt therewith in behalf of thoſe freeborn Engliſh Twins Liberty and Property) under which the Nation with ſilent murmurs lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and lamented, when they ſo ſoon, after the end of this Parliament at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Kings Progreſs into the Weſt, ſaw no leſs than ſeventeen Counties in Eaſt England indicted by the Kings command, and as a grievous offence laid to their charge, that they had been againſt him with the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> (the late Principals amongſt the conteſting Lords, but now ſecur'd faſt enough, the two firſt under the undiſſolvable Bonds of Death, the other, under the Chains of a perpetual Impriſonment in the <hi>Iſle of Man)</hi> and ſeveral honourable Perſons ſent to induce the Lords, Spiritual and Temporal, to make a Submiſſion by Writing, ſeal'd with their own Hands, acknowledging themſelves Traytors to the King, though they never offended him in Word or

We may eaſily conclude the Court, thought the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were not over much in love with theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving Statutes, unaccuſtomed Oaths, inſnaring Blanks, and inforc'd Submiſſions, and ſuſpected them ready enough, upon occaſion, to oppoſe, and withſtand theſe manifeſt encroachments of Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Prerogative upon the Liberty of the Subject, and ſtrive to ſtrike off theſe Fetters, and Shackles of Slavery upon the next opportunity, before they were thorowly rivetted by Time and Preſcription, and therefore eſteemed it their wiſeſt Courſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with them firſt, by the uſual Method of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, while they had the Reins of Government in their own hands, and ſo conſequently power enough to manage the Law, as they themſelves pleaſed, to wind and turn it about to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and bend it to their own irregular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Deſigns, ſince that they lik'd not to have them confin'd within the limits and bounds thereof.</p>
            <p>This manner of acting however, by the by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me the moſt beaten Path to Deſtruction, and the high way to the Actors unavoidable Ruin, and I think I have reaſon, Hiſtory and Experience all on my ſide. This the City ſeems well to have underſtood, and therefore with Prudence choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40944:141"/>
to yield to the times for a ſeaſon, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſtrive againſt the running ſtream, and immediately to fall a rowing againſt high wind and Tide; but as ſoon as ever the flowing waters began to Ebb, and the tide was a turning, the City Barge ſtruck in with the returning waves, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to ſteer the Ship of the Common-wealth to a quite different Haven from that, whither the Court was furiouſly driving her before. And then for the moſt favourable of the Citizens to ſhew themſelves but faint Regardleſs friends, was far leſs beneficial to the deſolate forſaken King, than for others of them to appear earneſt Enemies in ſo critical a Juncture, was diſadvantagious to this unfortunate Prince, as he may well be term'd, either for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none but ill Councellors and faithleſs Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-friends about him, and hearkning ſo much to their pernitious and deſtructive advice, or elſe for the defect of his Judgment in not diſcerning between their private ſelf ends, and his own ſpecial and particular intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Impartiality in doing Juſtice to all States and Perſons, from the higheſt to the loweſt, ſquaring all his own actions by the known Rules of the Law of the Land, to the pleaſing of his people, not by the compaſs of other mens unſtable fancies and anomalous Plat-forms, to the loſs of his Subjects love and affection, and the unhappy fate, that attended him upon this his ill conduct, when he was violently thrown out of the Chair of State into a profound Abyſs of miſeries and infelicities, and irrecoverably caſt out of a Regal Throne into an unavoidable Priſon, between which and his grave he had but few ſteps to make.</p>
            <p>For we are to know that, as in the tuming of fortunes wheel the ſpoke, that is got upermoſt,

Now the King is in hold, let us ſee how the Citizens behav'd themſelves in this great Turn and Change of the Times. They had in this Kings Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in his Grandfathers dayes, appear'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Aſſertors of his Right and Title; and in the beginning of his Reign contributed much to his Security and Settlement on the THRONE: But a new Generation being ſprang up in Twenty Years ſpace, and their old Services at laſt ſo ill requited, by new attempts on their Liberties, by Inditements and blank-Charters, inſtead of ſtanding up with their Lives and Fortunes in the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Vindication, they openly devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to anothers Service, and became the known Favourers of that Party, which aſſiſted to Depoſe this unhappy Prince, and ſet up in His Room the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> under the Name and Title of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth.</hi> As is provable, both from Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Law <hi>(viz.</hi> the Act made in the Firſt of this New <hi>King,</hi> to be ſeen in the Statute-Book, <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>An.</hi> 1. <hi>H.</hi> 4. Where we find expreſs mention of the good and lawful behaviour of the <hi>Mayor, Sheriffs,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and all the Commonalty of the ſame City of <hi>London</hi> towards him) and <hi>Stow</hi>'s general Chronicle of <hi>England,</hi> wherein we read, at the latter end of the Life and Reign of <hi>King Richard</hi> the Second, That after the Duke was come from <hi>Coventry</hi> to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> about five or ſix Miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming to <hi>London,</hi> the Mayor, and the Companies in the Liveries, with great Noiſe of Trumpets, met the Duke, doing more Reverence to him, than to the <hi>King,</hi> Rejoycing that GOD had ſent them ſuch a Prince that had Conquer'd the Realm, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Court-party,</hi> within one Months ſpace: Whereupon, when the Duke was come within two Miles of the City, he ſtopt his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40944:143"/>
Army, as if out of Reverence, and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in Submiſſion thereto, and ask't Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Commons thereof, what they would do with the <hi>King;</hi> who Anſwered, they would He ſhould be led to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> upon which, to them He was delivered, and they led him accordingly to <hi>Westminſter,</hi> and from thence by Water to the Tower. Nay, ſome of the <hi>Londoners</hi> publickly ſhew'd themſelves ſo much His Enemies, as to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together with an intent to have met Him without the City, and there to have Slain him for his former Severities: But the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and beſt of the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> upon Information hereof, with ſome difficulty reclaim'd them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. After the Citizens had thus receiv'd the <hi>King</hi> into their Cuſtody, and in effect thereby made a publick Declaration of their Minds and Opinions, as to the great Change ſucceeding the Duke, we are told, entred <hi>London</hi> by the chief Gate, and Rode through <hi>Cheapſide</hi> to St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and there Lodg'd for ſome time; ſo ſecure was he of the Citys good Will and Affection to him, and afterward in <hi>October</hi> held a <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimſter-Hall,</hi> where the old <hi>King</hi>'s Depoſition, and the new <hi>King</hi>'s Election were compleated.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtay to make a long Paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cityes proceedings in this Affair, it being Matter of Fact, and undeniable, that the City conſented hereto, from the aforeſaid paſſages, which may be likewiſe thought very much to have influenc'd the Nation in their Elections to that <hi>Parliament,</hi> if, from the Annaliſts Computation, we may ſafely and truly aver, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Men</hi> were choſen after theſe Tranſactions at <hi>London,</hi> becauſe Forty dayes at leaſt interven'd between this time and the firſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:40944:143"/>
whereon he ſayes the <hi>Parliament</hi> began. If any be deſirous of another Obſervation, I leave them to their own Liberty to infer, from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Premiſes, that it much conduc't to facilitate the <hi>King</hi>'s Depoſition, that he had no known, and generally acknowledg'd Heir, of his own Body lawfully begotten, boldly to ſtand up for Him, and ſtrongly plead his Cauſe in Armour, for his own particular Intereſt, as well as out of a due ſence of his Duty. Neither indeed do I well ſee how he could have any, ſince that he had none by his firſt Wife, that I read of, his ſecond Queen was too young, another Heir was publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed out to the Nation, and he himſelf was alſo looſely addicted, as ſeems plain beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. His Laſcivious living being hinted to us in <hi>Burton</hi>'s Hiſtorical Remarks of <hi>London,</hi> among the Articles drawn up againſt him; and we have great reaſon to think it was an imputation too true, when we read of ſeveral Ladyes expell'd the Court in the <hi>Eleventh</hi> of his Reign, by the Procurement of the conteſting Lords; and a little before the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Wonder-Working-Parliament;</hi> and take Notice, out of <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Abridgment, of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> Requeſt in the <hi>Twentieth</hi> Year, for the avoiding the outragious Expences of the <hi>King</hi>'s houſe, and namely of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Ladyes,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>'s Anſwer thereto made, That he would be free therein; and that the <hi>Commons</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by had offended againſt him, his Dignity, and Liberty: Such was his Indignation againſt them for deſiring to controul him in this Point; and ſo highly incens'd was he thereat, that, to Appeaſe him, the Exhibiter of the Bill was adjudg'd to dye as a Traytor, though, upon ſome great Ones importunity, his Life was for that time ſpared,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40944:144"/>
and he himſelf at length reſtor'd in Blood, and to the recovery of his Goods, Livings, Lands, and Tennements, at the next <hi>King</hi>'s comming to the Crown. But how, I trow, come the Biſhops to be complain'd of by the <hi>Commons</hi> among the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Were they ſuch Courters of Ladyes, as, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rebuking, to follow, or rather give bad Examples to the <hi>King</hi> and Country? Yet now I think on't, theſe were <hi>Popiſh,</hi> not <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: Though I ſcarce believe, every one of them, that, to the view of the World, gives himſelf a Proteſtant Title, is able well and truly to plead not Guilty: If <hi>Noli-fet-ole-chery,</hi> be a Motto rightly father'd upon one of our <hi>Weſtern</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans.</p>
            <p>How all things in a manner concur'd to further King <hi>Richard's</hi> Depoſition, and that he was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depos'd, hath already been ſpoken of, which nevertheleſs barely did not content the Party, but they would needs have it done in a formal and ſolemn way: Firſt, the King muſt make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Renunciation of all Right, Title and Claim to the Crown, then Commiſſioners are by the States appointed in their Names to pronounce the Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Depoſition from the Throne, and make to him a Reſignation of their homage and fealty; for their Loyalty ſeems plainly enough to have been gone before. Neither did they think this enough, but were reſolv'd over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to leave Articles againſt him upon Record, wherein are expreſſed the ill things done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his Reign, and as they ſay, by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whereby they deſigned to juſtifie what they had done towards the unhappy Kings Depoſition, which viſibly pav'd the way to his Grave. So pernicious is it for Princes to ſuffer their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40944:144"/>
to be abus'd, to ſhelter other mens Crimes, or their Names to be made uſe of, without a Preſent Reſentment, to carry on Deſigns hateful to the People, though they never conſent thereto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as their own Act and Deed.

For that the <hi>King</hi> ſuffered his Subjects to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Marſhal-Law, contrary to his Oath and the Laws of the Realm. For that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being only bound by their Allegiance, were
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40944:146"/>
yet driven to take certain New Oaths, for ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the folly of the <hi>King.</hi> For that the <hi>King</hi> by his private Letters, would charge the Eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Miniſters in any new Canonical matter, to ſtay, contrary to his Oath. For that the <hi>King</hi> by force in his Parliament, baniſhed the Arch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> without any good Ground. For that the <hi>King</hi> by his laſt Will paſſed under the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and <hi>Privy Signet,</hi> gave unto his Succeſſors, certain Money and Treaſure, upon Condition to perform all the Acts and Orders in the laſt Parliament, which being ungodly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, he meant as ungodlily to dy in. For that the <hi>King</hi> in the 11th. of his Reign, in his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the Manour of <hi>Langley,</hi> in the preſence of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> and others, received the Sacrament of the Lords Body, that he would never impeach the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> his Uncle, for any thing before done; and yet to the Contrary procured him to be murdered. For that the <hi>King</hi> moſt fraudulently and untruely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Oath, Baniſhed the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and waſted his Goods: in which Article<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in private Conference between the ſaid Arch Biſhop, the <hi>King</hi> in a manner propheſied, and doubted that the like would happen of himſelf; and thereupon ſhewed a ſpecial Token to the Arch Biſhop, That if he ſent the ſame at any time, that the Arch Biſhop ſhould look that the King would come to him.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Imputations laid to his charge, and that they were then thought true, or at leaſt not contradicted, is ſelf-Evident, all ſeeming highly deſirous of a Change, and few diſpos'd to eſpouſe the depos'd Kings Cauſe and Intereſt, ſo furious and violent was the Current of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40944:146"/>
Times, as to bear away well nigh all before it: That Parliament being ſo full of the new Kings Favourers, and ſo empty of the old Kings true and cordial Friends, that I remember to have read of but one, <hi>viz.</hi> the Loyal Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle;</hi> who, after a little Demur of a few dayes time, upon a Motion made in Parliament about the diſpoſal of King <hi>Richard,</hi> ſtood up boldly, and undauntedly, for his old Lord and Maſter, in the midſt of his profeſſed, and declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and known Deſerters. His Speech (as a rare Example of Fidelity giving us the very Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of Loyalty) I ſhall venture to ſet down out of Sir <hi>Richard Bakers</hi> Chronicle, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, The Matter now propounded, is of marvellous Weight and Conſequence, wherein there are two Points chiefly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; The Firſt, whether King <hi>Richard</hi> be ſufficiently put out of his Throne; The Second, whether the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> be lawfully taken in. For the Firſt, How can that be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, when there is no Power ſufficient to do it? The Parliament cannot, for of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the King is the Head; and can the Body put down the Head? You will ſay, but the Head may bow it ſelf down; and may the King reſign? It is true; but what force is in that which is done by force? And who knows not that King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Reſignation was no other? But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he be ſufficiently out, yet how comes the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to be lawfully in? If you ſay by Conqueſt, you ſpeak Treaſon; For what Conqueſt without Arms? And can a Subject take Arms againſt his lawful Soveraign, and not be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40944:147"/>
Treaſon? If you ſay by Election of the State, you ſpeak not reaſon; for what Power hath the State to Elect, while any is Living that hath Right to Succeed? But ſuch a Succeſſor is not the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> as deſcended from <hi>Edmund Crouchback,</hi> the Elder Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> though put by the Crown for deformity of his Body; for who knows not the falſeneſs of this Allegation? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a thing Notorious, that this <hi>Edmund</hi> was neither the Elder Brother, nor yet <hi>Crook-Back't</hi> (though called ſo from ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) but a goodly Perſonage, and without any deformity. And your ſelves cannot forget a thing ſo lately done, who it was that in the Fourth Year of King <hi>Richard</hi> was declared by Parliament to be Heir to the Crown, in caſe King <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould dye without Iſſue. But why then is not that Claim made? Becauſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Leges inter Arma,</hi> What diſpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> extream Injuſtice, that King <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould be condemn'd, without being heard, or once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to make his Defence. And now, My Lords, I have ſpoken thus at this time, that you may conſider of it before it be too late; for as yet it is in your Power to undo that juſtly, which you have unjuſtly done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much to this Purpoſe was the Biſhop's Speech; but to as little purpoſe as if he had gone about to call back Yeſterday. The Matter was too far gone; and ſcarce a Perſon there preſent, that had not a Hope of either a private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefit by that which was done. Yet againſt this Speech of the Biſhop, there was neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40944:147"/>
nor excepting: It paſſed in the Houſe as but one Man's Opinion: And as for the King, it was neither fit he ſhould uſe much Severity againſt any Member of that Parliament, which had ſo lately ſhewed ſo much Indulgence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; nor indeed ſafe, to be too hot in his Puniſhment, when he was yet ſcarce warm in his Government. Yet for a warning to uſe their Liberty of Speech with more Moderation hereafter; the Biſhop was Arreſted by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, and Committed to Priſon in the <hi>Abby</hi> of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> but afterwards, without further Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſet at Liberty, till upon a Conſpiracy of Lords, wherein he was a Party; he was Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Dye, though through Extremity of Grief he prevented Execution. Thus far the Chronicle.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> is now got into the Throne, <hi>(Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> being thruſt into a Priſon, and afterwards into his Grave) and yet I don't find him ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and well ſettled, but that he had many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Another advantage they likewiſe laid hold on, to Promote their own Earthly advancement, by making uſe of this opportunity, to ſuppreſs the growth and encreaſe of the <hi>Wickliviſts,</hi> the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of the age, whoſe Numbers began now more and more to encreaſe in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and grew formidable to the whole <hi>Popiſh Hierarchy.</hi> Theſe men, whom they could not vanquiſh by dint of Argument, ſo conformable were their Doctrines to the Scriptures, they thought it eaſier to oppreſs by the Civil Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Power of the Magiſtrates Sword, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had of late ſet a keener Edg, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſome laws to be made againſt them, under the Name and Notion of Lollards. And yet, ſuch was the ill fate of oppoſing the ſpreading of the Goſpel, that theſe Aſſertors of it's verity, like the Primitive Chriſtians of old, dayly encreaſt in Numbers and Repute under their oppreſſions, and grew every age more mumerous in ſpight of all the malice and oppoſition of their cruel and blood thirſty Enemies: and much too by the ſame way and methods, the Evidence of truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of good lives and Exemplary Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Like the ancient Chriſtians they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into holes and ſecret places, into private Conventicles and ſeparate Aſſemblies. And though they were not, like them, at every turn cal'd upon to be caſt to the <hi>Lions,</hi> for diſobeying the Emperours Edicts and Commands, yet away with them to the fire, and to burning of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, or in a little ſofter phraiſe, to putting the Kings Laws in Execution, were the common outcryes made againſt them.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the diverſity of their Religion and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40944:150"/>
their difference in opinion from the reſt of the Nation, were not thought Incentives ſtrong enough to ſtir up the popular Rage &amp; Fury, a more Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way was found out, inſtead of charging on their account all the Miſchiefs, Miſeries, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters of the Times, to lay the deteſtable Crimes of Treaſon and Conſpiracy at their doors. Hence may we conclude ſprung the Informations, given into the King, of ſome, that had conſpir'd ſuddenly to have Slain Him and his Brethren, and of numerous Aſſemblies meeting in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Fields to that End. Hereon poſſibly may we ground the Rumour ſpread abroad of great offers made of Money by Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtles</hi> Favourers to the <hi>Scots,</hi> to invade the Realm in the Kings abſence in <hi>France,</hi> of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sir <hi>John</hi> himſelf (who was a known <hi>Wickli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſt)</hi> with <hi>Douglas</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi> at <hi>Pomfract,</hi> on the ſame Errand, and of Indentures and other Writings made betwixt him and the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> containing Inſtructions to the <hi>Scots</hi> to beſiege <hi>Roxborough</hi> and <hi>Barwick.</hi> Such Stories may we look upon, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports likely enough to have been purpoſely ſpread abroad, to ſtir up the Peoples Animoſities againſt the Diſſenters of the times: Hitherto likewiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may we impute the Original of the <hi>Schedules,</hi> ſaid to be nail'd upon the Church doors in <hi>London,</hi> with threats of an hundred thouſand Men, ready to riſe upon Occaſion. <hi>Stow</hi> indeed, out of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> the Monk, charges them upon <hi>Wickliſts</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers; yet have we reaſon to ſuſpect the firſt Author, as too partial in the Caſe, and queſtion whether theſe were not <hi>Popiſh</hi> Shams put upon the Nation by the <hi>Wickliviſts</hi> Enemies, to raiſe a colour for an Out-cry againſt them. For at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Fifth</hi> of this King, we read, in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Abridgment, of an haynous complaint againſt Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40944:151"/>
&amp; in the end (mind this) they ſuſpect they were Lollards &amp; Traitors; which made a way for a Requeſt that Commiſſions at all times be granted to enquire of them. Whoever was Originally in fault, we may ſee from this where the blame ſhould light, and the ſevereſt Proſecution too, could the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prelates have had their Will, notwithſtanding the ſlightneſs of their thin-ſpun pretences, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their groundleſs Imputations. A pretty device, to make Riots and Inſurrections; and then accuſe the contrary Party of them, as if they had been ſo Fanatical, as tumultuouſly to meet together, <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> without any Arms about them, or Weapons in their hands, to diſturb the Kings Peace; and with no worſe deſign, than the Warrant of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Cuſtoms, whereon ſome, in an unheard of manner, without Law or Reaſon, and contrary to common ſence, intruded, to deprive them of the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>Out of the forementioned Monkiſh Writer, <hi>Stow</hi> tells us of an Army of Twenty Five Thouſand, that were to have met Sir <hi>John</hi> in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Fields; and yet for all this great Cry we find not One Hundred taken, though he affirms Sixty Nine of them to be condemn'd of Treaſon (upon ſuch kind of proofs perhaps, as theſe, whereon the Compoſer of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>'s Life makes him to have been found Guilty of Treaſon in the <hi>Firſt</hi> of King <hi>James,</hi> for which he had the honour to be Beheaded about Forty Years after, upon his Return from his unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful <hi>Guyana</hi> Voyage) and Thirty Seven Hang'd. But the Record out of the Kings-Bench, the moſt authentick Evidence, mentions only, That Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle,</hi> and others, to the number of Twenty Men, call'd <hi>Lollards,</hi> at St. <hi>Giles,</hi> did conſpire to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the State of the <hi>Clergy</hi> (this it ſeems then was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40944:151"/>
the principal Offence; the reſt Aggravations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Scales could not have been well weigh'd down) and to Kill the King, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other Nobles, as any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader may ſee in <hi>Cottons</hi> Abridgment at the afore-cited Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Fifth</hi> of this King. Where now are any good grounds for this malicious Out-cry upon the Diſſenting <hi>Wickliviſts</hi> for Traiterous Plotters and Conſpirators: And whats become of the great Army that Fame and Report had Rais'd? But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Inn-keepers, in the adjacent Hamlets, and neighbouring Villages, were not only their familiar Friends, but intimate Acquaintance; as Mr. <hi>Bags</hi> ingenuity (to the elevating, and ſurprizing of our Minds) hath taught us to expreſs it; how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this <hi>Achilles,</hi> and his dreadful Army of <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midons,</hi> could have continued thus unſeen, and ſlipt away in Diſguiſe, ſeems not reconcileable to Sence and Reaſon. And yet how ſuch great Numbers could have lain hid within the compaſs of a <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,</hi> or have been put like <hi>Homers Iliads</hi> in a <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell,</hi> is a thing that paſſeth all my underſtanding to conceive. If ever ſuch a thing was, as doubtleſs it never hapned in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor amongſt either our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or modern Reformers; certainly then this unconceivable Wonder muſt have fell out in the Reign of <hi>Queen Dick,</hi> King of no Lands, upon the <hi>Terra incognita</hi> of ſome other of the <hi>Fairy</hi> Iſlands, bordering upon <hi>

            <p>But laying aſide theſe idle Stories of the Monkiſh Romancers, I paſs on, from our famous win-All, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> to the unfortunate <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſe-All, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> a far better Man than <hi>King,</hi> as being more intentive upon the Devotions of the Times, than the Government of his Realm; and better skill'd in his Beads, than his Scepter: and therefore ſeems rather cut out for a Prieſt than a Prince. In this Kings Minority, while ſuch great States-men and Patriots, as his moſt renowned Uncles, <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſate at the Helm, and ſteadily Steer'd the Ship of the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> one by his Arms, the other by his Arts, Honour, and Renown attended upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Banners in <hi>France;</hi> and the Land at Home in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Flouriſhed under the benign Influence of their ſucceſsful Councels, for the moſt part free from ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Broils and Commotions; King <hi>Henry</hi> being in actual Poſſeſſion of both Crowns, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch noble and worthy Directors. But when Death had ſnatch'd away one from his Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>France;</hi> and the other was diſmiſt from his Protectorſhip in <hi>England</hi> through the courſe of time: The King being grown in Years, and come to ripeneſs of Age, though not it ſeems to ſuch a degree of underſtanding, as might capacitate him to act the part of a King, further than in Name and Shew; his Affairs in forreign Parts ſoon went mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably to wrack; and being turn'd out of almoſt all beyond Sea, deadly Fewds and Annimoſities (the uſual attendants of ill Succeſs abroad) encreaſt ſo faſt at Home, between the Nobles and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

            <p>Whether 'twas purely the ill ſucceſs abroad, or the ill management of the State at home, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Fate attending the Kings Matching with Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> to the breach of a former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or the unſeaſonable ſtirring of her and her accomplices to Suppreſs, Ruine, and Root out the other Party, whereby they were compell'd for their own Security to link themſelves together in the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bonds of Confederacy, and ſtand continually upon their own Guard: Whether the weakneſs of the King, or the reſtleſs Spirit of the Queen (too Active for her Sex), The much reſented Death of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> or the ſubtle Arts and Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (into the particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will not now deſcend, as being the Subject of a diſtinct Treatiſe by it ſelf) and the Popularity of the great Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Whether 'twas any of theſe ſingle, or all of them joyntly concurring, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the over-ruling Providence of an Almighty Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that made this ſtrange Alteration in the Face of things, to the dethroning of one Prince (the moſt devoted of his time to religious Exerciſes) and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of another, as much given to Women, as the former to Religion, whereby the White Roſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt the Red: Certain it is, the City of <hi>London</hi> had a great Influence upon theſe Tranſactions, and the favour the Citizens bore to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and his Party, contributed highly to the advancing of his Intereſt above the King Regnants, if they were not the only grand cauſes under Heaven, that produc't ſuch wonderful and ſtupendious Effects. This the

more clearly to demonſtrate, I ſhall not oblidge my ſelf exactly to trace the whole Series of State affairs, through the following Princes Reigns, nor over-ſcrupulouſly confine my ſelf to the Life of this or that King diſtinctly and apart. But deſign to view the differences between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in the lump, conſidering them under the Notion of one particular Conteſt, though of a long and large du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and throughout with all plainneſs and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, I can lay claim to, ſhew what powerful Rays of Influence from <hi>London</hi> were ſhed abroad upon the Face of the Land. For I intend not to Write an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of <hi>Englands</hi> general Hiſtory, as having only undertaken a particular Argument relating to this Honourable Cities Fame, Renown, and Glory abroad; Strength, Riches, and Power at home within her ſelf; and the various Influences ſhe caſt all over <hi>England</hi> in the more ſpecial turns and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Affairs: For the reſt, the Curious may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the laborious Works of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>Therefore, chooſing my own Method, I ſhall make a diviſion of what I have to produce in this place, into two Parts or general Heads, under which I hope to comprehend the moſt material Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages I meet with ſutable to the deſign and purport of this Attempt: The firſt containing Inſtances of <hi>Lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Fathers Labours, and retain'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conqueſts therein; there is no doubt to be made. But I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume I have a much ſtronger proof to produce, from no leſs convincing an Argument than Statute Law (as authentick an Evidence in the Caſe, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is capable of) to be found <hi>Anno octavo Henrici ſexti. cap.</hi> 11. where we have expreſs mention made of the entire affections and great kindneſſes done, and ſhewed to the ſaid King, in all his Affairs, by the Citizens of the City of <hi>London;</hi> which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and for the future the more to encourage, the King was induc'd by Authority of Parliament to give them leave to put and take in Apprentices according to their ancient manner, form, or cuſtom; of which they had ſome time before been abridg'd by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statute, to the great hindrance and damage likely thereby to redound to them.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall require further Inſtances hereof, let them but have recourſe to the Annals of this Kings Reign; and there I doubt not but they'l have their Expectations anſwer'd, and their Curioſity highly ſatisfied, when they ſhall have carefully and thorowly boſerv'd the Noble Equipage of the Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Citizens in the <hi>Tenth</hi> Year, when they rode forth to meet the King upon his return out of <hi>France,</hi> the Pomp and Gallantry, wherewith they receiv'd him at <hi>London,</hi> and entertain'd him in his paſſage through it, and the coſtly Preſent they made him afterwards at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> And take Notice of their ſplendid appearance in Scarlet, blew Gowns, broider'd Sleeves, and red Hoods, to convey his Princely Bride, Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> through the City in the <hi>Twenty-Third</hi> of his Reign.</p>

Yet they did not ſo ſoon forget their old Love, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſide with the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Lancaſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but ſeem for a while to have continued, as it were, in a ſtate of indifferency, ſometimes favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the one, ſometimes the other, as if uncertain with whom to ſide, till the Number of publick Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances being greatly encreaſt, or elſe more eagerly and plainly remonſtrated to them by the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they more openly at length ſhifted all their Sails, and with fix't Reſolutions eſpous'd the <hi>Yorkiſt</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and ſo that Family got Poſſeſſion of the Throne thereby. Then which, what greater Evidence can there be of the Cities Power and Influence in thoſe Times? And yet in this interval and ſpace of time, which I venture, and I hope with truth enough, to term the State of her indifferency or neutrality, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Inſtances of her Power are produceable for the further illuſtration of the Point in hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate beyond diſpute, that the variation, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and change of the Citizens Minds over-rul'd

            <p>Several ſuch Inſtances are to be ſeen in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and have been hinted before in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Relation: And if need were I might produce the Diſturbance likely to have hapned in the <hi>Fourth</hi> year of this King, by the Biſhop of <hi>Winchesters</hi> meanes, then at Variance with the Protector the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> when upon ſtrict Commandment given to the Mayor, he ſet a ſure Watch by night, that kept out the Biſhops Servants by force, and would not permit them to enter the <hi>City</hi> over the <hi>Bridg,</hi> whereupon a pacification was at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between theſe two great Men, their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in time amicably adjuſted, and the <hi>City</hi> ſeems to have protected the Protector himſelf: But that I haſten to the fecond general Head, before propos'd, under which I am to make out the viſibility of the <hi>City's</hi> affection to the houſe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> diſtinguiſh'd from that of <hi>Lancaſtor</hi> by the white Roſe, their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

            <p>For the proof of the Queens Suſpicions, or others Apprehenſions, Inſtances more than one or two, and a triumvirate of Witneſſes may be brought. <hi>Stow</hi> tells us before the battail of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> how that the King having aſſembled his Power to oppoſe the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> then marching towards <hi>London</hi> at the Head of an Army, his meaning was rather to meet the Duke in the <hi>North</hi> parts, than about <hi>London,</hi> where it was thought he had too many friends, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departs with ſpeed from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Stow</hi> ſhall here bring up the Rear, to back their Informanions, with this expreſſion, that, becauſe the Duke was had more in eſtimation among the <hi>Citizens,</hi> than either the King or Queen, ſhe caus'd the King to make his Progreſs, as perceiving ſhe could attempt nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him near to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we conſider Actions, and reſpect Matters of Fact, we ſhall find the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> often received at <hi>London,</hi> when the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> were either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly refus'd, or at leaſt compell'd to get fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off into other parts, for their better ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſafeguard.

for his Holineſs of life, and abundant Clemency. Whether the Citizens would have yielded to more or not, I cannot be poſitive, but this I am ſure of, that they ſo far gave way, that now the <hi>York</hi> Party had got much the better end of the Staff by an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as well as by Arms, Title, and the Cities Affections, and made uſe of it accordingly to the Old Kings actual Depoſition, and the ſetting up of a New one at <hi>London,</hi> before the next Spring was over, by the concurrent conſent of many ſubſtantial Citizens thereof.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Yorkiſt</hi> Faction had reaſon enough, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their proſperous ſucceſs in the Country, to acknowledge as a great favour of the Commonalty of <hi>London,</hi> and impute the following ſucceſs to their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in adhereing to their Party, after a double over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw given the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> by the <hi>Lancaſtrians,</hi> when the Magiſtracy ſeemed, in part, at leaſt, to have alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Opinions and Reſolutions, if not their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, would but the Commons have ſate ſtill, and continued Neutral in the Conteſt, the other ſide was in a fair way to have made their Party good againſt the <hi>Yorkiſts:</hi> but the Commons oppoſition to their Mayors Proceedings, ſtem'd the Current, to the others benefis, and the manifeſt diſadvantage of the Queen and the Court.

            <p>The Queen with her Northern Army had overthrown and ſlain <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and routed his Party at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and afterwards diſcomfitted the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and his Power at Saint <hi>Albons,</hi> upon <hi>Bernard</hi> Heath, and ſo delivered King <hi>Henry</hi> out of their hands, who pretended to be his Life Guard, but were in reality his Keepers, Obſerves, Overſeers, and Governours, or, in an yet harſher term though as true a ſence, his Jaylors, upon which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Succeſſes, the Queen ſent to the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> willing and commanding him in the King's Name ſpeedily to ſend her Victuals without delay, for her Army: which Command the Mayor ſtrove preſently with great diligence to put in Execution, by preparing ſeveral Cart-Loads of <hi>Lenten</hi> Proviſion, and ſending them to <hi>Cripple-Gate,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> Camp at Saint <hi>Albans.</hi> But there the Commons unanimouſly withſtood their further paſſage, and by ſtrong hand kept the Carts from going out of <hi>London,</hi> ſaying, It did not behoove them to feed their Enemies, who intended to Rob the City, and having repulſed the <hi>Northern</hi> Horſemen robbing in the Subberbs, upon their attempt to enter that way into the City, and ſlain three of them, continued ſo firm and fixt in their Reſolutions, that let the Mayor do what he could by Exhortation and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſhew them the danger, that might enſue by ſtopping the Carts, he could neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim nor alter their minds, nor by any means prevail upon them, but in the end was fain to ſend the Recorder and ſome of the Aldermen to the Kings

Council, to requeſt the Northern Mens Diſmiſſion, beſides two Female Mediators to interceed for him to the Queen, and excuſe his not uſing force in thoſe dangerous and doubtful times, againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons oppoſition, leaſt their fury being once ſtir'd it might not ſo eaſily have been allaid again. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Queen was ſending ſome of the Lords, with 400 Soldiers to the City, to take a view of the peoples demeanour, but having her hands full, upon certain notice that the Earl of <hi>March, Yorks</hi> Eldeſt Son, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> with joint Forces were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in all haſte to <hi>London,</hi> ſhe departed with the King, her Husband, and Son, into the North, her only refuge, having little truſt in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> leſs in them of <hi>Kent,</hi> but leaſt of all (ſaith <hi>Stow)</hi> in the <hi>Londoners;</hi> ſo little avail'd it to have the Mayor and ſome of the chief Commoners on her ſide, (as <hi>Fabian</hi> intimates) when the Commonalty, <hi>i. e.</hi> the vaſt majority, held with the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his party, wherefore, upon the Courts departure from St. <hi>Albans,</hi> the Earl of <hi>March</hi> with his <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> entered the City in <hi>Lent,</hi> with a great Attendance, and was joyfully received, the people reſorting to him in great numbers out of <hi>Kent, Eſſex,</hi> and other parts, to ſee, aid, and aſſiſt this luſty Prince, (as the Annaliſt words it) in whom the hope of all their joy conſiſted, as ſoon as his coming thither was known, where he was quickly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and acknowledged King by conſent, in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and after eight or ten Battels, actually Crowned in <hi>June</hi> with great Royalty, and a ſplendid appearance of Lords and Commons, Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens. In ſo high a degree did the Cities actions ſway the Country, and ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was it to the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> to have gained her over to their Party.</p>
            <p>I need not here remark the prevalency of the Commonalty over the Temporiſing Mayor, and his
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40944:160"/>
time-ſerving Intereſt, (the event plainly ſhe wing in theſe particulars, <hi>Vox Populi</hi> to have been <hi>Vox Coeli)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have touched upon this ſtring already. But this however I am warranted from Hiſtory to obſerve, that the <hi>Londoners,</hi> after they had once throughly placed their hearts upon the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> they continued ſo fixt and firm to their Intereſt, that no ſhocks of Fortune, nor the Troubles and Commotions about the middle of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reign, could ſhake the firmneſs of their adherence to him, ſo faſt was he Rivetted in their Affections: nor yet the Popularity of the great Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> himſelf, ſo much greater than a King, as that which makes is greater than that it makes: whoſe Hoſpitality may be ſuppoſed to have redounded ſo much to his own advantage, and the Intereſt of the <hi>York</hi> Family, which he had for a long time before eſpouſed, by the favour he gained thereby among the Commons of the Realm in general, and of the City in particular: For when he came to <hi>London,</hi> the Analiſt informs us he kept ſuch an Houſe, that ſix Oxen were eaten at a Breakfaſt, and every Tavern was full of his Meat, and whoſo had any acquaintance in his Houſe might have had as much Sodden and Roſt, as he might carry upon a long Dagger. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when upon diſguſt and diſcontent he had turned to the other ſide, and became a favourer of the <hi>Lancaſtrians,</hi> he was never the leſs diſappointed in his aims and expectations from the <hi>Londoners.</hi> For though by his turning ſides the <hi>York</hi> Party had been once routed, King <hi>Edward</hi> taken Priſoner, and King <hi>Henry</hi> reſettled once more on the Throne, and he had in a manner the whole power of the Land in his hands, beſides the general Love and Affection the Commons bore to him, and the dread and terror the ſound of his Name oft ſtruck into his Enemies Hearts, it having in effect altered the Fortune and turned the Scales in two Battels, one in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s days for the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40944:161"/>
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> for the <hi>Lancaſtrians,</hi> yet upon the return of King <hi>Edward</hi> from beyond Sea (whither he had ſome time before eſcaped out of Cuſtody) into <hi>England,</hi> to recover his Inheritance, and regain his Crown, and the News of his Marching up to <hi>London,</hi> both ſides (ſaith <hi>Baker)</hi> ſeeking to make the City their Friends, the Citizens backwardneſs to take up Arms in Defence of Old King <hi>Henry,</hi> his Crown and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inclination to Young King <hi>Edward,</hi> was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that <hi>Warwicks,</hi> own Brother, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> diſtruſting the Event, ſecretly ſought King <hi>Edwards</hi> Favour; he himſelf was received into <hi>London,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> was redelivered unto him, and the Great <hi>Warwick</hi> ſlain not long after at <hi>Barnet</hi> in a pitch'd Battell, to the utter Ruin of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Party for that Age, the conſequence of this overthrow being enough to read them their ſucceeding ill Fate at <hi>Tewksbury:</hi> they themſelves having ſufficient Cauſe to be daunted, with the loſs of their moſt powerful friends and favourers, and the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> to be fluſh'd with their Succeſs in gaining ſo important a Victory.</p>
            <p>As the Citizens continued thus favourable to the King, ſo I don't find them them chang'd and alter'd in ther Inclinations to the other ſide, till ſome of the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> themſelves, by their own hands, began to looſe and untye thoſe Bonds of Amity, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Fidelity, the Late King's Children being diſpoſſeſt by his own Brother, the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the ſurviving hopes of the <hi>Lancaſtrians,</hi> had openly declar'd his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſolemnly Sworn, to marry King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Eldeſt Daughter, the rightful Heir of all the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> Greatneſs, which afterwards was as honourably as honeſtly perform'd: whereby both Families became united in one Line, and the two Roſes happily inoculated each upon the other. The expreſſion
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40944:161"/>
I hope the ingenious Society of Gardiners and Floriſts will pardon me, if harmleſly guilty of an abſurdity in tranſlating the term from fruits to flowers.</p>
            <p>Did the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> appear ſo zealouſly on the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> behalf, and yield ſuch powerful aſſiſtance to carry on their deſigns? What other than can we expect with reaſon, but that King <hi>Edward</hi> behaved himſelf very gratefully towards that City, which Eſpouſed his flaughtered Fathers Cauſe, againſt even the Governing Party, and contributed ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his own Reſtauration. Though it is but too commonly ſeen that as mean ſervices are but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenced, or elſe wholly' ſlighted add forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſo an exceſs of merit too great to be rewarded, brings oftner danger than advantage to the party concerned. Evident examples whereof our own and Foreign Hiſtories can abundantly afford us, and it is well if the City of <hi>London</hi> could produce no experience of her own in confirmation of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and validity, while ſome others having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten well by their ſervices, to the facilitating their aſcent into high Places, have no better improved them in the Eyes of the World, than in keeping their Coaches, their Horſes, and their Miſſes, and made little other returns of thanks and gratitude to the City, but ſome ſmall ſlight acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and conceſſions, and perhaps a few verbal promiſes and aſſurance, or elſe forgetting their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer needs and neceſſities, have endeavoured, moſt ungratefully, to turn their power upon her, which they may be thought to have gained chiefly and principally by her means. But King <hi>Edward</hi> it ſeems, or thoſe about him had honeſter Principles in them, or were better tempered: For we find in <hi>Baker,</hi> that he furniſhed his Councel Table for the moſt part with ſuch as were gracious among the Citizens; and we Read in <hi>Stow</hi> of no leſs than
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40944:162"/>
eleven Aldermen, beſides the Lord Mayor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, Knighted by him at one time in the Highway betwixt <hi>Islington</hi> and <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> upon his return from the Battel at <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> in reward of the good ſervice the <hi>Londoners</hi> had done him. As for the jovial Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in <hi>Waltham</hi> Forreſt, by the Kings expreſs order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in his preſence, about an year before he dyed, 'tis a Subject Treated on by more <hi>English</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians than one, with the circumſtances and conſequents thereof, the pleaſant lodge of Green boughs ſet up on purpoſe for them, the Complemental condeſcention of the King, in refuſing to go to his own Dinner till he had ſaw them ſerved, the Hunting ſport he ſhewed them, the plenty of Veniſon he gave them at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and the noble Preſent of two Harts and ſix Bucks, with a Tun of Wine, he ſent to the Lady Mayoreſs, and her Siſters the Aldermens Wives, to make merry with, which they did afterwards at Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Hall: where without all peradventure, the Kings Health went all round the Table, if it was then in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhon, but for this I will not put one finger in the fire.</p>
            <p>If we dive into the reaſons of the variation of the Pole at <hi>London,</hi> and ſearch into the occaſional Cauſes of the manifeſt change and alteration of their Affections, from thr Family of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> we may impute it partly to the loſſes, croſſes, and unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful management of Affairs, under a weak King and a ſelf ſeeking Court of <hi>Lancaſtrians,</hi> but chiefly to the encreaſe of National grievances, without timely care taken to redreſs them, and the fixt Reſolution of the Court Party to oppreſs their oppoſites, the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> any manner of ways, by right or by wrong; for we may eaſily obſerve from Hiſtory and experience, ſuch to have been the uſual motives to diſguſts, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon incitements to diſcontent. Therefore I preſume I may draw hence better grounds and reaſons of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40944:162"/>
Cities Love to King <hi>Edward,</hi> than thoſe alledged by <hi>Baker</hi> out of <hi>Comines, (viz.</hi> that he got the Love of the <hi>Londoners</hi> by owing them Money, and the good will of the Citizens, by lying with their wives) as looking at firſt appearance too Comical and Jocular to be ſound, when ſifted to the bottom. Why elſe did this Experiment never ſucceed before nor ſince? I don't think but there have been other Princes, beſides this Amorous <hi>Yorkiſt,</hi> ſitting upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, whoſe Conſciences would never have boggled at bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing Money, and then Cornuting their Creditors, if this <hi>Recipe</hi> could have ſhewn its <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi> But whatever Reaſons Hiſtory or Phancy ſuggeſts, this is moſt undeniably certain, as being matter of fact, that the City was viſibly ingag'd in the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> Intereſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever that Family could attain to the height of their deſires. From whence I doubt not to conclude, that had the Citizens been otherwiſe inclin'd, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firm and fixt to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> might indeed have laid his Claim, and pleaded Title, with many other fair-ſpun pretences, (as the Prerogative of Birth, Priviledge of Law, the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of altering a Native Right by previous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, Vows, Oaths, or Preſcription, and the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of breaking the Thread of an Orderly Succeſſion) but, all this notwithſtanding, he might ſtill have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for ought we can be ſure of, far enough off from compaſſing his Ambitious Deſires, or from the poſſibility of coming within view of his Journeys End, the City ſtanding between him and the wiſhed for Haven. The Obſervation is obvious from ſeveral paſſages aforegoing. The City in it ſelf is too great to be over-aw'd, and her influence over the Country conſequently too powerful, to have it long quietly over-rul'd by any Party whatſoever, with whom ſhe refuſes to concur.</p>
            <p>Another Obſervation give me leave to make <hi>en</hi>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:40944:163"/>
               <hi>paſſant,</hi> and that ſhall be upon the time and ſeaſon, not of the Citizens manifeſting their Affections, but of their actual appearance in behalf of the Duke and his Party. This I obſerve to have been, not preſently and immediately in the fore-front, and the very firſt beginning, but upon the coming up of the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> to <hi>London</hi> with Swords by their ſides, and reſolution in their minds: So that they ſeem firſt to have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers, and then Seconds to the Dukes Party in their deſigns upon their open Declaration. Before that the Commonalty ſo openly and reſolutely refuſed to let Proviſions paſs to the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> Camp at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had declared himſelf in the midſt of his Friends and Adherents at <hi>London</hi> ready to aſſiſt him, and though he was then dead, having been ſlain in Battle, and the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> ſo near the City at that very ſame time, yet his Eldeſt Son being in the Head of an Army in the Country, was ſoon come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> received, Elected, approved, and ſet up for King by their approbation, conſent, and good liking. This likewiſe may be obſerved to have been the common cuſtom and uſage of the City, as an ordinary <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader may eaſily find in ſeveral places of this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a review, or careful recollection of what hath been before ſet down: or elſe to ſatisfie his Curioſity, without truſting to this Tranſcription, he may ſearch after the paſſages himſelf in ſuch Authentick Authors, as <hi>Fabian, Stow; Speed, Baker,</hi> or the like Chronicles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, which being eaſier met with than the Original Writers of theſe times, he will be put to the leſs trouble, upon any doubt occurring in any things here delivered for matter of Fact, in that I have choſe to draw up this Treatiſe for the moſt part out of theſe laborious Collectors. Where it is obſervable that the Cities inclinations being by ſome one or other overt act, as manifeſtly declared, or elſe plainly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or ſhrewdly gueſſed at, by the induſtry and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40944:163"/>
of the diſcrning Spirits of the Age, the diſcontented Nobles were quickly encouraged thereupon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to withdraw into the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> or the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there gathering together their Party, and Raiſing as great Forces as time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity would permit, away they come in all haſt, as faſt as they can, up to <hi>London,</hi> where being joyfully and gladly received, with great applauſe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Courtiers were often compelled to fly for their ſafety, and the Governing Party deſperſe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to try it out by dint of Sword, (at which they were commonly worſted) or elſe quietly yield to ſuch conditions, as would be approved in the City, and were acceptable to the Party, the reſult whereof ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally was the calling of a Parliament, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Subject, though the dread and fear of the Court. But for the better illuſtration of this remark, I ſhall produce modern experience, and inſtance in what hath hapned within the memory of thouſands yet living.</p>
            <p>That under the late Uſurpation the City was very deſirous of a Free-Parliament is not to be doubted of. And yet we find ſhe ſate ſtill quiet, and pretty well contented to outward appearance, (amidſt the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious changes from an Old Protector, to a New one, from that to the Rump, and thence to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Safety) as if over ridden, or like a wearied Beaſt, ſilently couching down under her heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, almoſt wholly inſenſible, and as one uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But as ſoon as General <hi>Monk,</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had openly declared his diſlike of the Armies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, and was come up from <hi>Coldſtream,</hi> amidſt the Viſits of the Gentry, and Acclamations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo near the City as <hi>Harbrow,</hi> we hear preſently of Commiſſioners come thither to him from the City, and their propoſing a re-admiſſion of the Secluded Members, that the Parliament might be made full and free. This
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40944:164"/>
was the firſt Publick Addreſs I meet with looking that way, but after this we read of many from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the Land, and almoſt all Counties of the ſame Nature with that from the Capital City of the Nation, as if all had been animated by the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Rays of her Inclinations, and her Reſults were the ſuperior faculties of the Soul, ove-ruling the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Members of the Body. But the City ſtaid not here, for as ſhe addreſſed, ſo ſhe was reſolved for a full houſe, before ſhe would pay any publick Taxes. And tho' <hi>Monk</hi> upon ſtricter declar'd Reſolutions put her into a great Conſternation for a time, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to over-aw her with his Soldiers, which was not in any wiſe expected at his hands, yet upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to her <hi>Common-Council,</hi> when he return'd the next day with his Army to regain their almoſt loſt favour, (and what then might not they have done of themſelves, when their amazement, ſprung from the ſuddenneſs of the unexpected ſurpriſe, was abated?) they approv'd of his Intentions to have the Houſe of Commons fill'd up, demonſtrated it with Bells and Bonfires, perſuaded and procured his continuance amongſt them; whereby his own Security was conſulted, and thoſe Deſigns moſt ſucceſsfully carried on, which laid the way open to his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Peaceable Reſtauration. For this Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the City with General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Reſolutions, brought about the Reſtitution of the <hi>Secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> that procured a free and fuller meeting of the Lords and Commons, and ſoon after the King was recall'd from his forced Exile, to the open Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Royal Power and Authority over theſe his Three Nations, and made his Publick Entrance in the greateſt Calm of Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility imaginable. Thanks to the Honourable City for concurring ſo unanimouſly to the Revival of the remaining part of the Old Parliament, which
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40944:164"/>
brought forth ſo Miraculous Effects, as to have an Injur'd and Exil'd Prince fully reſtor'd to his Throne, and yet the Glory of the Action not tinctur'd with Blood. Such was the Influence of <hi>Londons</hi> concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of <hi>Londons</hi> Power, of <hi>Londons</hi> Prayers.</p>
            <p>If then the many inſtances hitherto related, being conjoyn'd, riſe not up to a demonſtration, as much Mathematical, as the ſubject can bear, I know not what will. As for the truth of them, I defie any one to diſprove me, who hath but the leaſt grain of ſence and reaſon in him, and as much Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge as may amount to the ſixtieth part of a ſcruple. The particular reaſons of the Cities Potency have been ſhewn, and the general ground thereof is as plainly evident. For how can it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but that a City endowed with ſuch Royal Grants, fortified with ſo many and ſo great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and exalted to the heighth of Grandeur, by the vaſtneſs of her Trade; multitude of her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Wealth and Riches of her Inhabitants, Spirit and Courage of her Citizens, Statelineſs of her Buildings, Preheminances of her Antiquity, Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of her Scituation, and Regular Order of her Government, ſo Ennobled with the higheſt Courts of Judicature for the Law, adorned with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Churches for the Goſpel, and frequented by Strangers from all parts of the habitable World, the Receptacle of all Arts and Sciences, the Haunt of the Commonalty, the Delight of the Gentry, the Habitation of the Nobility, the Reſidence of the King, and Glory of the whole Nation; ſo pleaſant to Admiration; and ſo populous to a Wonder, where many Scores, if not Hundreds of Thouſands, can be Raiſed and Armed in a few Hours Warning. How, I ſay, can it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but that ſuch a City muſt needs highly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, over-rule and over-awe the Counſels of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40944:165"/>
and turn the Inclinations of the People whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe pleaſe? For Nature generally uſes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ordinary means and methods, and I do not ſee that the All-powerful God of Nature often diverts her Courſe, or works Wonders and Miracles in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age and Seaſon. Now that <hi>London</hi> is ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I appeal to Hiſtory and Experience for my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Obſervations I had to make concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glories of the City of <hi>London</hi> and the Influences ſhe had upon the grand Concerns of the Nation, in that great and famous Conteſt between the two Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York</hi> (through the moſt conſiderable part whereof I have hitherto traced her Actions) wherein finding her moſt triumphant, amidſt the great variety of the publick Tranſactions of theſe times, I think it not much material to give ſo diſtinct a Relation of her private Affairs, though among them I might likewiſe find many things moſt worthy of Remak, as haſtening apace towards the Concluſion of this Treatiſe, that it may not ſwell into too great a bulk, to the Reader's Diſcouragement, and the wearying out of his Patience, I fear, already almoſt tired. Wherefore, as to what concerns the private Troubles of the City, the Tumults, Riots and Inſurrections ſprung up out of her own Bowels in theſe perilous Times, and happily ſuppreſt by the Power of her Majeſtrates, and the accidental Caſualties happening within her Liberties: or elſe the many Benefits accruing to her, by the Care and Vigilance of her chief Officers, the good Rule and Order of her Government, the ſtrict Obſervation of her particular Ordinances, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Execution her Injunctions: Or as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the external Augmentation of her Honour, her Splendor and Renown, by the Reparation of her Walls, Renovation of her publick Structures, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and erecting of new Fabricks, I paſs them all over
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40944:165"/>
without a more particular mention, (ſending the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inquiſitive to the Chronicles, <hi>Baker</hi>'s eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who hath treated purpoſely of ſuch remarkables in diſtinct Sections, at the end of the Kings Lives) as not ſo pertinent to my preſent deſign, tho' in other Kings Reigns I may have here and there touch'd upon ſome ſuch Remarks: And ſhall direct the Reader with an Inſtance of the Courage of ſome bold ſpirited women of the City, having hitherto entertain'd him with the Heroick and Illuſtrious Acts only of the other Sex. The Relation I have out of <hi>Stow,</hi> who places it in the Seventh of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1428. where, after mention made of a Parliament Aſiembled at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> that Year, he gives it us in theſe words.</p>
            <q>In this Parliament there was one Mrs. <hi>Stokes,</hi> with divers other ſtout Women of <hi>London,</hi> of good recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, well Apparell'd, came openly to the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of Parliament, and deliver'd Letters to the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and to the Arch-Biſhops, and to the other Lords there preſent, containing matter of Rebuke, and ſharp reprehenſion of the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> becauſe he would not deliver his Wife <hi>Jaqueline</hi> out of her grievous Impriſonment; being then held Priſoner by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her there to remain ſo unkindly, and for his publick keeping by him another Adultreſs, contrary to the Law of God, and the honourable Eſtate of Matrimony.</q>
            <p> Bold words and bold women. For this Duke was then Lord Protector of the Realm, and ſo confequently of great Power, Place, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therein. But theſe were <hi>Londoners</hi> that durſt be ſo couragious, as to ſay, to Princes, <hi>Ye are Wicked,</hi> and then the wonder is not altogether ſo great, on one hand, that they dar'd to reprehend the great ones of the Age, and on the other, that we ſtill find ſuch Heroical Spirits in the City, ſince they ſpring from ſuch a Race both by the Fathers ſide, and the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40944:166"/>
Mothers. The <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians celebrates the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that Noble Matron, who came into open Court, and with ſo undaunted a ſpirit of boldneſs, pleaded her own Cauſe, to the great amazement of the Senate for the preſent, that they made an Order to forbid the like for the future. What Viragoes then were theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Matrons of <hi>London,</hi> that in open Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament durſt reprove the Nobles to their faces, and were not afraid to attempt to teach our Senators wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? wherein they may ſeem to have out-did that fam'd <hi>Roman</hi> Matron, in that what ſhe did may be thought to have proceeded from ſelf-love and ſelf-defence, whereas theſe with a greater Courage eſpous'd another Cauſe, an exceſs of Charity and Humanity, and, inſtead of ſtaying for an opportunity of defending their own Intereſt upon occaſion or neceſſity, durſt volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily make an onſet on the more powerful with ſharp rebukes, for neglecting the diſtreſſed, and refuſing to aſſiſt the poor, weak, and diſconſolate. So that the Royal City of <hi>London</hi> appears emulous of the Old Imperial City of <hi>Rome,</hi> both in the Courage of the Women, and valour of her men: as if reſolved not to yield to her Fame on any account in Glory and Merit, nor come behind her in the Heroick Acts of either of the Sexes, while one continues as potent in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> World, by the Spirit of the Citizens and influence of her Actions, as the other once was famous for her Arms all over <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> And who knows whitherto ſhe may come in time, as how far the Fates, or rather Providence, have decreed to advance her? Was ſhe ſo powerful ſo many Ages ſince, what is ſhe now, ſince that ſhe's very much encreaſed in the Strength and Number of her Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and her private Buildings are reform'd from Wood and Earth into Brick, and publick into Stone, low humble Cottages into ſtately Edifices, and who dares be ſo poſitive to aver, that they may not in time, be chang'd into Marble?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:40944:166"/>
Hitherto have I treated the <hi>Reader</hi> with variety of Proofs and Evidences ſufficiently (I hope) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative of the Repute, Fame, Honour, Glory, and Renown, Magnificence, Grandeur, Strength, Power and Influence of this ſo <hi>Triumphant a City,</hi> whoſe Approbation and Aſſiſtance, hath ſetled Kings upon their Thrones, and the diſſatisfaction of whoſe Inhabitants hath ſometimes left the way open to the ruine of Princes; In the Examples and Inſtances whereof, the Concurrence of her Citizens was, for the moſt part, general and univerſal, at leaſt ſo far as concern'd the <hi>Majority.</hi> But now I ſhall produce an Inſtance (and not eaſie perhaps to be parallell'd, from either Divine or prophane Writings,) to ſhew, how influential the bare ſhadow of her Name hath been in State-Affairs, and how contributary to the transforming of a Subject into a King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent aſſent of the Main Body of this ancient Corporation; which I am ſo far from thinking a diminution of her Glory, that I rather look upon it, as here circumſtantiated, to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the City's great Power, Reputation, and Eſteem, under this Conſideration;</p>
            <p>That if that aſpiring Protector, the bloody Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> better known by the Name of <hi>Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back'd Richard the Third,</hi> could do ſo much by the ſhadow, what might he not have done, could he have but enjoyed the ſubſtance? As in Divinity, Circumſtances make many an Action good or bad: ſo in Hiſtory, the Deſign and Event not ſeldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles or debaſes an Enterprize. 'Tis not ſo much the bare Act, or thing done, in this particular, that is to make good my Aſſertion, as the Deduction from the Conſequences thereof, whether real or deſigned, which come now to be related in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:40944:167"/>
When that ambitious, Crook-back'd <hi>Duke,</hi> upon his Brother's Death, had got his eldeſt Son and Heir, and the rightful King, into his hands, and by treacherous Plots, devis'd Crimes, and falſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations, taken away the Lives of thoſe true and truſty Friends of the old King, that were moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue faithful to his young Son and Heir in his Minority, and loyally ſtand by him with their Lives and Fortunes, againſt the open Attempts or ſecret Deſigns of his Treacherous Uncle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by remov'd many of the Rubs out of the way to his aſpir'd greatneſs. His next Care was to get the Peoples Conſent to the turning of his Ducal Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net into a Regal Crown, and their Concurrence to acknowledge him for their King, whereas before he was but Protector. But how ſhould this be done? A Pretence muſt be found to cajole them, ſeeing that he had ſo little Equity and Juſtice on his ſide to confirm them to him. The City of <hi>London</hi> was known to be powerful and populous, and their Example was thought to do much with the reſt of the Nation, to make them, if not approve, at leaſt connive at his Nephew's Depoſition, and his own Exaltation, therefore the Citizens were to be Careſs'd, and their Approbation to be ſought. Whereupon he ſeeks for and procures Inſtruments fit for his turn, that, to honour his ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſtuck not openly to turn <hi>Renegado's</hi> to Truth, Honeſty and Loyalty, ſo that they migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Among whom none of the leſs noted, nor leaſt uſeful, are reckon'd the preſent Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> (a Man of a proud Heart, and highly deſirous of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, how little ſoever he deſerv'd it) and two <hi>brazen-fac'd</hi> Sons of the Church, both great Preachers, of more Learning than Virtue, of more
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40944:167"/>
Fame than Learning. So uſeful hath the Pulpit in the Church been always thought to carry on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues in the State. The Contrivance was firſt to prepare the People and break the Matter at <hi>Paul</hi>'s-Croſs, and then Motion it to the Citizens at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> to accompliſh which, and bring his purpoſe to perfection, the Duke cared not, ſo his dead Father were thought, or call'd, a Cuckold; his Mother, a Whore; his Brethren, Baſtards; and his Nephew, illegitimate; to the ſhame of the whole Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> ſuch Fires of Ambition rul'd and rag'd in his Heart. The flattering Clergy-men readily did their Parts in the Pulpit, as far as they were able, but with ſo ill ſucceſs to the Duke's Cauſe, and their own Reputation, that he was wholly diſappointed of the deſir'd Acclamations, and they loſt their Credit and Eſtimation among the People ever after. One loſt his <hi>Life</hi> after his Sermon, the other his <hi>Voice</hi> in the midſt of his Preaching, and ſo was forc'd to leave off and come down.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs away go we, the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following the Doctor's Sermon, to <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and there we find the Mayor upon the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> and all the Aldermen aſſembled about him, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the City gather'd before them. To whom the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> newly come thither, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with divers Lords and Knights from the Court, makes a long and large Oration about the Grievances under the late King, his many unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Taxations, great Severities, and the looſeneſs of his Life, (to caſt dirt thus upon the late King's Government, was thought then, it ſeems, an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Means, to make way for this <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor)</hi>

of a King, hoping by his many Arguments and Perſwaſions, with the volubility of his Tongue, to obtain the Citizens Concurrence in a full Cry of of King <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Richard.</hi> But they were, it ſeems by the ſtory, very deaf of hearing on that Ear, to his no little wonder and amazement. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon further conſultation with the Mayor and others privy to the Deſign, <hi>Buckingham</hi> reſumes his Diſcourſe, and rehearſes the ſame over again with a louder Voice, as if the Citizens had not all heard, or not well underſtood the meaning of his former Speech. But neither did this move their Affections, nor produce a Word in favour of the Motion from the Auditors. Then Mr. Recorder, by the Mayor's Advice, was pitch'd upon to ſecond the Duke, upon hopes that it might be better accepted from him, as the publick Mouth of the City. Full loth, we may well think, was he, an honeſt Man, and newly come to his Honour and Preferment, having never ſpoken to the Citizens before from that place, to begin upon ſo harſh and unpleaſing a Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But however the Mayor's Commands muſt be obey'd.

they could get none? Hitherto not a word of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, what muſt be done next? Why? when we deſpair of Citizens Words and Wiſhes, we'll e'en pretend to reject them, as uſeleſs and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſeeing they will not be model'd to our minds. And therefore at laſt the Citizens are plainly told, that all the Nobles of the Realm are reſolv'd already upon the Point, (a thing as true, as the Mayor was Honeſt, or the Duke Loyal) and their ultimate Anſwer was demanded. Upon which follow'd ſecret Whiſperings, and a confuſed Bur, among the People, till at laſt ſome of the Duke's Servants, and others of their procuring, (Prentices, and other Lads, thruſt into the Hall among the Preſs) ſet up their Notes at the lower end, threw up their Caps in token of Joy, and loudly cry out upon King <hi>Richard.</hi> This the Duke and Mayor, ſeeing they could have not better, take advantage of, and would have it forſooth paſs for an unanimous Conſent, and the univerſal Approbation of the City, though the whole multitude of Citizens anſwer'd them not a word, only caſt back their heads, and marvelled what thoſe meant behind them, with their whoopings and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings. A goodly Cry, quoth the Duke, and thanks them, and ſo departs.</p>
            <p>The next News we hear is of a Petition immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, the Morrow after, to the Protector at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s Caſtle, to take upon him the Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Realm, as rightful King, to which, with much ado and intreaty, (poor Man!) he at laſt yielded, as if altogether compell'd, through meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and others importunity, the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> coming in the Name of himſelf, the Lord Mayor and his Brethren, as indeed we find them there amongſt others, to ſee this notorious piece of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation acted over. So ſlips this diſſembling <hi>Yorkiſt</hi>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:40944:169"/>
into the Throne, over his young Nephew's head (whom afterwards he cruelly caus'd to be murder'd) is Crowned, and Reigns as King for a time, the Holla's and Huzza's of a few Courtiers and Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices being impos'd upon the Nation, for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent of the City of <hi>London,</hi> though the Duke's Party could not obtain ſo much as that Complement from the Citizens themſelves. Seeing therefore they could not embrace the Subſtance, they were reſolv'd, I would ſay, to graſp at the Shadow, were I ſure the Criticks would not Cenſure the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion. For being not able to prevail upon the Maſters, they endeavour'd to try Experiments on the Apprentices, and failing of the Majority of the Men, are content to be playing with the Boys: And if this now may be call'd the Concurrence of the City, 'tis eaſie doubtleſs to be had at any time with Feaſting and Fudling. Let the diſtruſtful, or evil thinking perſon, conſult Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi> about the Life and Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, and then he may ſee Authority enough for the precedent Relation.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the Duke is mounted at laſt up into the Saddle, and from a Protector, that might have been legal, he becomes a King moſt unlawfully, by very unjuſt Means and indirect Methods, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding his poor innocent Nephew of his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and afterwards depriving him of his Life, aſperſing his own Mother with Adultery, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Baſtardy to his Brethren, and bringing a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Reflection upon his Father. But can we think ſuch an ill-gotten Crown could ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper with him? No ſure: 'Twas improbable, and impoſsible. The Furies are ſtirr'd up to torment him, for Providence ſleeps not, nor could Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance lag long behind. The City never gave her
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40944:169"/>
full conſent, notwithſtanding all the endeavours of that falſe Knave her Mayor, therefore ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and occaſion enough for the deepeſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſee her Name without her Authority baſely abus'd by Treachery and Deceit, to promote other Mens corrupt Deſigns, and the Duke ſo lately tranſpos'd into a King, ſufficient Grounds for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fears, Jealouſies and Suſpicious, about the fickleneſs and unſetledneſs of his own State and Condition, being ſo inſecure and uncertain of the City's hearty good will and affections, as knowing the Cheat he had newly put upon the Nation, and the Affront he had offered to the whole Body of the Citizens, in making uſe of their Names without their Conſent and Concurrence, to ſettle himſelf in his intended Uſurpation. <hi>Boſworth-field</hi> alſo is drawing nigh a pace, where he ſhall be forc'd to pay Nature her laſt Debt, Juſtice ſhall have her due, and a full period ſhall be put to all his villanous Acts and Enterprizes, after a ſhort Reign or Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of two Years, two Months, and a Day or two, the ſhorteſt Term by far of any Kings Reign ſince the firſt <hi>William,</hi> unleſs we admit <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, for Method and Cuſtomes ſake, into the Number of our Kings, who for Ten Weeks ſpace bore the Name, though it may be more properly call'd the Tyranny of the Duke, than the Reign of the King.</p>

The Habit of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens, were either Scarlet or Violet, and his Reception was in great State and Pomp, they meeting him in orderly Array without the City, and ſo conveying him through it to St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> Neither may we think him inſenſible of their Favours, if <hi>Baker</hi> records the truth, as indeed I am not able on any good grounds to contradict him, when he ſays, that the City of <hi>London</hi> was this King's Paradice, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably conſute the Reaſons he gives for his Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That what good Fortune ſoever befel him, he thought he enjoy'd it not, till he acquainted them with it. And can we fancy he had not good Grounds and Inducements, for this honourable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their Kindneſs and Goodneſs ſhewn him by them, beſides the firſt Expreſſions thereof in the beginning of his Reign, when he was ſo far from being well warm'd in his Seat, that he was not yet enter'd upon the Throne by the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Coronation, nor had taken poſſeſſion of the Government with the uſual Ceremonies and Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Formalities?</p>

Neither do I find the City at any time complaining, or oppoſing, or joyning with his Enemies: For notwithſtanding his ſettlement on the Throne, and his uniting the two Families into one, by marrying <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's eldeſt Daughter, he had a <hi>Lambert</hi> and a <hi>Perkin</hi> to diſturb his Quiet and Repoſe, about Title.

Whereof we may well believe the King was very ſenſible, and ſo were the oppoſers of his peaceable tranquility, were it only from this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that when, in the Second of his Reign, it was bleer'd about by his Enemies, that the Earl of <hi>Warwick, George,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarences</hi> Son, was eſcap'd out of the Tower, and a counterfeited Earl was provided to act the part of the true one, to draw People to their Aſſiſtance, (which might have created no little trouble to the King, and greatly endanger'd his Perſon and Dignity) to diſappoint and fruſtrate their Deſigns, and fully lay open the Cheat, of all Parties and Places of his Kingdom, he choſe <hi>London,</hi> to ſhew therein the right Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> to the People, though the principal Scene
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40944:171"/>
of thoſe Affairs were then laid in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the other ſide appear'd ſo fearful of the Effect thereof upon the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and their Influence doubtleſs upon the reſt of the Nation, even <hi>Ireland</hi> it ſelf, though ſo far diſtant, that to buoy up the Spirits of their own Party, they thought it moſt effectual to report about the Iſland, that that was a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit purpoſely train'd and taught by King <hi>Henry,</hi> and ſhew'd by him in <hi>London,</hi> to blind the Eyes of the Simple and Ignorant. So ſollicitous were both to encreaſe the number of their Adherents, and draw the People of the Land to a belief of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and ſincerity of their Intentions, and Equity of their Actions, among whom the City of <hi>London</hi> is certainly the greateſt Body, fitly joyn'd together by good Laws and Conſtitutions, greatly confirm'd by an orderly ſucceſſion of her Magiſtrates, and much ſtrengthned by a long and large train of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Succeſſes. But the City continued fix to the King's Intereſt, and therefore the others Devices and Pretences work'd little or nothing upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. They were rather ready to rejoyce on all occaſions for his victorious Succeſs, than pron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to take part with his Enemies againſt him, whereof they gave him ſufficient Teſtimonies at ſeveral times and ſeaſons, when they had opportunity to expreſs their Affections, in a more free and open way, at ſuch glorious Solemnities, as Coronations, Inſtalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, publick Receptions, and Royal and Princely Marriages.</p>
            <p>'Tis confeſs'd, that, towards the latter end of this King's Reign, ſome of her principal Officers, her Mayors and Sheriffs, were ſore troubled and vext in the King's Courts, and large Sums of Money demanded of them, for things pretended to be done by them illegally in their Offices, and ſuch of them
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40944:171"/>
impriſon'd, as refus'd to pay thoſe Arbitrary Fines, as may be ſeen in <hi>Stow</hi>'s Annals; but theſe were Troubles only of particular Men, and common alſo to many others of the King's Subjects, when <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> were got into Authority, and, to humour the old King's covetous itch after Riches, (a Vice incident moſtly to Old Age) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd old forgotten Laws, and rais'd large Sums of Money upon Offences againſt Penal Statutes; wherein they acted ſo exorbitantly, and took ſuch arbitrary, illegal and unjuſt Ways, (many whereof <hi>Baker</hi> reckons up in his Chronicle) to compaſs their Ends, that they themſelves at length were become the principal Grievances of the Nation, and ſuffered accordingly in the beginning of the next King's Reign, both of them by the hands of Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to pay their Heads for ſatisfaction to the People, and their Promoters moſt ſhamefully Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory'd and Impriſon'd. So little did it avail them, to pretend they put the Laws in Execution, or to call themſelves the King's Promoters or Informers. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, as ſoon as he came to the Crown, more regarding the Commons Crys, and the Complaints of his People, than he valued the pretended Loyalty of ſuch profligate Villains, as had no other way to pick up a Livelihood, than by raking it out of other Mens Miſeries and Troubles.</p>
            <p>This Prince in his youth was ſo much addicted to Pleaſures, and Paſtimes, fine Sights and Shews, Masks, Juſts, and Tournaments, and in his elder years to Cruelty and Tyrannical Oppreſſion, that one might be apt to expect, and perhaps with ſome colour of reaſon, that little was to be found in <hi>London,</hi> in the beginning of this King's Reign, but Jollity, Joy, and Rejoycing, gaudy Shews,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40944:172"/>
and pleaſing Objects, delightful to the Eye, and grateful to Senſe, a King's Example commonly drawing along with it his Subjects Imitation; and that in the latter end, ſcarce any durſt preſume, to make oppoſition to a Man of ſo domineering a Spirit, as, by his own death-bed Confeſſion, never ſpar'd Woman in his Luſt, nor Man in his Anger: And yet notwithſtanding we meet with, under this Prince, Inſtances of the City's Power, Boldneſs, and undaunted Reſolution, and of the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Citizens.</p>
            <p>The laſt may haply be concluded, even from the Effects of evil <hi>May-day,</hi> when we read of the King's pardoning the many hundreds Indicted for that day's Riot and Inſurrection, at the three Queens interceſſion, upon Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s Advice, and perchance in Complaiſance to the City. Not to mention that eminent Inſtance, of the King's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Love, and Affection to the City, when, in ſo great a ſcarcity of Bread therein, that many died for meer want, he freely and frankly ſent thither, out of his own Proviſions, 600 Quarters of Corn, which ſerv'd for a very ſeaſonable Supply, till more could be brought from other Parts. But as to the former, I dare aver it from the conſequence of the Conteſt, between the City and the Cardinal, in the 17th year of this King, out of <hi>Stow,</hi> and thence prove, beyond denial, how like her ſelf the City always continued, in oppoſing the Arbitrary Power and Exorbitances of over grown Favourites.</p>
            <p>Commiſſions were ſent forth, by Order of the Council, into every Shire, to Levy the Sixth Part of every Man's Subſtance, towards the King's paſſage into <hi>France,</hi> but this was ſo vehemently oppos'd by the People, as contrary to ancient Laws and Cuſtoms, and not granted by the Paliament,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40944:172"/>
that the King thought good to deny, that he ever knew of that Demand, and, by ſoothing Letters, ſent to <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, he requeſted only his Subjects Benevolence. This was a Term more plauſible, than a ſet Demand, and a fix'd Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and the Cardinal forſooth would needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake perſonally to induce the City's conſent thereto, and therefore ſent for the Mayor, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the moſt ſubſtantial Common-Councel-Men, to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> thinking by fair Speeches, good Words, and large Promiſes, to have overper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them. To him indeed they lent their Ears, but we don't find them over haſty to part with their Purſes. However they ſent Deputies to him, Four Aldermen and Twelve Commoners, to return him their thanks, and every Alderman aſſembles his Ward, and makes a Motion for a Benevolence, which was openly deny'd them by the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then the Cardinal ſends again for the Mayor, and his Brethren, who informs him what they had done. Whereupon he would have examined them apart, and demands a benevolence of them in the King's Name: But for Anſwer, was told, by a City Councellor, that the Motion was againſt an Act of Parliament, which could not be diſprov'd, though it was in part gain-ſaid. Thereupon the Mayor reſolutely denies to grant any thing; ſo that upon his coming home to <hi>London,</hi> all publick endeavours were laid by, and it was declar'd, that every man ſhould come to the Cardinal, and grant privily what he would. This was ſo little grateful to the Citizens, and upon the Mayor's endeavours to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie them, by promiſing they ſhould be gently treated, and exhorting them to go when ſent for, they were ſo highly offended thereat, that in their
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40944:173"/>
fury, they would have had ſeveral expell'd the Common-Councel, and ſo without further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, angrily departed home. Whereby we may be well aſſur'd of the truth of <hi>Hall</hi>'s Obſervation, that though the Mayor and Aldermen had granted the Demand, the Common-Councel would never have aſſented; For we muſt know, this was done at the Common-Councel call'd the next day after my Lord Mayor came from Court. The Reſult therefore of all was in the Iſſue, that the King openly proteſts, in a great Council, call'd at <hi>York-place,</hi> now <hi>White-hall,</hi> that his mind was never to ask any thing of his Commons, that might ſound to the breach of the Laws, and ſo this Project was rejected, and laid aſide, by order of the Kings Letter ſent into all Counties. For ſeeing that the City refuſed, how was it poſſible to perſwade the Country, who look upon <hi>London</hi> as their principal Guide and Directreſs, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſquare their Actions by the Citizens Rule? Doth not then this ſeem a clear Example of the <hi>Londoners</hi> conſtant fixedneſs to their old Principles of Liberty? And if the Reader likewiſe pleaſe, it may paſs for an Inſtance of the Citizens diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Mayor's Reſolves, and the prevalency of the Commonalty over the Magiſtracy, when reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in their juſt oppoſition.</p>
            <p>As an Overplus, I ſhall caſt in a Paſſage out of <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicles, where we find it upon Record, under the Title of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how that, when in the Fourteenth Year, a Tenth Part of all Mens Subſtance was required by the Cardinal, towards the Charges of the King's Wars, and he would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had every Man
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40944:173"/>
ſworn to tell what he was worth. The <hi>Londoners</hi> thinking this very hard, they were thereupon excus'd for taking the Oath, and allowed to bring in their Bills upon their Honeſties: from whence may be argued, either the Strength, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Power of this honourable City, whom the Court, nor the Cardinal, durſt not diſpleaſe, or the great reſpect then ſhewn her, in regard of thoſe many glorious Rays of Influence ſhe ſheds all over all the Land, when the Word of a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen went as far, and was as well accepted, as another Man's Oath.</p>
            <p>If ſuch then was the Honour and Reſpect of the City heretofore, what may we think it to be, now that <hi>London</hi> hath ſince receiv'd ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable an Addition, and Augmentation, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſpects, by the happy concurrence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Circumſtances to render it eternally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>Was this City able to hold a Conteſt with ſo grand a Favourite and potent a Courtier, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> and at laſt to come off with flying Colours, to the vindicating her own Rights, and the Liberties of all the Nation beſides, and the forcing King <hi>Henry</hi> in the ſtrength of his Age, as ſtout as he was, to ſo great a Compliance, as hath been hinted before? 'Tis plain then, ſhe was ſtrong, and her Citizens not deſtitute of Spirit. Did the King, as cruel as he was to others of his Subjects, ſhew himſelf favourable to <hi>London?</hi> 'Tis evident, he had great cauſe and reaſon ſo to do, unleſs he was deſirous to be tax'd with ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſo un-Prince-like a Crime. For we may
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40944:174"/>
obſerve the Citizens were ready enough to pleaſe him in any thing, wherein their All was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and in that I never yet found them ever prone to humour the Follies of any King living. Witneſs their readineſs on all Occaſions for the Honour of the King, to appear in the moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Equipage on publick Solemnities.</p>
            <p>Among which, the moſt remarkable, in my Opinion, were the Coronation of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> Mother of the never to be forgotten Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> of bleſſed Memory, with the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives thereto, the Celebrity of her Attendance by Water, from <hi>Greenwich</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and her honourable Conveyance from thence through the City, amidſt the great variety of pleaſing Shews, and delightful Objects, to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> particulariz'd in <hi>Stow,</hi> and the glorious appearance of the Citizens, at the great Muſter in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s-Park, <hi>May</hi> the 8th, <hi>Anno</hi> 31. to the Number of Fifteen Thouſand, in bright ſhining Armour, with Coats of white Silk or Cloth, and Chains of Gold, where the Citizens ſtrove in ſuch ſort to exceed each other in bravery of Arms, and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Service, as if the City had been a Camp, and they not Men of the Gown, but all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Soldiers, which they perform'd to their great Coſt, but greater Commendation, ſaith Sir <hi>Richard Baker.</hi> But the greateſt Inducement may be ſuppoſed to have been, that they never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd prone to join with the King's Enemies, of which he had good ſtore abroad, beſides Domeſtick Troubles and private Inſurrections at home, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the latter end of his Reign, when he had taken away the Pope's Supremacy, excluded
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40944:174"/>
his Authority, and ſuppreſſed the Abbies and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, the chief Fortreſſes and Pillars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, either by force of an Act of Parliament, or by vertue of the Reſignations of their Governours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-aw'd by fear, or brib'd with Penſions: Not long after which there were ſeveral Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Land, which might have much ſhaken the Throne, had the Citizens openly ſhew'd any inclination to joyn with theſe diſturbers of the Kings reſt and repoſe, but they continuing quiet, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe troubles were quickly compos'd, and ſo the foundation, undeſignedly doubtleſs, was laid for a publick Reformation, which was more vigorouſly carried on in the next Kings Reign, though I hardly think it hath yet arriv'd to ſuch perfection, as to render it ſo compleat, as might be piouſly deſired.</p>
            <p>Short was the Reign of this pious Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, yet not ſo ſhort, but that it gave ſuch an Addition of ſtrength to the Proteſtant Religion, by removing out of the way many of the Relicks of Popery, and openly encouraging the Preaching of the Goſpel, that hitherto it could never be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Land, notwithſtanding the damage it ſuſtained under the next Succeſſor, a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and rigid Papiſt, and the many ſecret Plots and practices of Popiſh Emiſſaries, to undermine it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Popery again into <hi>England,</hi> prov'd upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus was the outward face of Religion viſibly chang'd in the City, under this Religious King, but yet her power we find not in the leaſt dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor the eſteem our great men had thereof, of which we meet with an evident inſtance in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, on account of the difference ariſen between the potent Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſome of the Privy Council, on the one hand, and the Lord Protector <hi>Seymour,</hi> the Kings M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40944:175"/>
The Privy Counſellors, having deſigns upon the Protector, and withdrawing themſelves from Court, got to <hi>London</hi> with their attendance, and taking poſſeſſion of the Tower, made it their buſineſs to ſecure the City to their ſide, by ſending for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to <hi>Ely</hi> houſe in <hi>Holborn,</hi> where they were aſſembled, and entertaining them with a long Oration, about the ill government of the Protector, and the many miſchiefs, that came thereby (as they affirm'd) upon the Kingdom, attended with a requeſt of their joynt aſſiſtance, to help them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him, wherein they were ſo ſucceſsful, that, upon the arrival of two Letters almoſt at the ſame inſtant to the Common Council held at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> one from the King and Lord Protector for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the City to be arm'd in defence of the Kings Perſon, and the other from the Lords to have two thouſand men to aid them, with the ſame Plea, for defence of the Kings Perſon, and that the City ſhould be well kept with Watches day and night, the Citizens ſhew'd themſelves ſo inclinable to the Lords, that they arm'd an hundred horſe men, and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot men, in defence of the City, ſuitable to the motion of the Lords, and ſent no Aſſiſtance to the Protector, though it had been deſir'd in the Kings Name, but rather ſuffered a Proclamation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining diverſe Articles againſt him, to be made in ſeveral Parts of the City, and the Lords were entertain'd with a Dinner at one of the Sheriffs, the eighth of <hi>October</hi> after they had been themſelves in Perſon at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and on the tenth they din'd at the other Sheriffs; after that by a Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil the ſame day, in <hi>Stows</hi> Computation, five hundred men of the City had been granted to be ready on the next morning. Evident marks, ſigns, and tokens doubtleſs which way the City bended,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40944:175"/>
and the event is a ſufficient confirmation thereof. For the next News, we hear, is the removal of the Protector from about the King, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to the Tower, within two or three days after, where an humble Confeſſion and Submiſſion was his beſt ſecurity for that time, by which he got his Liberty ſome time after, and was ſworn again a Privy Counſellor, but no more a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector.</p>
            <p>Had the City ſent him the Aid requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſted, he would poſſibly have had little reaſon to have ſtood infear of the combined Lords, or had but her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates continued Neuters in the Caſe, and not been ſo openly favourable to his Enemies, he might perhaps have been able enough to have cop't with them, with little or no bazard, for he had raiſed much People about <hi>Hampton Court</hi> in the Kings Name, and conveyed him to <hi>Windſor</hi> with a great number of Horſemen and Footmen; But the Strength and Authority of the City was not to be contradicted, much leſs oppoſed. Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector loſt his Place, and well it might have been haply for the King and Nation, if that had been all. For his Enemies having remov'd him from his Protectorſhip, and thereby gain'd the greater acceſs of Power to themſelves, and the Principal of them the politick Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> lately cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> advanced in Title and Honour equal with, and in Authority and Power above the higheſt, whereby his aſpiring thoughts were grown ripe to be put in execution, they were reſolv'd to have the other touch with him for his Life, wherein they made uſe of the Cities Power to ſecure them for his Tryal, by ordering every Houſholder in <hi>London</hi> to take care of his own Family, keep his houſe, and have one ready in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40944:176"/>
arms upon call for the day time, and that by Night a ſufficient Watch of ſubſtantial Houſholders ſhould be kept in every Ward. So litte durſt they attempt without ingaging the City therein, and ſo frail and tranſitory had been their projecting deſigns, had ſhe refuſed. But with her concurrence what could they not do? So then at laſt tryed the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was, acquitted of Treaſon, and condemned for Felony, and afterwards beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> much againſt the Kings Will, the Conſtables of every Ward in <hi>London</hi> (by vertue of a Precept directed from the Council to the Lord Mayor) ſtrictly charging the Citizens not to ſtir out of their houſes before a prefixt hour, for fear perhaps of a Reſcue, for 'twas known he was well belov'd gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the People, and plainly evidenced, when, upon a miſtake thinking him acquitted, they gave ſo great a ſhout for joy, that it was heard <hi>(Stow</hi> tells us) from <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> to <hi>Long-Arce,</hi> to the Lords aſtoniſhment. So fell <hi>Sommerſet</hi> by the malice of his Enemies and weakneſs of his Friends; and we may eaſily believe 'twas not deſign'd the King ſhould be long liv'd, if ſome could prevent it, For they, that ſhot off his good Uncle's Head, would hardly ſtick at attempting ſecretly upon his health and ſecurity, who otherwiſe might have liv'd to avenge the Protectors Death.</p>
            <p>But the chief Projector <hi>Northumberland</hi> had but little joy of his ambitious deſigns, though King <hi>Edward</hi> was dead and he had got his two Siſters put by, and the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> his Daughter in Law proclaimed Queen of the Realm, by ſound of Trumpet, through <hi>London.</hi> For when he might have thought himſelf moſt ſecure, then was he moſt diſappointed, and he, that could do ſo much in the City with the Magiſtracy, either for fear or love,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40944:176"/>
quickly loſt that branch of his Power, when he was gone from the City, though at the head of an Army, and thereby, in effect, his Life. The ſame Mayor who had before conſented in appearance to ſecure the City for the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> a little after, upon a motion from the Council, going ſtraight ways and proclaming the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> Queen: And then ſhe was quickly acknowledged for ſuch all over the Land. So that here we ſee two Queens proclaimed in <hi>London</hi> within a very ſhort ſpace of time; but ſhe, who was laſt proclaimed and the Citizens ſtuck to, continued Queen, and the other was laid by as uſeleſs, and afterwards brought to the Block as a guilty Criminal. Had the City ſtuck to the firſt, the other probable had ſtill been counted the Offendor, and might perhaps have ſuffered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: But the Stream was turn'd with the Tide, and it was hard rowing againſt the Current. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> at firſt had addreſſed her ſelf by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Lord Mayor to proclaim her, and the Cities affections may be thought inclinable from the beginning unto her, be it only from <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's</hi> expreſſion of his thoughts to the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> in his paſſage through <hi>Shoreditch</hi> with his Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her and her Forces, who obſerved that the People preſſed to ſee them, but could not hear one that bid them Gods ſpeed. Is it ſo conſiderable to have the Voice of the Citizens, how much more than their Hearts? Thus came in Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and with her Popery upon the Proteſtants ſhoulders. For the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men were the firſt, that eſpous'd her Intereſt, upon Condition, that ſhe would make no alteration in Religion, which ſhe then moſt readily promiſed, but kept it afterwards like a Papiſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> broke it; and 'tis ſomewhere obſerved, that many more of that Country ſuffered for Religion in the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40944:177"/>
               <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution, than of any other. So ſutable ſhe acted to that avow'd Principle of her own Religion, that no faith is to be kept with Hereticks, a poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publickly authorized by the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and often ſince confirmed by many undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtances and Examples. But 'twas well for her that the City of <hi>London</hi> (whoſe concurrence with the reſt of the Nation firſt mounted her up into the Throne, and from whoſe Citizens ſhe received ſo great reſpect the day before her Corononation by coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pageants, thoſe dumb ſhews, of reſpect and other honorary expreſſions of their affections) continued firm in their Allegiance, otherwiſe ſhe might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance have paid dear enough for the breach of her promiſe upon Sir <hi>Thomas Wyats</hi> inſurrection. For could he but have got into the City, either by the <hi>Bridge</hi> or by <hi>Ludgate,</hi> how much of his purpoſe he might have brought to effect, is eaſier to be gueſſed, than declared in ſo uncertain a matter. But he was repulſed at both places, and deceived in his expectations and hopes of aid from <hi>London,</hi> he himſelf was taken, his party routed, and all his deſigns vaniſhed into ſmoak, to the loſs of his own life and ruin of many of his principal Friends and Followers. So unſucceſsful is an enterprize (on what grounds ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and appearing likelyhood of ſucceſs at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken) wherein the Londoners refuſe to ingage themſelves; whereas had but the City joyn'd her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Wyats,</hi> let him in within her Walls, and not ſtood firm to the Quens Intereſt, he might perhaps have been able to have commanded what Conditions he pleaſed. Of this we may well believe the Queen and Court were extreamly ſenſible. For we find the Queen her ſelf, her Lords, and her Ladies, came from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>Guildhall,</hi> where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the City were aſſembled in their Liveries,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40944:177"/>

The five hundred Men, which the City, at the Lord Treaſurers requeſt, had ſent out ready Arm'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that inſurrection, having turn'd to the other ſide at the perſwaſion of their Captain and Leader, and there being ſo great a Conſternation at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> upon <hi>Wyats</hi> approach, that the Serjeants at Law, and other Lawyers pleaded in their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the Queens Speech having ſecur'd the generality of the Citizens affections, ſtrict Watch and Ward continued to be kept in <hi>London,</hi> the Mayor and Sheriffs Commanded each Man to ſhut down their Shop-windows, and ſtand ready Arm'd at their Doors, they themſelves being likewiſe in Armour, the draw-bridge was cut down, the Bridg-gate ſhut, and convenient forces ſent to keep it, and others ſet in fit places of the City, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Wyat</hi>'s purpoſe was defeated, and his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of aſſiſtance fruſtrated, as he himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in the Meſſage he ſent the <hi>Londoners</hi> by Merchant <hi>Dorell,</hi> upon his March out of <hi>Southwark</hi> toward <hi>Kingſtone.</hi> For before he came with ſuch confidence towards <hi>London,</hi> that he hoped for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent entrance.

Souldiers, the Artillery Garden, that 'tis eaſie to conjecture how ſecure her Majeſty was in the Ctii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens love and loyalty, and how happy they thought themſelves in the favour and protection of ſo good, great, and gracious a Princeſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis not therefore to be expected, that ſuch turns and changes ſhould occur in her days, wherein the City might have occaſion to interpoſe her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſettle and ſecure the Nation againſt the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts of arbitrary Pretenders, or lye under any unavoidable neceſſity of ſhewing her Power and Influence over it, in contradiction to other mens aſpiring and ambitious Deſigns. However I am not deſtitute of an Inſtance, to demonſtrate the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of her Example, and how much all <hi>England</hi> was influenced thereby to the manifeſtation of their zeal, love, and duty to their Soveraign. In 88. a year ſo famous for the Spaniſh Invaſion, the Queens Counſel had demanded, what the City would do for her Majeſty and their Country, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen had referr'd it to their Honours to make their Propoſals; whereupon fifteen Ships and five thouſand Men being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and two days reſpite at the Cities deſire gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Anſwer, they returned in convenient time and ſeaſon, and entreated their Lordſhips, in ſign of their perfect love and loyalty to their Prince and Country, (they are <hi>Stows</hi> words) kindly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ten thouſand Men, and thirty Ships amply furniſhed, double the number of what was asked, and even as <hi>London</hi> (ſaith my Author) gave Preſident, the whole Nation kept ranck and equipage; ſo ready were the other Cities, Counties, Towns and Villages to follow where <hi>London</hi> went before.

               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:40944:179"/>
As to what concerns the frequency of the viſits the Queen made to <hi>London,</hi> and the great ſplendor, wherewith they commonly welcom'd her home at the end of her Country progreſſes, I paſs them all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though undeniable demonſtrations of the preſent content and ſatisfaction they took in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> good Government: Neither ſhall I take notice of the many Companies of Soldiers ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times rais'd at her own charges for her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Aſſiſtance, it having been commonly done before, under Princes in whom ſhe took delight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would haſten to King <hi>James,</hi> the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of great <hi>Britain,</hi> in whoſe Perſon <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were firſt united, though his preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, King <hi>James's</hi> Grand-ſon, was the firſt born Heir of that happy Union, that was Crowned King of both Realms, and the firſt Engliſh King by Birth of the Scottiſh race, that ever ſate upon the Engliſh Throne that we read of.</p>

and <hi>Virginia,</hi> would be tireſome perhaps to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and needleſs for the Writer; ſince that in <hi>Stows</hi> Chronicle, continued by <hi>How,</hi> theſe particulars have been ſo largely treated of, whether the curious and inquiſitive may apply themſelves for further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Neither ſhall I trouble my ſelf with making large remarks upon the great honour and dignity, for the City's ſake, belonging to the Lord Mayor thereof, of which we ſeem to have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the beginning of this Kings reign, when Sir <hi>Robert Lee,</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> ſubſcrib'd in the firſt place to the invitation ſent the King to come into <hi>England,</hi> before all the great Officers of the Crown, and all the Nobility; This great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, upon the Kings death, being ſaid to be the prime perſon of <hi>England,</hi> than which what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er honour can there be appertaining to a Subject? I have indeed read in <hi>Cotton,</hi> that upon a Poll Bill the Lord Mayor paid four pound as an Earl many years ago, in King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond days, when but few of the Nobility, if any beſides the blood Royal, bore any higher title: And find ſince at our Kings Coronations that he hath had a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal place and part aſſigned him, particularly at his preſent Majeſties, <hi>April 23d.</hi> 61. and in the honourable Cavalcade made from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the day before, in order thereunto, where the Suppliment to <hi>Baker's</hi> Chronicle, out of <hi>Elias Aſhmole</hi> the <hi>Windſor</hi> Heralds Copy, hath placed him between the principal Officers of the Crown and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> a place doubtleſs deſigned him as moſt ſuitable to his Dignity, and the high Office he bore; and yet I count none of theſe Honours comparable to that before mentioned, which ſeems paramount to all others. To be the higheſt by place in the Kingdom of courſe for a ſeaſon ſounds
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40944:180"/>
greater, than to be a Second, a Third, or a Fourth, and is more doubtleſs to the Honour, Credit, and Reputation of the City, that conferrs this place as ſhe pleaſes.</p>
            <p>But the chiefeſt point I intend here to inſiſt on, with all convenient brevity and perſpicuity, is the Declaration of the Cities love and affection to King <hi>James,</hi> and the requital made her by him in return. The firſt I know not how it could be better expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, than by the wonderful readineſs, and hearty gladneſs (as the Annaliſt words it) of the great City of <hi>London,</hi> where the Magiſtrates, and all other inferior Citizens ſhewed all poſſible ſigns of perfect joy and contentment, amidſt the general applauſe of the whole Engliſh Nation, when he was firſt proclaimed King of the Realm; and we have further demonſtrations thereof from the Kings honourable Reception, when he came near to <hi>London,</hi> by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in Scarlet Robes, and five hundred grave Citizens in Velvet Coats and Chains of Gold, all very well mounted like the Sheriffs and their train, one of which had three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore men attending him in fair livery Cloaks. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance may be the care taken in <hi>London</hi> to watch and guard the Gates, upon the firſt diſcovery of the Gun-powder Treaſon, and the great joy and rejoycing manifeſted therein ſoon after, upon its further detection, by filling the Streets with Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, and the Solemn Aſſemblies with publick praiſes and thankſgiving to the Almighty for the Kings happy Deliverance. This Gunpowder Treaſon (ſo to obſerve by the way) was one of the ſeven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars the Intelligencer tells us were ſometime ſince ſet up in a Table in St. <hi>Martins</hi> Church at <hi>York,</hi> under this Title, <hi>Things never to be forgotten by Proteſtants.</hi> The other ſix were, The bloody
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40944:180"/>
Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> The many Plots in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign. The Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland</hi> in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one. The horrid Murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> in One thouſand Six hundred and Forty eight. The burning of <hi>London</hi> in One thouſand Six hundred and Sixty ſix. And the horrid Popiſh-plot in One thouſand Six hundred and Seventy eight. An Inſcription, that ſome harmleſs well meaning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would have been apt doubtleſs to have thought very honeſt in its ſelf, and deſervedly written in Letters of Gold, till an Order came to one of the Church Wardens to take it down, or appear at the Spiritual Court to anſwer the Contempt: For 'twas above the ordinary Capacity of a Common lay-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant to apprehend any thing ill or offenſive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, till ſuch wits among the Clergy, as had far more ſagacious intellects, perceived the drift and deſign thereof, and judging it perhaps to be part of the Presbyterian Plot, might think fit to have it thrown down, that the Vulgar might be no more amus'd with the dreadful remembrance of ſuch things.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Cities Love and Loyalty to King <hi>James,</hi> another remarkable proof thereof may be deduced from the double Guards ſet in all places about <hi>London,</hi> the Precept iſſued out by the Lord Mayor to the Wards to raiſe the Train Bands, and the unexpreſſible diſtraction of Mens minds, upon a flying rumour ſuddenly ſpread about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>March 22d.</hi> (ſomewhat above four Months after the Powder Plot was diſcovered) of the Kings being ſlain that morning at <hi>Oking,</hi> ſome twenty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> which occaſioned great weeping and wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

news brought of the Kings ſafety, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Whitehall</hi> thereupon the ſame afternoon, where the peoples hearts were as much raiſed with joy, as before they had been drowned in grief, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen went to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Majeſty upon the aſſurance of his continued Health and Security.</p>
            <p>Such were the expreſſions of the Cities affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us now ſee the return of Kindneſs on the Kings part, and his Princely acknowledgment of their ſingular love and loyalty to him. Much doubtleſs of the Kings mind in this particular may be gueſſed at from the frequent Viſits he made the City, but I preſume by no one Act of his better known, than by his repaying the Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the ſeventh of his Reign, the Threeſcore thouſand pounds they had lent Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> three years before her death. An Act of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Juſtice and Equity, and whereby likewiſe he got more love, ſaith the Chronicle, than he paid mony. This may paſs both for an Example of the Kings Goodneſs and Prudence, and an Inſtance of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> Power and Eſteem, ſince his Majeſty thought it good to be at ſuch charges to oblige her. For to pay their Predeceſſors Debts is ſo rare among Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that many of them hardly ever pay their own.</p>
            <p>Hitherto have I preſented the Reader with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of paſſages out of our Engliſh Chronicles, to demonſtrate the Glory, Honour, and Renown of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Courage of her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, the Power of her Magiſtrates, the Strength of the Commonalty, and the undeniable Influence of the whole Corporation upon the reſt of the Kingdom; and have given him here and there the words and expreſſions of private men, as ſo
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40944:181"/>
many illuſtrative Arguments on the Points. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I ſhall produce no leſs than what I account a Royal Teſtimony, in confirmation of the many demonſtrative Evidences already brought, and that of no leſs a Prince than his preſent Majeſties Royal Father, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and out of an Author ſo little partial to the City, that the very name of <hi>Peter Heylin,</hi> and the diligent peruſal of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> Life, by him writ, may ſufficiently convince an indifferent Reader, that he was none of <hi>Londons</hi> greateſt Favourers or Admirers, ſince 'twas look'd on as the Retreat and Receptacle of the Grandees of the Puritan faction, as he is pleaſed to ſtile all thoſe he thought contrary to that Party of Men, he will needs call the Church of <hi>England.</hi> A Proof therefore out of ſuch an Adverſary's mouth, as <hi>Heylins,</hi> ſeems a very convincing Argument, when he himſelf is forced, meerly by truth and matter of fact, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and acknowledge the influence of <hi>London</hi> on all parts of the Kingdom, in that paſſage, where he intimates it to have been generally look't upon <hi>as the compaſs, by which the leſſer Towns and Corpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations were wont to ſteer their courſe, and to plead it's practice on all occaſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I conceive to be the Kings Teſtimony by that writer deliver'd, is by him brought in, as the reaſon of his Majeſties preferring <hi>Laud</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>London, viz.</hi> For that he was a Man of a more active Spirit than the former Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, and ſo fitter to carry on the deſign of rendring the City conformable to that propos'd Model of Church Government, which was intended for the whole Nation, and therein therefore principally to be promoted, <hi>becauſe of the Influence it had, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it's wealth and trading, on all parts of the Kingdom, and that upon the correſpondence and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:40944:182"/>
               <hi>thereof the welfare of the whole depended.</hi> This Teſtimony doubtleſs is of great authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe proceeding from ſo Judicious a Prince, and related by an Author not to be ſuppos'd over ready to write any thing in favour of this City, to which he ſeems to have born a very great animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe the Citizens would not be ſo thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac'd Epiſcopal, as his Reverend Doctorſhip would have had them to have been. But now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it ſhould be of greater prevalency than ever, ſince that King <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf, before he dyed, out of his own experience knew much more of the Cities ſtrength and Power, than many of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors did for ſome ages before. For 'tis plain beyond denial, diſpute, or contradiction, out of the memory of Man and the everlaſting Records of time, that in the late Wars between him and his two Houſes of Parliament, 'twas the Cities pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and influence, that rais'd them to that height of Grandeur, which made them ſo formidable to all the Royal party. Whereas, without her help and aſſiſtance, how little able they had been to have long ſubſiſted, or held up their heads above ground, is evident from the many ſupplies they had from <hi>London,</hi> of Men, Mony, and Arms, the frequent applications they made to her on all extremities, and the conſtant endeavours they us'd to cultivate her friendſhip, and preſerve her affections. But over theſe Tranſactions I ſhall chooſe rather to caſt a vail of ſilence, than induſtriouſly endeavour to lay open the bleeding wounds of the Nation in thoſe days, as being fully aſſur'd of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of guiding my pen ſo dextrouſly in delivering the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, as not to ſubject my ſelf to cenſure, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the anger, diſpleaſure, and indignation of any
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40944:182"/>
one. Suffice it then to ſay, that, in the long Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Parliaments under King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, ſuch ſeeds of diſcontent were ſown, in City, as well as Country, that upon the firſt opportunity, they ſprung up into bitter herbs, and ſour fruit, and who taſted moſt thereof, I think all the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> world knows ſufficiently by this time of day.</p>
            <p>But if any in this age is ſo ignorant as to wonder how it was poſſible for the two Houſes in forty one to bear up againſt the King, without being diſmis'd from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by vertue of the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the uſual method of ancient times, and the known practice of later days, he is to know and underſtand, that his late Majeſty had formally paſs'd away his grand Power of Prorogations, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journments, and Diſſolutions by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo put the ſtaff out of his own hands, that he could never recover, as long as he lived, by force nor intreaty. An act of Grace this was, that is hardly to be parallel'd, and yet perhaps it may be lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Otherwiſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the uſe that might have been poſſibly made of the former, it might have look't like the ſame book with additions new Printed in <hi>Octavo,</hi> which before was bound up in <hi>decimo ſexto.</hi> Neither of theſe are to be found in our New Printed Statute books, they pretending not to ſet down all the Antiquated, Repeal'd, or expir'd Statutes, that ever were in being.

In the next place comes the encouragement, the Letter ſent from ſome of the old Council of State privately met at <hi>London,</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom we find Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhley Cooper,</hi> that Fam'd Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> a Principal Agent through the whole courſe of thoſe affairs, and an active Inſtrument in bringing in the King) to <hi>Monk,</hi> brought his Officers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the reaſon given thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the wiſeſt of them did conclude from theſe appearances of action at <hi>London,</hi> that their party was encreaſed in <hi>England,</hi> imagining that otherwiſe they durſt not have ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly acted.

rods in the Fable bound up together in one bundle, will make doubtleſs a very convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great power and influence <hi>London</hi> had upon the Nation in this grand turn of the Times. I ſhall therefore leave it to the Reader to make ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remarks thereon, it being ſo obvious to an unprejudic'd Perſon, that great was the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment General <hi>Monk</hi> and his Officers receiv'd from <hi>London,</hi> conſiderable was the hope and confidence he put therein, when he undertook ſo Heroick an Enterpriſe, as the freeing his poor Country from the Tyranical exorbitancies of the unruly Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and thought of marching up thither in Arms with all convenient ſpeed to that end; and moſt highly advantagious to his Deſigns was the unanimous concurrence of this great, honourable, and powerful City, which was not ſo furiouſly raſh, preſently to attempt to run down the encroachers upon their dearly belov'd Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when they might with greater eaſe, and as effectually, gently walk them down, as a certain Perſon is ſaid to have expreſs'd it on a much later Occaſion. The City petition'd and addreſs'd, and ſhe was follow'd by the Country: She waited a while with patience, and the ſecluded Members, that were choſen in forty and from forty eight kept out of the houſe till fifty nine, for almoſt twelve years ſpace, were reſtor'd in peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, though under ſome few Obligations; And ſo there was again the face of a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: Being reſtor'd, they diſſolv'd themſelves in a ſhort time after, to make way for another aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40944:186"/>
It being moſt certain, that that Parliament ow'd its beginning to the Kings Writ, although its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance was thought to depend on the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act, as long as the King liv'd. Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Houſe of Commons had actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd themſelves, and it was become the receiv'd opinion that the Parliament of Forty was in Law diſſolv'd before upon the old Kings death, the next Aſſembly, <hi>Stylo Communi</hi> Parliament, would not barely ſtick to either of theſe ways, but thought good likewiſe themſelves, by vertue of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to declare that Parliament of Forty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd. Whether or no they thought, that the bare Act of a ſingle houſe of Commons, without King and Lords, could not in Law be took for a formal Repeal of the former continuing Act, made by King, Lords, and Commons joyntly, and ſo reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as really inſignificant in its ſelf, though made uſe of for the time; and out of a Cautious foreſight dreaded ſome ill conſequences attending the receiv'd opinion, [of the long Parliaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd by the Kings death, whether or no the continuing Act were formally repeal'd by as good Authority as made it] leſt thence in time, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows when, occaſion might be taken to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that if a Kings death repeals one unlimited Act, it may likewiſe on the ſame ground vacate all by him made, and ſo, by affirming the ſame of all other Princes ſince the firſt <hi>William,</hi> a foundation might be laid for the Introduction of Arbitrary Power, when evil minded Pretenders are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute enough to attempt it with hopes of Impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I pretend not to determine. For I remember my ſelf to be a Relater of matters of Fact, not a Reader of Law Caſes.</p>
            <p>Therefore I proceed to acquaint the Reader,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40944:187"/>
that that Aſſembly (though call'd without the Kings Writ, yet by his Majeſty afterwards moſt Graciouſly own'd and acknowledg'd for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) thought it fitting and convenient, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and enact, <q>that the Parliament begun and holden at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the third day of <hi>November,</hi> in the ſixteenth year of the Reign of the Late King <hi>Charles</hi> of bleſſed Memory, is fully diſſolved and determined.</q> They are the words of the Act to be ſeen in the Statute-book, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. This was the Aſſembly that bleſſed us with his Majeſties actual Reſtauration, towards which there had been made ſo many ſteps a little before by the Loyal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, and Commonalty of the Land, and the Worthy Citizens of this Honourable City: Whoſe publick Reception, and Triumphant Cavalcade through the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>White hill</hi> was very remarkable, for the ſplendid appearance of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to conduct him, the Gallantry ſhewn by them on ſo acceptable a Solemnity, and the many demonſtrations of joy and gladneſs they gave him, worthy themſelves, and that glorious day, which they had ſo long expected, and contributed ſo much of their aſſiſtance to haſten. For which I have a paſſage or two more to produce, beſides what hath been already brought. For the firſt, out of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to <hi>Baker,</hi> I quote his Majeſties moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Letter, To his Truſty and well belov'd, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> wherein he Honourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the publick and frequent Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their affections to him, and the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good Example <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40944:187"/>
of their Charter, Confirmation of all priviledges granted by his Predeceſſors, and the adding of new favours to advance the Trade Wealth and Honour thereof The next is a Commemoration of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Joyful Reſentment of this Letter, and the Kings Declaration enclos'd in it, as it was was expreſs'd by the Grateful Duty of the Common-Council, who immediately, upon the reading of them, ordered a Preſent of Ten thouſand Pounds to be made to His Majeſty, and a thouſand pounds to each of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And likewiſe deputed ſeveral of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and worthy Citizens to attend upon His Majeſty from the City, with a Preſentment of their moſt Dutiful acknowledgments for his Clemency and Goodneſs towards them. So deſirous were they to give him the greateſt demonſtrations of their affection and Loyalty before his Return, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly Wiſe, as well as Loyal, to ſet all parts of the Nation a good Example to imitate in a ready manifeſtation of their Duty and Allegiance to him after his Return. Neither in this would they be behind hand with any of them all. For the City of <hi>London,</hi> as being the firſt, the richeſt, and moſt Honourable, and the Seat of Kings for many ages, might Judge it ſelf oblig'd (as the Supplementer inſinuates) in point of duty and Reputation, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the reſt in the Glory of their performances towards their Soveraign. But whatever the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens did think of the Obligation on either ſide, certain enough it is, that the reiterated expreſſions of their Loyalty to the King were Honourable, and Meritorious to the higheſt degree. For to the ſplendor of their former Preparations at his firſt Reception and Triumphal Entrance, they added the coſt of a moſt magnificent Entertainment at <hi>Guild-hal,</hi> (for that very purpoſe richly beautified
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40944:188"/>
and adorned) whither the King, his two Brothers, the Lords of the Privy Council, the two Houſes of Parliament, and the chief Officers of State were conducted <hi>(July</hi> the fifth, 1660.) in great Pomp by the Lord Mayor, and the Grandees of the City and treated in a Royal manner with the choiceſt of Delicacies, with excellent Muſick, and whatever elſe could be thought on, or delightful for ſo Illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Aſſembly. As if the Citizens thought it not enough to entertain the King, but for his ſake were reſolv'd to put themſelves to the charge of gratifying others for their Loyalty. Where's now the Man can bring me a parallel hereto? General <hi>Monk</hi> appear'd, and <hi>London</hi> concur'd, and then the Houſe of Commons of the Parliament of forty is immediately reviv'd, a face of the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment reſtor'd, a new Parliamentary Aſſembly call'd, the King ſent for home to enjoy his Fathers Throne, and moſt peaceably ſettled therein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the noiſe of War, or the cries of the wounded in our ſtreets. A Miraculous effect of the Cities influence. For what parts of the Land are ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate to oppoſe, when <hi>London</hi> is engag'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd? Former Examples may teach them future wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Theſe having been the neceſſary preparatives, in ſixty one, on Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day, <hi>April</hi> the 23. comes the Kings Coronation, (the faireſt day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Preceding, in which he made his Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade through <hi>London,</hi> the Nation enjoy'd both before and after, if the ſupplementers Obſervation be well grounded, notwithſtanding it began to Thunder and Lighten very ſmartly towards the end of Dinner time,) and ſoon after that another meeting of King, Lords, and Commons at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> whither the Kings Writs had Summoned
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40944:188"/>
them to make a New Parliament, the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly having been diſſolv'd the <hi>December</hi> before by his Majeſties Order and Command. How ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable the Actions of that Aſſembly were to City and Country hath been hinted before, and the concurrence of the King, when reſtor'd, was not wanting to Authorize their proceedings; yet this new Aſſembly, notwithſtanding, thinking the manner of it's Aſſembling not to be drawn into Example, and that therewas ſome defect, as to the neceſſary point of Legality, in the Statutes then made, or at leaſt deſirous to remove all doubts, fears and ſcruples about them, would not let ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe Acts paſs without being formally ratified, and confirm'd anew by it's own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore conſequently, not truſting to the receiv'd opinion of the diſſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of forty by the late Kings Death, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the Houſe of Commons Act to diſſolve themſelves in fifty nine, nor the diſſolution of the Lords and Commons in ſixty, another Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made in the point, in theſe word. <hi>To the end, that no Man bereafter may be miſled into any ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or unquiet demeanor, out of an opinion that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament begun and held at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>upon the third day of</hi> November, <hi>in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred and forty, is yet in being, which is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolved and determined, and ſo is hereby Declared and Adjudged to be fully Diſſolved and Determined.</hi> And it was further Enacted, by the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>That if any Perſon or Perſons at any time after the four and twentieth day of</hi> June, <hi>in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty and one, ſhall Malitiouſly and Adviſedly, by Writing, Printing, Preaching, or other Speaking, Expreſs, Publiſh, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tter, Declare or affirm, that the Parliament begun at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter

            <p>Thus then were all diſputes upon this point ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſtil'd and ſuppreſs'd by this Authority and Command of King, Lords and Commons, and the greatneſs of the penalty incur'd by the perſon offending, which amounts to no leſs than to be put out of the Kings Protection, and have his Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to the King, and his Body Attach'd, if to be found, and brought before the King and his Council, there to Anſwer the premiſes, or that proceſs be made againſt him by <hi>Praemunire facias,</hi> and if return'd <hi>non eſt inventus,</hi> than to be Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd.</p>
            <p>Next I proceed to obſerve, that 'twas Petitioning and addreſſing, that prepar'd the way for His Majeſties Reſtauration, and therefore doubtleſs the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof ſhould be always grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Loyal. Such preparatories to great turns and changes being alwaies preferrable to the other rougher methods of drawn Swords and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Piſtols, which are the general effects of Civil Broils and Commotions, while theſe are the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal reſults of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
            <p>With the King was that part of the Engliſh Clergy likewiſe reſtor'd, which appropriates to it ſelf the name of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> A Term much gloried in by many, as if none but
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40944:189"/>
themſelves were the conſtitutive parts thereof, and which ſome now adays pretend freer from Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity than the more general Name of Proteſtants. What we underſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by that Term we know very well, and are not aſham'd thereof. Yet, by the way, I don't think but 'tis as lyable to exceptions, where Cavils take place, as the other title of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, ſo much of late turn'd into ridicule by ſome few pretenders to wit and ſenſe above the vulgar. For if by Church we underſtand barely an Aſſembly of Men met together in one place, then doubtleſs, without any incongruity, it may be applied to many a civil meeting of Men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about their own private concerns. If by Church we mean a ſociety of Men conjoyn'd in Spiritual duties, or the Ordinances of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then I hope it will be no Soleciſm in common Speech to affirm, many of the Diſſenters meetings may reaſonably lay claim to the Name. And if a due Celebration of the Sacraments will make a Church, why then may not the Denomination as well belong to ſome private Conventicles, as to the publick Oratories? If it ſhould denote on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Aſſociation of many diſtinct Aſſemblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Eccleſiaſtical Government, what ſhould hinder the Preſbiterians from enjoying the Title in thoſe places, where they are allowed to exerciſe their power in Claſſical, Provincial, or National Synods? Which Power they once exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in <hi>England</hi> publickly within the Memory of Man. But if the Law of the Land makes the difference, and the eſtabliſhed Government of the Country, in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, as with us in <hi>England,</hi> then I am apt to beleive this Expreſſion, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not without it's Ambig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities, and may be a denomination comprehenſive
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40944:190"/>
of Men of as many different modes and forms, as ſome would fain have us think the word Proteſtant admits of.</p>
            <p>Heretofore at the firſt planting of the Goſpel in this Iſle among the <hi>Britains,</hi> we may call it the Britiſh Church. When <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk came in, bringing with him the Cuſtoms and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and introduc'd them among the converted <hi>Saxons,</hi> then we may term it the Romiſh Church. When the Monks and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, like the Frogs in <hi>Egypt,</hi> had over-ſpread the whole face of the Land, then we may give it the Epithite of Monkiſh. In ſucceeding Generations, when Popery was arriv'd to its height, we may name it the Popiſh Church. In King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth days it may properly be called Reformed. Under the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution 'twas certainly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> brought back the Reformed Religion under an Epiſcopal Government, and therefore I venture to give it the Name of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Epiſcopal Church. A little before the late Wars, when the Hierarchy was arriv'd at its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of Pomp and Grandeur by the <hi>Laudean</hi> principles and practiſes; It was certainly then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical. In the late times 'twas once the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, then the Independent Church, and other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were puting in a pace for a ſhare, and then, had they ſucceeded, it might have been, without much impropriety, entitled to the Epithite of Fanatical. King <hi>Charles</hi> brought back the Biſhops, and ſo now 'tis again Epiſcopal. Should Popery come in, it would be Popiſh. Were there any likelihood of ſo great an Impoſſibility, as the prevalency of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, then it would be the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. If <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> Religion, which hath been publickly profeſs'd in the Pulpit preferable to Presbiterianſm, why
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40944:190"/>
might it not be allow'd the Title of <hi>Mahometan?</hi> And if we ſhould revert to the Ancient Barbarity, where would the impropriety be, ſhould we term it the Heatheniſh Church? For the Heathens here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had the thing, though not the Name, Temples inſtead of Churches, and bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to make up the greateſt part of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p>What a fine Company then of different Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites, of different ſignif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To ſuch a fine paſs would people once be brought, when they fall to wrangling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout words and terms, at the ſame time, that they know one anothers meaning well enough, yet will pretend not to underſtand each other: We may have haply reaſon enough to approve of, and glory in the Name of Church of <hi>England</hi> men, though not perhaps in ſuch a reſtrained ſenſe, as ſome do, yet our grounds, without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are as good to apply to our ſelves the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title of Proteſtants, and we can as properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh our ſelves thereby from Papiſts, as if we term'd our ſelves only Sons of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> under this conſideration, that Proteſtants at firſt were ſuch, <hi>Baker</hi> tells us, as made a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in defence of their Doctrine, and now we are ſuch as proteſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt Popery and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:40944:191"/>
But to return, how contributory this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able City was to his Majeſties Reſtauration, and how Loyally affectionate her Citizens ſhew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him before and after, hath been already inſtanced: Let us then in the next place take a ſhort tranſient view of her actions, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents hapning to her, under King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, and ſee whither ſhe hath not continued ſtill the ſame, as of old, a City of high Renown, Fame and Power, and of great ſway and influence all over the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Firſt then let us conſider her misfortunes, that we may the better contemplate her glories. In ſixty two her Pariſhes loſt many of their beloved Paſtors in that great ejection of publick Miniſters, among whom were ſome that had declar'd in Print againſt the pretended high Court of Juſtice in the time of his Late Majeſties Tryal. In ſixty five the great Plague ſwept away her Citizens by thouſands, tens of thouſands, and ſcores of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. In ſixty ſix the fire burn'd almoſt all the Remainder out of Houſe and home, and laid in a manner the whole City in Aſhes: So that, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhe feem'd then near to a very diſmal Cataſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophe. And yet we ſee now Providence hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her out of theſe her Calamities, and ſhe is become more glorious than ever in the Eyes of the Nation. The number of her Citizens is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, and her ſtreets fill'd with ſuch multitudes of people paſſing to and fro, that thoſe who dyed in the ſickneſs are neither miſs'd nor wanted. The fire hath made ſuch a Reformation within her Walls, and the new buildings, publick and private, have been rais'd up, to the admiration of all, in ſo ſmall a ſpace of time, and in ſo pompous and ſtately a form, that ſhe may be thought, like the old <hi>Phaenix</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40944:191"/>
in her neſt of odoriferous Spices, only to have ſhaken off her old decay'd feathers by the fire, and out of her own Aſhes, <hi>Phaenix</hi> like, to have riſen up with more Splendor and Gallantry than ever.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the late Diſcovery of the Grand Popiſh Plot, and the times ſucceeding, and therein alſo we meet with inſtances of <hi>Londons</hi> influence and Authority with the reſt of the Nation. She guarded her ſelf with her own Arms, and how ſoon was ſhe follow'd in other places? After the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſome of the National Aſſemblies, (which we Engliſh men call Parliaments, and firmly beleive the greateſt liberty of the ſubject to conſiſt therein) upon a new choice, when her Citizens made a publick promiſe to their choſen Repreſentatives, that they would ſtand by them with their lives and fortunes: Such a Copy was ſet the Nation, that moſt places ſtrove to imitate it, and the Example was as influential, as when before, upon the Cities Petitioning for the ſitting of one of thoſe before mention'd Parliaments, Petitions of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture came thronging in amain from ſeveral parts of the Land in imitation.</p>
            <p>Look we now upon the City, and ſee how intent the eyes of the Nation are fixt upon her actions, and the great conteſt about the Sheriffs. How all the Land ſeems concern'd on one ſide or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and think their own well-fare wrapt up in her ſecurity. Such ſollicitouſneſs of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for one particular City muſt certainly denote ſome what extraordinary therein: And what is it, can more intereſt the Nation in her concerns, than the great Influence 'tis known ſhe has upon all their grand affairs, be they more or leſs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? Even the very buſineſs of the <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> now depending, will adminiſter an inſtance of her
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40944:192"/>
Power and Greatneſs. How do all now ſtand ready waiting the Event, depending upon her ſucceſs, or ready to follow her fate? When the Writ was brought againſt her Charter, how great was the Expectation of the people, and their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to know what would be the Iſſue? Some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, but when <hi>London</hi> appear'd to Stand up in her own Vindication, what a ſtop was there put to Reſignations, and how rare have been ſurrenders ſince? Moſt ſeem now ready to defend themſelves by Law; Nay, <hi>Oxford</hi> hath pitch'd upon the ſame way and method with <hi>London:</hi> Whereas had this Honourable City, but ſurrender'd calmly and quietly, 'tis a queſtion whither any would have ſtood out, or whether rather all Towns and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would not have ſtrove to have out run each other to the Throne of Majeſty, there to have made an intire Reſignation of all their Charters, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Priviledges and Franchiſes, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hazard they might have run, by diſſolving their Ancient Corporations, to have loſt back all the Eſtates, given to them as Corporate bodies, to the Donors Heirs, ſutable to the Reply ſaid to be made to the Burgeſſes of a Certain Corporation, when they ask'd advice in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Such having been the influences of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> all along upon the Nation, and ſuch the undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proofs thereof, what then remains, but that we muſt needs acknowledge and confeſs her to be a City moſt Triumphant? Triumphant in the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Foundation, the continuance of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient renown, and the Glorious Acts of her Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens: Triumphant in the Freedom of her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, the Honourable reſpect ſhewn her Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and the Combined ſtrength of her Commonalty:
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:40944:192"/>
Triumphant in the Prevalency of her Power, Victorious ſucceſs of her Arms, and unavoidable Deſtruction of her Enemies. Let us therefore with an united conſent proſtrate our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of Grace with this Petitionary requeſt, that ſhe may continue ever fixt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable in her Duty to the Almighty, firm in her Loyalty to the King, and ſecure in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted enjoyment of her juſt Rights, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Priviledges and Franchiſes: A Prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I doubt not but every Loyal Engliſh Man, and honeſt well meaning Citizen will readily from his heart ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
