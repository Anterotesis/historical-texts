            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Actions of Perſons of Quality, as they are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd than any other to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique view, are alſo more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to cenſure and obloquy; eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> where Libels ſet forth of meer malice againſt the reputation of our Sex, are entertain'd with undeſerv'd applauſe, and look'd upon as pieces of Court-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and Wit. I very well knew Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of that kind, ſpare not the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſons, yet, I confeſs, I thought my ſelf priviledged from their Laſh by the favour of the Age, and conſtant Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48334:5"/>
of my Life, till I was undeceiv'd by News ſent me from <hi>France</hi> of a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of my Life publiſhed there in Print, of which I was ſuppos'd the Author: You may believe me (upon receiving this News and the Circumſtances that attended it,) not a little curious of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Book; but when I had read it, the indignation I was in at the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſent me, was quickly chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſlight and contempt the Author deſerv'd: I need not inform thoſe who are acquainted with me, there is not in this pretended Hiſtory any one inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent but what is fictitious, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Humour, as to Truth; there needs but a ſlight knowledge of my Inclinations and Conduct to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Reader 'tis a pure Invention of the Author of it; and that if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any adventure of my life, he hath diſguis'd and made it quite another thing, by the Circumſtances he hath added to it: I paſs by the baſeneſs of the Style, than which nothing more ordinary and mean; and (to ſay all in a Word) nothing more like the Genius of the Author: But becauſe thoſe who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48334:5"/>
know me not, may give credit to what he hath endeavoured to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: I thought my ſelf concern'd to vindicate my reputation from the injury offer'd it, by giving you a true and faithful Relation made by my ſelf of all that happened to me from a Child, to which the preſſing Inſtances of ſeveral Perſons interreſſed in my concerns, have further oblig'd me.</p>
            <p>I was born at <hi>Rome,</hi> and deſcend of a Family of Illuſtrious Nobility, and no leſs conſiderable for Merit; which needed not the Glories of <hi>Cardinal Mazarin</hi> my Uncle, to make it appear with Splendor in the Chief City of the World. When I came to ſeven Years of Age, my Mother not finding in me the Beauty ſhe obſerv'd in my Siſter <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> (now Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarin</hi>) diſpos'd me to go into a Covent of the Order of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> call'd <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> with deſign to make me a Nun; and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that an Aunt of mine in the ſame Covent, who had the tuition of me, would be very inſtrumental for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>After two Years ſpent there, my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48334:6"/>
Mother, though ſhe had not equal tenderneſs for me, as for my Siſter <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſia,</hi> yet pittying the ill health I had there, and attributing it to my being ſo ſtraitly coop'd up, and to the Air of the Place, which was very ill, ſhe took me home.</p>
            <p>About two Years after my leaving the Covent, my Uncle, arriv'd almoſt at the height of his Fortune, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to improve his happineſs by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it. He writ to my Mother and my Aunt <hi>Martinozzi</hi> to come into <hi>France,</hi> and bring with them each her eldeſt Daughter. The order being ſo ſtrict, ſeem'd to exclude my Siſter as a <hi>Cadette</hi>; but being my Mothers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, her Beauty gain'd her in my Mothers Affection a right of Seniority: However, I was made acquainted with my Uncles Orders, and my Mother would doubtleſs have been very glad to have found me unwilling to obey them. I am ſufficiently aſſured of it by her having put it to my choice to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> or ſtay at <hi>Rome</hi> with my Aunt to be made a Nun; and her asking me very ſeriouſly if I had not made a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48334:6"/>
Vow to that purpoſe: I very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Anſwer I made her, was, There were Covents every where, and that if ever I chanc'd to be ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpos'd, I could be a Nun at <hi>Paris,</hi> as well as at <hi>Rome</hi>; and that I was not yet of a competent Age for making a choice of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>My Mother undeceived by this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, reſolv'd to take me along; and to eaſe her ſelf of the trouble ſhe was in for the preference my Uncles orders gave me above my Siſter, ſhe took us both with her.</p>
            <p>We embarqued in a Gally of <hi>Genes,</hi> ſent us by that Republick, whom my Uncle had particularly oblig'd. I ſhall not take upon me the deſcription of that floating Manſion, that I may not loſe time in ſetting forth the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Magnificence of its Tackle and Furniture, it ſhall ſuffice to acquaint you that during our Voyage, the Pomp we were treated in was no leſs than Majeſtick, and that the Tables of Kings are not ſerv'd with more Splendour, or greater Magnificence than ours was four times a-day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48334:7"/>We landed at <hi>Marſellis,</hi> where my Aunt (more ſcrupulous than the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the place requir'd) made a long time ſome difficulty to receive the Civilities of the Town, as not able to perſwade her ſelf to comply with ſome formalities that attend them: But at laſt with much pain ſhe maſter'd the difficulty, though not without giving juſt cauſe of complaint for oppoſing things ſo long authoriz'd by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Marſellis</hi> we paſs'd to <hi>Aix,</hi> where we were lodg'd in the Houſe of the Governour of <hi>Provence,</hi> being the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> who of all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>France</hi> had made the firſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the Cardinal, by marrying <hi>Victoria Manchini</hi> my eldeſt Siſter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gone as far as <hi>Cologne,</hi> to deſire her in Marriage, when his Eminence was forc'd to quit the Court.</p>
            <p>Two Months after our coming to <hi>Aix,</hi> my Siſter arriv'd there to keep us company. And for ſix Months more that we tarry'd there, all her care was to divert and treat us, at the charge of the Duke her Husband, who regal'dus
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48334:7"/>
every Day with extraordinary Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
            <p>Theſe eight Months expired, our Uncle thought us by that time pretty well fitted for appearing at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſent us order to come to the Court there, whither my Siſter <hi>Victoria</hi> who was big with her firſt Child would bear us company, notwithſtanding the great ſeverity of the Winter; the danger ſhe expoſed her ſelf to, and the deſire we had to give the Duke her Husband ſatisfaction, made us wiſh ſhe would have been perſwaded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear giving us this proof of her kindneſs, but the tenderneſs ſhe had for us, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd all our Reaſons, and prevail'd more than any conſideration of danger or inconvenience ſhe might fall into: Thoſe that know her will eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, and confeſs that Heaven ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver united a more Noble Soul, with a handſomer Body, nor ſo much Vertue with ſo much Beauty.</p>
            <p>After a Months happy Journey we arriv'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> where my Uncle ſaw us in private, and received us with ſuch particular expreſſions of kindneſs,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48334:8"/>
that wanting Words to deſcribe them to the Life, I ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf by giving you an Idea of them, in telling you, it was an Enterview like that of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and his Brethren, which was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all poſſible evidences of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affection. And though my Siſter <hi>Hortenſia</hi> had no order to come, as was hinted before, her Beauty excus'd my Mothers bringing her along, and the Cardinal was extreamly pleas'd at the ſight of her.</p>
            <p>Being pretty well recovered of our Journey, we went to kiſs their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Hands, who received us with particular demonſtrations of kindneſs ſuitable to their Royal Grandeur: But this happineſs was very ſhort liv'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon interrupted by a ſudden and ſad change, of which I am going to give you account.</p>
            <p>I was not fully recover'd of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of our Journey, the livelineſs of my humour diſorder'd by ſo much agitation, and my ill obſervation of dyet (eating indifferently what was bad, as well as what was good for me,) made me look ſo pitifully, that my Uncle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48334:8"/>
reſolv'd to put me into a Covent, to try, as he ſaid, if that would recover me. Beſides, he loo'd upon me as too young and raw, and ſo great a ſtranger to the Language of the Country, that he thought me not fit, as yet, to be introduced into ſo glorious a Court; my Siſter in all appearance ſhould by reaſon of the like inconveniences have run the like fortune; but ſhe was ſo young, or rather ſo beautiful, that ſhe was diſpens'd with: Thus was I put into the Covent of the Viſitation in the <hi>Fauxbourgs,</hi> St. <hi>Jacques,</hi> where my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter came two Months after to bear me company, by order from his Eminence, who at length thought her too young to continue at Court, where her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had introduc'd her, and great pleaſure was taken in ſeeing her, inſomuch that <hi>Mounſieur,</hi> though very young, could not live without her. But that which principally mov'd his Eminence to take this Reſolution, was an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous obſtinacy he obſerv'd in my Siſter, which was thought to proceed partly from the liberty they gave her in the Palace; by this means we were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48334:9"/>
both in a Covent under the direction of Madam <hi>La Mere de Mignon,</hi> Siſter to the Prince Preſident of <hi>Paris.</hi> She took care of our Education, and taught us French, and all other things neceſſary for Maids of our age and quality, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted her ſelf of her Charge with great pains and induſtry: when we had been in that Covent a year and a half, my Uncle ſent to us Madam <hi>de Venele,</hi> Maid of honour to my Siſter the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> with order to bring me to <hi>Fere</hi> a Town in <hi>Picardy,</hi> where the Court then was.</p>
            <p>Before this progreſs, his Eminence deſirous of an alliance with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>Milleray</hi> had propos'd a Marriage between his Son the Great Maſter and me, thinking it but juſt to diſpoſe firſt of me who was the elder: But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Love and of Reaſon are ſo very different, his Eminence found he had to ſmall purpoſe deſign'd me for the Great Maſter, who had already made Choice of another object, and wholly devoted himſelf to my Siſter <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> from the firſt moment he ſaw her, with ſuch particular Circumſtances, that he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48334:9"/>
ſaid aloud, he could rather ſpend his life in a Covent then marry any other.</p>
            <p>I came to <hi>Fere</hi> wholly ignorant of the Deſign of marrying me, but when I arriv'd there, I had ſome confus'd knowledge of it by flying Reports, which in few days vaniſh'd with the Treaty then on foot, the Grand Maſter having by his anſwer declar'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his affection for my Siſter: I continued at Court, where by the help of that Light I had attain'd by age, and care of my Inſtructors, I diſcover'd ſome Charmes till then wholly unknown to me, although I had not the full liberty of taking the pleaſures of the place: My Mother ſeeing me lively and brisk, had not the ſame kindneſs for me ſhe had for my Siſters; but kept me Lock'd up as long as ſhe could, and watch'd me ſo narrowly that I ſtirr'd not abroad but in Company, and was frequently left at home all alone. This was no ſmall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to me, and appear'd far the greater, when compar'd with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence us'd to my Siſters, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty given <hi>Olympia,</hi> (now Counteſs of <hi>Soiſſons</hi>) and <hi>Hortenſia</hi> who came
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48334:10"/>
two Months after out of the Covent: I Confeſs I was vext at the heart to ſee them allowed to ſpend their time at Court, when I was mewd up alone in a Camber, and depriv'd of the pleaſures they enjoyed. I could not forbear mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Complaint to my Mother for her uſing me ſo, and told her ſharply, that if my Siſter <hi>Hortenſia</hi> deſerv'd by her beauty the Chief place in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, however ſhe could not but know I was her Elder: my Mother at this was touch'd to the quick, and told my Uncle there was no living with me, and that it were better make me a Nun than venture me into the World, where ſhe clearly foreſaw I ſhould be very mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerable, having neither ingenuity, nor reſpect for thoſe I was oblig'd moſt to eſteem.</p>
            <p>The Remonſtrances my Uncle made me, after theſe Complaints, were ſo harſh and cutting, they would have made impreſſion on any other but me, who minded them ſo little, that though I remembred very well what he ſaid, I never laid it to heart.</p>
            <p>The Great melancholly my Mother
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48334:10"/>
ſoon after fell into, was a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and fore-runner of her Death; ſhe became of ſo ſtrange an humour, 'twas impoſſible to endure it: And I whom ſhe lov'd leaſt was to bear the torment of all her ill conditions, my Siſter <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympia</hi> having a diſtinct Apartment to her ſelf, and <hi>Hortenſia</hi> was at the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mercoeur</hi>'s, where her Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Madam <hi>de Venele</hi> brought her up, with extraordinary tenderneſs and care. The life I led was very ſad, and my troubles unparallell'd. And to mend the matter, my Apartment was the worſt of all, and no company but an old Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid call'd <hi>Roſe,</hi> who waited on us when Children. And to compleat my miſery, I ſaw my ſelf on the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into the Covent.</p>
            <p>This was my condition when my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell ſick. And though at firſt her ſickneſs did not appear dangerous, His Majeſty honoured her every Evening with his preſence, and obſerving I had ſome wit and briskneſs, he ſaid to me one thing or other every day by the by, which help'd me a little to bear with comfort the affliction I was in by my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48334:11"/>
ill humours: but this was no ſmall addition to my Mothers diſeaſe, who could not endure I ſhould enter her Chamber when company was there.</p>
            <p>My Mother at length grew better, but afterwards relaps'd and dy'd. The <hi>Hemettick</hi> Wine (which is us'd as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in Caſes of extremity) was given her in her ſickneſs, and quickly brought her to her Grave.</p>
            <p>Education is the greateſt preſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents can beſtow on their Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their being: But 'tis very neceſſary it ſhould be attended with Gentleneſs, too much Severity being often a means to root out Natural Affection; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent are Love and Fear: I ſpeak it by Experience, the fear my Mother had kept me in, having made ſuch impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in me, that Two Years after her death, I ſtill dreamt ſhe was alive, and when broad awake, I often fancy'd I ſaw her, to my very great trouble.</p>
            <p>Soon after Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi> dy'd ſuddenly in Child-Bed, to our general affliction; who could not but lament the loſs of a Beauty ſo rare, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48334:11"/>My Mother being dead, Madam <hi>de Venele</hi> was made my Governeſs, with the like power and charge over my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Hortenſia</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> who was lately come to us with our Brother <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo,</hi> who dy'd very young and very unfortunately, having been wounded in the Head as he was at play with his Schollers of the College of <hi>Clermont,</hi> where he boarded.</p>
            <p>The death of my Mother having made me a little more miſtreſs of my ſelf, and my Siſter <hi>Olympia</hi> being marry'd, I enjoyed the Priviledges of an elder Siſter, and was in a fair way to lead a Life full of Tranquility and Pleaſure. The condition I found my ſelf in, convinc'd me that the health of the Body depends almoſt altogether on the ſatisfaction of the Mind. And in the condition I was then in, I might have ſaid without Vanity, that Fortune had been no leſs favourable to me in the Gifts and Endowments of mind, ſhe conferr'd on me, than in outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and that the Soveraign Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of my Soul had a ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over my carriage, and form'd my deportment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48334:12"/>In the mean time my manner of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the King and his Brother, was ſo familiar and pleaſing, that I had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak what I thought, and the good fortune to find what I ſpoke very well taken. At my return with the Court from <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> I was aſſur'd I was not hated by the King, who though very young, had penetration enough to underſtand that Eloquence which, without ſpeaking a Syllable, perſwades more than all the fine words in the World. And the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination I had for the King, (whoſe merit and Quality I eaſily diſcover'd, greater than any Mans in his Kingdom) had perhaps render'd me more skilful in this than in any thing elſe. I thought the Teſtimony of my Eyes not ſufficient to convince me of ſo important a truth, till confirm'd by the extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and devoires paid me by the Courtiers, who as ſo many ſpyes of the Actions of their King, had clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his Majeſties Love for me.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this my raviſhing proſperity, a ſmall ſtorm aroſe, but was quickly over. It was reported the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48334:12"/>
King would marry the Princeſs <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> Daughter of Madam <hi>Royal,</hi> and afterwards Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> a Lady of extraordinary merit: This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the Court to go to <hi>Lyons</hi>: I leave it to thoſe who have Wit and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to judge, how capable a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of this kind is, to trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a perſon in love, and what a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to fear the loſs of what we have an extream paſſion for, eſpecially a paſſion grounded on extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and occaſion'd by ſo exalted an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when reaſon doth countenance and authorize our affection, and not only inclines, but commands us to love. But this ſtorm was too violent to laſt, and the marriage was as ſuddenly broke off as propos'd. I was oblig'd for this to <hi>Don Antonio Pimental,</hi> who luckily arriving with Propoſals of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (whereof he had a Project) their Highneſſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently return'd for <hi>Savoy,</hi> and I recover'd my former Tranquility, and found that the pain I had newly endur'd, being ſhort, and follow'd by the happineſs I regain'd, had improv'd my taſte of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48334:13"/>
pleaſures I enjoy'd, and heightned their ſweetneſs, and made thoſe ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Love the King honoured me with, more charming than ever: Nor was it a ſmall addition to my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that the Queen Mother gave me conſtant evidences of a particular eſteem for me, and that my Uncle was much kinder than before.</p>
            <p>The Exceſs of my proſperity made my ſatisfaction imperfect; and I could have wiſh'd my ſelf ſome little misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that I might the better reliſh the happineſs I enjoyed. It was not long ere I had my deſire, and fortune (with a Witneſs) granted my Requeſt.</p>
            <p>Being return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> our time was wholly taken up in divertiſements, which made this the pleaſanteſt part of my Life. His Majeſty to make our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights durable, commanded all thoſe of our Company (being the principal Lords and Ladies of the Court) to treat us by turns, which, though in the Country, was perform'd with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt magnificence. Love is the life of ſuch Entertainments, and there was not one of the Lords of the company but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48334:13"/>
had his ingagement; the Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpar'd no coſt to regale my Siſter <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>Richlieu</hi> was no leſs careful to pleaſe Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Motte Augencourt,</hi> Maid of Honour to the Queen. The Marqueſs <hi>d'Alvy</hi> was in love with Mademoiſelle <hi>Touillons,</hi> our Confident, who was alſo Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Queen, and afterwards marryed to the Marqueſs; not to ſpeak of the reſt as deeply engag'd.</p>
            <p>It would take up a Volume to tell you what happen'd in thoſe Gallant Treats, and the Divertiſments that attended them. I ſhall content my ſelf with the Relation of a ſingle adventure, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Gallantry of his Majeſty, and how well he knew to take his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew it. It was, as I remember, at <hi>Bois le Vicont,</hi> where, as I was walking very faſt under a row of Trees, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would give me His Hand, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hit mine a little with the Pommel of His Sword, He preſently drew it out of the Scabbard, and threw it away, in a manner no words are capable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. Theſe Pleaſures had laſted a pretty while, and 'twas now time I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48334:14"/>
ſhould taſte of ill fortune, who had ſo long enjoy'd good; but my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was greater than I deſir'd, and in a time I leaſt expected it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> no leſs weary of War, than the <hi>French,</hi> had (as I ſaid before) ſent <hi>Don Antonio Pimental</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to make an Overture of Peace; and the Treaty of Marriage with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> when almoſt concluded, being broken off at his arrival, <hi>France</hi> caſt her Eyes on the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom the World look'd upon as the only means to make Peace between the two Crowns, and reſtore Chriſtendom to general repoſe.</p>
            <p>It was not likely the King ſhould have Love for a Princeſs he knew only by Report, but the Picture of that charming Lady being come into <hi>France,</hi> produc'd in the Affections of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch the effect a ſight of the Original would have wrought, and preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd into him an ardent deſire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Allyance propos'd, which the Charms of the <hi>Infanta</hi> would have made him embrace, though the Queen Mother's perſwaſions and the Cardinal's,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48334:14"/>
and even Reaſons of State had been wanting to preſs him to it.</p>
            <p>Before the Court made ready for that famous Expedition which reſtor'd Peace to theſe Puiſſant Monarchies, His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence began his Journey, and would have us with him, to remove me from the Kings preſence, as fearing my ſtay at Court might obſtruct his deſigns. This part of my Life offers my Pen a large field to enlarge upon, by diſcovering the favourable inclination his Majeſty had for me, anſwerable to the general Report that hath paſt of it. But my modeſty forbids it, and will not allow me to ſpeak of the trouble that Prince was in at my departure; having retir'd to <hi>Chantilly</hi> for eight days, whence he inceſſantly ſent Courriers to me, the firſt whereof was a Musketeer who brought me five Letters from him, all very long. But I cannot paſs in ſilence the grief I had at parting nothing hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over gone ſo near me as this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: I thought the moſt exquiſite torments, pleaſures, if compar'd with the afflictions of ſo cruel an abſence, that was to put an end to hopes ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48334:15"/>
and make all my high and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ideas vaniſh into nothing. I wiſh'd for Death as the ſole Remedy of my Misfortune, and the Condition I was then in, was ſuch as cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</p>
            <p>There are few ſo unfortunate to have no hope of relief: All the comfort I had, was my hope the Treaty might be diſſolv'd, the Obſtacles of Peace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſo great, and that the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Treaty might turn to my advantage; but the Miniſters of the Crowns ſurmounted all difficulties, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining invinſible but my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
            <p>My Uncle being gone to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> to attend the coming of <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> chief Miniſter of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Court being ſhortly after arriv'd there, he ſent us to <hi>Rochell,</hi> with leave to take our pleaſure of walking over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Aunis</hi>: But ſolitude being more ſuitable to the ſadneſs of my thoughts; I choſe for my reſidence the Caſtle of <hi>Brouage,</hi> a place deſtitute of divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and where my Siſters and the reſt of my Company could not, as at <hi>Auris,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48334:15"/>
go every Day to a Play; as if I had fancy'd all the World obliged to ſhare in my ſorrow, and the pleaſures of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be my Crimes.</p>
            <p>All my divertiſements in this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, was reading ſome Letters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Poſt, and the kindneſs of my Siſter <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> who often quitted my Siſter <hi>Mariana</hi> to bear me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Then it was the Biſhop of <hi>Trejus</hi> arriv'd there from my Uncle, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to me Marriage with the Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> who had for that purpoſe ſent to his Eminence at the Conference, the Marqueſs <hi>Angeleli,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> to make the Propoſal to my Uncle; and at the ſame time engage <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> to obtain from his Catholick Majeſty the permiſſion (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Conſtable, being his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) to marry me.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Trejus</hi> fail'd not to repreſent it to me as the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Match in <hi>Rome</hi>; the Conſtable being equally illuſtrious for Nobility and Fortune, and with very great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs deſiring me in Marriage before any other. Any one but I would have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48334:16"/>
been comforted with a Propoſal of ſuch advantage, but the grief I was in had ſo fill'd me with diſdain, that the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Inſtances of the Biſhop did but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me, and forc'd me to anſwer him, He might have ſav'd himſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his Journey, if he had nothing elſe to propoſe to me but my leaving <hi>France</hi>; and that my Uncle, before I left Court to go along with him, had given me his word he would never force me to marry againſt my Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop return'd with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my Uncle, who having a great deſire to ſee my Siſters, was already diſpos'd to ſend for them, and had done it, but that the fear I was in of being left alone, and the requeſts of my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs prevail'd to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Peace being made, and the Kings Marriage concluded, his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ſent our Governeſs orders to bring us to <hi>Paris</hi>; where we arriv'd ſome Days before the Court remov'd from <hi>Burdeaux</hi>; and Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> a Perſon equally Gallant and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, began to make Love to me.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48334:16"/>
His Paſſion was as pleaſing to me as to my Governeſs, who very well knew the honeſty of his deſigns. But my Siſters were not pleas'd with his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities, and being often oblig'd to follow me to the <hi>Tuilleryes,</hi> they grew weary of thoſe continual walks; and as we ſeldom pardon the leaſt defect in thoſe we have no inclination for, the amorous Prince fell often under their Cenſure, inſomuch that the Reſpects he paid me, and the eſteem I could not deny his merit, were uſally made the ſubject of their Raillery.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his Nephews deſign, and fearing this Prince, being his lawful Succeſſor, might by the Marriage he intended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe the Cardinals Intereſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his Eminence advantages to the prejudice of the Duke, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbad him further addreſs to me, but pretended to me himſelf, but to very ſmall purpoſe, being too old to ſupply the place of a young Prince, or ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expect his waiting on me at the <hi>Tuilleryes,</hi> ſhould have the ſucceſs the aſſiduities of his Nephew might have met with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48334:17"/>While this new Lover was making his Court to me, the King arriv'd at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and the Cardinal ſent for us thither from <hi>Paris,</hi> to kiſs the new Queens Hand: I quickly foreſaw how dearly I ſhould buy this new Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and muſt confeſs I had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to perſwade my ſelf to receive it; expecting my Wounds (for which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was the beſt Remedy) would bleed afreſh at ſight of the King. I could not imagin the King would have received me with the indifference he did, and I muſt acknowledge I never took any thing ſo much to heart, which made me wiſh every moment I might have leave to return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an ordinary fault of our Sex, not to endure to hear others commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though very deſerving, if the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be given by one we love, to a Perſon who robs us of his affection. 'Tis the greateſt of torments. And the King frequently put me to it. I was to be pitied the more, that I could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him, or diſapprove a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Reaſon excus'd. And the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders my Uncle had given me, never to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48334:17"/>
ſpeak on that Subject, left me no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of blaming him. Yet all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations but augmented my grief, and the impatience I had to find an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to tell the King my Mind, who received my Complaints ſo ill, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd never more to acquaint him with my troubles.</p>
            <p>But my Diſeaſe wanted remedy, and in ſearch of cure, I removed from my ſight all Objects capable to foment my Paſſion, and ſtudied all plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes to ſtifle it: I earneſtly pray'd my Siſter, (in whom I had great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) to ſpeak all the ill ſhe could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the King; which was a hard Task for any, much more for one of her age. I ſhunn'd Company, and quitted the Court then at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and came thither as ſeldom as poſſible. There it was my Uncle fell ill, and finding himſelf grow worſe and worſe daily, he reſolv'd to have me marry'd to the Conſtable, who ſtill deſir'd it with much Conſtancy and Affection. His Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence finding me willing, writ to the Marqueſs <hi>Angeleli,</hi> then at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> who had made the firſt Overture of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48334:18"/>
Marriage to my Uncle at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Burdeaux</hi>: The Marqueſs came into <hi>France,</hi> and being a perſon of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and agreeable deportment, he made ſo good uſe of it in favour of the Conſtable, and the Cuſtomes of <hi>Italy,</hi> that I made it my requeſt to the Biſhop of <hi>Trejus</hi> to ſolicit my Uncle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Treaty of my Marriage, which his Eminence did ſome Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the concluſion of the Treaty of Marriage of my Siſter <hi>Hortenſia</hi> with the Duke <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and ſoon after finiſhed the courſe of his Heroick Life in a death equally illuſtrious. His Majeſty having been pleaſed to honour him with all poſſible expreſſions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and affection. Having done right to his memory, the King was ſo far from leſſening the kindneſs he had for us, it ſeem'd to increaſe; not a Night paſſing but he came into our Apartment, attended with the greateſt part of the Court, than which none was ever more rich or more ſplendid, or had greater Affairs in hand.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the divertiſements of the time, my Heart was full of cares and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48334:18"/>
diſquiet, the Articles which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſhould have ſent under his Hand, being not come; 'twas generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this delay proceeded from the change of Affairs by the death of my Uncle, and His Majeſty was pleas'd to offer me ſeveral Matches among the higheſt Nobility of his Court. But being as much concern'd to keep my word with the Conſtable, as I was to ſee my great hopes all vaniſh, I anſwer'd the King, if the Conſtable had alter'd his Mind, I would ſpend the reſt of my Days in a Covent.</p>
            <p>A few Days after, the Courrier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd with the Articles expected; in purſuance whereof we began to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Ceremonies of my Marriage in the Kings Chappel, where <hi>Maſs</hi> was ſaid by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſia,</hi> now Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who made me a Preſent of very great value, on the part of his Nephew the Conſtable, in whoſe Name the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Angeleli</hi> took me by the Hand: This Ceremony being over, I was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Princeſs Stranger, and as ſuch I had the priviledge of ſitting on a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourette
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48334:19"/>
in the Queens preſence. This was the begining of this affair, which was to end in my departure; I ſolicited it with a great deal of earneſtneſs, and could not be at reſt till I was on my way; I had taken my Reſolution, and thought it requiſite to execute it ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As I took leave of their Majeſties, the King had the goodneſs to aſſure me he would always allow me a place in his thoughts, and that he would favour me with his affection where ever I went. With that I went away, accompanied by the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Angeleli,</hi> and our Governeſs, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Fifty of the Guards, whom his Eminence had before his death or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to conduct me ſafe to <hi>Millan,</hi> where the Conſtable was to receive me.</p>
            <p>I paſs by the Accidents of our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as not worth relating. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable came to meet me, accompanied with the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaces</hi> his Couſin. This Gentleman making as if he were the Conſtable (who follow'd him to obſerve how I would receive him) advanc'd to ſalute me; but appearing very different from the Idea I had of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48334:19"/>
Conſtable, I receiv'd his Complement with a little ſurprize, and very coldly, and turning on the ſudden towards my Maid <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> I told her, if that ſame were the Husband provided me, he might go look out another Wife, for I would never have him. <hi>Hortenſia</hi> having ſeen the Conſtables Picture, knew him, and obſerving him hide himſelf behind the Marqueſs, ſhe, to diſabuſe me, ſhew'd me him, who to clear the miſtake and put me out of doubt, advanc'd preſently, and having ſaluted me, gave me his Hand to lead me to a Houſe of Pleaſure he had hard by, within ſix Leagues of <hi>Millan,</hi> where he had provided us a magnificent Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Having eaten, we embarqued to go lye at <hi>Millan,</hi> where we were received in very great State: The Marchioneſs <hi>de los Balbaces</hi> took me in her Coach, and the Duke <hi>Caltano,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Millan,</hi> being come out of the City to receive us, accompanied the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, who would conſummate the Marriage that very Night, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcruples of my Governeſs, who would have had it deferr'd till after <hi>Maſs</hi> on the morrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48334:20"/>I was ſo tyr'd with my Journey, ſo diſpleas'd to ſee my ſelf at that diſtance from my Relations, and above all ſo troubled that I had left <hi>France,</hi> and ſo much the more as I compared the way of living there with that of <hi>Italy,</hi> (though I was then not advanc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Millan</hi> to learn the difference) that I was in very ill humour, which was no ſmall affliction to the Conſtable, who did all he could to divert me, with Balls, and Dancings, and running at the Ring, and other Entertainments of that Nature; wherein I may without flattery or partiality affirm, the Conſtable deſerv'd the applauſe of all, as having ſurpaſſed all others in the dextrous performances of thoſe Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The principal Ladies of the Town feaſted me ſumptuouſly in their Houſes, particularly the Marchioneſs <hi>de la Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente,</hi> who ſurpaſſed the reſt both in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Magnificence; but I was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, and out of order, being newly recover'd of a Fever, and could not reliſh thoſe Pleaſures: At laſt, after ten Days continuance of theſe Divertiſements, it was reſolved, notwithſtanding my ill
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48334:20"/>
health, we ſhould ſet out for <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Conſtable was very deſirous to be before the hot Weather came. The Governeſs and Guards that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us took their leave, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd for <hi>Paris,</hi> and we embarqued on a rich and glorious Veſſel for <hi>Bologna,</hi> where the Marqueſs <hi>de Angeleli</hi> received us in his Houſe with extraordinary kindneſs, and regal'd us very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently; the Ten Days we ſtaid there were ſpent in ſeveral Divertiſements, but I grew worſe and worſe of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and could not find any pleaſure in them.</p>
            <p>We continued our Journey by the way of <hi>Lorretto,</hi> to avoid the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Florence,</hi> where, of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Europe,</hi> Ceremonies are moſt in uſe. When we arriv'd at <hi>Peſaro</hi> I was ſo ill, that the Conſtable was oblig'd to take with him a Phyſitian to take care of my health, and, travelling pretty hard, we came in two days to <hi>Loretto,</hi> but I was not able to go further. The trouble the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable was in for my illneſs was incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and the greater, becauſe it hinder'd his being at the <hi>Cavalcade</hi> yearly made at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48334:21"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> on St. <hi>Peters</hi> Day, for which he had haſten'd our Journey, and travell'd very hard. But my Malady appearing deſperate, and the Symptoms mortal, the Conſtable ſent for all the Eminent Phyſitians in the Neighbouring Cities, but with very ill ſucceſs; for of Ten or Twelve that came to me there was not one capable to undertake the Cure; they all agreed it dangerous, but none of them knew what to propoſe for a Remedy: They had every Day Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations together, but I receiv'd not the leaſt comfort from their Conferences, which ended ſtill without any reſolution. This oblig'd the Conſtable to diſpatch a Courrier to <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome of the moſt famous Phyſitians there, and the ſame time he gave the Cardinal <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chini,</hi> my Uncle, an account of my condition. He came to us almoſt as ſoon as the Phyſitians, and was very much grieved to ſee me ſo ill, and took incredible care to comfort me.</p>
            <p>The violence of my diſtemper, and the diſorder it put me in, was ſo far from permitting me to make the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable thoſe great demonſtrations of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48334:21"/>
kindneſs were due to him, that I muſt acknowledge he was not a little tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the ill humour I was in, which the Cardinal us'd his endeavours to put me out of; and had been more ſucceſsful, had he apply'd himſelf alſo to cure the ill humour of the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe imprudent inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and indiſcreet Zeal perſecuted me with that violence, that he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred my Chamber, but he told me there was no hope of life, that it was high time for me to ſet my Houſe in order, and not think my ſelf a Woman for this World: And although I was not altogether of his Opinion, yet I made ſome preparation for death, and gave order for a Prieſt (who could ſpeak <hi>French</hi>) to be ſent for. They brought me a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who was an eminent Man, and helped me three or four times to make my General Confeſſion. The Conſtable more concern'd than I for my Sickneſs, inform'd himſelf every moment, by the Phyſitians who attended me, if there were hopes of my life; and being anſwered there was, if I were not worſe the third day, he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48334:22"/>
came into my Chamber with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance, and having told me the good News, pray'd me with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to trouble my ſelf for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs impertinent Preachments: The ſucceſs verify'd the judgment of the Phyſitians, I grew viſibly better, and was in few days out of danger; ſoon after I went to give God thanks at the Chappel of <hi>Lorretto,</hi> where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Communion; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, to perform a Vow he had made for my health, ſent thither one of the faireſt and richeſt Lamps to be ſeen there, which he conſecrated on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to our Lady, in whoſe Treaſury it remains.</p>
            <p>The ill Air and heats of <hi>Lorretto</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudicial to my recovery, I was carry'd to <hi>Recanati,</hi> a place not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, where I continued ſix days, in which time by the care taken of me, and the good Air of the place, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſtrength enough to purſue my Journey, and ſatisfie the Conſtables deſires of taking me to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter</hi> being over, there was no entring that City, by reaſon of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48334:22"/>
exceſſive heats, and the manifeſt hazard of health they run who will venture it. But we, though advis'd to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſlighted the danger, and, having taken a ſmall preſervative againſt ill Airs, eſcap'd without hurt. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and weakneſs I was under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my late ſickneſs, oblig'd me to keep my Bed for ſome days, in which time the Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> preſented me with ſome Jewels of very great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, beſides a hundred and fifty pieces of Gold worth two thouſand Piſtols.</p>
            <p>Having in few days recover'd my health, (though without any care of my part,) I began to walk abroad for divertiſement, and appeared in an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Dreſs for the Novelty. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable one day ask'd me if I would go viſit the Nieces of Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> then Pope, to deſire them to bring me to kiſs his Holineſs Feet; I who was us'd to ſee every Day a great Monarch come into my Lodgings, innocently ask'd the Conſtable if his Holineſs would not firſt come and viſit me. The Conſtable and thoſe in company anſwer'd me, ſmiling, that the Popes were not us'd to do any body that Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48334:23"/>The Cuſtoms of <hi>Italy</hi> were not at all agreeable to my humour, yet the love I had for the Conſtable made them tolerable, and I bore with them pretty well. As for the Conſtable, he forgot not any thing that might give me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, appearing always neat, gallant, and extremely careful of me, with an unexpreſſible Complaiſance: And though he be not naturally very tender and kind, I may truly affirm I was the Perſon he had moſt love for, and moſt conſtancy: No man ever was more paſſionately deſirous of Children, and I was then in hopes to ſatisfie his deſires; when I told him the News of it, it gave him incredible joy, though it laſted but two Months, at the end of which I miſcarry'd; this accident occaſioned by trouble and ſickneſs, was attended with a Fever of forty days, which made them report commonly at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Conſtable had marry'd a Lady that was incurable, who had more need of a Phyſitian than a Husband, and would never have a Child: None more buſie than the Patriarch in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Reports, which ſeem'd to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48334:23"/>
juſtified by the length of my ſickneſs, having laſted all Winter; but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd towards Spring, and having found my ſelf the ſecond time with Child in the Summer, thoſe Reports vaniſh'd, and People alter'd their Opinions. My former miſcarriage accaſion'd the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of me now, ſo that I was not allow'd to ſtir abroad but in a Chair. As I was in my ſixth Month, the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> my Brother, came to <hi>Rome</hi> to paſs the Carnaval there: 'tis not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expreſs the joy I had to ſee him after ſo long abſence, and ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly: The Conſtable was no leſs glad than I at his coming, and making it his buſineſs to find out means at once to regale him, and divert me, he ask'd us if we would go a hunting to <hi>Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> a place belonging to the Prince of <hi>Caſerta</hi> then in Exile, but we found there (in his Room) Monſieur <hi>de Gactan,</hi> who received us with all poſſible civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and treated us magnificently: We continued there fifteen days, and ſpent moſt of our time in hunting: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, who knew that beſides the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and divertiſements of that ſport,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48334:24"/>
ſome Glory may be gain'd in that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent War, by clearing the Country of the wild Boars that harraſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it, deſir'd the aſſiſtance of ſeveral Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood to help him and his Retinue to deſtroy thoſe Monſters of the Forreſts. He had that ſucceſs in it, that it was ſaid we left not one alive thereabouts; and we carryed with us to <hi>Rome</hi> enough to feaſt half the Town.</p>
            <p>I was then ſo big, I durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hunting on Horſe-back; yet I loſt not the pleaſure of the Chaſe, the Huntſmen cauſing ſeveral wild Boars to paſs near a cloſe Charriot I rid in, which was ſo large and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, that the ſtrongeſt Boar could not overturn it; ſo that I had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing the ſport without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger; beſides the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of my Brothers Company; who, naturally averſe from pains and fatigues, ſate with me in the Charriot.</p>
            <p>At our return to <hi>Rome,</hi> we found all ſports and divertiſements prohibited by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>; who, to expreſs the ſmall inclination he had for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48334:24"/>
of pleaſure, would not permit a Comedy to be preſented: The Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupply this defect, reſolv'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us with an Entertainment in <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade:</hi> The Subject was taken from the Fable of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were repreſented by the Conſtable and my Brother, attended with a Train of Gentlemen, and uſher'd in by a Man in the ſhape of a Swan; ſo much to the Life, that had Nature produc'd Swans of that bigneſs, the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning Eye might have miſtaken this Man for a Swan. As they march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they threw among the Ladies the following Verſes compos'd by a Perſon of known Ability.</p>

            <p>Pleaſure and Pain commonly ſucceed each other, the one uſually beginning where the other ends: After the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Carnaval, we had the diſpleaſure of my Brothers departure, but allay'd with his promiſe to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when I ſhould next lye in. Not long after, I had the News of the death of the Marqueſs <hi>Angeleli</hi>; who having reſolv'd, againſt the advice of all his Friends, to return to <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was murder'd by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Count <hi>Bovio</hi>; who according
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48334:25"/>
to the Cuſtome of the place, took his Revenge upon the Marqueſs for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done by his Couſin and intimate Friend, who was the principal Object of the Counts wrath; but a Perſon from whom he had not been able to obtain ſatisfaction. I was extreamly concern'd for the misfortune of the Marqueſs, who, while he liv'd, made it his buſineſs to oblige me, and had occordinly done me many good Offices, being withall a Perſon of great Merit and excellent Parts. All the time I went with Child, my prayers were it might be a Son; my deſires were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd the ſeventh of <hi>April,</hi> being the Coronation Day of Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>: The News of my being brought to Bed of a Boy were received with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Joy by the Conſtable, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and all the Family, who as paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately wiſh'd it as I: And though the weakneſs of the Child gave ſmall hopes of long Life, yet the Joy at his Birth was extraordinary, and thoſe who brought the firſt News of it, were richly preſented.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> looking on me as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48334:26"/>
the principal cauſe of this Joy, came in Perſon to congratulate me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with a thouſand Piſtols, and ſeveral Jewels: At forty Days end (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lain in ſo long) I was to fit my ſelf for receiving the Viſits of the ſacred College, and of the Princeſſes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Town; to perform this with the formality requiſit, I made uſe of a Bed prepar'd for my firſt lying in, and never ſince us'd, being generally admir'd for its Novelty and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. It was made in imitation of a Shell-Fiſh floating in the midſt of a Sea, artificially done, and exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; the waves ſerving as a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to the Bed, the Poſts whereof ſtood on four Sea-Horſes, mounted with as many Syrens, ſo excellently cut, and curiouſly guilt, all that ſaw them thought them made of Maſſy-Gold, ten or twelve little <hi>Cupids</hi> ſerv'd for Hooks and Claſpes to hang the Curtains on, which were of the richeſt Cloth of Gold, and hung down looſely to hide from ſight whatever might be thought ordinary in this ſumptuous Bed, which indeed was more for Ornament than uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48334:26"/>My young Son being much better, and I ſo well as to give the Conſtable hopes of another Succeſſor, his Joy was ſo great, that he declared he was never better ſatisfy'd, never more at eaſe, and to compleat his happineſs, he made it his buſineſs to give me cauſe of equal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. I took my advantage of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable diſpoſition, and having a great deſire to paſs the Carnaval at <hi>Venice,</hi> I propos'd a Journey thither; he promis'd to go with me, if the Cardinal his Uncle would bear us company. His Eminence at my firſt motion made ſome difficulty to conſent, but yielded at laſt, upon my aſſuring him I was not with Child, the fear of my miſcarriage being the Obſtacle he objected. We left <hi>Rome</hi> about the end of <hi>April,</hi> and had a pleaſant Journey, the more to my ſatisfaction, in that the Conſtable was not ſo ſcrupulouſly careful of me as formerly, but allow'd me to uſe my Coach, or ride, and ſometimes at full ſpeed, as I pleas'd. Till this occaſion, he had always ſeem'd to love me very well; but was now ſo far from being angry at my exceſſes, that he bid me
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48334:27"/>
one day, not diſcover my condition to any, leſt it might come to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Ear. Having eſcaped very well all my Journey, I miſcarry'd the ſecond time, ſoon after my arrival at <hi>Venice</hi>: this deferr'd for a while the effect of the Conſtables Vows: but I lay in of this miſcarriage a fortnight only, and was perfectly recover'd. While I went with Child, I was always pretty well; and being now the fourth time ſo, I paſs'd the Carnaval with much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in ſeeing Plays, in feaſting, dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and other Entertainments, playing often at <hi>Baſſette,</hi> a Game I was much taken with, wherein I had the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and other Perſons of quality, who were come to <hi>Venice</hi> to enjoy the pleaſures of the Seaſon. In the midſt of which I was tormented with the fear of leaving a place of ſo much divertiſement, and returning to <hi>Rome.</hi> Accordingly the Conſtable told me one day, we muſt of neceſſity be gone, and that having gone with Child a pretty while, I was to prevent the like accident as had happened to me at
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48334:27"/>
my coming to <hi>Venice.</hi> I was much troubled at this order, though expected, and to make me comply with it, he was forc'd to give me his word to come thither the next Carnaval; with that we parted, having taken leave of our Friends, particularly the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> who was ſo pleaſed with our company, and the Conſtables civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that he promis'd to come to <hi>Rome</hi> on purpoſe to ſee us, and would bring with him thither the Princeſs his Wife.</p>
            <p>I was carry'd all the way in a Litter, our Journeys were eaſie, ſo that it was the begining of Summer when we got to <hi>Rome</hi>; where having paſt the great heats, which were more troubleſome for my being ſo big with Child; I was brought to Bed the begining of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of a ſecond Son, the night before Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> was to take his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for <hi>Spain,</hi> to bring the <hi>Infanta, Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to the Emperour. His Eminence was extreme glad at the news brought him of a ſecond prop of his Family newly born, and not content to expreſs his Joy in words,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48334:28"/>
he made me ſeveral very fair preſents, and no leſs rich than the former, and preſently took his leave, in obedience to his Majeſties orders.</p>
            <p>By the Cardinals abſence, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable came to have the abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and diſpoſal of all his Eſtate, the management whereof had been left to his Eminence: A few days after we went to <hi>Ciſterna,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> with his Lady the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, came from <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee us, and ſtay'd with us three days: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and I expreſt our ſelves very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſo extraordinary an Obligation, and I particularly thank'd him for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word ſo exactly. I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſpeak of the civility and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of this Prince, being qualities as well known as his name. As ſoon as I came to <hi>Rome,</hi> I went to pay the Princeſs her viſit, and found in her carriage, her humour, her wit, and her dreſs, an Abridgment of all the charming Perfections and exacteſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>France</hi>: About that time my Brother being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> writ to us to come to him, which we could
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48334:28"/>
not then do, but reſpited our Journey till Spring; when we ſet out for <hi>Venice,</hi> to be there at the Aſcenſion, to ſee the ſolemnity of that Feaſt, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fair, which ſo many curious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> reſort to ſee. The Circumſtances of the one and the other, are too long to be inſerted here. I was then with Child, but being more careful of my ſelf than formerly, I eſcap'd without any ill accident in my Journey, or at <hi>Venice</hi>; where having ſeen all the Solemnities of the Feaſt of Aſcenſion, we went for <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> the begining of Summer, which we ſpent very pleaſantly, till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, finding himſelf obliged the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>September</hi> to paſs over into <hi>Spain,</hi> left me in much trouble for his abſence, which the Marchioneſs of <hi>Balbaces,</hi> the Marqueſs her Husband, and my Brother (who was pleas'd to bear us company) endeavoured to ſweeten to me, by the great kindneſs they expreſt for me. While I was afflicting my ſelf for the Conſtables abſence, he was in extream danger by a terrible ſtorm that overtook him in the Mediterranean,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48334:29"/>
being aboard a Gally of the <hi>Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron</hi> of <hi>Scicily</hi> bound for <hi>Spain.</hi> But having narrowly eſcap'd it, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, and (though without equipage) continued his Journey by Land. He took the firſt Coach he met with, till he might accommodate himſelf better with neceſſaries to carry him to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he arriv'd at length, three days after the death of King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth. The death of this Monarch having chang'd the face of Affairs, caus'd the Conſtable to change his deſign, and made him reſolve to return after a fortnights ſtay in that Court, where the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſolitude on that ſad occaſion, and his impatience to ſee me, would not permit him to ſtay long; to ſatisfie this deſire, and perform his promiſe to me of being back by that time that I was to lye in; he came by the way of <hi>France,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Millan</hi> about the end of <hi>November</hi>: His Siſter and I went to meet him out of Town, where I was as joyful to ſee him, as I had been troubled for his abſence, and the very night he arriv'd I brought him a third Son for his welcome-home. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48334:29"/>
been in labour of this Child to the apparent danger of my Life, I took a reſolution to avoid, for the future, all occaſions of expoſing my ſelf to the like, by bearing any other. The Conſtables conſent being neceſſary to make valid a reſolution of this nature, I preſs'd him for it, and obtained it, having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince found him, in that particular, a Man of his word. Having made this agreement, all my care was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my health to go paſs another Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval at <hi>Venice</hi>: As ſoon as I had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd ſtrength, we ſet forwards on our Journey, leaving our third Child to the care of the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Balbaces,</hi> the ſecond being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the eldeſt with us. I had ſpent this Carnaval with a great deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, had it not been for my jealouſie of the Conſtable, who went in ſearch of reparation abroad, for the loſs incurr'd at home, by our late agreement. And, I muſt confeſs, I was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd his keeping his word with me ſhould coſt me ſo dear.</p>
            <p>There were at <hi>Venice</hi> many excellent <hi>Opera</hi>'s, particularly that of <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48334:30"/>
which I ſaw very often, being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleas'd with the ſweetneſs of the Voices, and excellency of the Actors, eſpecially a Muſitian of his Highneſſes, call'd <hi>Cavagninro,</hi> and one of my Maids, who did wonders; not to ſpeak of the Comedy, which was one of the beſt that ever was acted.</p>
            <p>The Carnaval being over, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable went to <hi>Rome</hi> with my Brother to diſpatch ſome Affairs. At his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn (which was within three weeks) I ſpoke to him of going to <hi>Millan,</hi> where I deſir'd to be at the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s arrival. I was more troubled to quit <hi>Venice</hi> at this time, than formerly, as having more acquaintance there, and being of opinion it was the pleaſanteſt City in the World, and of the choiceſt divertiſements: but the more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I appear'd to leave it, the more did the Conſtable haſten our departure, ſo that we ſet out in the hotteſt of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. At <hi>Millan</hi> I did my endeavour to paſs my time as pleaſantly as poſſible, to which the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaces</hi> and his Lady contributed not a little. We ſpent the day in walking, and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48334:30"/>
Collations, and the night in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, prepar'd for us at <hi>The Place Marine,</hi> the pleaſanteſt of that Town. A while after our company was increas'd by the addition of ſome perſons of quality, which came to us from <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> from whence his Royal Highneſs had ſent us one of the principal Lords of his Court, with ſeveral Gentlemen his Friends to complement the Empreſs, who arriv'd there about the end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi>: I kiſs'd her hand, having waited on her in a Spaniſh Dreſs, and in deep moorning for Cardinal <hi>Colonna,</hi> who dy'd at <hi>Final</hi> of a Sickneſs he fell into, attending this Prince. Her Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with very great kindneſs, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I appeared, by my Deportment, and the air of my Countenance, to be what my Habit promis'd. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement whereby ſhe intended to give me the advantage over the Ladies of all other Nations; there being no doubt but ſhe look'd upon the faſhion her ſelf appear'd in, the moſt excellent, and preferrable to all others. She continued her Journey for <hi>Vienna,</hi> but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable was not diſpos'd to wait on her
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48334:31"/>
thither, though I very much deſir'd it. He hath a Soul ſo generous, I ſhould do him wrong, ſhould I impute his not going, to his fear of expence neceſſary for ſuch a Journey. The truth is, the Love he had had for me, was very much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and too weak to incline him to ſo much complaiſance. I propos'd to him then, that we ſhould paſs another Carnaval at <hi>Venice,</hi> which I was aſſur'd he would not deny me, though I was ſenſible his inclinations for the place, prevail'd with him more, than my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for going thither. We ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on our Journey, and though I found in that City the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements as formerly, they did not pleaſe me ſo well, being now very much alter'd, and perpetually torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my jealouſie of the Conſtable, which the ſtories I heard of him did but too clearly juſtifie. I was ſo griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that others took advantage of my politick Barrenneſs, that I found my ſelf already in a very ſorrowful condition. And as if I had not had reaſon enough to torment my ſelf with jealouſies abroad, Fortune provided
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48334:31"/>
me a new occaſion at home, by a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs who lodg'd with us. Her Youth, and her Beauty, drew the Eyes of all towards her, and amongſt the reſt, the Conſtable was of her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Had I not made that conjecture by his looks, his ſighs and aſſiduities had been ſufficient to convince me; I had too much reaſon to make that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; my reſentment, though conceal'd, was great, but that of the Preſident <hi>Donaville,</hi> whom my Brother had taken with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> was greater, who look'd upon the Conſtables ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes as no ſmall Obſtacle to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs of his paſſion, rival'd alſo by <hi>Quaranta Lupuli,</hi> a Man of excellent parts, natural and acquired, and a moſt affectionate Lover, powerful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for obtaining of Love. The Winter, as well as the Carnaval, being over, we went for <hi>Rome,</hi> by the way of <hi>Bologna,</hi> where the Cardinal <hi>Legat</hi> gave us, in his Pallace, a ſplendid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. The Marchioneſs travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, found the number of her Lovers increaſe by the way; but the moſt paſſionate, and he who evidenc'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48334:32"/>
his fidelity, by a Sacrifice very unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in our days, was <hi>Quaranta,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely concern'd to ſee his Love ſlighted, and fancying others more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, abandon'd himſelf ſo to jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and grief, that within a days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Bologna</hi> (in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he intended to bear us compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) he fell into a violent Fever, which quickly ended his days.</p>
            <p>We continued our Journey, and at our arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> had the news of his death. The Marchioneſs wept, but many tears were not to be expected from a perſon ſurrounded with the flames of ſo many Lovers. After the death of this Lover ſucceeded the abſence of her Husband, whom ſhe enjoy'd a very ſhort time, a military employment they had beſtowed on him at <hi>Amona,</hi> having call'd him away thither to live in a Houſe of his own, after ſeven or eight Months time ſpent in ours; the Paſtimes and Feaſts we had conſtantly at home, appear'd to me too dull for the Carnaval, and deſiring to ſpend it with more pleaſure, and prevent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the liberty I enjoy'd, I reſolv'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48334:32"/>
to have a Maſquerade, wherein I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Clorinda,</hi> and being attended with thirty or forty Gentlemen in Souldiers habit; I threw about, as the cuſtom was, ſome Verſes, which my Brother and a Gentleman his Friend, call'd <hi>Mareſcotti,</hi> made for the occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Carnaval being ended, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs ſpoke of returning to <hi>Bologna,</hi> which the Conſtable appear'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at; the Correſpondence, between them, having for ſome time paſt been leſs than formerly. A few days after we went for <hi>Millan</hi> to receive my Siſter <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who we heard was retir'd from <hi>Paris,</hi> for ſome differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Husband and her: The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs I always had for her, made me undertake this Journey with a great deal of pleaſure, and I forgot nothing that might oblige the Conſtable to come thither alſo, who did all he could to excuſe himſelf, and divert me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, among other reaſons, I was not oblig'd to go ſo far: Yet he reſolved to go upon the arrival of a Courrier, ſent by the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaces,</hi> to inform us my Siſter was arriv'd at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toff,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48334:33"/>
and to invite us to <hi>Millan.</hi> The Conſtable having, with ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, anſwer'd he would go, we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Marchioneſs and I in a Caleche, in which we went away Poſt, and the Conſtable in another, with the Counteſs <hi>d' Eſtela,</hi> whom I formerly mention'd by the name of <hi>Hortenſia</hi>: Our train was reduced to three or four Valetts, whom we thought moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a Journey of haſte, with whom we arriv'd at <hi>Millan</hi> in ſix days; where I found my ſelf extremly diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, not only with the fatigue of the Journey, but the perpetual Jars I had with the Conſtable, who was never better pleas'd, then when he ſaw things fall out ill in this Journey undertaken againſt his will, in the worſt time of the Year. Being arriv'd, we learnt by the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaces,</hi> that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was at a Country houſe, ſix or ſeven Leagues from <hi>Millan,</hi> and ſet out preſently for the place, where we found her a-Bed, which ſhe was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to keep for a hurt ſhe had received in her Knees by a fall from a Horſe: the hurt was conſiderable, though ſhe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48334:33"/>
ſaid it was nothing, and bore it ſo well, ſhe appeared not troubled at all with it: Being newly come from <hi>France,</hi> ſhe had her fancy full of the faſhions of that Country, and the humours of the Nation; which, conſidering only the outſide, takes the meaſures of eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, meerly from the dreſs they appear in: The Marchioneſs and I, very defective in that point, found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very cold reception, our ill equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page had met with the contempt it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. This mortification being over, the paſſage by water being thought more convenient for my Siſter, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued for <hi>Millan,</hi> where we arriv'd that Night, and the Marchioneſs ſoon after return'd for <hi>Bologna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one was deſirous to ſee Madam <hi>Mazarin;</hi> the greateſt things ſeldom anſwer the Ideas we conceive of them before-hand, and generally fall in their value with us, when acquainted with them; but 'twas otherwiſe with my Siſter, who exceeded at ſight all that had been imagin'd of her, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd new Graces every day ſhe was ſeen, which was not ſo often as was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48334:34"/>
wiſh'd, by reaſon of the great pleaſure ſhe took at <hi>Millan</hi> in being alone, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing only to her own People, and locking her ſelf up in the Apartment we had provided for her, where ſhe kept her Bed for the moſt part, that ſhe might be cur'd the ſooner of her hurt; ſo that if ſhe went ſometimes abroad with us (which was not ordinary) yet ſhe went very negligently dreſt, though ſhe appear'd beautiful as ever; her hurt (which was rare) having added new Graces to her Perſon, ſo that in a looſe dreſs, ſhe look'd as charming as in the moſt exact and compleat the World could afford. Some weeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Brother came to us, and was raviſhed to ſee her; but this mighty kindneſs was quickly broke off on the account of a Gentleman of my Siſters, whom ſhe gave a little too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, it being uſual with thoſe of his Character, to forget themſelves and abuſe the liberty allow'd them; yet I reconcil'd them, though but for a few days; they falling out again upon a difference of which you ſhall have an account in its proper place. I was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48334:34"/>
then ſo weary of ſo long ſtay at <hi>Millan,</hi> that I pray'd the Conſtables leave to go with my Brother and Siſter to <hi>Venice</hi>: The anſwer he made my humble requeſt was, he could not go ſo ſoon, nor would go thither any more, but that I might go without him. I was ſo ſhock'd at the refuſal, and eſpecially the manner of it, when I ſaw him take pleaſure in croſſing me, that I had left his Houſe that very moment, had not my reſentment yielded and ſubmitted to the arguments of the Marchioneſs his Siſter againſt it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon the Conſtable ſtaid ſo long at <hi>Millan,</hi> was only to attend the coming of the Marqueſs of <hi>Mortara,</hi> the new Spaniſh Governour, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his coming deferr'd longer than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he reſolved to be gone. My Siſter and Brother deſir'd of him that I could not obtain; not able to deny it them, he gave his conſent, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhould not make any long ſtay at <hi>Venice,</hi> knowing it a place I was moſt pleas'd with, and pretending the cauſe of our ſhort ſtay to be a promiſe he had made Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> to meet him
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48334:35"/>
at a hunting match at <hi>Sienna</hi>: We quitted <hi>Millan</hi> with the ſatisfaction of having reconciled my Bother and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſecond time; my Brother promis'd to come to us before we left <hi>Sienna.</hi> But having heard by the way the Cardinal was not there, we went to <hi>Bologna</hi> to attend his coming. The Conſtable here lodg'd in a Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to one of his Gentlemen, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoid the trouble of complements would have been expected from him, had he lodg'd in a greater. The ſhort time we ſtaid there, the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Balbaces</hi> was very good company for us: but though we were entertain'd in the Country with great and ſumptuous Collations, I was ſo troubled to ſee my Siſter ſo ſad, that I took no delight in the Entertainments. At laſt we went for <hi>Sienna,</hi> upon the news we had of the Cardinals arrival there, where I began to recover my good humour, through the pleaſant reception given us by his Eminence, who feaſted us for fifteen days, wherein the pleaſure of hunting contributed not a little to our divertiſement, my Siſter being much
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48334:35"/>
taken with that exerciſe, and doing often as mortal execution on the Game with her Hands, as with her Eyes on the Gameſters.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all this joy, I had the grief to ſee a new falling out between my Siſter and Brother, who came to us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, and preſently after this third broyl returned for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> My Brother being gone, we went to <hi>Marino,</hi> an Eſtate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, qualify'd with the Title of a Dukedom, within twelve Leagues of <hi>Rome:</hi> Having ſtaid there till <hi>Allhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantide,</hi> we went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where my Siſter, continuing her way of living at <hi>Millan,</hi> made our Houſe a very Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, letting us ſee her very ſeldom, avoiding our converſation, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any viſit: Her retreat extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled me and my Brother, who in few days came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had new cauſe of diſpleaſure. Every body look'd upon her retirement as an effect of the ill Counſels of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of hers, in whom ſhe had great confidence, and I was willing to uſe all my Endeavours to perſwade her to

other courſes: And mov'd with a juſt reſentment, to ſee all my care and pains made the ſubject of their raillery and laughter, I told that Gentleman (who was call'd <hi>Courberville</hi>) what I thought fit on that account, looking on him as the ſole cauſe of this misfortune, it was not in my power to remedy. This Fellow (who was brave enough, but a little too preſumptuous) thinking it perhaps, beneath him to excuſe himſelf, anſwer'd me with ſo much incivility, and ſpoke of my Brother with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, I was forc'd to bid him get out of my Chamber, and threatning him he ſhould find ſome below who would teach him the reſpect he ought to pay Perſons of my Brothers quality; he went down in a Huff, and my Siſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offended at this buſineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly left my Houſe, and went to my Aunt <hi>Martinozzi</hi>'s, and <hi>Courberville</hi> to the Cardinal <hi>Manchini</hi>'s, my Uncle; whence in few days he went to <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> where he was taken, and, for his inſolence, clapt up in the Caſtle, but he quickly got out again, by the favour of the Popes Nephews who procur'd him
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48334:36"/>
his liberty at the requeſt of Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>; who, not able to endure the ſubjection ſhe was in at my Aunt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinozzi</hi>'s, reſolv'd to go live with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Aunt we had at <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> who was very glad to have her there. As for me, who never wanted kindneſs for my Siſter, I viſited her often, but being always received very ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I could not penetrate her intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or diſcover her deſigns.</p>
            <p>About this time I deſir'd leave of the Conſtable to go to <hi>Naples,</hi> which was eaſily obtain'd, for two reaſons, the one, that the Journey was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, the other, that it was a place I did not like ſo well as <hi>Venice.</hi> We had for company, the Patriarch, and the Sieurs <hi>Mareſcotti</hi> and <hi>Acciaioli,</hi> the firſt of <hi>Bologna,</hi> the other of <hi>Sienna,</hi> both very good Friends of the Family. We had with us beſides them the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables Brother, then call'd the <hi>Abbot Colonna,</hi> and my Brother: My compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was the Counteſs <hi>d' Eſtella,</hi> with one of her Chamber Maids, call'd <hi>Conſtance,</hi> whom my Brother had lik'd very well: This which was intended a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48334:37"/>
Journey of pleaſure, was unhappily diſturb'd by a quarrel between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch and the Abbot <hi>Colonna,</hi> which had like to have proceeded to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity: But having reconcil'd them, and continued a Fortnight at <hi>Naples,</hi> we return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I found my Siſter in a deep Melancholly, for the choice ſhe had made of her place of retirement. No Perſon is more ſenſible of the troubles of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation than I, who have in my nature a generoſity, rare in this Age, which puts me upon attempting the difficulteſt matters for their eaſe and relief. This made me conſult only my own ardent affection, and paſs by the coldneſs my Siſter entertaind me with, and propoſe to her a way how to get out of this Covent, telling her, ſhe might rely on the protection of the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that her Majeſty had given me hopes of receiving her into her Palace; ſhe accepted the offer, and I went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to take order for puting the deſign in execution. But when I thought all things in readineſs, the very day I had reſolv'd to go take out my Siſter, I was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48334:37"/>
told, by ſome I had employ'd in the buſineſs, that it was not in the Queens power to meddle in the Affair, (as ſhe made me hope ſhe would) nor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect my Siſter. I was not diſcourag'd by this ill ſucceſs, but reſting aſſur'd of favour and protection if I could get out my Siſter; I went to the Covent, and took my Children with me, that while my Aunt and the Nuns ſhould be playing with them, I might put my deſign in execution: After a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with my Aunt, I took my leave of her, and told her at parting, ſhe ſhould not ſtir a ſtep further for fear the Air might do her harm, being not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well: The ſame Inſtant I made ſigns to my Siſter to follow me, which ſhe did on pretence to bring me to the Gate; we went on together, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending private diſcourſe, (to give them who follow'd us occaſion of coming after at a diſtance) we were quickly at the Gate, while my Aunt and the Nuns were buſie in careſſing my Children; I fell a talking to her who was Porter, and ſo made way for my Siſter to get out, with a Maid of hers call'd <hi>Anne,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48334:38"/>
and without taking leave of any, I preſently ran after them. We ſtept into the Coach which waited us hard by, and went directly to Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi>'s, to beg his favour, or at leaſt his adviſe: But not finding him within, we went to our Brothers houſe, where we had been all born and bred, but, unluckily, found it all unfurniſhed, being newly left by an Aunt of ours, who had lodg'd there: Here we reſolv'd to ſend to <hi>Don Juan Baptiſta Roſpiglioſi,</hi> the Popes Nephew, who preſently came to us: Having inform'd him of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of what we had done, my Siſter and I intreated him to beſpeak the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Nephew and the Pope in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, leſt Cardinal <hi>Manchini,</hi> our Uncle, ſhould incline him to ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt my Siſter. <hi>Don Juan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf ſo obligingly, that we had the ſucceſs we deſir'd; and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Manchini</hi> found it out of his power, to prevail with his Holineſs, to come to any reſolution to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of my Siſter. On the contrary, the Pope declar'd, that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> having fled for refuge into his Eſtate,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48334:38"/>
it could not be agreable to Civility or Juſtice, to give her trouble; ſo that ſhe ſtay'd at the houſe I laſt mentioned, where ſhe was ſafe, and I viſited her every day.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the Conſtable and I went into the Country for ſome days, and at our return perſwaded my Siſter to take a Lodging at our Houſe, but we had in a ſhort time a little quarrel, and ſhe would ſtay no longer. The beginning of Spring, the Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> (whom the King had baniſh'd, as was reported, for ill Language given Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> about an Abby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, but could not obtain) after ſome ſtay at <hi>Genes,</hi> had the curioſity to ſee <hi>Rome,</hi> where he arriv'd accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd by Count <hi>Marſan,</hi> his Brother, a Gentleman of excellent parts, and pleaſant converſations, with two other Friends, the one named <hi>Garcey,</hi> the other <hi>Moreli</hi>; the former diſcreet, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and faithful; the other dextrous, and of a quick and clear apprehenſion, but a little too ſubtle: Subtlety, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, is a neceſſary quality, but a fault if exceſſive: A Gentleman is to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48334:39"/>
make uſe of it, not as a Weapon to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, but as a remedy, cure, or arms of defence, to ſave himſelf from harm. The Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain</hi> was much taken with <hi>Rome,</hi> but that which did the rather oblige him to ſpend his two years exile there, was the concourſe of Perſons of the higheſt quality who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented our Houſe, which ſeem'd to be the Center of all the divertiſments of the Town, where I may ſay without hyperbole, that Plays, Diſcourſes, Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Muſick, Treats, Collations, Feaſts, and all divertiſements imaginable, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one another in ſuch a manner, as inſtead of cloying our taſte of the pleaſure of them, heightned it by the variety. The Chevalier in his firſt viſits endeavour'd ſtrongly to gain an intereſt in Madam <hi>Mazarins</hi> affections, but not meeting with the ſucceſs he deſir'd, he had not the patience to wait longer for it, but all on the ſudden broke off his amorous Addreſſes. In a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I deſign'd to entertain the Queen of <hi>Sueden</hi> at a Conſort of Muſick, and at the ſame time to take a little recreation, as neceſſary for my ſelf, whoſe Element
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48334:39"/>
was Action; and my greateſt delight to ſet others at work. My Siſter and Brother were pretty good Friends then, and though I knew both cold enough towards me, I was ſo far from reſenting it in the leaſt, that I told them, with all ſincerity (my humour being unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſſimulation) I was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the care they both took to avoid ſeeing me: The matter reſted not there, but my Muſick applauded by every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, was ſo jeer'd by my Brother, that he told me, the Voices and the Airs were the pityfulleſt in the World, and the Symphony worſe: My Siſter, though ſhe ſaid not a word, confirm'd by her looks the cenſure he had paſt. This anger'd me ſo, that I fell out with them both, being unwilling to be made their ſport, and their laughing-ſtock, or to allow my Brother the ſatisfaction of the pleaſure he took in provoking me by his croſſneſs and contradictions. Things being at this paſs, they plotted privately to go together into <hi>France,</hi> and never let me know it till three days before they ſet out, which they did without bidding me adieu: The greater
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48334:40"/>
love we have for any perſon, the more we reſent an injury done by him. I was both ſurpriz'd and griev'd at their abſence, and willing to know the cauſe of it, I received a Letter from each of them, wherein they told me with very good words, that they had great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>France</hi> which call'd them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that my ill humour made them haſten their Journey, yet they would come back again without fail, if I deſir'd to ſee them, for which Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> gave me her word. To ſatisfie my curoſity I expected their return, without giving my ſelf the diſpleaſure of reading out their kind thoughts of me.</p>
            <p>Soon after my Brothers arrival at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> he marry'd a Kinſwoman of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Monteſpagne,</hi> call'd Mademoiſelle <hi>de Siange</hi>; whoſe beauty, aſſiſted with the Kings perſwaſions, brought him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Yoke he never expreſt any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for: Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf ſafe at <hi>Nevers</hi> where ſhe ſtaid, and fearing the Duke her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might make uſe of his right, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſomething againſt her liberty, ſhe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48334:40"/>
went to the <hi>Abby-Royal</hi> within ten Leagues of <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe continued till the King ſent for her, to know what ſhe deſir'd; having at her arrival an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd his Majeſty, ſhe deſir'd only a Penſion to live handſomely in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhe obtain'd it without difficulty: The Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain</hi> in her abſence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied us to ſome houſes of Pleaſure of the Conſtables, where we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went a hunting: Having ſpent ſome time in thoſe Country ſports, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Walks, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and ſumptuous Treats given us, ſometimes in the Vineyards of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> ſometimes at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto,</hi> and ſometimes in other places, contributed not a little to our pleaſure; to continue which we reſolv'd to treat one another by turns every <hi>Sunday,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> Prince <hi>Savelli,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> the Dukes <hi>Sforza,</hi> and <hi>Baſanello,</hi> who was the Conſtables Couſin, being of the company, ſo that we paſt the Carnaval with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than uſual, <hi>Pippa Acciaioli</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtain'd leave of the Pope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an <hi>Opera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48334:41"/>About the end of the <hi>Spring,</hi> Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> performed her promiſe, and I had the pleaſure to ſee her again after nine Months abſence, more beautiful than ever. But this ſatisfaction had like to have coſt me dear, for having taken Phyſick that day, I got ſo ſtrange a Collick by going abroad the day I had been purged, that had it laſted a little longer, it had certainly made an end of me. I was ſo ill the moſt ſtony heart would have pitied me, yet the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was not in the leaſt mov'd at it, at leaſt in appearance, having with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful tranquility, and unconcern'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, heard me groan frightfully a whole Night: My Siſter appear'd as little concern'd as the Conſtable, while his Brother and all thoſe about me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt their ſorrow for my pain, they only excepted who were my neareſt Relations, who never troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for what ſhould become of me. However the violence of my Diſeaſe yielded at laſt to the ſtrength of the Remedies us'd, which effectually cur'd me: Then it was the Chevalier <hi>de Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> preſented me from <hi>Monſieur</hi> a full
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48334:41"/>
hunting Equipage, of the value of a thouſand Piſtols, garniſh'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deal of Ribbands, the fineſt and richeſt in <hi>Paris,</hi> which his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had ſent him to preſent me with: Having been pleas'd to accept of a Preſent I had made his Highneſs of Gloves and other Toys not worth the ſpeaking of: The Chevalier procur'd me this Preſent, who had not done him any ſervice, nor lent him any thing as was falſly reported, it being certain he never wanted Money, and was extreamly diſpleas'd with me for going about to borrow ſome to pay him my looſings at play.</p>
            <p>The following Summer intending to take the pleaſure of bathing, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and I, went to <hi>Sebaron,</hi> a paſſage very dangerous, through the rapidity of the ſtream, where the violence of the Water car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd me with ſuch force, I had been certainly drown'd, had I not been help'd by a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Maid-ſervant, that Monſieur <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> General of the Popes Galleys in <hi>Candy</hi> had beſtowed on me. She was more ſtrong than big, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48334:42"/>
with my Brothers aſſiſtance drew me out of the danger I was in. This made us chuſe a place of more ſafety in the <hi>Tyber,</hi> near which we cauſed a Cabbin to be made to undreſs us in, from whence we had a Gallery that reach'd juſt to the bathing place, all made up of Canes, Leaves and Boughs, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable art. The Autumn we ſpent in the Country, and the Carnaval in ſeeing <hi>Operas,</hi> as we us'd to do, though not with equal pleaſure; the Conſtable of a long tme not having the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, tenderneſs, and eſteem for me as formerly; he ſeldom ſpoke to me, and when he did, it was in ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, I could have wiſh'd rather he had not ſpoken at all to me. The Count <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> his Brother, formerly known by the name of the Abbot <hi>Colonna,</hi> who had ſeveral times compos'd our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and by his prudence hinder'd them from breaking out, is a witneſs of my ſufferings. Not able to endure any longer ſuch ſenſible diſpleaſures and injuries, I apply'd my thoughts to find out a remedy. My Siſter and I in the time of our bathings and walks, had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48334:42"/>
contracted a ſtricter amity than ever. I reſolv'd to take the advantage of the tenderneſs ſhe had profeſt for me, and earneſtly pray'd her not to return into <hi>France</hi> without taking me with her. She faithfully promis'd it, having firſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me the inconveniences ſhe lay under, and I was to expect, if I took the courſe ſhe had done. Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more true than that, ſhe was ſo far from inclining me that way, that ſhe did all ſhe could to make me ſenſible of the ill conſequences of an undertaking of that nature, as ſhe hath written in her Memoires.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, the Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain</hi> was call'd home from <hi>Exile</hi>; his Friends were not a little pleas'd at the ſurprize he put them to at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Court, ſo much ſooner than they expected. The mean while as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables freaks and ſlights increas'd every day, ſo did my trouble and vexation: My Brother the better to perſwade me to conceal my reſentment, told me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he fear'd I ſhould not long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my liberty, adding once in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s preſence, that when
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48334:43"/>
I leaſt expected it, I ſhould be clapt up in the <hi>Palliano,</hi> a Caſtle of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſtanding on the Confines of the Eſtate of the Church and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> Theſe reaſons added to my natural averſeneſs againſt the cuſtoms of <hi>Italy,</hi> where diſſimulation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between Families are more in vogue than any where elſe, haſten'd my putting in execution the deſign I had of retiring into <hi>France,</hi> the place of my Education, the reſidence of moſt of my Relations, and the Center of my Genius, having a particular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for their free and gay humour, ſtill affecting novelty, and for the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Air and gallant Deportment of the brave Men there; and being quite weary of living at eaſe in a quiet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and under a peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We left <hi>Rome</hi> the twenty ninth of <hi>May,</hi> with a very ſlender Equipage, all I had about me being ſeven hundred Piſtols, my Pearls, and ſome Roſes of Diamonds, Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> having loſt all her baggage by leaving it at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Conſtable went to ſee a breed of Mares he had at one of his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48334:43"/>
Country Houſes, called <hi>Trattocchie.</hi> As we ſtept into the Coach, we told the Coachman aloud, he ſhould drive us to <hi>Traſcati,</hi> which we did to deceive a company of our people who ſtood at the Gate of the Palace <hi>Mazarin.</hi> At the firſt turning, a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> of my Siſters, a <hi>German</hi> born, call'd <hi>Pelletier,</hi> bid the Coachman drive ſtreight for <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> where a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> waited our coming. The Coachman was threatned if he did not make haſte, and obeyed his orders ſo well, that by night we got within ſight of <hi>Civita Vecchia. Pelletier</hi> had agreed with the Marriners they ſhould take us aboard five Miles from the Town, leſt we ſhould be diſcover'd at the Port: we ſent them news of our coming, the rather for that a Lacquey we had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd before to that purpoſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with extreme impatience, was not return'd. Notwithſtanding our cares and fears of being taken, Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> and I ventur'd into a thick Wood near the Sea, and ſlept there two hours ſo quietly and ſoundly, that a Maid of my Siſters, and <hi>Morena</hi> one
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48334:44"/>
of mine, who ſerv'd for a guard for us, were aſtoniſh'd to ſee it: When we awak'd, we diſcern'd my Siſters <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> coming afar of, who told us, he could diſcover nothing of the <hi>Feluca,</hi> and that the Lacquey took his reſt at an Inn, to ſweat out the Wine he had drunk, ſo that we were upon the point of returning to the Coach, and reſolving to go forward by ſome by-way, for fear of being met with on the Road, but the Horſes being tyr'd, my Siſter ſaid it was better ſend them back with the Coach to an Inn near <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> and give the Coachman order to ſay, if any came in ſearch of us, that he had ſeen us go aboard, which he promis'd to do for a little Preſent that was made him. We got the while into the bottom of a Wood near the High-way, having ſent <hi>Pelletier</hi> in ſearch of the <hi>Feluca,</hi> with order to hire ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if he could not diſcover the firſt. He promis'd to do it whatever came of it. The extreme heat of the Sun hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcalded my Head five hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a forc'd faſt of twenty four hours, and the trouble I was in for having no
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48334:44"/>
news of the <hi>Feluca,</hi> made me abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpair, and tell my Siſter I would go back again, and that I were as good dye of any other death as of hunger. My Siſter, who is the beſt humour'd and patient'dſt Lady of the World, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd me a little with her diſcourſe; adding, that if within half an hour we ſhould not receive ſome good news, we might go back again. I reſolv'd to wait the time ſhe had ſet, and within a quarter of an hour, we heard the noiſe of a Horſe gallopping towards us, which, with the trouble I was under, and the fear I had we ſhould be preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Horſeman, made me abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſpond. My Siſter arm'd with a pair of Piſtols, and reſolv'd to kill the firſt that came up to her, advancing before us, ſaw it was our Poſtillion who had been in ſearch of the <hi>Feluca,</hi> without acquainting us with his intentions: Thus my fears vaniſh'd, and my ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was turn'd into joy, upon the Boys telling us our <hi>Feluca</hi> waited for us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five Miles of the place we were in. Hereupon, having fill'd our Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which were neither great nor heavy,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48334:45"/>
we ſet forward in the heat of the day, through a Plain where we could ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Locuſts. Indeſatigable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was got ſo far before me, that to follow her the better, I was forc'd to reſt me ſeveral times; and at length hunger, thirſt, wearineſs, and heat had reduc'd me to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I was compell'd to pray a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer I ſpy'd there, to carry me about a hundred Paces towards the Sea, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I had loſt my company a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my Siſter and I having chang'd habits in the Coach. The Country Fellow made ſome difficulty at firſt, but perſwaded at length, by ſome Piſtols I added to my requeſt, he carry'd me in his Arms to the place where my Siſter was: Much about the ſame time <hi>Pelletier</hi> arriv'd, who told us he had hir'd another <hi>Feluca</hi> at a thouſand Crowns, but that in truth he did not like the Faces of the Maſter or Marriners, who all look'd like Raſcals; we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that fortune had favour'd us with news, by the Poſtillion, of the firſt <hi>Feluca,</hi> and that he was gone to meet her: <hi>Pelletier</hi> was no leſs joyful than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48334:45"/>
we at ſo happy an adventure. At laſt, partly a foot, and partly in the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Arms, I got to the Sea-ſide, where our Maids arriv'd preſently after us; but no <hi>Feluca</hi> appear'd, and I finding all our hopes fruſtrated, remain'd ſad and diſconſolate. My Siſter, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concern'd, conceal'd her trouble, that ſhe might not increaſe mine: In this miſerable condition we laid us down on a little Straw we found in a Cabbin, and ſent <hi>Pelletier</hi> the ſecond time in ſearch of a Barque, the while I pray'd the Labourer to go fetch me a little Water: In a quarter of an hour <hi>Pelletier</hi> return'd, who with a ſad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and troubl'd Voice told us, we were undone, and that we were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd: I was ſo weary, that the news made no impreſſion upon me, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of what he ſaid; my Siſter preſſing him to tell truth, and finding by his manner of expreſſing himſelf he ſpoke not in earneſt, ſhe angrily bid him tell her ſeriouſly how things were; he anſwer'd, what he had ſaid was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to frighten us. My Siſter chid him, ſaying, 'twas no time to jeaſt. We
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48334:46"/>
went thence to the Barque, and with that which was firſt hired found the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the Maſter and Seamen would have perſwaded us to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. But <hi>Pelletier</hi> having given me a more favourable account of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I ſtepped in without regarding the other, my Siſter and our Maids hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done the like. The other Marriners began to threaten us, and hinder our putting out to Sea, ſo that we were oblig'd to buy our peace of them, and get out of their danger. I was ſcarce out at Sea but I felt the effects of it, yet was more ſenſible of the new propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our Maſter made us of more Money for our paſſage than he had agreed for with our Valet: He grounded his demand on the danger he expos'd himſelf to for ſerving us. <hi>Pelletier</hi> (who wanted not Stomach) was inrag'd to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deceiv'd in the good Opinion he had had of our Maſter, who, contrary to promiſe, demanded more than was due, and in great wrath would have made him ſtand to his Bargain. But the Maſter had the power on his ſide, and to his Reaſons good or bad added
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48334:46"/>
threats to throw us over-Board, or ſet us a-ſhore in ſome deſart Iſland, ſo that I commanded <hi>Pelletier</hi> to be quiet, and with one hundred Piſtols, addition to the Rate firſt bargain'd, ſilenc'd the Maſter, aſſuring of further recompence at his landing us in <hi>France,</hi> which he promis'd to do.</p>
            <p>We had the Wind very favourable for the firſt ſix hours, after which we were ſo becalm'd, we made no ſail at all. About Evening we diſcovor'd a Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and the Maſter fearing it might be a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſel, we drew near ſome Rocks on the Coaſt of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where he ſhew'd us a place where we might diſembark and be in ſafety, in caſe he ſhould be forc'd to fight. Coaſting near the Rocks, he at laſt knew the Veſſel, and having ask'd whence ſhe came, and finding her a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> we continued our Voyage to <hi>Monace:</hi> where the Calm being on the ſudden turn'd into a Storm, my Siſter grew very Sea-ſick, the Tempeſt being ſo great that we were in great danger of Shipwrack.</p>
            <p>The Plague was in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> where we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48334:47"/>
took Shipping; and having not had the opportunity or liberty to diſembark for want of a Certificate (that we came from a place uninfected) till we got to <hi>Monaco,</hi> we obtain'd a falſe one there, with the help of ſome Piſtols given for that purpoſe. Our Maſter unwilling to land us at <hi>Marſellis,</hi> by reaſon of ſome difference he ſaid he had with ſome of the Town, it prov'd lucky for us by preventing our falling in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Felucas</hi> and <hi>Gallies</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable had ſent in purſuit of us, which could not have miſs'd of us, had not our Maſter ſteer'd his courſe to avoid <hi>Marſellis.</hi> After nine days ſailing, we arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Ciutat,</hi> where having reſted four hours, we mounted Horſes we had hir'd for our Journey; and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all night, arriv'd betimes at <hi>Marſellis.</hi> I enquir'd there for Monſieur <hi>Arnous,</hi> Maſter of the Gallies, hoping he had a Paſs for me, having deſir'd it of his Majeſty before we left <hi>Rome</hi>; being told he was very ſick, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to give him a viſit; and having told him who I was, and that I was ſorry to find him in the condition
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48334:47"/>
he was in, I ask'd him if he had not ſomething from the King to give me. He could ſcarce anſwer me, for an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex he was fallen into, but gave me a Pacquet ſeal'd, wherein was a Paſſe, with a Letter from his Majeſty, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Monſieur <hi>de Pompone,</hi> for Monſieur <hi>Grignan</hi> the Kings Lieutenant in <hi>Provence,</hi> who had a particular charge to receive me at <hi>Aix,</hi> and aſſiſt me with his Authority, and any thing elſe in his Power. At our return from Monſieur <hi>Arnous</hi>'s, we went to Bed, but had ſcarce reſted an hour, but they awak'd me, to let me know Captain <hi>Manchini</hi> deſir'd to ſpeak with me from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. All my People trembled at the news; and to prevent further incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, I gave Monſieur <hi>Arnous</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of it. He preſently ſent me a Guard, and pray'd me very earneſtly to take a Lodging in his Houſe, where I might be ſafer than in any other place. I did ſo, having firſt given <hi>Manchini</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, who had no propoſal to make me, but to return to the Conſtable, or ſtay there at leaſt till he could ſend me a Train more ſuitable to my Quality,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48334:48"/>
and ſuch things as were neceſſary for my continuing my Journey with more decency and ſplendour. He forgot not to mind me of my Children, judging the tenderneſs I had for them, might perhaps prevail with me to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution he endeavour'd to perſwade me to: But though I lov'd my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren infinitely, I fear'd more my own danger, and making no doubt but all his good words were only a Cloak for ſome ill deſign, I told him I was reſolv'd not to return: With that I ſtept into the Coach Monſieur <hi>Arnous</hi> had ſent me, with a Gentleman in it, and went to his Houſe, where we were ſo well receiv'd, entertain'd, and lodg'd, that in a ſhort time we were quite recover'd of our Voyage. The day after, news was brought me from Monſieur <hi>Grig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> (to whom I had ſent Monſieur <hi>de Pompones</hi> Letter) that he had ſent a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman with ſix of his Guards to attend me, with order to furniſh me with whatever I wanted: I accepted the Gentlemans offer, and having eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> and I went with him into the Coach, and arriv'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48334:48"/>
in the Evening at <hi>Aix,</hi> in company with Monſieur <hi>Grignon,</hi> who came to meet us a League out of Town with his Coach, where he deſir'd us to ſtep in, telling us he was much troubled he could not lodge us in the Governors Palace, who then was the Duke <hi>de Vendoſm</hi> my Nephew, the Son of the Duke <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> and my elder Siſter <hi>Victoria de Manchini.</hi> Having thank'd him for his care of us, we pray'd him not to give himſelf further trouble for our Lodging, having given our words to a Gentleman of my Brothers, call'd <hi>Mories,</hi> that we would lodge in his Houſe, or at Monſieur <hi>Caſteletts</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, his elder Brother; as we did, and were treated there magnificently fifteen days.</p>
            <p>My Siſter could not go to <hi>Paris,</hi> by reaſon of an Arreſt of Parliament ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd againſt her by her Husband, which made me diſpatch <hi>Pellitier</hi> with a Lettter to the King, wherein I pray'd him to let me know what Houſe he pleas'd I ſhould live in at <hi>Paris</hi>; and that my Siſter might be permitted to come to Court, without fearing the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48334:49"/>
purſuit of her Husband; I propos'd the Palace <hi>Mazarin,</hi> where my Siſter deſir'd to lodge with me: <hi>Pelletiers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was delay'd by an ill accident he met with by the way, having been robb'd, and in danger of his Life, to my very great trouble. This ill accident was attended with a piece of bad news, which gave me new diſpleaſure, in the aſſurance I had, that Monſieur St. <hi>Simon,</hi> who had been at <hi>Aix,</hi> and made me the ſame Propoſals as <hi>Manchini</hi> had done, was at <hi>Paris</hi>; where he ſolicited for the Conſtable, and being a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi>'s the Popes Nephew, he did all he could againſt me, and, the better to ſerve his turn, made uſe of the Popes Authority. To prevent the Storm that threatn'd me, I would have been gone without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Pelletiers</hi> return, or regarding my Siſters objections, with whom I went to <hi>Mirabeau,</hi> where the Gentleman, who was Lord of the place, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us with ſix of the Guards of my Nephew the Duke of <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> of whoſe Company this Gentleman was Captain, and treated us very handſomly.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48334:49"/>
In this Village Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me reſolv'd to go forward, pray'd me to ſtay a while for <hi>Pelletiers</hi> coming, which, for fear of putting her out of humour, I conſented to. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtaid ſix days to no purpoſe, I told her I would be gone without farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and get near <hi>Paris,</hi> where I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood they endeavour'd to hinder my entrance. The Chevalier <hi>de Mirabeau</hi> ſeeing me reſolv'd to go, accompanied us with the Guards as far as <hi>Pont St. Eſprit,</hi> where we heard that <hi>Polaſtron,</hi> Captain of Duke <hi>Mazarins</hi> Guards, was paſs'd by <hi>Aix</hi> in ſearch of us. This news oblig'd us to quit the Road, and retire into a Country-houſe. My Siſter the ſame night purſu'd her Journey by the way of <hi>Savoy,</hi> accompany'd with the Chevalier <hi>d' Anne</hi> and one half of the Guards, the other half remaining with me. I continued much afflicted at the ſeparation from my Siſter, and upon her word ſhe would ſtay at <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breri</hi> (whither ſhe was then bound for) till the King would permit her to live in <hi>France,</hi> I promis'd her not to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Grenoble,</hi> that I might be near
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48334:50"/>
her, and hear how ſhe did. I came to that City, and having continued three days in an Inn on the other ſide the Water, not one knowing who I was, a Gentleman arriv'd, ſent by the Queen, to whom his Majeſty had left the Government of the Kingdom, while he went in Perſon to command his Army againſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi>: The Gentleman brought me a Letter from her Majeſty, wherein ſhe commanded me in very obliging Terms, not to come beyond the place where this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould find me; adding, ſhe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but it was the Kings Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſhould be ſo. I anſwer'd, mine was ſo too, and to obey her orders with abſolute ſubmiſſion. The Duke <hi>d'Eſdignieres,</hi> Governour of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, had received like orders, and gave me a Viſit, and invited me to take a Lodging at his Houſe, or at the <hi>Arſenal.</hi> Being loath to give him trouble, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of a Lodging at the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where <hi>Polaſtron</hi> (whom I believ'd come in purſuit of my Siſter) came to ſee me, and, to the Complements he made me on the the behalf of the Duke
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48334:50"/>
his Maſter, added the offer of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and all that depended on him; proteſting he had order to make the like offer to the Ducheſs his Miſtreſs. Upon this aſſurance, and the word of the Governour, I gave my Siſter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by an Expreſs, deſiring her to come to me: But having gone a great way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by <hi>Turin</hi> and the Mountains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chamberri,</hi> it was a Month ere ſhe got thither; ſo that my Courrier was there before her. As ſoon as ſhe received the Letter, ſhe made ready for her Journey, and I to receive her: At our Enterview ſhe gave me an account of the fatigues of her Journey, but thought them well endured to obtain the Honour done her by his Royal Highneſs of <hi>Savoy. Polaſtron</hi> ſpoke with her, but his Propoſals proving ineffectual, he return'd for <hi>Paris,</hi> and we for <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi> where we were till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the King return'd from the Campagne, and <hi>Pelletier</hi> came to us (having miraculouſly eſcap'd the danger I ſpoke of) with a Letter from his Majeſty, wherein he advis'd me to retire into a Covent, to ſtop the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48334:51"/>
mouths of thoſe who made ill conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my quitting <hi>Rome</hi>; to which he added as to Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> that the Conditions of ſeparation from her Husband were well known to her, and the ſame as formerly.</p>
            <p>I was ſo far from being ſatisfy'd with this Letter, that I reſolv'd to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Paris,</hi> and throw my ſelf at his Majeſties Feet. I acquainted my Siſter with my deſign; ſhe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Complaiſance anſwer'd, I was to conſider only my own intereſt in the caſe, without regarding her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in it, being very willing to return to <hi>Chamberri.</hi> We went from <hi>Grenoble</hi> in a Litter without ſaying any thing of our intended Journey, for fear of being ſtaid by the Governour; We went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as far as <hi>Lyons,</hi> and there parted, my Siſter for <hi>Chamberri,</hi> and I for <hi>Paris,</hi> with a Courrier belonging to the Kings Cabinet, call'd <hi>Marguein,</hi> whom I had known at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Man honeſt, faithful and witty. I engag'd him to come with me, and intruſted him with the management and care of all the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my Journey, wherein he ſo
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48334:51"/>
well acquitted himſelf, that he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced what Money was neceſſary: I went poſt in a Caleche, <hi>Morena</hi> and he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me on Horſeback. A Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney beyond <hi>Lyons</hi> I embarqued, in hopes to paſs by Water with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and eaſe; but the Water was ſo low, and the paſſage ſo diſagreed with the impatience I was under of getting quickly to <hi>Paris,</hi> that I went a-ſhore the firſt Town we came to. But not finding there any Poſt-horſes, I was forc'd to make uſe of ſuch as we could borrow in the Neighbourhood of the Carriers; but not one of them would draw in a Caleche without leading, which troubled me extremely, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the fate that attended me, who could not rid way by Poſt or by Water, ſome Obſtacle happening always in the way to ſtop the deſign'd ſwiftneſs of my courſe. At laſt we came to <hi>Nevers,</hi> where I learnt, undiſcover'd, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Wife were at St. <hi>Elay,</hi> three Leagues from thence, getting Poſt thither; I met with another trouble I had not foreſeen, but very luckily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcap'd. When I askt for Poſt-Horſes,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48334:52"/>
they denied me any, telling me they durſt not without firſt giving notice to a Gentleman, who had forbidden them hiring out any Poſt-horſes without order from him, I was afraid he had given the like order in all the Poſt-Towns on my Road, and having heard at <hi>Lyons</hi> the King had diſpatch'd a Gentleman from Court, I preſently apprehended it might be to meet me, or rather to ſtay my coming to <hi>Paris.</hi> To defeat all their preventions, I told <hi>Marguein</hi> he muſt by any means get me ſome Poſt-horſes; he did it ſo dextrouſly, that they furniſh'd us with as many as we needed for our Journey; while Monſieur <hi>de la Gibertrere</hi> (the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I mention'd) watch'd my coming on a Bridge, where he thought I muſt paſs, having heard I had taken Water at <hi>Roane,</hi> and never dreaming my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience had made me diſembark to travel by Land.</p>
            <p>While my Caleche (which wearied me more than the Poſt-Horſes) ran all on the Nayl by the Road, and I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by travelling all night to repair my loſs of time in my Voyage on the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48334:52"/>
River, and thought my ſelf paſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, my Caleche having twice over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd without hurting me, yet the ill Fate inſeparably attending my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, to compleat my misfortunes, as I arriv'd about noon at <hi>Montargis,</hi> afflicted <hi>Morena</hi> with a grievous Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and more to my vexation than his, fill'd <hi>Margueins</hi> head with fancies of ſtrange conſiderations and cares, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd himſelf obliged to have, of thoſe inconveniences his politicks ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted might fall upon him and me, and my Family, upon my arrival at <hi>Paris</hi> againſt the Kings order: Adding that <hi>Morena</hi> being ſick, and not able to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, he thought it our beſt courſe to ſtay where we were. Tyr'd and ſleepy as I was I ſubmitted to his Reaſons, which would not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with me on another occaſion. Having yielded as much to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of refreſhing my ſelf, as to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, I agreed, that while he went to <hi>Paris</hi> to carry a Letter to the King, and another to Monſieur <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> I would take the way of <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> whither I travell'd, taking <hi>Morena</hi> with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48334:53"/>
me in my Caleche: <hi>Marguein</hi> went his way, having ſubſtituted, to ſupply his Room with us, a Man of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whom he furniſh'd with Money to defray our Charges by the way: This man was very faithful and honeſt, but withall very troubleſom; and not knowing me, judg'd of me by my Train, and took me to be a perſon as inconſiderable as my Equipage was poor. At every Stage he quarrel'd with the Poſtillion, who was unwilling to carry any more than one Perſon in a Caleche for fear of tyring his Horſes. After all their brangling and noiſe we arriv'd at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> about ſeven in the Evening, that being the only place Monſieur <hi>Gibertiere</hi> could have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to overtake me in, having reſted my ſelf at <hi>Montargis.</hi> I have been ſince told he would have puniſh'd the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter for furniſhing me with Horſes, but at laſt he pardon'd him, partly out of Clemency, as a quality becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gentleman, and partly not to loſe time, ſeeing himſelf oblig'd to make haſte after me, who made ſuch haſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Having left <hi>Nevers</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:48334:53"/>
he arriv'd at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> two hours after us, and forbid any there ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me with Horſes. About nine in the Morning I heard of his arrival, by the news he ſent me he had buſineſs to ſpeak with me; I ſent him word he might come when he pleas'd. Having deliver'd me a Letter of Credence from his Majeſty, he endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to return to the Conſtable; as the beſt courſe I could take: things being not for my advantage in <hi>France,</hi> where the King was inform'd I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd much upon his favour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to govern him as I pleas'd. He added, that his Majeſty was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled he had granted me his protection upon frivolous and Chimerical Pretences of mine, and for Reaſons which had no other ground but my humour and caprice. He concluded in caſe I would return home, I had no more to do but take the way of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and go into the Abby of <hi>Montfleuri.</hi> He had the Heads of his Embaſſy written under the Letter, and my anſwer was, that I had not left my Houſe to return thither ſo ſoon, that what I had done
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48334:54"/>
was not upon imaginary pretences, but for good and ſolid reaſons, which I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would, nor could declare to any but the King; that all I deſir'd was to ſpeak with him, in confidence, that having obtained audience of him, I ſhould find him ſo wiſe and ſo juſt, that he would permit himſelf to be diſabus'd, and lay aſide thoſe ill impreſſions they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd ſo induſtriouſly to give him of my conduct. That I was very far from flattering my ſelf with the vanity of the preſumptuous power he had mentioned, that I had neither Merit, nor Quality, nor Parts to pretend to a ſhare in the management of his Affairs; that I deſir'd leave to retire to <hi>Paris,</hi> and limit my ambition to the ſtraitneſs of a Cloiſter, where I begg'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Permiſſion to live among my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as the great Dutcheſs of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>de Chalais,</hi> and many more Ladies who were Widows, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from their Husbands, had been allow'd to do. As to my returning to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> I was too weary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begin another Journey; and further, that I waited his Majeſties anſwer,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48334:54"/>
by which I would govern my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe were my laſt words to him, which having ſpoken, I preſently fell a playing on my Guittarre. He took his leave of me, and a while after, by a Letter from <hi>Marguein,</hi> I had news the Duke <hi>de Crequi</hi> was coming to ſee me from the King, with orders to anſwer my Propoſals: He arriv'd, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guein</hi> alſo almoſt together: I pray'd the Duke to come in, who ſeeing me a-Bed in an ordinary Room in an Inn, and conſidering the poverty of my Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, compar'd with the Grandeur and Pomp he had ſeen me in at <hi>Rome,</hi> he told me he was no leſs aſtoniſht than ſorry to ſee ſuch a change, ſupplying with his diſcourſe and commiſeration my inſenſibility of the illneſs of my Fortune; but finding him enlarge too much on that ſubject, I pray'd him to paſs on to what he had to communicate to me of greater importance. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd very clearly, the King was not willing I ſhould either enter <hi>Paris,</hi> or ſpeak with him, having given the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio and the Conſtable his Royal word he would grant me neither, for reaſons I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48334:55"/>
could not be ignorant of; that my beſt courſe was to return for <hi>Grenoble,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I would rather chuſe to go home, which would certainly be ſafeſt and moſt honourable for me.</p>
            <p>Mov'd, more than can be imagin'd, at a declaration of this nature, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, the King might well refuſe me the Honour of ſeeing him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me entrance into <hi>Paris,</hi> but it would not appear very handſome to oblige me to return for <hi>Grenoble</hi> in the condition I was in, no leſs tyr'd with the heat than with haſte of my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: That it was a ſtrange piece of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity in a King to deprive me of the Honour of his Royal preſence, but ſince there was ſuch neceſſity of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, I beg'd his Majeſty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to enter into <hi>L'ys</hi> Abby. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Crequi</hi> pray'd me to write a Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to the King for that purpoſe; and having return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> with the Billet, he ſent, the day following, a Page who brought me the leave I deſir'd, with order to the Abbeſs to receive me, and to Monſieur <hi>Gibertiere</hi> to accompany me thither. Much about the ſame time
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48334:55"/>
arriv'd a Gentleman from Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> with two Purſes of five hundred Piſtols a piece, which his Majeſty had order'd ſhould be ſent me; being the ſum it pleas'd his Royal Grandeur to oblige me with every ſix Months while I continued under his protection. I went immediately to <hi>L'ys,</hi> where the Abbeſs received me with great expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Eſteem and Affection. Soon after my Siſters came to ſee me, and brought me many conſiderable Preſents. I cannot expreſs the joy I had to ſee them, whoſe Civilities and Careſſes to me, for three or four days they were to ſee me, were no ſmall comfort to me in my afflictions. The Counteſs of <hi>Soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> of her natural generoſity, ſent me a very rich Bed with Tapiſtry and other Furniture of value; and in a word all ſhe thought I ſtood in need of. The Count of <hi>Soiſons</hi> her Husband who not long after dy'd, by an accident in the Army, not without ſuſpicion of Poiſon, and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd leave of the King, came to ſee me, none daring to viſit me without permiſſion from his Majeſty: I liv'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48334:56"/>
very quietly in this Monaſtery, the kindneſs of the Nuns being ſuch, I have not words to expreſs the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and tenderneſs they us'd me with, by the example of the Abbeſs. But Fortune, who never permitted me to enjoy long any happy Eſtate, made uſe of my ſelf as the ſureſt Inſtrument to deprive me of this, and to diſturb my repoſe, brought me into great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with the King, by means of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I writ to Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the ſmall Courteſie I found at his Majeſties hands; concluding, that ſince he denyed me leave to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> he would permit me to go where elſe I pleas'd. His Majeſty was very ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at this Letter, which my Enemies laid hold of to incenſe him the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, acquainting him I was too near <hi>Paris,</hi> and that I might come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a moment. This made him order Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> to tell me from him, I had no more to do, but chuſe a Covent threeſcore Leagues diſtant from Court, and that having written him ſuch a Letter I deſerv'd not his protection. By this anſwer I ſaw my
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48334:56"/>
fault, and ſorry, though too late, for my raſhneſs, I writ to Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> that in truth I had done ill to write the Letter I had ſent him, but that he had not done better in ſhewing it the King. And that ſince he was in part, though indirectly, the cauſe of his anger againſt me, he was oblig'd to pacifie him, in telling him how ſorry I was for my folly, and to ſolicit my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: Having done what he could to ſerve me, he ſent me word the day after by Letter, that his Majeſty had pardon'd me, but perſiſted in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ſend me threeſcore Leagues from <hi>Paris:</hi> I anſwered very ſubmiſſively, I had not yet been ſuch a wanderer as to be able to make choice of a Covent at that diſtance, and therefore if there were no poſſibility of altering his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties mind, I begg'd he would be pleas'd to name a Covent, and I would obey without reply, though I could not but be troubled to go out of a Covent where I was well acquainted, and liv'd with ſome pleaſure: The Anſwer I receiv'd was four or five days after to ſee Monſieur <hi>Gibertiere</hi> coming with a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48334:57"/>
Coach, and bringing an order to the Abbeſs to let me go. I obeyed, and going out with four Maids I then had with me, (the Conſtable having at my requeſt ſent me three who had ſerv'd me at <hi>Rome</hi>) we travelled to <hi>Avenay,</hi> an Abby three miles from <hi>Rheims,</hi> where his Majeſty commanded I ſhould be, at half the diſtance firſt mentioned from <hi>Paris.</hi> The Abbeſs received me with all the honour and kindneſs I could wiſh: A month after the Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims,</hi> Brother to the Marqueſs de <hi>Louvoy,</hi> came to ſee me; he preſs'd me very much to tell him what reaſons I had given the King for my coming from <hi>Rome</hi>: I deſir'd to be excus'd: he ask'd me, ſomewhat diſpleas'd, whether I came with a deſign to prevail with the King as formerly: I reply'd, that it was a thing he could grant me the leaſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and I had the leaſt thought of.</p>
            <p>Every day I received proofs of the generoſity and goodneſs of the Abbeſs and her Nuns, who were all very civil, and ſtrove who ſhould divert me moſt for the three months I continued in that Covent: At three months end my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48334:57"/>
Brother obtained leave to bring me to <hi>Nevers</hi>; the hopes I had one day to have leave to go to <hi>Paris</hi> made me take the Journey with a great deal of pleaſure, but the ſucceſs was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; for having engag'd my ſelf to my Brother upon my word, that if he left <hi>Nevers</hi> I would go into a Covent, he told me about the weeks end he had buſineſs call'd him ſuddenly to <hi>Venice,</hi> and that he hop'd I would not fail to perform what I had promis'd him. I was very much afflicted at the news of this unexpected Journey, which diſſipated all my hopes of returning to <hi>Paris,</hi> and obliged me to quit a place where I liv'd pleaſantly enough, and depriv'd me of the company of the Ducheſs his Wife, who was one of the moſt lovely and obliging Ladies in the World, and moſt did all in her power for my comfort and eaſe. However reſolv'd (as always) to keep my word, though to my diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and diſpleaſure, I viſited all the Covents in <hi>Nevers</hi> to ſee if there were any could pleaſe me: but having been us'd to great and famous Abbies, I found not one to my mind there.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48334:58"/>
But my Brother preſſing me more and more every day (though more out of policy than for any buſineſs he had at <hi>Venice</hi>) I told him, to ſatisfie him, that the beſt expedient was for us to go to <hi>Lyons</hi> where I might have choice of Covents: He lik'd my reſolution, in hopes it would give him an opportunity to take me further, as it did. We went for <hi>Lyons,</hi> whence the Coaches of the Marqueſs <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who commanded there in his Fathers abſence, came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us two or three Leagues from the Town. Having reſted a while I went to view the Covents, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of St. <hi>Mary</hi> of the Viſitation, ſcituate on a height which overlook'd the City: I had taken up my reſidence there, had not my ill fate made the Marqueſs and my Brother diſſwade me from it, by aggravating my ſufferings, and the flight put upon me in <hi>France,</hi> to that height, that I took a reſolution to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> without acquainting them what place I would chuſe for my retirement. The Marqueſs about that time was call'd home from Exile; ſo we parted; he for <hi>Paris,</hi> we for <hi>Italy.</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48334:58"/>
I had ſcarce ſet foot in that Country but I perceived my Error, and the fault I had commtted in quitting <hi>Lyons</hi>; to retrieve this miſcarriage, I deſign'd not to paſs beyond <hi>Turin,</hi> hoping his Royal Highneſs would afford me his aſſiſtance. I diſcover'd the deſign to none but my Siſter, as I paſs'd through <hi>Chamberi,</hi> where I pray'd her to write to his Highneſs in my favor, to facilitate my putting my deſign in execution; ſhe did it readily. Having paſt the <hi>Alpes,</hi> I acquainted my Brother with my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: He was extremely aſtoniſht at it, but durſt not oppoſe it, knowing the time and place inconvenient. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Monſieur <hi>Boniel,</hi> a learned and honeſt man I had taken at <hi>Gnenoble</hi> for my Chaplain, who came to me at <hi>Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> I diſpatch'd him with a Letter I had written to his Royal Highneſs, beſeeching him to give me leave to retire into ſome Covent in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and aſſuring him his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would not diſlike of it. The next day he anſwer'd me, with much kindneſs, he would very willingly grant me his protection,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48334:59"/>
if (as I writ) the King would be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it: He ſent a Gentleman to complement me, with a Coach to bring me to <hi>Turin.</hi> My Brother took leave of me, and went on his Journey, avoiding to paſs by <hi>Turin</hi> that he might not be oblig'd to ſee his Highneſs. This Prince came to receive me a League out of Town, and made me go into his Coach, wherein were ſome Lords of his Court, and with a great Train of Nobility on Horſeback, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me to the Covent of the <hi>Viſitation,</hi> where he had commanded an Apartment to be furniſh'd for me, and diſpos'd the Abbeſs to receive me, by the interceſſion of the Archbiſhop, who was preſent at my entrance: The Nuns were kind and obliging as poſſible during my three Months abode there; about the end of which, being inform'd Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was ſuddenly for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> partly out of a deſire to ſee her, and partly to endeavour to repair the fault I committed in leaving <hi>France,</hi> I reſolv'd to go to <hi>Chamberi</hi>; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd his Royal Highneſs not to permit any Courrier to paſs for two days, for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48334:59"/>
fear of my being purſu'd. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very obligingly granted my requeſt, yet forgot not to condemn my reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and expreſs his diſpleaſure at it. Aſſur'd of his word, I ſet forward with a thouſand Piſtols the King had return'd me of his uſual bounty. <hi>Morena</hi> and my Chaplain were all the company I had: With this ſmall train I arriv'd at <hi>Chamberi</hi> more weary than ever: There to my comfort I found my ſelf fruſtrated of my hopes to ſee my Siſter; who, prevail'd upon by intereſt more than by affection, had hid her ſelf from me, for fear of being concern'd in my deſigns. I ſlept in the Caſtle ſhe dwelt in, and asking her People where ſhe was, and when ſhe would be at home, I could not obtain a ſatisfactory anſwer: At laſt not to hazard a certain enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an expectation, I reſolv'd to return to <hi>Turin,</hi> under the protection of his Royal Highneſs, with whom I had all the reaſon in the World to be ſatisfy'd, his care and bounty having been ſo great while I was at <hi>Turin,</hi> and particularly at my laſt addreſs to him, that I could not deſire more. I writ
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48334:60"/>
him a Letter to pray him ſend me a Coach to the Foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which he did with his uſual exactneſs: The Marqueſs <hi>Drone</hi> and a Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Conſtable, call'd <hi>Don Mourice de Bologna,</hi> who was come to me by the Conſtables order, came to receive me near <hi>Turin.</hi> They were no leſs glad of my return than they had been apprehenſive of my executing my former deſign, which they endeavour'd to prevent by ſending Courriers into ſeveral parts to hinder my paſſage: The ſame time the moſt Chriſtian King, at the Conſtables requeſt, ſent orders to the Governours of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and other Provinces of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not to permit me entrance. When I arriv'd at <hi>Turin,</hi> I went to the Prince of <hi>Carignan</hi>'s, where I found the Count <hi>de Oreux</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de Savoy,</hi> his Nephews and mine. And fearing he would not receive me, if I gave him notice of my coming, I took poſſeſſion (without ſaying a word to him) of an Appartment where I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above a Month, till leave was come from <hi>Rome</hi> for my returning into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48334:60"/>
and that I might go abroad once a-week, which Cardinal <hi>Porto Carrero</hi> procur'd for me. The mean time I frequented the Court, and went to a Houſe called <hi>La Venerie,</hi> about which was ſtore of all ſorts of Game and Divertiſements, ſo that I never ſpent my time with more pleaſure than there, receiving continually from his Highneſs Royal, and Madam Royal, all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expreſſions of Affection and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>My happineſs was too great to laſt long; Fortune making it her buſineſs to perſecute me, ſuggeſted to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs Reaſons of State to make me a Propoſal of returning whence I came, and to tell me it were better for me to be at my own Houſe than in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: And that if there were no other Obſtacle but the preſent diſunion from the Conſtable, he would undertake to reconcile us. I was ſo offended at this and ſome other things he ſaid to me at <hi>La Venerie,</hi> that, carry'd away by my cholerick humour, I would have gone away that moment in a pet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> and had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48334:61"/>
done it, had not Madam Royal hinder'd it, by ſtaying me with them eight days more; at the end of which they accompanied me to the Covent: Our difference increaſed by the way, through the impatience of my humour, and my unwillingneſs to pardon him any thing, which put us in a greater heat than ever. Letting go my hand, as I entred the Covent, he told me, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long ſilence, that as humourſome and pettiſh againſt him as I was, he would be ſtill ready to ſerve me: This offer, which ſhould have appeaſed me, anger'd me more than ever; ſo that I told him, haughtily enough, I made juſt as much account of his protection as I did of his perſon: This anſwer madded him, that he went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying a word more to me: My E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies look'd on this as a good occaſion to work me out of favor with him, and ſucceeded in it.</p>
            <p>About this time I endeavour'd by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters to the Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> to prevail with the King to revoke the Orders he had given to prohibit my coming into his Kingdom, but I could
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48334:61"/>
not obtain the favour: The mean time his Highneſs Royal paſt all the Summer at <hi>La Venerie,</hi> without as much as ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me one complement: At his return he came to ſee me with Madam Royal, to comfort me for the death of Count <hi>Soiſons</hi>; he performed this melancholly Complement with a great deal of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, the ſadneſs of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuiting very well with that of the occaſion. Finding my ſelf diſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of hopes from <hi>France,</hi> and leſs honour'd than formerly by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of <hi>Savoy,</hi> I laid hold on an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offer'd me by a Voyage of the Marqueſs <hi>de Bourgamanero</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> to intreat him to prevail with the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his very good Friend, to give me leave to go into <hi>France,</hi> being aſſur'd the King would not deny me that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour if the Conſtable deſir'd it. The Marqueſs return'd to <hi>Millan</hi> to ſerve me on this occaſion, and with full purpoſe to return to me as ſoon as he ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the permiſſion requiſite from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he ſaid he muſt write to obtain it, being not diſpos'd to ask it of the Duke <hi>d' Oſſuna,</hi> then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48334:62"/>
Viceroy of <hi>Millan,</hi> for fear of being deny'd by him, who had already, by his fault, loſt the Love and Eſteem this Gentleman had once had for him. While matters ſtood thus, the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flatter'd me with hopes the moſt Chriſtian King would permit me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>France,</hi> aſſuring me he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Majeſty to do it. 'Twas no hard matter to make me believe a thing I ſo much deſir'd: I was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to believe this, as knowing it for the Conſtables intereſt I ſhould leave <hi>Turin</hi>: The Marqueſs <hi>de Borgamanero,</hi> the beginning of Autumn, return'd with the permiſſion (I mention'd) grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain</hi>: But finding the Conſtable writ to me every day he had not receiv'd anſwer from <hi>France,</hi> and judging he would be better pleas'd I ſhould retire into <hi>Flanders</hi> than any other place, I reſolv'd to go thither; intending to ſet out within eight days, I ſpoke of it to the Marqueſs who highly approv'd it. About this time I received ſeveral viſits from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but not with the ſatisfaction I had formerly from
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48334:62"/>
them, being grown ſo weary of the uneavenneſs of his humour, that though he often pray'd me to communicate my reſolution he could not prevail: This did ſo anger him, that Madam Royal took notice of it; and, when I took my leave of her, ask'd me what I had done to the Duke, that he return'd ſo vex'd and out of humour from the Covent: I anſwer'd, he muſt attribute to himſelf and the inequality of his temper all I had done to him, and that if he had not given me cauſe to complain of him, I had not given him cauſe of complaint againſt me. Yet the Morning before we ſet out, the Marqueſs preſſing me very much to take my leave of that Prince, I did him that Devoir more out of civility than inclination. The Duke made ſeveral Complaints, and told me he was much diſpleaſed at the reſolution I had taken to be gone, and preſs'd me very much to let him know whither I went, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that wherever I went I ſhould not find a Prince more willing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me. I heard very attentively his complaints and his offers, and as I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48334:63"/>
took my leave of him, I thank'd him for the latter, which I could not accept, being reſolv'd to quit his Dominions. He gave me his hand and brought me to the Coach: We went for <hi>Rone</hi> in the State of <hi>Millan,</hi> with deſign to paſs thence into <hi>Switzerland</hi>; but being a days Journey from <hi>Turin,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and the Abbot <hi>Oliva</hi> who was come from <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſerve as Chaplain (being in truth a learned Man, but far ſhort of the other in Zeal and Fidelity) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſſwade me from paſſing through <hi>Millan,</hi> telling me, they were well aſſur'd ſomething would be attempted againſt my perſon, and that I was to ſave my ſelf as long as I could from ambuſhes laid for me, and that the Duke <hi>d' Oſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> would certainly order me to be ſtaid.</p>
            <p>It was a pretty while ere I would yield to their Counſels, but ſubmitting at length to their Eloquence and the ſtrength of their Reaſons, I took the Road of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> accompanied with the Marqueſs, the Abbot, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,</hi> and a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> call'd <hi>Martin,</hi> having ſent away the reſt of my people by <hi>Rone</hi>: I was ſoon convinc'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48334:63"/>
of the truth of what they ſaid, for the Duke <hi>d' Oſſuna,</hi> being inform'd of my departure from <hi>Turin</hi> by a Courrier <hi>Don Maurice</hi> had diſpatch'd, and preſt by Letters from the Conſtable to ſend me to the Caſtle of <hi>Millan,</hi> gave order I ſhould be arreſted, believing I would paſs by <hi>Rone,</hi> having ſent ſome of my People that way: My Maid <hi>Conſtance</hi> receiv'd in the Priſon there all Honour imaginable, being taken for me, till <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonago</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> ſent by the Duke to ſee me, undeceiv'd them, and at the ſame time delivered thoſe of my Train out of the pleaſanteſt Priſon ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, where for eight days they had been ſplendidly treated, and afterwards enjoyed, as an effect of that Dukes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, all ſorts of divertiſements. We came far ſhort of that pleaſure in our Journey over the Mountain St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> travelling throw Snow, and over horrible precipices: However we arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Baſſe,</hi> where we had the news of what had happened to my People at <hi>Rone,</hi> who, a few days after they were at liberty, came to us at <hi>Mayence,</hi> whence we paſt to <hi>Francfort,</hi> to go thence to <hi>Cologne,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:48334:64"/>
taking that compaſs to pleaſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and the Abbot, who were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be at the Siege of <hi>Bonne,</hi> or meet the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Troops then on their march: I had the honour to ſee the Ducheſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and to receive of her Highneſs all the demonſtrations of affection I could wiſh, during our three days ſtay at <hi>Franckfort.</hi> Having ſo long enjoy'd the ſweet converſation of that Princeſs, impatient of longer ſtay, I ſet forward on my Journey, wherein is impoſſible to comprehend, much more to expreſs, what I ſuffer'd from the ſuſpicious humour, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable flegm, and continual watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of my Fellow Travellers, who ſtill had an Eye upon me, and from the impertinence of the other. This laſted till I came to <hi>Cologne,</hi> where the former, thinking it neither ſafe nor civil to continue troubling me, alter'd his courſe; being well inform'd, the Embaſſadors of ſeveral Crowns had made me offers of their Services, and fearing perhaps the advice I received from ſome might make me alter my mind; as I had certainly done, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48334:64"/>
obſtinately bent to perſecute me, had not (by hindring me to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to what Monſieur <hi>Courtin,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Barrellon,</hi> foretold me would come to paſs, if I went into <hi>Flanders</hi>) unhappily caus'd me to ſlight their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But the Marqueſs and the Abbot, fearing the Diſcourſe and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I held with theſe Ambaſſadors, might not only obſtruct, but ruine their deſigns, made uſe of all the Credit and Eloquence they had to perſwade me for <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Marqueſs could not reſt till he ſaw me on my way; letting me know, that <hi>Don Manuel de Lyra,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Envoy, had given him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiment, which was on their march to convoy Money to the Army, and to return: He made us believe this the moſt favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity we could wiſh to guard us into the Camp of the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentar,</hi> Camp Maſter General, afterwards kill'd in the Battel of <hi>Sennef,</hi> to whom the Marqueſs <hi>Borgamanero</hi> had written, as to his intimate Friend, to receive us, and permit us to follow him till we came to <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the Regiment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48334:65"/>
for fear we ſhould meet with ſome <hi>French</hi> Troops, who committed great diſorders in theſe Countries.</p>
            <p>Before we arriv'd into the Camp of the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aſſentar,</hi> Fortune hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſign'd to uſe <hi>Borgamanero</hi> as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to perſecute me, found the means to help us out of a ſcurvy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent befallen us by the breaking of our Coach; which happening to be in a place where we had neither time nor materials to mend it, Horſes were offer'd us. And the way being very dangerous, the Weather cold, and the Night dark, being not far from the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aſſentars</hi> Camp, I accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a very fine Horſe offer'd me by the Marqueſs of <hi>Marber,</hi> Camp Maſter to the Regiment, and a Gentleman of one of the beſt Families in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Two of my Maids mounted other Horſes provided for them, and the reſt of my Train went with good Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for <hi>Holland:</hi> Four or Five Days after our arrival in the Camp, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued our Journey in a Coach of the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aſſentars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Horſe ſo good and ſo ſure was,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48334:65"/>
though indirectly, the cauſe of all my future ſufferings, and threw me head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into misfortunes I had not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. The Marqueſs <hi>de Borgamanero</hi> having from that time reſolv'd my ruine, and executed his deſigns with ſo much Art, it was not in my power to defeat: During my Journey, the Principal Officers as well <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Flemmings,</hi> expreſt for me all the care and complaiſance imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, endeavouring to divert me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at Play and ſometimes by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. As I was thus paſſing my time, with a great deal of Pleaſure, I obſerv'd the Marqueſs often out of humour, and in deep meditation: I little dreamt of what he and <hi>d' Aſſentar</hi> plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, who could not imagin the ill prepared for me, with the help of the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſufficiently poſſeſt with reports to my prejudice. We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Malines,</hi> where the Governour told me, the Count had written to him not to let me paſs further, till things were in readineſs for my being received into a Covent at <hi>Bruſſells.</hi> 'Tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48334:66"/>
to expreſs how I was aſtoniſh'd at this admirable Complement, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expcted Reception. The Marqueſs fearing I might attribute this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, made as if he had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſurpriz'd, to which he added Oaths and Proteſtations I thought ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, that I inſtantly pray'd him to go preſently to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and intreat the Count to give me leave to come into that City, and retire into the Covent of <hi>Barlemont,</hi> to recov<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

me faithfully in this affair, or at leaſt to remain neuter, and not do me harm. But the pleaſure of Revenge is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs incident to Men as well as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and more criminal in the former. The Marqueſs and Abbot did all they could to inſpire into the Count a hatred againſt me, and advis'd him to clap me up in the Cittadel of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to prevent my going to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England</hi>: So that when I was fully perſwaded th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe two Gentlemen la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd my liberty, and, to baniſh from my mind all umbrage to the contrary, I look'd on the paſſages at <hi>Malines</hi> as an illuſion of fancy, behold with <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamanero</hi> a Gentleman from the Count who told me, his Excellency being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to march the next day with the Army to meet the <hi>French</hi> Troops, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd me to ſtay at <hi>Antwerp</hi> till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: The Marqueſs to confirm the complement, or (to name it right) the order, told me with a feigned trouble, that there was a neceſſity of obeying it, but that it ſhould be for few days, and ſo long only till an anſwer might be had from the Conſtable, and leave from

the Pope for my entring a Covent: that he was extremely ſorry it had not been in his power to obtain leave from the Count for my coming to <hi>Bruſſells</hi>: that the refuſal was to be attributed to the ill informations he had received of me; adding, that time muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to take away the ill impreſſions they had made, and that he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the doing it. I did not yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt him, not doubting but he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the generoſity he pretended, but told him I was very ſenſible of his kind offers, and accepted of them. And, ſeeing there was then no other courſe to be taken, I went with the Admiral a board a fine Barque he had brought to take me in. The next day we arriv'd at <hi>Antwerp</hi> very early; they kept me ſo long aboard after our arrival, that I began to ſuſpect ſomething in hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Yet after three hours wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, news being come that the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> Governour of the place, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me in his Coach, I thought all well again, concluding, by all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was done for my honour. Having landed, I went into the Coach with
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48334:67"/>
               <hi>Borgamanero</hi> and the Governour, who carried me ſtrait away to the Cittadel, where continuing in my miſtake, and thinking my ſelf at liberty, all my care the firſt day was to recover of my wearineſs. The ſecond day I pray'd the Governour to let me have a Coach to go abroad in: <hi>Borgamanero</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht at this, told me with ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the weather was foul, and that I were better reſt my ſelf a little longer: Having thank'd him for ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging a care, I made no further reply: But the next day, <hi>Borgamanero</hi> being gone to the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> at the Army, and the Abbot <hi>Oliva</hi> to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> under pretence of returning that way to <hi>Rone,</hi> they plac'd two Guards and an Officer at my door: Then it was I clearly ſaw my former blindneſs, and the treachery of my pretended Friends; and that if <hi>Borgamanero</hi> had kept them from uſing me thus till after his departure, it was for no other end, but that he might not be thought the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of my ill uſage: But in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this World the blow is often felt when the hand that gave it is not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48334:68"/>
ſeen: This was not all, but, as if I had been an offender againſt the State, they received and opened all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written by me, or addreſſed to me; they proceeded yet further, for <hi>Borga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manero,</hi> not thinking himſelf ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reveng'd of my ſlights and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, which proceeded only from the ſmall obligation I had to him, and knowing I had received a Letter from the Conſtable, and a Brief from the Pope, wherein he permitted the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop to give me my choice what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent I would go into; he advis'd the Count <hi>Monterey</hi> to ſtay for an anſwer and an order that was to be ſent me from <hi>Spain,</hi> telling him, he was very well aſſur'd whatever he had done to me ſhould be very well approv'd; not only by the Conſtable, but by the Queen Regent. By this artifice he broke the neck of the buſineſs, when I thought it almoſt concluded: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations he had ſent againſt me into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> had the effect he deſir'd. The Queen order'd the Count to make ſure of my perſon, and the Conſtable commending highly their conduct as to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48334:68"/>
me, ſent me a Letter in juſtification of it: That upon advice had of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to go into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> they were oblig'd to deprive me of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to execute the deſign. 'Twas in vain to ſtand upon my defence, and endeavour to clear my ſelf of the falſe accuſations. I told the Count, when he came to ſee me in the Cittadel as he return'd from the Army, (as I had by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted the Conſtable) that if I had had the deſign they ſpoke of, it would have been an eaſie matter to have put it in execution at <hi>Cologne,</hi> where the one and the other very well knew I wanted neither Friends nor Favour. This had been reaſon enough to any other to have laid aſide all ſuſpitions of of this nature: But the artifice of the Marqueſs prevail'd over my innocence. The ſecond viſit the Count made me, upon my complaint of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my rigorous uſage, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his leave to go to <hi>Bruſſells</hi> as I was promis'd, he reſolv'd to ſatifie me, and gave <hi>Borgamanero</hi> charge to provide for my reception there: He hir'd me an Appartment adjoining cloſe to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48334:69"/>
Engliſh Covent, wherein he ſet up more Grates than were in the Covent. This famous habitation being fitted for me, he went to <hi>Bourgoigne,</hi> and notice was given me of the Lodging provided for me: Two of my Maids, whom I had ſent to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> having reported to me the Circumſtances of this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Priſon, and told me I were better ſtay where I was; I would not believe them, as not able to imagine, though they had depriv'd me of liberty to go abroad and walk the Town, they would alſo deny me entrance into the Covent. All things now ready, and this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant habitation in order, the Count ſent the Captain of his Guards, with whom I embark'd for <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> where I had a great deſire to ſtay: Having in this ſhort Voyage inform'd my ſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the particular conveniences of my future habitation, I began in good earneſt to be afraid of lying there, and reſolv'd to take Sanctuary in a conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place near it; ſo that a very fine Coach of the Counts being ſent for my reception, to carry me to this Lodging, without allowing me the liberty of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48334:69"/>
the Counteſs or Count at the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, I went into the Church, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covent, under pretence of ſaying my Prayers, and the ſame time declar'd to the Captain of the Guard, who had accompanied me, that I would not ſtir out of the Church, but to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Monaſtry, as the Count had promis'd I ſhould, in the Cittadel. The Captain carried the news to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, who came preſently to me, and adding threats to his requeſts, and all to no purpoſe; my refuſing to quit the Church provok'd him ſo, that he ſent to the Nuncio and the Arch-Biſhop for leave to take me out by force. After a ſhort conference with them, he came to me the ſecond time, but receiving from me as high and hard words as he gave me, he went his way, leaving ſeveral of his Guards to watch me, beſides four Sentinels at the Church Door, having before that, in the Queens name, forbidden the Abbeſs to receive me into her Covent.</p>
            <p>I was at laſt reſolv'd to ſleep in the Church, when Monſieur <hi>Bruneau,</hi> a Magiſtrate of <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> advis'd me to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48334:70"/>
come out fairly, aſſuring me he had good information his Excellency had given the Souldiers order to ſteal me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as ſoon as I ſhould be a-ſleep. I knew this to be an honeſt man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him, and according to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I went into my ſtately Lodging, which I found ſtronger and better guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the Tower of <hi>Danae.</hi> But notwithſtanding all my trouble, which were not ſmall, I was ſo tir'd and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that I never had a better Nights reſt: But the Grates, and Guards, and Centinels put upon me were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for the Count fearing I would one way or other find a paſſage into the Covent, ſent a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman call'd <hi>de St. Lorenzo</hi> to be witneſs of all my Actions, with order not to permit me to go out of his ſight. In this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition, and having not been able to obtain any thing of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Flanders</hi> with my ſighs and my tears, I reſolv'd at laſt to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and retire into a Covent, not doubting but this would be granted me. The Count approv'd of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and diſpatch'd a Courrier to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48334:70"/>
Conſtable to inform him of it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his permiſſion, which I preſs'd for extremely, out of a deſire to ſee that Court, and in hopes to better my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>While I expected an Anſwer from the Conſtable, the Count wanting his Guards, and being oblig'd to go to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> to diſpatch ſome affairs, preſs'd me much to return to the Cittadel, giving me his word I ſhould be better us'd, and allow'd to go ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, accompanied by the Lieutenant of the place. I found an opportunity to get him ſign the conditions of this Treaty, at a viſit he made me before he went for <hi>Antwerp</hi>: I had, to my coſt, found it neceſſary to uſe all the caution, and obtain the beſt ſecurity I could, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my falling under the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences I found there the firſt time, and the next day ſet forward for <hi>Antwerp,</hi> accompanied by Monſieur <hi>Bruneau</hi> and <hi>Don de St. Lorenzo.</hi> I had thenceforth more liberty in the Cittadel, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where elſe, after the arrival of the Abbot <hi>Colonna,</hi> who was come from the Conſtable to take care of me, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48334:71"/>
me in my Voyage. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed very much to my better uſage, by repreſenting to the Count that I might be guarded with more decency, and my Perſon ſufficiently ſecur'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing ſuch diſobliging and rigorous cautions. My Voyage for <hi>Spain</hi> being reſolv'd on, I writ a Letter to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, wherein I pray'd him to do me the favour, when I came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to receive me into his Houſe; and that he would get me leave, from the Queen, to go into a Covent belonging to the Court. All things being ready for my departure, I went to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> where <hi>Don Fernando Vallederes,</hi> Governour of the Town, treated me magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for eight days I ſtaid there, waiting a convenient opportunity to embarque: At the end of that time I ſail'd away, in company of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, which, with a favourable Wind, arriv'd in nine days at <hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi>: I was ſcarce landed, but finding no anſwer from the Admiral, nor conſequently from the Queen, I writ him a ſecond Letter to the ſame effect with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And to ſee if he would anſwer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48334:71"/>
me, I ſtaid eight days at <hi>St. Sebaſtian</hi>; during which, the Governour <hi>Don Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Pantoja</hi> us'd me and my People with all imaginable civility. Theſe eight days being over, and vext no anſwer was come, I reſolv'd to purſue my Journey towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> in hopes to receive anſwer by the way. Being a days Journey beyond <hi>Burges,</hi> and ſeeing no appearance of what I expected, I ſent an Expreſs to the Admiral, to to know if I might depend upon the favour I deſir'd of him by my Letters from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and from <hi>St. Sebaſtian.</hi> Continuing my Journey I arriv'd at <hi>Alcobendas,</hi> a Village three Leagues from <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Courrier brought me Letters; one from the Queen, wherein her Majeſty did me all the honours I could wiſh; the other from the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who very obligingly granted me the houſe I deſir'd, adding he would come in perſon to receive me, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it with his own mouth: The Abbot <hi>Vigliani,</hi> to whom I had diſpatcht a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to give notice of my coming, arriv'd, as I was eating ſomething, with his Coach, and another from the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48334:72"/>
who had ſent with it one of his Gentlemen to wait on me: Tyr'd with heat and with travelling, I ask'd the Abbot <hi>Vigliani</hi> if it were not poſſible to get me a little Ice. He was no leſs aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at the queſtion, than I was aſham'd I had ask'd him for ſo ordinary a thing. He preſently ſent for all ſorts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Liquors for me, who heartily thank'd him for ſo ſeaſonable a Refreſhment. At his requeſt I went in his Coach to our Ladies of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> about two Leagues from <hi>Madrid,</hi> where I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Ducheſs <hi>d' Albuquerque,</hi> and the Admirals Daughter in Law, Wife to the Marqueſs <hi>d' Alcannizas,</hi> the Admirals ſecond Son, and by the Duke <hi>d' Albuquerque</hi> (ſince dead:) They brought me to a Houſe of pleaſure of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals, on the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Madrid,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry richly furniſh'd, and adorn'd with the moſt excellent and rareſt Painting in <hi>Europe</hi>; and, in a word, the fineſt and moſt pleaſant place of all <hi>Spain.</hi> I was there about two Months, and then, fearing I might be troubleſome to the Admiral, (who treated me ſplendidly enough) and ſeeing him naturally care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48334:72"/>
ſo that he did not preſs the Queen for her permiſſion, for my going into a Covent as ſhe had promis'd me, I went my ſelf to ſpeak to her Majeſty, and intreated her Order to the Nuns of <hi>St. Domingo el Real,</hi> to receive me into their Covent, or allow me a Houſe they had hard by, between their Covent and that of our Lady <hi>de los Angeles,</hi> of the Order of <hi>St. Francis.</hi> The Queen receiv'd me with great kindneſs, and granted my requeſt; and the next day ſent order to the Nuns to receive me, or give me the Houſe I mention'd: Their anſwer was, they would obey the order, but intreated her Majeſty, with all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſhe would be pleaſed to make an Authentick Declaration under her Royal Signature, that the favour they did me ſhould not be drawn into Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which her Majeſty granted them, for preſerving their Priviledges, and with Circumſtances much to my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I entred this Covent the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> accompanied by the Nuncio, (now Cardinal <hi>Mareſcotti</hi>) the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Marqueſs <hi>d' Alcannizas</hi>: That I might neither give, nor receive
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48334:73"/>
trouble in my new habitation, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd me the half of the next houſe for my Apartment, where they plac'd Grates, and left the reſt of it for the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Don Fernand de Colonna,</hi> and my Family: I was at firſt at a great loſs for want of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue, and my ignorance of the Cuſtoms of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and had it not been for <hi>Donna Victoria Porcia Oreſco,</hi> Siſter to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Mortara,</hi> then Abbeſs, who could ſpeak <hi>Italian</hi> pretty well, and is very ingenious, I had had a very ill time on't. Afterwards I made an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with ſome of the Nuns, and paſt my time pleaſantly enough among them, till having ask'd leave to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad once a week (as I had been made to believe I ſhould, and was granted me at <hi>Turin</hi>) I underſtood it had been denied me at <hi>Rome.</hi> Soon after this I had news that the Conſtable, whom I had preſſed with much earneſtneſs to ſend me my ſecond Son, (and in order thereto, that he would take him along with him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Queen, at my motion, had honour'd him with a command of two Troops
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48334:73"/>
of Horſe) was ſo far from giving me that ſatisfaction, that he had written to the Queen and the Admiral, who had deſir'd it of him for me, that he had no mind I ſhould ſtir out of the Covent, and intreated her Majeſty not to permit it; that I was ſafe, and in good hands at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that he was loath to hazard the ſeeing me at liberty elſewhere. Nothing provokes me more than contradiction; 'tis hard to expreſs how highly I reſented this uſage, eſpecially conſidering I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually watch'd by a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were ſpyes upon my actions, by the appointment of the Abbot <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> who with a furious rigour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the Conſtables orders: Beſides, there were ſeveral diſaffected perſons, who made it their buſineſs to ſet my Husband againſt me, and do me ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, writing to him I had a mind to be gone, and would certainly do it, if not carefully watch'd. This made me reſolve to quit the Covent, and let them ſee all the pains they took to keep me up cloſe, could keep me there no longer than I pleas'd. <hi>Don Fernand</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:48334:74"/>
being abroad, and all my Men with him, I commanded my Maids to throw down thoſe ſtrong, thick, and high Walls, the Author of my life ſays were the only Obſtacle could ſtop me: I gave the Duke <hi>d' Oſſuna,</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Prince <hi>d' Aſtillano,</hi> notice of what I had done, by a Billet written to every of them, intreating their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on this occaſion, ſince it was not my deſign (as my Enemies gave out) to flye into <hi>France</hi> or into <hi>England,</hi> but to be at liberty in the Houſe I was in, it being not juſt I ſhould be kept up in a place I had freely and voluntarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: The Duke of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> though an honeſt and a gallant Gentleman, was willing to ſee the ſtorm over; and having ſent on the morrow to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me, reſpited his viſit for ſome days, convincing me on this occaſion he was more a Pollititian, than gallant or obliging. It was a whole week ere I could ſee the Prince <hi>d' Aſtillano,</hi> who excus'd himſelf, ſaying, the news came to him late. The Nuncio <hi>Melini</hi> and the Admiral, whom <hi>Don Fernand</hi> had pray'd to come preſently, fail'd not to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48334:74"/>
do it, not to favour my deſign, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their own, which was to oblige me to return into the Cloyſter. I did all I could to prevent it, and found no ſmall help from the difficulty the Nuns made to receive me: yet wanting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and having cauſe to fear the worſt from them who had prov'd ſo contrary to my expectations, I follow'd the advice of returning into the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Nuns having ſubmitted upon the Nuncio's threating to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, in caſe of reſiſtance. The Admiral, after ſo important an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proud to ſee me coop'd up, ſolicited their Majeſties to have me continued in the Cloyſter, and ſtrictly confin'd. The Conſtable was extreme glad at the news of this happy ſucceſs, and will certainly be ſtill well pleas'd with this Court, while they continue to vex me, his mind being ſo much alter'd, that he finds matter of joy in the oppreſſion of my liberty.</p>
            <p>I endur'd ſome Months, with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience enough, the violence they us'd to keep me in the Covent. I had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hopes of redreſs under the Queens
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48334:75"/>
Government, who anſwer'd my petition for liberty, that ſhe would grant it me with all her heart, if the Conſtable would conſent to it. Beſides, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral being the main Inſtrument to execute the reſolutions of <hi>Don Fernand Valenzuela,</hi> was too great a Friend of my Husbands, to admit of any propoſal that might give him offence, in croſſing the reſolutions they had taken againſt me, what the Conſtable had given full power to execute.</p>
            <p>In this lamentable caſe was I, when Heaven, pittying the diſtreſſed State of this Monarchy, and concerned for the preſervation of it, inſpir'd the Grandees to inſinuate to his Majeſty, how neceſſary it was to call home his Highneſs <hi>Don John of Auſtria,</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Brother, to attend his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the ſole remedy for thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that threatned the Government: This let in a Beam of hope, and brought into my remembrance the ſaying of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ventimilla,</hi> a perſon no leſs illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious for Virtue than Birth, That I muſt owe my liberty to that Prince, who at his return, would certainly reſtore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48334:75"/>
it me. I reſolv'd to make uſe of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an occaſion, not doubting but it would fall out as had been foretold, the particular eſteem I always had for the excellent qualities of that Prince, made me paſſionately deſire to ſee him in full poſſeſſion of all the honours due to him. My deſires were heightned by the advantage I hop'd to draw thence to my ſelf, who look'd upon my liberty as an infallible conſequent of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. All I could contribute to his Glory and Intereſt, was my good wiſhes, and inſinuations in his favour; I addreſt my ſelf to the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the perſon I was moſt oblig'd to. As for the Admiral, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they had given over viſiting me, leſt I ſhould imploy them in buſineſs inconſiſtent with the good intelligence they would hold with my Husband. The Duke I found ſo well diſpos'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this famous negotiation, that he long'd for the happy moment to put it in execution. Matters being in a pretty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and notice given me by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ventimilla</hi> that his Highneſs was parted from <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> I thought it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48334:76"/>
time to put my deſigns in execution, and allowing no longer time than I thought abſolutely neceſſary for the Princes Voyage, though perform'd with all imaginable ſpeed; when, by my computation, I thought his Arrival not far of, I went in open day out of the Covent, not as before, but through the Gate, and the Porters looking on. Having ſtept into a Coach, with a Lady my Friend, who came on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, I went directly to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>Mortara</hi>'s, who happened to be abroad, but at her return receiv'd me with great kindneſs, though much ſurpriz'd to ſee me.</p>
            <p>I had given the perſons above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned notice of my ſecond (as of my firſt) coming out of the Covent; and the Marchioneſs ſent word to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> I was at her Houſe; <hi>Don Fernand</hi> having before-hand given order all about for arreſting me, that I might be forc'd to return into the Cloyſter, though he knew not where I was, but thought I deſign'd to leave the Kingdom. The Admiral, at <hi>Don Fernands</hi> inſtance, and for reaſons he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48334:76"/>
knows altogether indiſpos'd to favour me, no ſooner knew where I was, but he preſently fell to conſider how to have me clapt up again into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or ſome other place of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſhort time I was at liberty I received not a viſit from any but the Duke <hi>d' Oſſuna,</hi> whom the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs advertis'd of my being with her; in all the diſcourſe I had with him, there was nothing remarkable but his telling me, it was impoſſible to make amends for the fault I committed in quitting the Covent, but to retire to a Houſe where I might find the piety and innocence of a Cloyſter, without the rigors and auſterities in practice there. The Prince <hi>d' Aſtillano</hi> neither came nor ſent me anſwer, but had the gallantry to ſend <hi>Don Fernand</hi> the Billet received from me, and aſſure him, by Letter, he would do the Conſtable all the ſervice he could: The Admiral, willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as honeſt a man as the other, came not to ſee me, being wholly taken up with buſineſs that concern'd me; which (if you would know it) was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48334:77"/>
held againſt me, and he thought fit to defer his viſit till the Councel were over. I knew nothing the while of what was plotting againſt me, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon daring to give me information, till Monſieur <hi>de Lindenau,</hi> extraordinary Embaſſador from <hi>Denmark,</hi> a Man of Honour and Merit, gave me intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all, by a Maid he ſent to me. I could not ſpeak with him, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting his advice to his Friendſhip, without taking further care to prevent what might follow, I thought no more of it; though the fears I was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in, were ſo many preſages to induce me to believe the truth of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. The Embaſſadrice of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> a Lady of great reſolution and wit, and the Duke <hi>d' Oſſuna</hi> had ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated my fears, by aſſuring me poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively they were cauſeleſs, that I thought my ſelf very ſafe. However, two days after, the Nuncio, the Admiral, and <hi>Don Garcia de Medrano,</hi> one of the Councel and Chamber of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> made me an important viſit by the Kings or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: The buſineſs of it was to oblige
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48334:77"/>
me to return into the Covent; telling me, that having entred it by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſhould not have left it without permiſſion from him: The Admiral ſpoke firſt, and told me, he was come only to acquaint me with his Majeſties pleaſure; to which the Nuncio added, that his buſineſs was to facilitate the execution of it, and remove the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles might be expected from the Nuns: the third, ſpeaking like a Miniſter of Juſtice, told me, with a ſevere tone, he had order to take me along; and, that in caſe of reſiſtance, he would not ſtir from me but watch me very narrowly. Their Remonſtrances and Threats would never have prevail'd upon me, had not the Marchioneſs preſs'd me on the other ſide, and told me, it would be a very great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to her, to ſee any violence offer'd me in her Houſe, in caſe of my refuſal to obey the Kings orders; adding, I were better ſubmit, and that when I was in the Covent, I might get out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day with his Majeſties leave: With theſe weak reaſons of hers I was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48334:78"/>
perſwaded to return once more into the Covent: She accompanied me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Nuncio, to ſurprize the Nuns, went before, and having had the Gate opened, order'd it ſhould not be ſhut, as if ſome Gentleman of Quality had been to follow him: At my arrival I found the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> who being on his way to give me a viſit at the Marchioneſs <hi>Mortara</hi>'s, and having heard I was upon my return to the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, went after the Nuncio to wait my coming: As ſoon as he ſaw me he gave me his hand, and accompanied me to the Covent, where ſeveral of the Nuns having known me (by taking up my Manto) fill'd the Air with their Cryes, ſaying to the Nuncio, what their reſentment to ſee their Priviledges broken ſuggeſted unto them; ſo that he was forc'd to ſend his Coach for the Provincial who lived at <hi>Our Ladies of Attochia,</hi> at the Gate of <hi>Madrid</hi>: He brought them to reaſon, and made them obey his Majeſties Order read by the Nuncio, having appeas'd the noiſe rais'd by the different opinions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48334:78"/>
of a hundred and thirty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of which that Monaſtery conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Amidſt the confuſion I took their part who were moſt againſt me, and notwithſtanding the deſpair I was in, to ſee my ſelf us'd with ſuch violence, I took no ſmall delight in the buſtle and diviſion I had occaſioned among them. The better to foment it, I told them it was a ſtrange and unheard-of proceeding of theirs, to have ſo little care of their priviledges which they ſaw not only broken by their being forc'd to receive me at firſt, but violated a-new by being oblig'd to a ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>But this Civil War was quickly at an end, and all Spirits quiet but mine. I was vext to the heart to think with what violence they endeavour'd to keep me confin'd under conditions more rigorous than was promis'd: But the ill ſucceſs of my two firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts could not diſcourage me from a third enterprize to recover my liberty which I, look'd upon as the greateſt pleaſure of life; to enjoy which, a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48334:79"/>
noble and generous Soul thinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much to hazard: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd ſeriouſly what means to obtain it by, and had been in conſultation a whole week with my thoughts, when by the favour of providence, that happy day ſo much long'd for by the Subjects of this Monarchy, appear'd; The day the famous Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> deſir'd ſo paſſionately, and had ſo zealouſly labour'd for, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the baniſhment of <hi>Valenzuela</hi> his Highneſs, with infinite applauſe, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entred <hi>Madrid.</hi> The particulars of this Affair, and Circumſtances of the Princes entry, I leave to abler Pens, and ſhall ſay only, that though I had the leaſt hand of any in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the enterprize, yet no Perſon was more concern'd for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; And I doubt not but my joy would have been far greater for the reſtitution of the Prince, and that he would have done me right upon the memorial I preſented to the Queen ſoon after my return into the Covent, (which her Majeſty referr'd to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48334:79"/>
of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> who would do nothing in it before his Highneſſes arrival, had not <hi>Don Fernand Colonna,</hi> to prevent Execution of what the Prince had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in my favour, repreſented to his Highneſs that the Conſtable deſir'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to ſee me in a Covent; and that he would take it for a Singular favour to have me continued under Confinement. This Declaration Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the reſolution of the Prince, who ſaw himſelf obliged to refer the mater to the Preſident of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> who proceeding as ſlowly as he had formerly done, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a Memorial to his Majeſty, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to his Highneſs by the Duke <hi>de Medina Sidonia</hi>: juſt as the Prince was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to grant me all I could expect from his Juſtice, a Letter was receiv'd from the Conſtable who having heard of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leaving the Covent, earneſtly begg'd his Majeſty to ſend me into ſome Caſtle: his Highneſs hereupon, to quit himſelf with his uſual prudence of a troubleſome Affair, would not come to a reſolution, but refer'd my memoriall and the Letter to the Councel of State.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48334:80"/>
Having Sollicited the Counſellors to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my Cauſe, the Dukes of <hi>Alva</hi> and <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> and the marqueſs <hi>d' Aſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> gave me their words to do me all the ſervice in their power: they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd their promiſe, and the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the vote of the Council, I had the Majority of voyces, and it was Carryed I ſhould have my liberty and a houſe to live in with decency and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſutable to my Quality. When I had notice of this favourable vote of the Council, I writ to <hi>Don Geronimo D' Eguia,</hi> Secretary <hi>Of the Univerſal diſpatch,</hi> intreating him not to defer acquainting his Majeſty with it, that he might do his pleaſure in it: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary gave me not an anſwer in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſent one to tell me very civilly, he would give my buſineſs all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch in his power. He was as good as his word, having within two dayes obtain'd a Decree which was ſent me by <hi>Don Bartholomew de Legaſa</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of State: the tenor of it was, that the King having ſeen my Memorial and the Conſtables Letter, thought fit to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48334:80"/>
Suſpend his reſolution till his Majeſty writ to him; And that in the mean time if I pleaſ'd to retire into ſome place about <hi>Madrid,</hi> his Majeſty gave me leave to do it until a definitive ſentence ſhould paſs. <hi>Don Fernand Colonna</hi> having heard how things went, and been Charg'd by the Conſtable to uſe all poſſible diligence to have me put into a Caſtle if there were no keeping me in a Cloyſter, he omitted nothing that might put a ſtop to my Liberty, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he preſented a Memorial wherein he inſiſted at large upon the inconveniences that would attend the granting it me; And that it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Conſtables ſatisfaction I ſhould be kept in a Cloyſter or a Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>I apprehended <hi>Don Fernand's</hi> oppoſition might turn to my prejudice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an alteration in the reſolution had been taken: which was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, the Remonſtrance he had made having already ſtagger'd ſome of the Counſellors of State. I thought it my my duty by getting timely out of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48334:81"/>
Covent to prevent the miſchief that Threatned me: I gave the Nuncio and the Duke <hi>D' Oſſuna</hi> and <hi>Dorma Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria</hi> notice of my deſign: ſhe did not diſapprove it, thinking I had obtain'd a full and formal Decree: I got up very early for fear a Nun who lay in my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment ſhould diſcover my deſign: I went out by ſix in the morning, and ſent for ſome Nuns into the Hall to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe them while my Coach came; the Marchioneſs of <hi>Mort<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Coach I had hir'd being come, I went with my mayds to <hi>Attocha,</hi> where I found the Father Procurator of the Nuns to ſay Maſs at my requeſt. Four days before I left the Covent I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd <hi>Don Bartholomew Legaſa</hi> of my deſign to retire to <hi>Ballacas,</hi> a place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King within a League of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that he might give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie notice. I had taken care the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Camaraſa</hi> ſhould ſend me a<gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Coach under pretence of ſending
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48334:81"/>
two of my maids thither, to fit an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment for me in the houſe of <hi>Dona Cecilia de Vera,</hi> who had given me the Choice of my Apartment there, except that in the poſſeſſion of the Prince <hi>de Monte Sarctno,</hi> who was priſoner there on his Parol. This Coach made no more haſt than the other, and I had time in ſtaying for it to hear four maſſes: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come at laſt with a Gentleman in it who had been formerly recommended to me by the Conſtable, we went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the houſe I mentioned, where we found only the Princes people who gave us their Apartment as the beſt, and provided for us a ſumptuous dinner. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four in the afternoon the Nuncio arriv'd accompani'd by <hi>Don Fernando</hi>: Having abſolv'd me of the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication I had incurr'd by coming out of the Covent without leave from him, he gave me ſo good reaſons that <hi>Don Fernando</hi> could do no leſs than preſent that memorial to the Councel of State, and excuſ'd him ſo well for the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Remonſtrances he had made againſt my liberty, that he prevail'd with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48334:82"/>
me to pardon him at his requeſt. I lay that night at <hi>Ballacas,</hi> though without any Sleep having had no reſt for a Rhume that troubled me occaſion'd by the dampneſs of the Room, and attended with a fever: this induc'd me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Madrid</hi> to live in the houſe of <hi>Don Fernando Colonna</hi>: In order to it I diſpatch'd a Page to the Duke <hi>d' Oſſuna,</hi> intreating him to ſend me preſently a Coach and ſix Mules: <hi>Don Fernand</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into my chamber I acquainted him with my deſign, and deſir'd him not to oppoſe it, which he was ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he writ to the Nuntio, and having repreſented to him the poor Condition he found me in, and that it was better I ſhould be at <hi>Madrid</hi> to wait (at his houſe) His Majeſties orders, he intreated him to ſend me a Coach aſſoon as poſſible; I was glad of this, fearing the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> being a Miniſter of ſtate would have excuſ'd himſelf from ſending any. The Nuncio preſently ſhew'd <hi>Don Bartholomew Legaſa</hi> the Letter receiv'd from <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> which having been ſhew'd to ſome of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48334:82"/>
the Councel, anſwer was ſent me; It was not thought fit my requeſt ſhould be granted: the Nuncio was not diſcourag'd at the anſwer, but having ſhew'd the ſame Letter to <hi>Don Jeronymo d' Egua,</hi> he carried it to his Royal Highneſs, and receiv'd order from him to tell the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio he ſaw no inconvenience in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what <hi>Don Fernando</hi> deſir'd. Upon this the Nuncio preſently ſent me a Coach with ſome wagons for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, having in vain expected the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna's</hi> Coach, who ſent me word by the Page after eight hours waiting he would come in perſon to ſeeme. This was in truth a great honour, but it would have been a greater obligation had he ſent me a Coach, when I was under that impatience of returning for <hi>Madrid,</hi> fearing I might be prevented by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prohibit my entrance there, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I had receiv'd a Letter from his Highneſs wherein ſhe told me I had miſ-interpreted his Majeſties or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that before my leaving the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſeveral circumſtances ought to have been adjudged as well for Choice of the place I ſhould go to, as for my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48334:83"/>
there in that ſplendor his Majeſty thought decent and fit for my perſon. But my fear was pretty well over, when I conſider'd this was not an order, but advice and a gentle admonition let me ſee the error I committed.</p>
            <p>While I continued under theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Nuncio's Coach arriv'd: I quickly went into it, ſtill fearing an order to ſtay where I was: We were ſcarce got half way to <hi>Madrid</hi> when we met the Dukes of <hi>Oſſuna, Veraguas Uzedas,</hi> with Father <hi>Ventimilla</hi> coming to ſee me, follow'd by four Coaches and a great Trayn on horſe-back: I rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt for his being ſo punctual; he anſwer'd I had no cauſe to complain of him who inſtead of ſending a Coach was come himſelf, and for one Coach brought me four, which were all at my Service, if <hi>Don Fernand</hi> would be my convoy: We travell'd together to the gates of <hi>Madrid</hi> where we parted. I met the Nuncio walking afoot; He came very civilly to my Coach and gave me ſome advice for my conduct which I obſerv'd to very good purpoſe. This
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48334:83"/>
accidental conference being over, I went to the houſe of <hi>Don Fernando Colona,</hi> where I am yet, expecting every day how his Majeſtie will diſpoſe of me, of which I am hitherto altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, though I have reaſon to believe his Majeſties Juſtice and Clemency, and the great prudence of his Royal Highneſs will put an end to my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and permit me to enjoy that repoſe and tranquillity I have ſo much need o<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
