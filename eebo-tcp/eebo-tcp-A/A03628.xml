            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The one, because he that lyuethe is forsaken and desty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the famylyarytye and frendshipe of him that is dead.
<pb facs="tcp:9999:3"/>
The othere, that the lyuynge dowteth, where the soul of his frende departed is bycome. Whether it be in heauen or in hel. Both thys Iles, maye be redressed with one gode, that is to wyt: If he that lyueth be assured, by the worde of God that his frende departed, is by mortal death entered in Christ in to eternall lyfe. But nowe in thys standeth all the dowte. How the lyuynge maye know in what state the soules depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted stond. This dowte can not the Gentyle dissolue, the wyse menne of the worlde, nor the commone sorte of soche as bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name of christianite.</p>
            <p>¶ Namely for this: that they ymagyn there frendes soules, to be broiled &amp; rosted in the fyre of Purgatory. Wherfore euen
<pb facs="tcp:9999:3"/>
as they feare they wotte not what: so seke they there reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they know not how. Wyth Masse, Dirige and such other. This paynes (by the lyuynge) presupposed of the deade: who can iustlye reprehende the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belyuynge lyuyng for the state of the dead, that more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nede is panyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, and more then profyt is: redemeth the prayers of other. But what may the truethe conclude. Is there any certayenty that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyth al out of dowte, oure fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des soules to departe from the earthe, strayght vnto eternall lyfe. Truly after the iugement of the fleshe, there is no suche knoweledge. For the fleshe in this case, eyther wyll planelye dispayre for the horrour and gretnes of synne: or els dowte
<pb facs="tcp:9999:4"/>
of the meanes howe it maye be remedyd. Onelye therefore the certayntye is knowen by the scrypture of God. Gyue therefore hede what in thys case what the worde of god cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifieth vs of the deade.</p>

broyled in Purgatory. Desyre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue you a reason why? Aunswere haue they none, but that ye muste so beleue, or els be accompted for an Heretike. So that rather they wil force menne wyth dowte to abyde in sorowe: then with iugement of Goddes worde happylye to conforte them wyth ioye. Bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed therfore, be the God of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy that hathe in thys case, put vnto vs an infallyble truethe and doctrine to warraunte the troubled mynd of the liuing for the state of the deade.

<pb facs="tcp:9999:5"/>
For a proue of the same against reasonne and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes doctrine. Saynt Jhon sayth: I harde a voice from heauen. As though he had sayde. It is so true: it can be no waye false, for it is from heauen. And because it shoulde instructe the afflycted of oure tyme and assertaine vs of the state and condicionne of the deade, aswell as it did saint Johne, and them of hys tyme, and for euer tyll the worldles ende: the Aungell byd Sainct Johne wryte the same, saying: Wryte. Blessed are the deade in the Lorde. Although al men indifferently wyshe and couete to be blessed aftre there deathe yet all menne come not to the thynge they moste wyshe for. Because they lyue contrarye vnto the wyl of God that solie

geuethe the blysse eternall, as Sayncte Paul sayth Ephe. 5.1. Cor. 6. No fornicatoure, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man shall haue any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retayge in the kyngedome of Christ, and God. And as Paul excludeth from heauen the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of the fruytes of infidelite, so doth S. John exclude for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelite it selfe. Joan. 3. He that beleueth not the sonne of God, shall se no lyfe, but the Ire of God tarieth vpon him. True it is then, that al men obtaine not thys blyssinge of GOD after death. And euen as the places before shewe who shall misse of thys Joyfull felicite: so S. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, in this place sheweth who shall come vnto it, saying: Bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed are they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dye in the Lord. They onely therfore be blessed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dye in the Lorde. And seyng
<pb facs="tcp:9999:6"/>
a death in the Lord is the gate to eternall life: We wyll more at large declare what it is to dye in the Lord. To dye in the Lorde is to dye in the sayeth of Christe, whom he sente into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde for the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Joan. 3. which is done when foure thinges is obserued.</p>
               <p>¶ Fyrst yf the seykeman in hys sekenes call vnto hys remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what he hath done all his lyfe tyme against the first &amp; seconde table of the Lordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes. The seconde if vpon his examination he find his brothere and neyghboure hurt by him in goodes, or fame, he studye vnfaynedlye to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye him as nere as he can again in both. The thirde, that the seyke man aknowlege vnto the Lorde, asmuche as he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb facs="tcp:9999:6"/>
agaynst the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of the fyrste table: wyth a detestation of them all. The fourth, that he aske of god for the death of Christe remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them all. But he that wyl assuredlye truste to optayne this forgeuenes, had nede to haue redye and prompte, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of the scripture, that sheweth in Christe, the father of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to remit the syke man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes offences. Gene. 3. Esa. 53. Matthew. 1.11. Joh. 1.3.4.5. Romano. 3.4. 1. Johan. 1.2. The assurance of faith by grace optayned: it is the sekemannes parte, and as many as be wyth hym, religiouslye to praye, for the perseueraunce of the same sayeth. And also to hys poure, to help the nedefull wyth hys almes, that they also may pray
<pb facs="tcp:9999:7"/>
to the Lorde for hym. Then thus commended hym selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God, Let him commende all his lykewise wyth some exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that they diligentlye ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue in the feare of God as the scripture teacheth. Gene. 49. Deuter. 31. Josua. 23. 3. Re. 2. He that thus dyeth, dyeth in the Lorde, and therfore blessed as this texte teacheth. And as it is taught in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 5. of S. John. Uerely, verely, I say vnto you, He that heareth my word, and beleue in him that sent me, hath euerlastinge life, and shall not come into iudgemente, but passe from death to life. He can not dye a wycked death that is blessed &amp; sanctifyed in the bloud of Christe. As he muste nedes be, that in his seykenes seketh health by this medicine prescri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed
<pb facs="tcp:9999:7"/>
by S. John. That by four wordes helpeth the greateste and damigerouse desperation, If credite and fayeth be geuen vnto them. The firste word is: I harde a voyce. The seconde: from heauen. The thyrde: Wryte, The fourth: Blessed be the deade that dieth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. If ye learne it well, it shall not only make you blessed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hour of death: But also moderate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sorowes &amp; murninges (whiche otherwyse) ye shall suffre while yelyue here, for youre frendes that dye. Lykewyse it shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suyre you of the state and condi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of your frendes departed that they haue the fauoure and presence of God. And better at ease in heauen wyth God, then ye be in the earth with menne. Learne to dye well therfore,
<pb facs="tcp:9999:8"/>
by this lesson, ye mortall men. And leaue not the medycyne prescrybed and taught by God the father, made and tempered wyth the bloude of Christe, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nystred in to the soule of man by the holye ghoste, broughte from heauen by an Angel, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vpon and to the people of the earthe by holye Sayncte John. For the medycynes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by manne, as Masse, Dirige, Peregrinacions, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, other mennes merytes when ye be gone, Tryntalles, Anniuersaries, Inuocation, &amp; prayers of and to sayntes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partede, Auriculare confessy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and suche other mennes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentiones whyche cannot ease nor quyet the conscience of the poore sekemanne.</p>
               <p>But the more of thys try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sles
<pb facs="tcp:9999:8"/>
is promysed vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the afflicted man, the more wretched creatoure he desyreth. As youre conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shall knowe at the tyme and houre of your sekenes and daunger. And then shall ye fele when all othere thynges be to lytle, that the precyouse bloude of Christe is ynoughe and where as wythoute dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te youre owne conscyens shall bare you recorde (do you and all othere men for you what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer may be done) ye are culpable and worthye deathe euerlastynge.</p>
               <p>So shall Christes spyryte if he be in you by fayth bayre record with youre spyryte, that yeare for Christes sake onelye, the heyres of eternall lyfe. This is the only way to quyete euerye
<pb facs="tcp:9999:9"/>
trouble and afflicted conscience in the daye of death. As Saint John sayeth, Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord. But seynge the deuell can not bare this doctrine, A man to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Christ, for the promes of Goddes sake: He goeth aboute to persuade thys word of God to be false that sayeth: He that dyeth in the Lorde is blessed. And so wyth the moste parte of men he subuerteth this Godly consolation. Ether he maketh the syke to dispare of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of his sinne: Ether causeth hym to seke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiente and vnlawfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to remoue his synnes. And that you and I be subiecte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this temptacion: Read Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe. .27. Luke. 23. And se what the deuell aduentured to
<pb facs="tcp:9999:9"/>
persuade vnto Christ himselfe. And wolde haue borne hym in hande he was not the sonne of God: nether that God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryde for hym seinge he suffered hys enemyes thus to preuale agaynste hym. And the same temptationne he burdened the holy prophete Dauid wyth all, Psal. 3. If he coulde obiect and bourdeyn the sonne of God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> argumentes that he could not be blessed that dyed in the lord: How muche more doth he, yee or maye he: not onelye swade &amp; attempte, but also perswade &amp; ouercome oure myserable and weake condycyonne: Ile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paryd God knoweth of a thow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sande sorttes of temptationne to sustayne of them the leste.

withoute tyme, of none ye may learne so wel as by the lyfe and death and also the doctryne of the Patryarkis, Prophetes, Christe, &amp; the Apostles. Whose example yf ye follow not here: incase hereaftre ye neuer come where they be, thanke youre selues. And that ye take vpon you to vse another remedys (yea and as manye men sayeth bettre) to warraunte &amp; stonde at the tyme of deathe agaynste the tyrannye of syne, hell, the deuel and the wordle. If after youre departure from hens it be worse wyth yow then it is wyth them: blame none but youre selues. And the bettre blame worthy be ye, so many tymes admonyshede, yet not a dele the bettre. Juge other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they lyste, thus I beleue. He
<pb facs="tcp:9999:10"/>
that dyeth as an Apostle, shall hereaftre lyue lyke an Apostel. And he that beleueth as an Apostle, shalbe saued lyke an Apostle. Understonde what I saye. It is of theyr doctryne &amp; suffycient lernynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I speake of, whyche is fully &amp; suffycient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye able to leade a man in to all treuth. 2. Tymo. 3.

If any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale general, or prouyncyall: If anye lernynge of man coulde shewe you, how bettre to lyue, &amp; more godlye to dye, then the wryttynges of the Prophetes, and the Apostles in whose wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynges ye haue aplate bothe of there lyfe, &amp; also of there death. I woulde comede it vnto you. But you know, there is none. Seynge ye be thys perswaded of them, &amp; alow so muche there

The ignorancye of thys trew doctryne to teache men to lyue and dye well, hath broght in that false &amp; vntrewe opinione of fayned purgatory. The whyche inducyd foure greate Iles. The fyrste, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the deathe of a mannes frynde to be more paynefull. The seconde it abolysheth one of the chief artykles of our e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyefe. Whyche is, I beleue the remission of synne. The thirde is that it brought the workes
<pb facs="tcp:9999:11"/>
and deseruynges of men into greater estymatione then the merites of Christe.</p>
               <p>The fourthe: it causeth men to lyue in a greater securyte, &amp; libertye of lyfe: Bycause there opynione is, that there freyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des doynges for them after deathe: shall helpe to there sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatione.</p>
               <p>Beware therfore of this doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryne of purgatorye as of a moste pestilente Ile, and seyng all oure saluatione restethe in thys that we dye in the Lord: whyles we be in helthe, let vs learne thys doctryne well, and exercyse the same. It is not a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s part to slepe in synne as an Ile souldyer tyll the trompe blowe. Nether yet to prouyde for weapone tyll hys enymye be vpon hym. But to
<pb facs="tcp:9999:12"/>
haue it readye that it serue as tyme and necessyte requyreth. And so we be admonyshed to do by the horryble example of the fyue folyshe vyrgynes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. 25. chap. of S. Mathew. that neglectyng there oune bounde dewtye to know and lyue well, and trustynge to the helpe of others were shut out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Joye eternall. For whyles they wer a byinge other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes merites they loste there owne saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The aduersaries of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth dothe vse to obiecte agaynste thys doctrine of God, that such as dye in the Lorde shoulde strayghtway be blessed wyth hym in heauen, &amp; say we denye not but they be blessed: but it is in hope to come &amp; not wyth pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent Joye and felicytie for they muste suffre the paynes of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorye
<pb facs="tcp:9999:12"/>
and so entre the place appoynted. To the whyche obiectione S. Johne, in thys place ansureth, &amp; denyeth anye deferrynge of tyme betywyxe the deathe of a Christyane and hys acceptatione into the fruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cione of God, and sayth by and by not to go fyrste into purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye &amp; then aftre into heauen. And so saythe Chryste hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe. John. 5. The same tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs the parable of Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus soule streyghwaye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death that was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Abra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hams bossome. Luc. 16. Where as ye maye learne the state of the soules departed. And here S. John, sheweth the cause why the soules that dye be not drawen through purgatorye nor passeth through no suche paynes to come to heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9999:13"/>Because sayth he they maye reste from there laboures, that is to saye from the paynes dew for synne, and from all other myseries of right annexed and layde vpon men for synne. If the Christyane soules go into purgatorye they be not quyt from there labours but put vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to more laboures. From a hote feuere into a hote fyre, frome paynes tollerable, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be (as there doctryne saythe) as greuouse as the paynes of hell. So the deathe of manne were not the ende of hys my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seryes, but the begynnynge. Nether were not deathe as S. Paull saythe. 1. Corin. 15. The laste enemye of manne, but purgatorye were. Nether were it trewe that he sayth: Ebre. 9. chapt. That manne
<pb facs="tcp:9999:13"/>
receyueth hys iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after hys death: but after he is fyrste dead, and then sufficyently pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged in Purgatorye.</p>
               <p>Wherof ye haue no Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in the newe Testamente nor in the olde: ye haue neyther anye commaundemente to praye for the dead, nor yet promyse that God wyll heare youre prayer, when ye praye.

               <p>The seconde doctrine here, of Saynt Johne repugneth and ouerthrowethe the opynyon of manye ignoraunte and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticious persones that whyles they yet lyue here them selues, passeth lytle, what faythe, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyon, or workes commaundyd by god they do, but in the tyme of death they thinke to redeme all their synnes by other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes workes after deathe: with masse, pylgrymayge, perdones and othere.
