            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To you from whom God for his glory, our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne for his honor and safety, and our Church and Common-weale for their flourishing welfare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
<pb facs="tcp:23382:3"/>
doe expect much by your transcendent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable imploiments: To you I say, and to no other do I present this Consultation (termed <hi>Vox Coeli</hi>) to your consideration, and dedicate it to your protection.</p>
            <p>And because (in point of integritie and dutie) I hold my selfe bound to bring the truth neerer to your knowledge, or rather home to your vnderstanding; May it please you to be informed, that about some three yeares since, at the first setting of the last high Court of Parliament, when our King was so earnest in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the match of our Noble Prince his Sonne, with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi>; When the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> coulourably pretended (though not really intended) to be deepely affected to entertaine and embrace the said motion; When Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> (his Ambassador) made shew to be a zealous solicitor, and a most actiue and officious stickler for compassing and finishing it; When our Romish Catholiques became passionately and insultingly confident of the free toleration of their Religion, and in the skie-reaching mountaines of their ambitious and superstitious hopes, were already prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to erect their Groves and Altars, to set vp their Idols and Images, and consequently to introduce their Pope and his Masse in the Temples of our God; when all Prisons were vnlocked, and open to all pernitious Priests and dangerous Iesuites, and that many others
<pb facs="tcp:23382:3"/>
like (Caterpillers and Vipers) came flocking and swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from diuers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to poyson and eate out the soules of our people, with their Idolatrous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Antichrist, and to withdraw their hearts and consciences from their Alleagiance and Fidelity, to their naturall Prince &amp; Countrey; purposely (with more treachery then Religion) to subiect them to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine power &amp; iurisdiction. When the Emperour had beaten the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> from <hi>Prague,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with the assistance of the Swords, Souldiers, and Treasure of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had in a setled truce assaulted and taken many Towns in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> contrary to their promises to our King, &amp; of his Maiesties to the Prince his Sonne in Law, and contrary to the publique peace of <hi>Germany</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome. Then, then it was, (that to pull off the Maske of <hi>Spaines</hi> ambition and malice, who with the fire of this match, sought to set <hi>England</hi> all fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a mournefull and miserable combustion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bury her glory in the dust, and her safety in the cinders of her subuersion and ruines) that as <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> fetch'd fire from heauen, so the fire of my zeale to the good of my Prince &amp; Countrey, likewise fetch'd from thence this Royall consultation for the discovery of our apprant and imminent dangers, and in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to know likewise how to prevent them;
<pb facs="tcp:23382:4"/>
Which resolving to make publique, because it is solely tended to <hi>Englands</hi> publique glory and prosperity: I contrary to my expectation (but not to my feares,) saw my hopes nipt in their blossomes, and my desires stifled in their births, because the Seas of our Kings affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Spaine</hi> went so lofty, and the windes were so tempestuous, that it could not possibly be permitted to passe the Pikes of the Presse: When albeit my zeale and fidelity againe and againe infused new audacity and courage to my resolutions, to see it salute the light, yet it was impossible for me or it to be made so happy, because I saw <hi>Allureds</hi> honest Letter, <hi>Scots</hi> loyall <hi>Vox Popoli, D. Whiting, D. Everad,</hi> &amp; <hi>Claytons</hi> zealous Sermons, and others, suppress'd and silenced, as also <hi>Wards</hi> faithfull picture, which yet was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, as it onely breathed forth his fidelity to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in silent Rethorique, and dumbe eloquence. Whervpon inforced to take a law from the iniquity of the time, (with much reluctation and more griefe) I hushed vp my said Consultation in silence, and because I could not serve my Prince and Country in that booke of mine: I therefore then renewed my constant resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeale to serue them in my most fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and my most religious and zealous wishes, the which I haue ever since faithfully and constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23382:4"/>Sitting thus to behold the constant inconstancie of the World, which presents as many different accidents to our knowledge, as obiects to our eye; and being iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, vigilant, and attentive, to that which did, or which might any way appertaine to my Soveraigne and his Princely posterity to his Dominions and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; I was enforced to see (O that I had beene so happy as not to haue seen) the perfidious Progresse of <hi>Spaines</hi> new treacheries, and vsurpation vpon many Countries of <hi>Europe</hi>; For first, his Cousine <hi>Leopal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> hath devoured the Dutchy of <hi>Cleaves</hi> and <hi>Iulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> then he and his forces have taken many other fre Townes, and whole Bishopricks in the Counties of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and La <hi>Marcke</hi>; as also in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Swisserland</hi> and <hi>Loraine:</hi> then he and his Factor the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (for him) hath finished his absolute Conquest of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> (that dainty, rich and fertile Prouince of <hi>Germany</hi>) the Dowry of our onely Princesse, the inheritance of the Prince her Husband, and the Patrimony of their Royall issue, wherein the honour of our King, and of his three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kingdomes, doe most extreamely suffer.</p>
            <p>I saw him conquer the cheifest Cities, Forts, and Passages of the Grisons, and hath brought their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and liues to their last gaspe and periode; yea, to the mercilesse mercy of his not generous but bloody
<pb facs="tcp:23382:5"/>
sword; which being vnder the protection of the French King, doth likewise cast a wonderfull staine and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish on the lustre of his honor and Crowne, if he spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take not his revenge thereof; by leauing these his honest Confederates as free as he found them, and as great <hi>Henry</hi> his Father left them. And after the triumphes and treacherous progression of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath now made a body of his, and the Imperiall forces, and this Summer intends to play his bloody prize for the totall ruine and subversion of the Netherlands; who (to the eye of the world, and to humane iudgement) must shortly sink, if the two Kings of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> doe not make them swim; by speedily sending them braue succours and assistance in this their vrgent necessitie.</p>
            <p>And whereunto tends all this treacherous ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and formidable vsurpation and greatnesse of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but to cut out a passage with his sword, and to make his troopes and regiments flye o're the Alpes, for his erecting and obtaining of the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Empire? And whereunto tends it I say, but to make his territories and Dominions to encirculize great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> yea to be their Cloyster, and to make and esteeme those two famous Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, but onely as a fatall Church-yard to burie
<pb facs="tcp:23382:5"/>
and interre themselues in.</p>
            <p>But Illustrious and generous Sirs, is this all the malice and treachery which <hi>Spaine</hi> hath offered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England?</hi> O no, nothing lesse; for vpon that iourney (which was as dangerous as suddaine) of our Prince into <hi>Spaine</hi> (then whom the world hath not a braver:) Hath not the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> dealt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously with him about his match with the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Sister? yea have they not in his Princely person, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the Lawes of Hospitality, and the Priviledges of Princes (when being vnder his own roofe) by attemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting to tye him to formes, which were diametrally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to his honour; yea, to be so audaciously impudent, as with much violency and virulency to seeke to put a rape vpon his Conscience and Religion, in their profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enforcement of his Conversio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Popery; as if their <hi>Infanta</hi> had bin to him more precious then his soule, or that he had beene so wretchedly grounded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in pietie, that his Highnesse would haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken his God, purposely to haue obayed and adored the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who is not, nor cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter King then he is a Prince?</p>
            <p>And to step yet a degree farther; was it not a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish policie, and a diabolicall designe and resolution of the Councell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to advise our Prince vpon his return into <hi>England,</hi> to warre vpon the Protestants;
<pb facs="tcp:23382:6"/>
and to proffer him an Army to suppresse and extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them. The Protestants, I say, who are those by whom our King his Father raigneth, and without whom his Maiestie can never subsist nor raigne; nor his highnesse successively aspire, or hope to aspire to his Crownes and kingdomes after him, sith they are the life, the vigour, the heart, and the soule thereof. And will our King, and our Prince, our Parliaments and our Protestants of <hi>England,</hi> then ever forget this inveterate rage, and infernal malice of <hi>Spain</hi> against them? as also the rest of their imperious and insulting cariage towards his Highnes and towards great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> as if they priz'd it at so low a rate, and made their boundles ambition so excessively over-value their own <hi>Spain?</hi> that that were in the <hi>Crisis</hi> of her weakenes and misery, and this in the prime &amp; verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point of her power and glory? And when his High<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes pressed them for the restitution of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> which they had ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promised to the King his Father, then they temporized so cunningly, and subtillized so treacherously with him, that every day brought forth new delayes and difficulties, till in the end they had made the cure worse then the disease, &amp; having taken firm footing therein, were enforced to vnvaile &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask their dissimulation, and faintly and coldly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they would treate with the Emperour for

the restitution thereof, but could not promise it: Thus having abused, first our King the Father, and then our Prince the Sonne, they have now likewise betrayed and ruined our Princesse the Daughter in their final Conquest, and resolute detention of the Prince her Husbands <hi>Palatinate,</hi> that Princesse I say, whose royal and sublime vertues, make her the honour of her time, the ornament of her sexe, and the Phaenix Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the world. VVhereunto adding the absolute breach of the Match long since prophetically dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, and cast in Heaven by the Princely and Royall Authors of this Consultation, and since the same breach here on earth likewise so happily confirmd by the King, as also by the Prince: so all these premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath not <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> reason to hate <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard <hi>Spaine</hi> hates it? especially because of these two main ensuing points, &amp; important considerations?</p>
            <p>First, for that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is a greater &amp; more professed Enemy to our sacred King &amp; his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all posteritie, then either the Emperour, or Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and is so to be held and esteemed of vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that therefore to denounce warre to him, and to make it good as soone as it is denounced, is as Honourable as necessary, and as iust as honorable for <hi>England;</hi> As vpon New yeares day last I made these two points apparent and manifest to the King; in my Discourse intituled <hi>Votivae Angliae,</hi> which I sent

Confederats vniustly oppressed and ruined, much more his owne Royall children, and that if the <hi>Palatinate</hi> be too farre, that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> are hut the skirts and Suburbs of <hi>England.</hi> Tell him that <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus</hi> said, that words are feminine, and deedes Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, and that it is a great point of honor, discretion, and happinesse for a Prince, to giue the first blowe to his Enemyes. Tell him that Spaniards hate vs; why then should we love them? that we can beate them at our pleasures, why then should we feare them? Tell him that if it goes not well with <hi>Holland,</hi> it must needes goe ill with <hi>England</hi>; and that if wee doe not preuent their ruine, that we cannot secure our owne danger. Tell him that in matters of warre, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to make a stand, shamefull to retire, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to advance. Tell him that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> is of <hi>Pirrhus</hi> his minde, who said, that having devoured and conquered all <hi>Europe,</hi> he would end his dayes in iolity and pleasure in <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And therefore that it is time, yea high time to strike vp our Drums against him, because as well our safety, as our Honour envites vs to it.</p>
            <p>And now turning from his Maiestie, to you the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious and famous body of this great and famous Court of Parliament, (whereof the King is the head) to you, I say, who are the creame and flower of his

            <p>Thinke what a happinesse, what a glory it is for <hi>England</hi> to haue wars with <hi>Spaine,</hi> sith <hi>Spaine</hi> in the Lethargy of our peace, hath very neer vndermined our safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and subverted our glory; And let vs dispell those charmes of security, wherein <hi>England</hi> hath bin too long lull'd and enchanted asleepe: And if feare and pusilanimity yet offer to shut our eies against our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet let our resolution and courage open them to the imminency of our danger; that our glory may surmount our shame, and our swords cut those tongues and pens in pieces, which henceforth dare either to speake of peace, or write of truce with <hi>Spaine.</hi>

            <p>No, no; to take the length of <hi>Spaines</hi> foote aright, we must doe it with our swords, not with our neckes, for the first wil assuredly establish our safety, and the second infalibly ruines.

               <p>HEauen beeing Gods Throne, and Earth his Footstoole, it is impossible any thing can bee here spoken and acted, but wil there be heard, revealed and detected; for not onely our hearts but our thoughts, not only our tongues but our intents, lye open and are obvious &amp; transparent, to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and relucent eyes of Gods most sacred Maiestie, who being the sole Architector, &amp; preseruer both of Heauen and Earth, rules that by his presence, this by his providence, and both by his power; and that we Men are not by many thousand degrees so great in his eyes, as the smallest Pysmires are in ours; who lookes still on our Designes and Actions, sometimes with approbation, now with pitie, then with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and anon with Choller &amp; Indignation, being himselfe the prime Presydent, the great Moderator, the mightie Councellor, the eternall and euerlasting Jehovah; who can and will giue Lawes to all the Kings and Princes of the earth, as they doe to their subjects, by their subordinate, and yet transcendent power, drawn from his most sacred Majestie of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the Starres who actually deriue their light, &amp; borrow their lustre from the refulgent beames, and glorious bodie of the Sun.</p>
               <p>And as this great God seated in his Coelestiall throne of Glory, with his all-seeing and sacred eyes beholds in Heaven the thoughts and actions of men heer on earth, so likewise out of his indulgent mercy and prouidence he likewise giues the same authority

and power to his Angels, Saincts and Martyrs, to do the like; who clad in white Robes, the Ornaments of sanctitie and puritie, with Palme branches in their hands the Emblems of Peace and Ioy, and Crownes and Coronets on their heads, the rewards and marks of Glory. Follow the Lamb Christ Iesus wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he goe, still singing these joyful <hi>Io Peans</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalamians</hi> of <hi>Haleluiah,</hi> and Glory be to God on High, Peace on Earth, and good will towards men.</p>
               <p>By vertue of which Deuine priuiledges, the maske of <hi>Spaines</hi> boundlesse Ambition being discouered &amp; pulled off, in supporting the Pope, &amp; seeking the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of his spirituall Iurisdiction, whereby his Holinesse in Exchange, may enlarge that of <hi>Spaines</hi> temporall Monarchy, so as that shall haue feet to goe, and these wings to flie to the height of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatnesse; whereby the <hi>Catholike</hi> Kings ayme, out of the ruines of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to erect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Empire in the West, and endeauour by degrees to make most of the Kingdomes and Free Estates of <hi>Europe</hi> become Provinces unto <hi>Spaine</hi>; as, some by force, some by policie, some by treachery, and now <hi>England</hi> by the Match of the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Daughter, with our most Illustrious and Royall Prince <hi>Charles</hi> (next to his Royall Father King <hi>Iames,</hi> our most Dread Soueraigne) the hope of <hi>Englands</hi> life, and the life of its Ioy and hope.</p>
               <p>I say the newes of these projects and resolutions of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing with as much fortunary as celeritie) passed the Clouds, and pierced the vaults and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of Heaven, it fast arriued there, to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of that immortall maiden Queen <hi>Elizebeth,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:23382:11"/>
whose heart ever loued <hi>England</hi> as her soule did Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and of whose flourishing welfare and prosperity I cannot truly averre, whether she still remayne more jealous or ambitious; Whereat grieuing with as much disdaine, as she disdained with griefe, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her Nephew and God-sonne Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> participated and burned in her zeale, that the insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable and bloud-thirsty Ambition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> might not erect his Trophees vpon the Tombe of <hi>Englands</hi> downfall, and the ruines of her subversion, she spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acquaints him with it; whom although Heaven had purified and devested of his Earthly passions, yet such was this young Prince, his never dying zeale to <hi>Englands</hi> ever living Glory, that his Highness could not refraine from looking red with anger, and pale with feare, at the report &amp; knowledge thereof. They consult hereon, and hold it both expedient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to acquaint other <hi>English</hi> Princes herewith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially those whom they knew stood deeply and sincerely affected to <hi>England.</hi> So Prince <hi>Henry</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints his Mother Queen <hi>Anne</hi> herewith, &amp; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Brother King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and both they their Father King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. who so upon advise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could not refraine to looke on <hi>England</hi> with the eyes of affection and pitie, and on <hi>Spaine</hi> with those of indignation and contempt. So these fiue great Princes and Queens prepare themselues to Consult on this most important busines, when loe they are suddenly met and assayled, with a doubt of no mean consequence and consideration <hi>viz.</hi> Whether, or no they should admit and receiue Queen <hi>Mary</hi> into this their Consultation, whom not her <hi>Roman</hi> merits, but

the praiers, of the <hi>Protestants</hi> had brought to Heauen; When at first they considring that in heart &amp; soule, she alwaies loved, and preferred <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>England</hi>; they resolved to exclude her, but at last (upon riper and more mature deliberation) conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that she knew many secrets of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereof peradventure they were ignorant; as also that from her innate &amp; inveterate malice to <hi>England,</hi> she might (either in jest or earnest) bewray somthing that might turne and redound to the good of <hi>England,</hi> they all consented she should bee advertised hereof, and so admitted; which was instantly performed; and as the rest of these Royall Princes envied <hi>Spaines</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and pitied <hi>Englands</hi> dangers; So to speak the truth, and no more, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (still resembling herselfe) both in her speeches and lookes testified the contrary; Vowing that as she loued <hi>Philip</hi> the II. the Father, so shee would still honour <hi>Philip</hi> the III. his Sonne.</p>
               <p>Thus these three Princes and three Queenes, not daring to consult in Heaven on any thing, without permission of the Superiour powers, they all reprayre to the sacred throne of the Lambe, (of that Great Maker and conducter of Heaven and earth) whose Tribunall is environed with more sparkling and bvr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sunnes, then we see Starres in the Firmament; and who is waited and atended on by many millons and Maryades of Angels; Where in signe of Gods glory and their humilitie, these Royall personages fall on their faces to his blessed feet, and so proffer vp their Petition to his heauenly Majestie to haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and place given them to Consult on this

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> O the <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings are too wise to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such grosse Errours of State, as to restore; for it is Conquest and Possession, and no way restitution, which affoords them best melody; Besides, sith they are the <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings, they cannot be irreligious much lesse vncharitable.</p>

                  <hi>Q.M.</hi> Sure Sister you wrong the Duke of <hi>Ossuna,</hi> and in him king <hi>Philip</hi> his Maister; for I haue heard that the said Duke did then Arme vpon newes of a great Fleet of Gallyes comming from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> vpon the irruption of intelligence betwixt the great Turke and the French King, for the eseape of the Polonian Prince <hi>Coreski</hi>: for the which the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Sancy,</hi> the French Ambassadour was at least confined, if not imprisoned at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and that therfore for the safety of the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved the said Duke to fortifie his Ports of <hi>Apulia, Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranto,</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> as well with Fleets as Regiments.</p>

                  <hi>P.H.</hi> The King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Ministers never want pretexts and evasions for their designes; but if the Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> for affirming hereof, should sweare <hi>Botta Dios,</hi> and <hi>par la Sanctissiam Virgina,</hi> till he were damn'd, yet that wise Senate, &amp; especially the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Tenn,</hi> will never beleeve him.</p>

                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. The <hi>Austrian</hi> Princes, and the <hi>Swissers,</hi> I haue still heard, are from Father to Sonne, hereditary and irreconcilable Enemies.</p>

                  <hi>P. H.</hi> Yea, the Swissers draw good vse and benefit hereof; for by this meanes they live not in security as some other States doe; but are still armed and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to march and follow their Colours.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.M.</hi> Yea, but the Councell of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath policy enough, to insinuate and temporize with all these Princes and States; and so to divert their Designes, and frustrate their resolutions, if they were bent that way.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.E.</hi> Yes, two wayes, next <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Leopaldus,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Losanna</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> in the free County by the Archduke <hi>Albertus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> Yes many times, but that tricke of <hi>Spaine</hi> is now growne olde and thrid-bare; so as the Swissers vowe to remedy the first, and the French Kings to

               <p>P. <hi>H</hi> When <hi>Great Henry of France (my honoured Vncle)</hi> made warres vpon the present <hi>Duke of Sauoy</hi> for the recouery of his <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Saluses,</hi> then this <hi>Phillip King of Spaine,</hi> (vnder the pretence and shewe to ayd the <hi>Duke</hi> his brother in Lawe against the <hi>French</hi>) sent him many troopes and <hi>Regiments</hi> of <hi>Spanyards</hi> for the preseruation of his <hi>State</hi>; when the <hi>peace</hi> being made betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the exchange for <hi>Saluses,</hi> with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes of <hi>Bresse</hi> and <hi>Gex</hi> ratified and acomplished; These <hi>Spanish Regiments</hi> being quartered in <hi>Carbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieres, Mountemellion, Savillan, Pignoroll</hi> and other places of <hi>Sauoy</hi> &amp; <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they vpon no reqvest or assommons made them by the <hi>Duke,</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence, but being commaunded the Contrary by the <hi>Count de Fuentes (Viceroy of Millan)</hi> as he was from the <hi>King</hi> his Master from <hi>Spaine,</hi> they peremptorily resolued and vowed to keepe firme footing which they along time did, vntill at last that wise &amp; <hi>Valiant Duke</hi> being thereunto constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the securitie of his estate, whose emmynent and vtter subuersion he apparantly sawe before his eyes, he very nobly cutt all their throates.</p>
               <p>H. 8. Beleeue me his <hi>Highnesse of Sauoy</hi> did well, for it was an act most worthy of his iudgement and generositie.</p>

               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Noe <hi>Madame,</hi> for although the <hi>Duke</hi> winke, and seemes (with father <hi>Aubigny</hi>) to haue the art of forgettfullness; yet he well remembers, how <hi>Don Iuan de Taxis Spaines Ambassadour in France</hi>) told <hi>Lullins, Arconas,</hi> and <hi>Alimes,</hi> his <hi>Highnesse Ambassadours</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> that the <hi>Kinge</hi> his master would Contribute towards the <hi>Exchange</hi> of the marquisat of <hi>Saluces,</hi> conditionally it remayned on that side the <hi>Alpes</hi> from the <hi>French</hi>; and since how his <hi>Catholique Maiestie</hi> hath performed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Why? who was the Avthor and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the League, but first Spaine, then the Pope, and next the Devill.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> O that was onely to preserue Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and the Catholique Religion, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate and roote out Heretiques, and was not this well done of the King of Spaine, sith he is the Catholique King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. Nay, now the least child in France knowes that Religion was onely the pretext, but Empire and Dominion the obiect of that League. How else dared <hi>Mendoza</hi> (Spaines Ambassadour in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris seeke the Crowne of France for the Infanta of Spaine, or how els dared the Iesuites his ministers, in their seditious Sermons, and pernicious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets aduance her right to the Crowne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when God and the world knowes shee had none to it.</p>
               <p>Q. M. Why, it was when God had caused that good Fryer <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> to kill that bad King <hi>Henry</hi> the third at Saint <hi>Clou,</hi> and when indeede that Kingdome was without a head, and then the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had reason to aduance his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Title to <hi>France,</hi> in right of her mother <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> (that Queene of Peace) notwithstanding the fundamentall power of the Salique Law to the contrary.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:23382:24"/>H. 8.

               </p>
               <p>Q.M. It was the <hi>Dukes of Mayene, Mercuaeur</hi> who drewe the <hi>King of Spayne</hi> to assist the <hi>League,</hi> and in it <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> No, No, Contrariewise it was the <hi>Kinge of Spayne,</hi> that debouchd and drewe these two <hi>Dukes,</hi> and with them almost all the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> to forge and contriue this League, and in it to ruine <hi>France</hi>: for already <hi>France</hi> was almost <hi>Spayne,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> had vndoubtedly borne the <hi>Crowne</hi>: If <hi>Great Henry</hi> his <hi>Victorious</hi> sword had not pulld off <hi>Spaynes</hi> maske, and so cutt her <hi>Title</hi> and its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. M. But see the equitie and <hi>Iustice of King Phillipe,</hi> for when <hi>Henry</hi> that Heretique <hi>King</hi> came to the Crowne, he restored him <hi>Calais, Dourlans, Valencienes, Blauet,</hi> and all other townes and <hi>Castles</hi> which he had formerly wonne and Conquered in <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>Q. M. Nay, obserue farther how religious <hi>King Phillip</hi> was (in imitation of <hi>King Agesilaus</hi>) for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23382:25"/>
hee kept his <hi>Fayth</hi> inuiolable towards <hi>Henry</hi> IIII although he were an heretique <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Nay obserue how irreligiously and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Kinge Phillip</hi> was to <hi>King Henry</hi> 4.

               </p>
               <p>P.<hi>H.</hi> Yea, that <hi>Spayne</hi> knew full well, for when the <hi>French Iesuites his Ministers</hi> had vnlocked the mistery they like bloody Schoole-masters, soe diuelishlie instructed and fortified that monster of men <hi>Rauilliack</hi> (their execrable and damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple) that hee soone sent him hither in a bloody Coffin.</p>
               <p>Q.M. But you will not say that the <hi>King of Spayne</hi> was accessary to <hi>Henry</hi> 4. his murther.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> No, but I will say that if the truth were knowne, the opening of that veine would make many great Birds, yea and many learned ones too, bleede themselues to death, and peraduenture the

               <p>Q.<hi>A.</hi> The Marshall of <hi>Lauerdin</hi> whistered mee a word concerning this, which I shall neuer forget, onely hee requested my secrecie therein: so the King of Spaines <hi>Larma,</hi> and the Queene Mother of France her <hi>D' Anchre,</hi> his <hi>Mariana,</hi> and her <hi>Cotton</hi> shall giue me leaue to thinke.</p>
               <p>Q. M. Questionlesse it were the sinnes of that King, and the finger of Heauen that cut off the threed of his life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Questionlesse you are deceiued Sister, for it were the sinnes of France who made the Knife, and the treasons of Spaine and Rome which made that Parricide <hi>Rauilliack</hi> performe.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> This is faire to the eye of the world, but it will bee excellent if the End of these matches proue fortunate for France.</p>

               <p>P.<hi>H.</hi> A very great traine, for Monsieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais</hi> (the French Embassadour with the King my Father) told mee that Monsieur <hi>de Bonelle</hi> (Master of the Ceremonies to the French King) reported, that when the first of them were entring <hi>Paris</hi> at St. <hi>Iaques</hi> Gate, that the last were but comming downe the <hi>Pyrene</hi> Mountaines.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> But what did all this rabble of Spaniards doe in France?</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23382:26"/>
and consequently a bridge and passage for the King their Master to enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. But how did the Parliaments, the Privie Councell, and the Nobilitie of France brooke and digest this?</p>
               <p>Q <hi>E.</hi> Yea, that is a question of State indeed.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> As for the Parliaments, and Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, many of them are so Iesuitiz'd, as they are Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in heart, though French in tongue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were so farre from preuenting, as they gaue way to it, onely for the Princes and Nobilitie (some few excepted) they (resembling themselues) vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and swore, that their swords should cut the Pens and Tongues in pieces of any Spaniard whatsoever, that dar'd propose or attempt it, for they spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud and affirm'd, the <hi>Florentines</hi> had taught them wit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. A braue resolution of the French Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; for the greatest of a State haue alwayes the greatest interest in the State; those Princes and Nobles are therefore highly to be applauded and praised: and such of the Privie Councell and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament who tacitely are delinquents, and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to their Prince and Countrey, deserue to bee found out, arraigned, and sacrificed to the good of the Common-weale, either with a sword, or a halter.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But, what said the Clergie of France to this?</p>
               <p>Q.<hi>E.</hi> Sister, it is to be fear'd, as you wish &amp; desire.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Why they out of passionate zeale, more then of zealous and sollid iudgement, approue of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23382:27"/>
any Match for their King, so it be not with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, and yet of none so well as of this with Spaine; Demand their reason and they will answer you (with as much vehemency as ignorance) that the King of Spaine is the Catholique King, and if you come further to particularize, they reply, that their Cardinalls (who indeede are onely the Popes Creatures) shall deliver more at the estates Generall: So the Clergie bad the Spaniards well-come into France.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But where are the Fire-brands and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries of the State, the French Iesuites, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are the Fistulaes and Botches of a State, what entertainment gaue they to the young Queene and her Spaniards?</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Surely Aunt, they crouched very low to the Queene; but in <hi>Cottons</hi> absence <hi>Arnoux</hi> and <hi>Berrulla</hi> (their Tongue and Eare) whispered so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to her Maiestie, that I could neither gather nor vnderstand what they said, but I guest at it; onely they gaue faire words and actions to all the Spaniards in generall; and to the nobler and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort of them in particular, they ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to keepe curious correspondence with the Catholique King, to whom they affirmed and swore by their <hi>Semi-God,</hi> and sole Patron <hi>Ignatius Loyolla,</hi> they would beare true observance, as the Marigold doth to the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Are not these two Iesuites the French Kings ordinary Preachers, and yet dare they doe it?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Although <hi>Berrulla</hi> be the Father of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23382:27"/>
yet he is in heart and soule a Iesuite, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noux</hi> is the Arch-Iesuite of France, and the Kings Confessor, and yet they dare, and will doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. But how did the Queene Regent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the Spaniards:</p>

But <hi>Sillery</hi> and <hi>Du Vair</hi> loue Spaine so well, as their courages are so mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, that though they see their errours in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading these Matches, yet they rather persist then acknowledge it, for like good cleere-sighted States-men, they haue witte enough to beare vpp with the time, for otherwise they know the times will not beare them vp.</p>

                  <hi>Q. M.</hi> But how did the Commons of France entertaine the Spaniards?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. E.</hi> Truely I thinke they will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to like the fashion of the little Hatte, and great set Ruffe.</p>

               <p>P. H. If we may iudge of <hi>Hercules</hi> by his foote, so we then may of <hi>France,</hi> by those of <hi>Paris</hi>) which is the eye, the heart, the soule thereof (where the Citizens in all streetes, and especially the Lakeyes at the Lovrre gate, and the new bridge, still salute the Spaniards as they passe by, by these courteous Epithites, <hi>Boracho, Pantalones,</hi> and <hi>Bouriques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>H. 8. How long remained all these Spaniards in France?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:23382:28"/>Q. <hi>M.</hi> So long I warrant you, vntill they did all their Kings businesse, and their owne too before they departed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> In truth so long, till all France was weary, and distasted of them and their proceedings, yea, so many yeares, that at last the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell were in a manner constrained to send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by an Edict, as they themselues, not many yeares since, did the Moores.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> The banishing of the Moores was a good and wholesome counsell of Spaine.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> And I assure you Sister the sending home of the Spaniards was an excellent one of France, for vpon the matter, they were but spyes, moaths and drones, and would haue proved so to France if they had continued there longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. But were they all sent home, and none left at the Court of France to giue, and receiue pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets to and fro for the Iesuits, the King of Spaines Factors and Agents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. E.</hi> O, no assure your selfe, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Spaine is too wise to commit so grosse and palpable an errour of State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> Therefore to cast the thicker mist, and to put the better varnish on the businesse, The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse <hi>De la Tour</hi> was left there with the title of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernesse to the young Queene, and there is as much correspondencie betwixt her and <hi>Don Ferdinand de Geron</hi> (the Ambassador of Spaine) as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the French Iesuites.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Thus <hi>Spayne</hi> leaues alwaies a Sting behind him, and I feare <hi>France</hi> will in the end find it so.</p>

                  <hi>Q. M.</hi> Whereon is your suspition, and feare grounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. A.</hi> Vpon the apparant symptomes of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, Feuer,</hi> or Consumption of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. You say right Madam, and the Noblest and truest hearted <hi>French-men</hi> participate of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; For the Iesuites (beeing the Popes Factors, and the King of <hi>Spaynes</hi> Oracles and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents) haue already corrupted the Parliaments and Priuie Councell, who should bee her <hi>Illium &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocorynth.</hi> They haue vndermyned and ruinated the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> heeretofore her <hi>Palladium,</hi> once the Queene of <hi>Vniuersities:</hi> Who now as a mournefull Widdow, sits with her hayre dandling about her eares, and her teares trickling downe her cheekes, liuing onely in her shaddow or Ghost, or rather in her ruines; for her Genius and Soule, hath alreadie made a transmigration to <hi>Clermont</hi>-House; Yea, and to speake true <hi>French,</hi> in our <hi>English</hi> tongue, they by their diuelish <hi>Aphorismes</hi> and bloodie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions (vnder a false &amp; hypocriticall shew of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Pietie) doe poyson and corrupt the Youth and prime Witts of <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did the Springs and Fountaines in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Also, the Clergie of <hi>France,</hi> degenerates from its Pristine candor and zeale to the good of <hi>France,</hi> and the glory of the <hi>French</hi> Church, for they receiue Lawes from the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> and the Iesuites, to whome they should giue them. How else at the last generall Estates of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the assemblie of Notables at <hi>Rouen?</hi> were they so vnwise, dishonest and cowardly, to referre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23382:29"/>
to the two Cardinalls <hi>Perron</hi> and <hi>Gondye</hi>? who like good Cardinalls, but bad French-men (having onely their Bodies in France, but their Hearts at Rome) in thankfulnes to the Pope for their red Hatts, forgat themselues and their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance so much, as to prostitute and debase that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crowne and flourishing Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> to be dependant to Rome in Temporall matters, notwithstanding the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> and the prerogatiues of the Crowne &amp; Church of France, to the contrary; whereat the Popes Nuncio at Paris laught with open mouth: So did the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinalls, and the Pope himselfe at Rome; and likewise the <hi>Catholike King</hi> in Spaine, with all that huge rabble of Iesuites, whiles all the Kings, Soveraigne Princes, and Free Estates of Europe (Spaine and Italie excepted) grieued and lamented at it, with as much shame as wonder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. Indeed these are two maine points &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that the greatnesse and generosity of France declynes, and that Rome and Spaine will shortly shuffle the Cards so well, as it must needs bee made a Province to Spaine; for they both haue consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and finde, that what could not be effected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reigne of old <hi>Henrie,</hi> may in these of young King <hi>Lewes</hi> his Sonne.</p>
               <p>P. H. It is not impossible, rather likely, for France abounds in a monstrous height of Pride and Sinne, And the old Cleargie of France admit of so many new orders of Fryers and Nuns, that almost all is out of order; and the seuenteene Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions which the Duke of <hi>Suilly</hi> left by accompt to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23382:29"/>
the Queene Regent, is all long since spent, and twice seventeene more. So as although the <hi>Polleta</hi> be still on foote, <hi>Monopolyes</hi> never so rife, the <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> or Exchequer drawne dry, and exhausted; yet the King is extreamely in debt to his Nobilitie and Pensioners; and is not this Musicke for the King of Spaine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Had Great <hi>Henry</hi> liued, he would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied and preuented these calamities.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> But his Sonne King <hi>Lewes</hi> is not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie to doe it, no nor his Creator, the Duke of <hi>Luynes</hi> so discreet and honest to aduise and councell him therevnto.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> The neglect thereof may make one, or both of them to repent it, and peradventure the Kingdome too; for alreadie the Commons grieue hereat, and the Nobilitie would, but cannot remedy it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Spaine loues France, therefore France need not feare Spaine.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> The <hi>Panthers</hi> skin is faire, yet his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is fatall, and his breath infectious.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Indeed if France loued not Spaine, it need not feare it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> loues King <hi>Lewes</hi> dearely.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Not halfe so well as he loues his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of France.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> In truth France hath reason to haue a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant eye ore Spaine, for as long as shee sleepes in her bed of pleasure and securitie, perhaps one of these dayes, Spaines Ambition may awake her with Drumme, Trumpet, and Cannon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:23382:30"/>P. <hi>H.</hi> O no, not as yet, for if the King of Spaine were so ill aduised, his Councell is not; for they like old experienced Foxes; will never permit him to discover himselfe, much lesse his Resolutions, and least of all his Ambition and sword, vntill the Sunne hath attaynd the Meridian.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> I know not what my Nephew meanes by this Mathematicall Riddle.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> I was never greatly skild in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes, and yet consuming my Youth, Yeares, and Cares for England, I haue reason to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his knowledge. Wherefore Sister, sith he is a Noble and famous Prince, let vs heare him, for he hath some mystery to reveale twixt France and Spaine.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> He loues France, and hates Spaine, and which is worse, he was an Heretique, therefore his tongue can make no Spherall Melodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. But his Heresie hath brought him hether to Heaven tho, and he is a famous and Noble Prince: therefore Cosen <hi>Wales</hi> speake on, of France and Spaine, for now we are all resolved to heare you.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> I gaue him my Fathers name, and he inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth my resolution and courage, and the King his Fathers wisedome, therefore he can neither flatter nor dissemble.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Speake on <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Know all men by these Presents, that if Spaine did see the Heart and Bowels of France weltring in its bloud, and flaming in the fire of an intestine Civill-warre, if it did see the Princes

banded against the King, or the King against the Protestants, these riffeling of the Lovare, and of Paris, and his Maiestie beseiging of Rochell, Sancerre, Sedan, Nismes, or Saumury, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Warre to all those of that Religion. If it did see sixteene Parisian Tribunes, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Court of Parliament prisoners to the Bastille, and Chastellets the rebellious Baryca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and a bloudie Massacre in Paris; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in all the Cities of the Kingdome, if hee did see some Princes of the bloud (or two great Dukes, as were <hi>Du Mayene</hi> and <hi>Merury</hi>) Captivating and Deboshing the obedience and affections of the French Nobilitie, Cleargie and Commons, and covering their pernitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes and trecherous attempts, vnder the Cloake of the holy League; If it did see Calais, Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Amiens, Montdidier, Valencienes, Blauet, and Croyden, or other strong Cities; or Forts of France, bearing out the redd ragged Crosse in stead of the three yellow Flower Deluces, and a second <hi>Mendoza</hi> for his Ambassadour, sate as premier President, and Oracle in the Lovare, Towne-house and Parliament, That then <hi>Phillip</hi> the III. of Spaine loues his Sonne in Law <hi>Lewes</hi> the thirteene of France so well, that he would vse him as King <hi>Phillip</hi> the second had an eager desire, and had almost done great <hi>Henry</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Q. M. Why how was that?</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But wee see strange alterations in the Court of France, for some dare, but will not, and others would, but dare not informe the King hereof.</p>

it, or that he cannot reduce them to obedience, by ending these warres with more fortunacie, and lesse danger and dammage.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Nay Sister, it is pittie that these two Kings of Spaine, and the Archduke <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Isabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> haue from time to time beene so ambitious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane, cruell, and revengefull, to drowne the face of the Netherlands with many deluges of blood, in seeking to preserue their libertie, liues, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from the cruell Tyranny and Inquisition of Spaine.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Indeed for this fortie yeares the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands hath beene the Schoole and Theatre of <hi>Mars,</hi> whereon there hath beene more braue Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and renowned Captaines slaine, then in any Country of the world, or in many precedent Ages; and yet all this blood is not capable to quench Spaines Ambition and Tyranny in seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure those Provinces.</p>

               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> O yes very lately, for whilst Spaine is Spaine, Holland will never forget how neere hee was to haue extinguished her libertie, and surprized their State, by infecting and corrupting their Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> a man of so profound wit, and deepe iudgement and experience in matters of State, as he was not onely the Oracle of the Netherlands, but the Ornament and Wonder of <hi>Europe,</hi> yea of his time.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> See, see the fruites of Spaines Gold, and the effects of his boundlesse Ambition, for it is a common custome with him, if not by the mayne, yet surely by the bye, to breake the necke of great Princes, and free Estates, publique Ministers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are great Souldiers or great Statesmen, or both.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Yea, the Web of this Treason was so

cunningly wouen, and so subtilly and finely spun, as if the Netherlands had not broken <hi>Barnevelts</hi> necke, he long ere this had assuredly broken the necke both of their libertie and State.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Well <hi>Barnavelt</hi> is gone, and now Spaine needs not feare his pollicie.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Nay, <hi>Barnavelt</hi> being dead, and <hi>Maurice</hi> that famous Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> liuing, Holland need not feare either the trechery, or force of Spaine.</p>

               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> But the Hollanders had Ships enough of their owne, and Gold, Silver, and Men from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, therefore they disdaine to feare Spaine, nay, rather they vow before the next Summer to make Spaine feare them.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> The King of Spaine is too religious to authorise so execrable a Murther.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> When England hath lost her selfe shee can lose no more.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But Sister, your death was the death of the Popes hopes, and of Spaines pretences to England.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> But they both seeme to reviue and bud forth afresh, if the Match betweene my noble Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther P. <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Infanta of Spaine take effect.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> May Heauen deny the first, and the King your Father never consent to the second.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> So shall Spaine euer feare England, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer England Spaine.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But I hope the contrary; for in these dayes the King of Spaines Gold and his Embassadour Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> act wonders in England.</p>

                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Hath <hi>Gondomar</hi> propounded this match to King <hi>Iames?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> O long since, and he hath vowed to weare out his red leather Coach, and greene buckeram Litter, but he will see an end of it this Parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> I thought indeede it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that he makes <hi>Aesops Fables</hi> his daily pocket guest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. How doth King <hi>Iames</hi> relish this match.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> His Exchequer is poore, and King <hi>Philips</hi> Indies riches, and therefore his Maiestie likes it so well, as he will hearken to no other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. How doth Prince <hi>Charles</hi> himselfe like this motion?</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> I know not how my Brother likes it, but for my part, I should ever haue preferred a Daughter of <hi>France</hi> to that of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and I hope the match will not succeed, because my Noble Brother Prince <hi>Charles</hi> is wise, valiant, and generous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. But how doth the braue and graue <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> savour this Spanish match?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Few loue it, most feare it, But as the match, so the <hi>Parliament</hi> is not yet ended.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> This would be Musicke indeede for the Romane Catholikes of <hi>England,</hi> if it should take effect; for the very first newes thereof, made them flappe their wings, as if they were readie to crowe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Yea, for they hope, and which is more, they know, that if it proue a match, That the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> will soone introduce the Masse, and Vsher in the Pope; therefore they haue reason to reioyce at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:23382:39"/>P. <hi>H.</hi> But if the King of Spaine will not giue the summe which my Father King <hi>Iames</hi> demands, will not they make it vp?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> It is probable and credible, That their Holy Father the Pope and themselues will stretch both their purses and credits to knit the match.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Why? hath <hi>Gondomar</hi> such power with King <hi>Iames,</hi> to hope to see this match effected?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> O yes; for his Maiestie saith, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is an honest King, and he a wise Servant: The first all the world knowes; and the second, I hope England shall shortly feele, at least, if all hookes take.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Indeed if <hi>Gondomar</hi> can effect this match, it is the direct way for him to be a <hi>Grande</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to procure a red Hat for his Sonne, or Nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Was the Duke of <hi>Monteleone</hi> so rewarded for his <hi>French</hi> matches.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Why then Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> need not feare, for he hath as much policie as the Duke of <hi>Montele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> though not so much ostentation.</p>

                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Who made and concluded the match with King <hi>Philip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> My selfe, and the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Nay Sister, put in <hi>Woolsey</hi> and <hi>Gardyner,</hi> and leaue out the Parliament; for you onely proposed it them but for forme, and had secretly concluded it before hand your selfe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Suppose I did, I might doe it of mine owne authoritie, and prerogatiue Royall.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But you offred no faire play to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

though, in asking their aduise when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts were ready to be sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But I had reason to follow mine owne Iudgement, not their Passions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Nay, nay Daughter, you contrariwise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your own passion, not their Iudgements, &amp; so God gaue limits to <hi>Philips</hi> Ambition, and your owne desires, by making you forsake earth, &amp; he England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. But wise King <hi>Iames</hi> is opposite to my Sister <hi>Mary,</hi> aswel in Religion as sexe; and therfore I hope, nay, I assure my selfe, he will first consult this match with his Parliament, ere he conclude it with Spaine.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> If the voice of the Parliament be free, and not enforced, I make no doubt but the Pope, the King of <hi>Spaine, Gondomar,</hi> and all our Recusants will come short of their hopes for the match.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Daughter, what benefits proposed you to the Parliament, by your match with Spaine?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Strength, Profit, Honour, which <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Prince <hi>Charles</hi> will likewise now find if the match hold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. As for strength, if England would know its selfe, it need not expect or hope for any from <hi>Spaine:</hi> for <hi>Spaines</hi> assistance hath alwayes proued fatall and ruinous, to those who haue vsed it; And if England would assume the ancient generositie of her Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and forsake her new fangled pride, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, Wee know it is strong enough to beate Spaine, and all his Kingdomes and Prouinces, &amp; no way so weake, to feare that Spaine should make Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23382:40"/>
and Englishmen, if they wore worse cloathes, and had better hearts and swords, and if they were more martiall and lesse effeminate.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> For Profit, what Indies are richer then <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi> For if England want money, her selfe is still more powerfull and capable to inrich it selfe, if it would be lesse vaine, and more fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and industrious, &amp;c. What is a fewe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds to England, if England be thereby exposed to the danger of Spaine? or that it be againe fetcht from them by the Bye, as it was brought in by the Mayne? for was profit ever cheape when it was bought with losse and repentance, with teares and bloud? or shall not euery Ducket be weighed and counterpoised downe with a farre greater preiudice and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency: for if the Match hold, will not our Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants looke a-loofe? will not <hi>Spaniards</hi> be so ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously insolent, to attempt to out-looke <hi>English?</hi> will not the Pope steale in by degrees, and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> breake in either like a Torrent or a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, when his Factors and Agents haue made all things ripe and in a readinesse? will this be <hi>Englands</hi> profit?</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> For Honour, England and Scotland were free, Royall, and ancient Monarchies; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Spaine was not Spaine, but dis-ioynted and dissevered Provinces: yea, for Pompe, State, and Glory, our Princes were Kings, when their Kinges were scarce Princes, nor their Princes Nobles: Therefore GREAT BRITAINE

by the Match can conferre and adde honour to <hi>Spaine</hi>; but not <hi>Spaine</hi> to GREAT BRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINE.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> I could neuer yet affect the Match of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for either of the two Princes my Sonnes: for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is by nature as trecherous as proud, and although <hi>Northampton</hi> perswaded me thereto, yet I loued true-hearted <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted me from it; as (in the depth of his Allegiance, and the profunditie of his wisedome &amp; Iudgement) well fore-seeing they would proue fatall and ruinous to <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. It is strange to see with what insatiable desire and Ambition, <hi>Spaine</hi> couets <hi>England</hi>; for he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie attempted it by treachery, by force, and now by the Match of his Daughter the <hi>Infanta</hi> to Prince <hi>Charles.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> You meane King <hi>Philip</hi> the 2. and not this present King <hi>Philip</hi> the 3; And as <hi>Don Iuan de Taris</hi> (the Ambassadour of Spaine) told King <hi>Iames</hi> at his first comming to the Crowne of England, that the Ambition and malice of Spaine to England, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Prince, and was interred and buryed with him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But was this King <hi>Philip</hi> the third and his Councell neuer acquainted with that horrible Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Treason, whereby it was intended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, that <hi>England</hi> should haue beene blowne vp, ouerthrowne, and ruined in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> O no, he is too Catholike a King to haue hearkened, much lesse to haue approued that Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate plot.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> You infinitely wrong the Pope, and King of Spaine, to suspect, much lesse to beleeue, that they were acquainted with that Powder-plot.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> No: went not <hi>Faulkes</hi> (that hellish Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary) once to <hi>Rome</hi> about it, and the younger <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> twice to <hi>Vallidolide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Yea, about some other businesse it may be, although I must confesse it was very immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before that Treason was discouered.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H. Gondomar</hi> told me, that both the Pope and King of Spaine abhord that Treason.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> I feare they abhord it, for griefe it tooke not effect.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> If euer this King <hi>Philip</hi> hated England, yee may be sure now he loues it; for else he would neuer seeke to match his Daughter to it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> What force and trechery cannot effect, now affection in the match shall. Wherein King <hi>Philip</hi> is of <hi>Lysanders</hi> minde, who when the Lyons skinne will not serue, he will sowe on a peece of the Foxes tayle.</p>

               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> So the Daughter come not into England, England neede not feare the comming of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> will beate his head and his horse shoes, but he will bring in the Daughter,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23382:41"/>
and already his hopes &amp; the probabilities are great, for hee is exceeding great and familiar with King <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Else he could neuer haue gotten open the Prisons-doores for the Romane Priests and Iesuites.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Nor haue made <hi>Rauleighs</hi> head to caper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his body.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Nor haue kept backe an Armie from my Sonne and Daughter, the King and Queene of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> when so many hundred thousand valiant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Souldiers desired and longed to haue serued them in their warres.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Nor haue shipt away so great a quantitie of Ordnance for Spaine, which one of these dayes will returne Bullets to our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. Nor haue procured a gallant Fleete to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the coast of <hi>Spaine,</hi> against the Turkish Pyrates, vnder coulour of going to <hi>Argier</hi> and <hi>Barbary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.<hi>H.</hi> That Fleete was fitter to haue gone to <hi>Mexico.</hi>

               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> So indeed it might haue returned with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Gold, whereas now I feare it will with losse and repentance, I will not say with shame.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> I know by Experience, it is an excellent thing for England to fight with Spaniards, but not to ioyne with Spaniards against others.</p>

                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. O but England, neere this twentie yeares hath lost those golden times of going to the gardens of <hi>Hesperides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> And now Holland after ten yeares tryall, and patience, resolues to finde them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Now we speake of Holland: It againe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly grieues me, that England goes from Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in that it will not protect it against Spaine.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> And truely it is my ioy and comfort to vnderstand it; for the farther England goes from Holland, I am sure the neerer Spaine comes to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</p>
               <p>P.<hi>H.</hi> Nay, if the match hold, Holland can expect no assistance from England; for the Pope, the King of Spaine, <hi>Gondomar,</hi> the Iesuits, and English Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, will in few yeares so shuffle &amp; deale the Cards, as England shall not be able to assist her selfe, much lesse her Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E</hi> 6. Why that is the way, in a few more yeares, to make England a Province to Spaine.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>E.</hi> Yea, yea, there is the mysterie; for if the Match with Spaine hold, the Conquest of England will vndoubtedly follow, and then <hi>Gondomar</hi> can be no lesse then <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> or great Commander of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for the King and Councell of Spaine will iudge him worthy of this honour, because he hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> It were better Spaine were hell, and <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> Vice-roy to the Diuell, as he is now Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to the Catholike King.</p>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:23382:42"/>Q. <hi>A.</hi> But is it possible that the King of Spaine hath so little Iustice and Charitie, and so much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and Ambition to desire it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. The Kings of Spaine make this the tenth Article of their Creede, that the Rules of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and State ought to giue Lawes, but not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But this is contrary to the Lawes of the KING of Kings.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But in the Councell of Spaine, the Rules of State are alwayes too sublime and powerfull for those of Religion; yea, the Pope will easily dispence with the King of Spaine, to make a Conquest of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, either by trechery, hostilitie, or the match: for it is against an heretike King and People, who refuse to enter into the bosome of the Church, &amp; therefore lawfull in it selfe; because it tends to the Catholike cause, the displanting and rooting out of Heretikes, and the establishing &amp; preservation of the Romane Catholikes in England.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Those giddie and passionate Romane Catholikes of England, who desire to fish in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters, who delight in nothing but in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and noueltie, and who make a May-game of Conscience, and an Ape of Religion, may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture flatter themselues with the false sunne-shine of these hopes; but those of them whose hearts are better lodged, and whose eyes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can see farther and clearer, Those I say, who know by the Lawes of Grace and Nature, what they owe to GOD, to their lawfull Prince,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23382:43"/>
and Countrie; those remember, that the Duke of <hi>Medina Sydonia</hi> sayd in eightie eight (who was then Generall of the Spanish Fleete) that his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was not to distinguish of Religion; but to make a passage with his Sword, ore both Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without exception, that thereby the King his Master might haue the easier way, and fairer passage to the Crowne and Kingdome of <hi>England</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we neede no perspectiue Glasse, or Spectacles to see, that it is not the establishing of the Romane Religion, but of himselfe in England, whereat the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> still aymes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> is wise enough to provide a Playster for that sore, for he in netling the Nobler sort of Catholikes with the Match, hath in plaine tearmes given the lye to the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> his speech, and therefore he hopes they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> The nobler and more passionate and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sort of them may beleeue <hi>Gondomar</hi> herein, but the wiser, temperate, and conscious will not; and yet the Feminine Gender, are Masculine sticklers and solicitors for him, as he and the Iesuites are for the King his Master.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Nay, the Romane Catholikes of <hi>England</hi> haue reason to beleeue <hi>Gondomar</hi>; sith King <hi>Iames</hi> loues him so well, as he esteemes his speeches Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Scripture; and who with the quintessence of his <hi>Castillian,</hi> or rather <hi>Galician</hi> braine, hath now brought matters to this passe, that no cinsere advise, honest Letter, Religious Sermon, or true picture can

                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. But me thinkes that this is no subtill policie of <hi>Gondomar</hi>; for the more he striues to suppresse the truth, the more it will flourish and prevaile; For (for the good of England) if one penne, or tongue be commanded to silence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will occasion and set tenne at libertie to write and speake; as Grasse or Cammomell, which the more it is depressed, the thicker it will spread and growe.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> Indeed they say, he reports that this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, the ayre of London and Islington is not sweete enough, either for his Fistula, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed braine, and that he hath therefore gotten leaue of his Maiestie, to lodge in a part of his Pallace of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> which standes in so pure an ayre, vpon the pleasant Christall Riuer of <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Q <hi>M.</hi> But if it be so, I thinke it is not to lodge there himselfe, but onely to square out the <hi>Infanta's</hi> Lodgings, her Chamber of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But why should King <hi>Phillip</hi> feare King <hi>Iames</hi> his sword, sith hee never yet knew the way to draw it: or why should his Catholike Maiestie feare the Councell of England, sith it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to all the World, that the element and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of their King, is bookes, not battailes, the pen

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> To Peace I hope, or rather, assure my selfe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Then Sister, yee are of neere intelligence with <hi>Gondomar</hi>; for not long since in one of his dispatches to Spaine, hee wrote the LL. of that Councell, that they should not doubt or feare of the Councell of Warre of England; for it was (said he) but a scarre-Crowe to feare, not to hurt, and would onely serue as a Vane on a house top, rather for ornament then vse. But if King <hi>Iames</hi> were of my minde, his Councell of Warre should strike rather then threaten; and send a Royall Armie into the bowels and heart of <hi>Castille,</hi> ere they thought it could be readie to depart from the Ports of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Not into <hi>Castille</hi>; for then the Peace were quite broken betwixt ENGLAND and SPAINE.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Why then into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; The <hi>Netherlands</hi>; or the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the <hi>Castillian</hi> Regiments disturbe the publike Peace of Christendome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. I see no reason to the contrary, but <hi>England</hi> should be as soone in Armes and Action as <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:23382:46"/>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But it is the inchanting melody of the Match, that brings England out of tune.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>M.</hi> But in this Proposition and Parlee of the Match, the King and Councell of Spaine, speake faire termes, and giue reall not verball content to King <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> So, did <hi>Phillip</hi> your Husband, and his Father by his Embassadors to mine at <hi>Bourbourg,</hi> thereby to lull me asleepe when his great Armado was in a manner ready to weigh Anchor, and set Sayle from <hi>Lisbone</hi> to inuade me and my England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. M.</hi> But King <hi>Iames</hi> knowes Spaines affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <hi>Gondomars</hi> sincerity to him, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to England in seeking this Match.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. A.</hi> But England knowes neither the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Master, or the sinceritie of the Seruant, and therefore hath reason, though not to feare, yet to suspect both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. It rather thinkes King <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Pericles</hi> his opinion and Ambition, who desired that the Iland in the Port of <hi>Piree</hi> mought bee removed, sith it was a moate and beame in his eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> The Morall is, that <hi>Phillip</hi> would haue England a Prouince to Spaine; but if the Match hold not: Spaines Ambition, <hi>Gondomares</hi> pollicie, and both their trechery will proue too weake to performe so strong an execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. M.</hi> Then the King of Spaine will hate <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domare,</hi> as much as he vaunts the King of England loues him. But I trust Count <hi>Gondomare</hi> hath liued too long to dote, or be made a Child in his old age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> No, no, <hi>Gondomare</hi> is too young to dote,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23382:47"/>
and too old to be a child, therefore he is Confident and sure that the Match will hold; but withall, he saith the Parliament must be ended, ere these royall Nuptiall Ceremonies can begin, and so I thinke to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. Indeede this <hi>Castillian</hi> Embassadour now sailes before winde and tyde, vnder fore-sayle, and maine-top-sayle, but very shortly hee hopes to hoyst vp top and top-gallant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.H.</hi> he may chance to packe on so much sayle, that hee may at last cracke the maine Mast of his Policie, or the maine stay of his hopes, or bee so busie and violent in the solicitation of this Match, as hee himselfe may giue himselfe a Shot, which may sinke either his reputation, or iudgement, or both, betwixt winde and water.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Intruth I found his Predicessor <hi>Mendoza</hi> too busie and dangerous in my State, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forbad him my presence, and discharged him my Kingdome, whereat I know not whether he, or the King his Master, more grieued, or my Councell and my Countrey reioyced.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A. Gondomare</hi> hath had time enough to know my Husband King <hi>Iames,</hi> but it seemes King <hi>Iames</hi> hath not yet enough deepely pryed into <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damare.</hi> In a word I know his Maiesty hath heard his tongue, but not seene his heart, much lesse the designes and resolutions of the King and Councell of Spaine, which are inuelloped and hood-winked vnder the Mysterie of this Match.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Indeede I haue read that <hi>Philip</hi> K. of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> went neere to haue betraid <hi>Arisba,</hi> K. of <hi>Molosses</hi> of his kingdome, vnder treating a Match with him.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:23382:47"/>Q. <hi>M.</hi> O but that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> was a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then King, and this <hi>Philip</hi> of Spaine is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like King, therefore King <hi>Iames</hi> need not feare his sinceritie in the Match.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> Sith you are so Religious Sister, pray say, how doth the Inquisition of Spaine like to match their <hi>Infanta</hi> to an Hereticke Prince, for so I know they terme my Noble Nephew Prince <hi>Charles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Why? <hi>Digbye</hi> could haue resolved you of that long since, for he knowes that the sacred and reverend Inquisition of Spaine loues England, but not the Match, our Country, but not our Religion and People; and yet in hope to root out Heretickes, and to plant England with Romane Catholiques, they oppose not the Match, but rather giue way to it, and approue it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But can Royall King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Sonne Prince <hi>Charles</hi> obserue their Religion and Conscience, in consenting to this Match, or haue the Clergie of England warrant enough Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, out of the Word of God to say <hi>Amen</hi> to it?</p>
               <p>Q <hi>A.</hi> O no, for King <hi>Iames</hi> (though not the Prince and Clergie) will now make Religion and Conscience Hand-maides to wait and attend on the State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. But his Maiestie should doe farre better to defend the Faith (whereof hee is the Defender) and therein the State, which professeth the true and sincere Religion of Christ and his Apostles, sith Pietie is the preserver of Kingdomes, and all our actions whatsoeuer should tend to the glory of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23382:48"/>
God, which is the banishing of Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, with their effects and Causes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Why pray, what Marriage so religious as for Prince <hi>Charles</hi> to match with the Catholique King his Daughter.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>E.</hi> Sister you haue still Religion in your tongue, but I feare wee shall finde none in your heart, for pray what places haue you of divine Scripture, to authorize and approue this Match of Prince <hi>Charles</hi> with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> sith they are of a different Religion and Beliefe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> As I confesse I haue none to approue it, so I am sure you all cannot alledge any one to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and contradict it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Yes, I produce <hi>Gen. Ch.</hi> 24. <hi>Ch.</hi> 26. against it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Well, whatsoever you say, this Match (notwithstanding) tends to Gods glory, and the good of the Catholique and Apostolique Church, and in the end you shall finde, that <hi>Gondomars</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie and Spaines Ambition will triumph ore your Scripture.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> This Match tends onely to bring in the Pope into our Churches, and the King of Spaine into our Estate; for that is the ayme of the first, the Ambition of the second, and the obiect and hopes of both, and I feare a few yeares will prooue it so; if in time it be not remedied and prevented: which God of his mercie grant, for 'tis true all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23382:48"/>
the wheeles of <hi>Gondomars</hi> Art and Invention, are at worke to effect and accomplish it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> The Pope I must confesse (as Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car Generall on earth) desires that England were Catholique, but for the good King of Spaine, he hath Kingdomes enough of his owne, and therefore lookes not after England, onely he desires to see the Match consummated.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Yes, the King of Spaines tongue hath so long watred, and his mouth gaped for England, that after Spaine, he wisheth England were his aboue all the Countries of the World, and his Catholique Maiestie is very confident, that this Match will giue a mayne stroke to the busines.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> If he once haue England; he will presently assume the Title of Emperour of the West, as King <hi>Philip</hi> his Father was resolved to doe a little before his death; yea his Ambition was so violent, as he missing of England, would haue proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Emperour of Spaine; and had not his Councell diverted and prevented him, he would haue sayled to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and there invested and intituled himselfe Emperour of <hi>America</hi>:</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> And I haue heard that <hi>Gondomar</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the King of Spaine his Master good hope of England; for 'tis certaine that hee not long since wrote to the Dukes of <hi>Lerma</hi> and <hi>Pastranna,</hi> that the report of the strength of England resembled those huge Pageants and Colosses erected at Rome, as the <hi>Caesars</hi> past from the <hi>Melvine</hi> bridge to the Capitoll in Triumph, who were outwardly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but within fill'd onely with straw and poore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23382:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
combustible stuffe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. Indeed, it is the shame &amp; weaknes of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Spaine</hi> is no better acquainted with its strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. A.</hi> And tis my griefe that <hi>Spaine</hi> should see <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands</hi> weaknesse, and not feele its strength.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> O but it is the Spanish Match which will giue fire to <hi>England,</hi> and make her welter in her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and flame in her calamities and afflictions.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> No, no, that Match will keepe the Temple of <hi>Englands</hi> Peace from firing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Yea, as <hi>Erostratus</hi> did that of <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> which in one day consumed all the wealth that rich <hi>Asia</hi> had beene many yeares and ages getting.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> As Religion is the powerfullest passion of our Soule, so there is no stronger lincke of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then Conscience, and therfore I hope my sonne <hi>Charles</hi> will not consent to match with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> But one of his chiefest Vertues is his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King his Father; for although the Prince be his Sonne, yet he knowes he is his Subiect.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>A.</hi> All the world cannot better teach the Prince my Sonne to obey the King his Father, then already he knowes and doth; but I could wish that King <hi>Iames</hi> my Husband would not inforce his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to this Spanish Match.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> If he marry the <hi>Infanta,</hi> shee may proue a false and vnsecret Secretary to the Prince her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and a dangerous Princesse to the State: for he giuing her his heart, his Highnesse can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue any corner thereof for himselfe.</p>
               <p>P. <hi>H.</hi> Yea then every Spanish Traytor and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23382:49"/>
Rebell will shroud themselues vnder the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and greatnesse of the Princesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. So if England match with Spaine, Spaine vndoubtedly will in a short time ouer-match En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. A.</hi> And infallibly take the Crowne from it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> Borrow it peradventure, to see it, not to weare it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> I feare to weare it, neuer to returne it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> 8. Yea for once gone, it is gone for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. E.</hi> And then shall Englands strong men fall vpon the edge of the Sword; her Virgins bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured and murthered, her Wiues defiled and slaine in sight of their dying Husbands; and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; young Babes shall haue their braines dashed against the wals in sight of their dead Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. H.</hi> Yea then shall our Nobility and Gentry, dye vpon the swords of those Barbarous Castilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and those who escape and suruiue their fury, shall bee fettered and led Captiues and slaues to worke in the Mines of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> 6. Then shall our Priestes who are now cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the white robes of Righteousnesse, bee drowned in those of their owne scarlet blood: No Church, no Temple, no Preaching, no Sacraments, but all couered with the thick fogges of Romes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Idolatries, and Egyptian darknes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.A.</hi> Yea, then the King my Husband, the Prince my Sonne, my excellent Daughter the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> her Princely Posterity, and if Spaine possibly can, all Great Brittaines blood Royall shall be rooted out and exterminated, as if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23382:50"/>
they neuer had beene, or at least no remembrance left of them, or of the name of <hi>Great Brittaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>M.</hi> This were musicke indeed for Rome and Spaine to dance at, and for <hi>Gondomar</hi> to laugh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to death for ioy.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>E.</hi> But I hope God of his mercy will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all those who wish or desire it, whether it be <hi>Gondomar,</hi> the Iesuits, Englands Recusants, Spaine, the Pope, or the Divell.</p>

profitable and Honourable for <hi>England</hi>; For louing <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Father, I must &amp; wil euer Honour <hi>Philip</hi> his son; They haue likewise ript vp &amp; vnmasked <hi>Spaines</hi> former Ambition, Crueltie, and Treacherie, aswell towards <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as other Kingdomes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery and relation whereof, I could neuer silence nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, your Excellencie must giue me leaue to signifie, that I feare your Secretaries are not so honest, as your self Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike; For you are hereby these Princes brought on the Stage in your naked and naturall Colours, therefore I could wish you to be more modest and not so busie; Only to the vtmost of your mortall power, knit the knot of this Match, for if it holde, the heart of <hi>England</hi> will be soone broken, or if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, it wil infalliably breake the necke of the King your Masters generall hopes &amp; pretences, and also of your owne particular credit and reputation, aswell in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Spain;</hi> you haue many eies ouer you, &amp; although your sweet wordes and promises lulle King <hi>Iames,</hi> asleepe, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse go neere to be circumuented, by those you seeke to circumuent. If you can bring in the <hi>Infanta,</hi> doubt you not but she will vsher in the Pope, and consequently he the Catholike King, your Master; Forget not to continue, and fortefie your Intelligence with the Seminaries and Iesuits of <hi>England,</hi> as also with the Catholike Ladyes of that Kingdome, and especially, with those of the Nobler ranke, and who are most powerfull at Court, for they may open a passage for your Master when none else dare. At any hand vse the prime of your Art &amp; Inuention, to keepe the King of <hi>England</hi> poore &amp; be sure to rivet this nayle soundly to his Maiestie that there is no Vertue so Royall and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in a Great King, as Liberality. I am sorie to heare that <hi>Englands</hi> Nauie Royall, doth so prosper and flourish; In
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23382:52"/>
which regard &amp; consideration, the King your Master shal do well to build store of new Ships in <hi>Biscay, Ostend,</hi> and <hi>Dunkerke;</hi> for if <hi>Spaine</hi> master <hi>England</hi> at Sea, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can neuer withstand <hi>Spaine</hi> by Land; for now the <hi>English</hi> are Effeminate, and you <hi>Spaniards</hi> Souldiers. I doubt not but by this time, there is such order taken in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> Fleet at <hi>Alicant,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cartagena,</hi> shall returne home with losse, shame and repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may teach them that it is only proper for <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to Domineere at Sea, and that the Sea, and Maritine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are now <hi>Spaines,</hi> no longer <hi>Englands</hi> Element.</p>
            <p>So whiles <hi>England</hi> lyes gasping, on her bed of Peace &amp; securitie, let the King your Master provide for warre; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to sow Diuision in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augment then diminish your Pensions to you know whom.

I commend your Excellencies policy, in being sharpe, and bitter against those, who either Speake, write, or Preach, against the King your Master and his pretences, for now you hauing the Honour and felicitie, to see your selfe tyed to King <hi>Iames</hi> his Eare, &amp; his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to your Girdle, the disgrace and punishment of these wil terrifie others.

and Concluding this Match; for the more you and he Debase the Honour and vndervalue the Reputation of <hi>England,</hi> the more you aduance and prise that of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But that which grieues me most, is because God himselfe hath opposed and confirmed the breach, and delaceration of the Match; but I hope that for the <hi>Catholike</hi> Kings sake, our Holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> and our blessed Mother the <hi>Church,</hi> will so interpose their Prayers to his Sacred and Diuine Maiesty, that very shortly he wil reuoke &amp; change his Resolution, and relish that which hee now Distasteth.

If <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> be in the Field, be not you Idle in your Houses or in <hi>England</hi>: for although <hi>Douer</hi> be shut, you shall finde Ports enough open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is for the Progression and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the Catholike Cause, &amp; for the Seruice of the great Catholike King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if all things hit well, you shall not repent your selues of your Valor &amp; Generositie employed &amp; spent in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. What though God haue heere approued of this Consultation against the Match; yet his great Vicar the Pope, will Confirme the Match against the Consultation; Therefore make you your Peace with the Pope, &amp; doubt not but his Holinesse, both can and will, at his pleasure, mak his with his God; Howsoeuer be ruled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the Pope, who is the Head of the Church; For you know out of the Church there is no Saluation. I like well that there daily Trauels some of your wisest Gentlemen for <hi>Spaine,</hi> and now you see there is no feare to bring home Priests and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, for Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> hath found out the Art

and Mysterie, to open the Doores of <hi>Wisbich,</hi> the <hi>Gatehouse,</hi> and the <hi>Clicnke,</hi> at his pleasure. To liue Idle is Effeminate and base, bee you therefore (like your selues) still busie and in action, for as in matters of Religion and Pietie, so in those of the State, the Practique is alwayes more Honourable then the Theorie. In a word, as long as Heritike Kinges raigne in <hi>England,</hi> your zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Catholikes shall there finde but little Peace, and lesse Ioy; and yet I must needs confesse, that God seemes to beare a particular affection to King <hi>Iames,</hi> but withall you know the second meanes must be vsed, which (I write to my comfort) I see his Maiestie neglects; So if <hi>Gondomar</hi> continue in <hi>England,</hi> and the Match dye not, then I hope a little time will worke all thinges to the best. Till when I salute you all, and will still pray with you for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of the Great cause.</p>
