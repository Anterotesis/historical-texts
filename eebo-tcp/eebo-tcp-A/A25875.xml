            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Earl of SOVTHAMPTON
At Westminster the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of February, 1600. and
in the 43 year of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth.</head>
            <p>A Spacious Court was made in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> where
the Lord Treasurer <hi>Buckhurst</hi> sate as High Steward
of <hi>England,</hi> under a Canopy of State, where sate
also about the Table the Earls, Barons and Judges of the
Land according to their degrees.</p>
            <list>

These sate all in the Court next the Barr before the High
Steward. Seven Sergeants at Arms came in with Maces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the High Steward, and laid them down before him in
the Court. The King at Arms stood on the one side of the
High Steward by his Chair of Estate, and one of Her
Majesties Gentlemen-Ushers with his White Rod in his hand
on the other side. The Clerk of the Crown and his Assistant
sate before him to read the Common Indictments and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations.
The Captain of the Guard (Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh)</hi>
and Forty of the Queens Guard were there to attend the
Service. Then the Sergeant at Arms made three <hi>O Yes!</hi>
and Proclamation, That the Lord High Steward of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
commanded Silence, and to hear the <hi>Commission</hi> read,
upon pain of Imprisonment. Then the Clerk of the Crown
read the <hi>Commission,</hi> whereunto the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive.</p>
            <p>Another Proclamation was made, That the Lord High
Steward of <hi>England</hi> commanded all Justices, to whom any
<hi>Writs</hi> had been directed for this Service, to bring them in,
and certifie the same.</p>
            <p>Another Proclamation was made by a Sergeant at Arms,
That the Lieutenant of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> should return
his Precept, and bring forth his Prisoners, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of
<hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Southampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Lord High Constable of the Tower, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Tower, and the Gentleman Porter, who carried
the Ax before the Prisoners came first in, and the Prisoners
followed and made their appearance at the Barr, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Porter with the Ax standing before them, with the Axes
edge from them, and so the Lieutenant delivered his Precept
into the Court.</p>
            <p>The two Earls (which were Prisoners) kissed one anothers
hands, and embraced each other.</p>
            <p>Another Proclamation was made, That the Sergeant at
Arms to the Queens Majesty do return his Precept of the
Names of all the Peers of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl
of <hi>Southampton,</hi> the which he delivered into the Court ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>

upon the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and jogged him upon his

            <p>Then they were called to hold up their Hands at the Barr,
which they did. And then the Clerk of the Crown read the
Indictments. That being done, they were bid to hold up
their hands again, which they did, and another Indictment
was read, whereunto the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was attentive. After
which the Clerk of the Crown asked them whether they were

                        <p>First he began to open the Evidence, and shewed the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Indictment, and held it in his hand and said as
followeth;</p>
                        <p>May it please your Grace (speaking to the <hi>High
Steward)</hi> about the eighth of <hi>February</hi> last my Lord of
<hi>Essex</hi> (there Prisoner at the Barr) went about with Armed
men very rebelliously to dis-inherit the Queen of her
Crown and Dignity, which when it came to Her Majesties
Ear, She of Her abounding mercy, sent to see if it were
possible to stop the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and who did She send? She
sent (my Lord) no worse persons than my Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> my
Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and Sir
<hi>William Knowles,</hi> all which went in Her Majesties name, and
commanded the Earls and their Adherents very strictly to
dissolve their Assemblies, and to lay down their Arms; but
he knowing it, very treacherously imprisoned the said Lords
and Councellors by her Majesty so sent, and altogether refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Her Majesties Authority, and divers of their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
cry'd out, <hi>Kill them, Kill them,</hi> thereby putting Her
Majesties Council in fear of their Lives; and withall, left
them with Sir <hi>Jo. Davis</hi> to keep safe, lest they themselves
should miscarry in the City; but, my Lord, I must tell you
this by the way, that my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> can no way excuse
nor shadow this his <hi>Rebellious Purposes,</hi> nor turn his <hi>Actions</hi>
to any other intent, for, the sending of <hi>Temple</hi> his Secretary
into <hi>London</hi> the night before manifesteth his determination,
without scruple or question; for by that means he was in
hopes to have had the help of the Citizens Her Majesties most
Loyal and Loving Subjects; and he used not only his best
endeavours to strengthen himself abroad, but also fortified
his House at home with strong Defence and Ammunition,
all which were tokens of his inclinations to a sudden and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55351:4"/>
unexpected Rebellion, and well confirmed in the opinion
of all the World, when he withstood divers of Her Majesties
Subjects standing in Her Highness right, and defence of her
Peace against him and his Confederates. Good my Lord, I
beseech your Grace, and you my Lords that are the <hi>Peers,</hi>
to understand, That if any man do but intend the Death of
the King, it is death by the Law, for he is the head of the
Commonwealth, and all his Subjects as Members ought to
obey and stand with him: But as for this <hi>Rebellion</hi> being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered, contains in it many branches of <hi>Treason,</hi> which
are and will be directly proved; which being found to be
so, my Lords, who are their <hi>Peers,</hi> are to find them guilty;
hereof need to be made no doubt, for it is more manifest
than the Sedition of <hi>Cateline</hi> to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<hi>England</hi> is in no less danger; for as <hi>Cateline</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the most seditious persons about all <hi>Rome</hi> to joyn
with him in his Conspiracy, so the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had none
but <hi>Papists, Recusants,</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> for his Adjutors and
Abettors in their <hi>Capital Rebellion</hi> against the whole Estate of
<hi>England.</hi> My Lord, I much wonder that his heart could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all the Princely Advancements given him by her Majesty,
and be so suddenly beflinted, as to turn them all to <hi>Rebellious
ends;</hi> but it seems this overweighing a Mans own Conceit,
and an aspiring mind to wished Honour, is like the <hi>Crocodile,</hi>
which is ever growing as long as he liveth, your Lordships
knows in what sort they went into the City, with <hi>Armour</hi>
and <hi>Weapons,</hi> and how they returned to <hi>Essex</hi>-house again,
as you my Lord Admiral and my Lord of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> with
others of their honourable Peers do know, which makes me
wonder they do not blush to be so forward to stand upon
their Tryals without Confession, when their intended Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are in all mens judgements palpable. For my part, my
Lord, I can conjecture nothing hereby, and it will not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of my conceit, but that there is some further matter
in it than as yet appears, but my hope is, that God of his
mercy that hath revealed their <hi>Treasons,</hi> will not suffer the
rest of his, or any others to the hurt of the State, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to her Majesties most Royal Person, whom I pray God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55351:5"/>
long to preserve from the hands of her Enemies: <hi>Amen,</hi> cry'd
the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
their Souls that ever wished otherwise to her Sacred
Person.</p>

               <p> May it please your Grace, the Lords Chief
Judges, which are the Fathers of the Law, do know, that the
thought of <hi>Treason</hi> to the Prince, by the Law is Death; and
he that is guilty of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> is guilty of an Intent (by the
Laws of the Land) to seek the destruction of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and
so adjudged <hi>Treason;</hi> and I will prove this unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
by two several Cases: First, he raiseth Power and
Strength in a settled Government; the Law will not suffer it, but
it is construed as in case of <hi>High Treason;</hi> he that doth usurp
upon it, the Law doth intend that he hath purposed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Prince; he that doth assemble Power, if the
King doth Command him upon his Allegiance to dissolve
his Company, and he continue it, without any question it
is High Treason. He that doth levy Forces to take any Town
in the Princes Dominions, it is so likewise; but my Lord
of <hi>Essex</hi> hath levied Power to take the Tower of <hi>London,</hi>
and to surprise the <hi>Queens own Court;</hi> then this must needs
be higher than the highest, and he that doth fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against the Princes Power, must needs be within the
compass of Treason; and by your favour, my Lord of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
I will now speak a word unto you; for I know you
can speak as well as any man, That whereas you say the
Law of Nature compelled you to do this, which in Judgment
you have, though most treacherously attempted. I will in a
word disprove your own judgment, admitting you must make
that freely your Argument. First I will open the Quality
of your <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Secondly, the Manner of it. Thirdly,
I will touch the Circumstances; and lastly, I will observe
the Person. The Quality hath <hi>High Treason;</hi> for which I
think I shall not need to say any more. For the manner
of it, I hold it an unnatural Act, for a natural Subject to
commit <hi>Treason</hi> against his natural Sovereign; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it cannot be by any probability denied, but that
this <hi>High Treason</hi> is, and must, be both against the <hi>Law of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55351:5"/>
God, Nature, and Reason;</hi> and under your Graces Favour,
my Lord, the manner of it being of so high a Nature as it is,
must needs be <hi>High Treason,</hi> which was not only carried in
their Hearts, but for a continual Remembrance kept in a
black Purse, which my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> wore on his Breast
next to his Skin. Let me note unto you my good Lord,
that they being both born under the Government of this
Princess, and so highly advanced by Her Majesties Favour,
should have trembled once to think of such Rebellion as
they have Enterprised. Doth not my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> now
enjoy his Earldome of <hi>Essex</hi> by the Gift of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
to his Father? Was not he made Master of Her Majesties
Horse at twenty two years of Age? One of Her Majesties
Council? to be <hi>Earl Marshal</hi> of <hi>England? General</hi> of Her
Majesties Forces in <hi>Ireland?</hi> and lastly, hath he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
divers Gifts and Summs of Money (to his own use)
of Her Majesties Gracious and Princely Bounty, to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of thirty thousand Pound? yet all these were as cleverly
forgotten, as if they had never been. Now shall I shew
you the Person whom this concerns, even Her Majesties
Sacred Person, against whom their Attempts have been,
only for the Undertaking of Gods Cause, and exercising
of Justice with admirable Mercy; and though I cannot
speak without reverent Commendations of Her Majesties
most Honourable Justice; yet I think her overmuch Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
to some, turneth to overmuch Cruelty for her self;
for though the Rebellious Attempts were so exceeding
hainous, yet out of her Princely Mercy, no man was Rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Tortured, or pressed to speak any thing further, than of
their own Accord, and willing minds, for discharge of their
Consciences they uttered; and then, to see the Mercy of
God that will have the Truth known, it is admirable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Conceit of Mans Capacity: For they being seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
examined, notwithstanding, all agreed directly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
varying. But when Her Majesty sent a Counsellor of
State to have the Earl come before Her, when she heard
of his Rebellion, for no other End or Purpose but for his
Admonishment, he refused to come; and having a guilty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55351:6"/>
Conscience, and suspecting his <hi>Treasons</hi> were laid open,
took consultation to surprise the Court and the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
all at one instant, and for his purpose had appointed
<hi>Blunt</hi> the custody of the Gates, Sir <hi>Jo. Davis</hi> of the <hi>Hall,</hi>
Sir <hi>Charles Danvers</hi> of the <hi>Presence,</hi> and himself of Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Person; whereupon <hi>Blunt</hi> said, Ah! in what humors
shall we find them in at the Court? this was not all, for
the Earl he must call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and he would decide
matters not making for his purpose, but now in Gods most
just Judgement he of his Earldom shall be <hi>Robert</hi> the last,
that of a Kingdom thought to be <hi>Robert</hi> the First, which,
my Lord, did not any whit amuse himself to give order,
that if he and his Complices should miscarry in <hi>London,</hi>
then the Councellors which he caused to be imprisoned in
his House should be slain, it was plain <hi>Treason</hi> in him to
stand out, being by them charged to dissolve his Company
upon his Allegiance; what shall I need to stand upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proofs, it is so Evident, and, my Lord, himself will not
deny, but that he had a Schedule containing in it divers of
his Friends names, which, as I conjecture, must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
some other matter, for he durst not let it come to light,
but burnt it: and as for <hi>Owen Salisbury, Davis</hi> and <hi>Tresham,</hi>
they must have the Guard of the Lords of the Council, to
use them at their pleasure.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>That upon the Sunday Morning he was sent for to <hi>Essex</hi>-house,
where he found the place guarded with many Gentlemen in
Arms, who told his Vncle that came in his Company, that he
feared they were come into an ill Action; my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> bade
him very welcome, and intreated him to go with him, for he
feared hurt of some private Enemies. And when Mr. <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

proves further, that Order was left, That if the Earl should
miscarry in <hi>London,</hi> then the Lord Keeper and the Lord Chief
Justice should be killed, and also when the Councel had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him upon his Allegiance to dissolve his Forces, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
nothing; he likewise saw my Lord of <hi>Bedford</hi> brought
in that Morning, and Mr. <hi>Witherington</hi> fearing he might be
drawn on to his destruction, prayed him only to follow him, for
when opportunity served in <hi>London,</hi> they would leave the Troop,

so suddenly: For, not long before Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> had
sent to my house to have Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> to come to
him to <hi>Durham-House,</hi> and we fearing him to be a private
Enemy, would not suffer Sir <hi>Ferdinando</hi> to go thither,
but returned answer, that he would meet him on the water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equal tearms, where Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> used the former
Speeches to Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> wishing him to leave our
Company, or else he would be undone; and whereas we are
charged to have dealt with <hi>Papists,</hi> I assure your Lordship,
and it is most true, that <hi>Papists</hi> have been hired and suborned
to Witness against me, as by the means of one <hi>Sudall,</hi> who
was a <hi>Seminary Priest,</hi> and sent into <hi>Ireland</hi> to deal with Sir
<hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> whom he thought to be inward with me, to
touch my Honour and Reputation. Then <hi>Bales</hi> the Scrivener

work to attempt against me so much as he hath done, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

               <p>By your favour, Mr. Sergeant <hi>Yelverton,</hi> a word
I hope; for my coming thither, it was not strange news, and
when I came that same morning to <hi>Essex-house,</hi> I protest I had
not above ten or twelve men attending me, which was but
my usual company, therefore far from purposing to raise a
<hi>Tumult.</hi>

               <p>Why, the reason of that was, for that you
thought all <hi>London</hi> would have risen with you; but good
my Lord, I beseech your Grace to hear the Oath of Sir <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando

                           <hi>Sir</hi> Ferdinando Gorges <hi>his Confession.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>He deposeth, that in <hi>January last</hi> the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> wrote to
him a Letter, wherein he complained grievously of his mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and the miserable Estate he stood in, whereof he purposed
shortly to free himself; and therefore prayed Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
to come up to <hi>London</hi> to him; who coming accordingly, the
Earl told him how mightily he was crosed and discredited by his
private enemies, which he could not endure; for, <hi>saith he,</hi> I have
120 Earls, Barons, and Gentlemen that participate in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
humour, and will joyn with me, and I desire your help
and counsel therein. One especial Friend I have in the Court,
whereby I have intelligence from time to time: And I hold our
selves indifferently affected by the Citizens of London, and hope to
have a good Party in Wales: He confessed also that they had two
several Meetings at <hi>Drury-house</hi> to Consult of these Matters, and
the Projects were, whether it were better first to surprize the Court,
or to take the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> or to stirr in the City. But most
agreed first to surprize the Court, and then and there Sir <hi>John
Davis</hi> took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and set down, That some should
keep the Hall, some the Court-Gates, some the Guard-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and some the Presence-Chamber; saying, many of the Guard had
been the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Servants, and were preferred to the
<hi>Queen</hi> by him, and will be more indifferent to deal with than
others, and so my Lord shall have a way through his own Guards
to come to the Privie-Chamber, and the Presence of the <hi>Queen.</hi>
And Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> said to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> Alas,
My Lord! what is so small a number of men able to do in so
worthy an Action? and so dissuaded the <hi>Earl</hi> from surprizing
the Court, and rather bade him submit himself to the <hi>Queens</hi>
mercy, than proceed any further. And that the Earl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi>
said at <hi>Essex-house,</hi> Is it not three Months since this
Plot began, and shall we resolve on nothing? Then upon a sudden
they all agreed first to stir in <hi>London,</hi> where they assured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of great favour: and after the Council was locked up, this
Deponent followed the Troops into <hi>London,</hi> and after some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> sent him back again with a Token
to deliver to the Lord Chief Justice only, by colour of which To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
he set at Liberty the Lord Keeper and the rest. Lastly, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55351:9"/>
confirmed that he told Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> first upon the <hi>Thames</hi>
of my Lord of Essex his making his House a <hi>Guard,</hi> and putting
his Friends into <hi>Arms,</hi> as it is delivered by Sir <hi>Walt. Raleigh.</hi>

entred into Consideration, how he might secure himself to
have access to the <hi>Queens</hi> Presence without resistance, and that
the Resolution was agreeable to certain Articles written with
the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his own hand, and sent to the Earl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi>
to surprize the Court, and that there were divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations
about it, and the Points were these: First, to take
the Tower, for it would command <hi>London,</hi> then to surprize
the <hi>Court,</hi> and after, the <hi>Court</hi> being taken and possessed, to
have assembled the rest of their Friends, and to have present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves to the <hi>Queen;</hi> and that being done, and the
Guard secured, Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> should keep the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Gates of the Court, Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> the Hall and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gate,
Sir <hi>Charles Danvers</hi> (this Deponent) should keep the
Presence and Guard-Chamber, and seize upon the Halberts
and Pentioners Battle-Axes. The Intent was to surprize the
Captain of the Guard at the Court, or at his own House, and
some others; and then to surprize the City of <hi>London:</hi> And
that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> resolved (these things being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished)
immediately to have called a Parliament to reform
Disorders and private Grievances: That this Deponent ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
disliked of these Courses, and after the <hi>Alarm</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at Court, he perswaded the Earl rather to flee into <hi>Wales,</hi>
or other parts beyond the Seas for his security, and avoiding
the imminent danger he was fallen into, than to trust to the
City. And lastly, he protested, for his own part, what he had
done in the business, was meerly for the Love he bore to the
Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and not for any Malice or private Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
otherwise.</p>

the self-same Fear, and the self-same Examiner, may make

never so far distant; but good my Lord, let me intreat
your Lordship to consider who they be that testifie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55351:11"/>
this against me; My Lord, they are men within the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Law, and such as speak with a Desire to live, but
I think they have much to answer for between God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
their Souls, and me: I see they charge me with the Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of the Tower; but upon what ground do they speak?
they had only some particular Notes of my Friends names,
but ever very scornfully dashed at me; For when my Friends
perswaded me to any course, this was my purpose; to
have come with eight or nine Honourable Persons, who had
just cause of discontentment (though not equal with mine)
unto her Majesty, and so by Petition, prostrating our
selves at her Majesties feet, to have put our selves unto her
Mercy; and the Effect of our Desires should have been, that
she would have been pleased to have severed some from her
Majesty, who, by reason of their Potency with her, abused
her Majesties ears with false Informations: and they were
<hi>Cobham, Cecil,</hi> and <hi>Raleigh:</hi> For we thought my Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
carried himself in such factious and dangerous Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as he told her Majesty many Untruths, which was a
principal Cause (as I think) of withdrawing her Favour
from us. And to that intent, to remove such from her
<hi>Highness</hi> (I confess) was the only Desire we had to present
our selves in all humility before her Majesty, but without
any purpose of Hurt to her Highness: for, I protest before
God, I do carry a Reverent and Loyal Duty to her Majesty
as any man in the World. But now, my Lord, seeing that I
have heard the Testimony of Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> and
himself here in Court to testifie it, I will say no more, but
that if it please her Majesty to be merciful unto him, I will
be glad, and pray for it; yet whatsoever he hath said, let
my Life and his Dealing testifie the truth: and, Sir <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi>
speak nothing to touch thy self, and speak what thou
wilt to me; for I see thou desirest to live, yet speak like a

of my Conscience, whether my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> did at any
time deliver out any Articles in Writing under his hand,
therein laying open the Projects of his Purpose for Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Court and Tower.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Southampton.</speaker>
               <p>It was a foolish Action, I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
the going through the Town, and that was suddenly
passed over; but my Lord's purpose to have men planted
at the Court, was, in regard he feared hindrance by private
Enemies, that would have stopped his passage to the Queen:
which, I protest, he intended to no other end, but to prostrate
himself at her Majesties feet, and submit to her mercy; as ye
have formerly heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cobham.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> (quoth the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up) let me know, I intreat you, why you lay such Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon me, as you have delivered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have forgiven all the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you shall not need to insist upon these Circumstances;
for I lay not my Cause upon ought that shall do your Lordship
any harm for my sake; for, I protest, my heart bears you no
Malice, but what I spake was freely, and in Gods presence, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55351:12"/>
her Majesty would have heard us and our Complaints,
being but true; And I do further assure your Lordship, that
I never spake it out of Fear of Death, or Desire of Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bacon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, may it please your Grace, whatsoever my
Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> hath here denied, in my conceit it seemeth to
be small. I speak not to any ordinary Jury, but to Prudent,
Grave, and Wise Peers: And this I must needs say; It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that you, my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> had planted a Pretence in
your heart against the Government; and now, under colour
of Excuse, you must lay the Cause upon particular Enemies.
You put me in remembrance of one <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> that was come
into a City, and doting upon the Affections of the Citizens
unto him (he having a Purpose to procure the Subversion
of a Kingdom, and wanting Aid for the accomplishing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour)
thought it the surest means for the winning of the
hearts of the Citizens unto him, and so in that Hope entred
the City, and cut his Body over-thwart, to the end they might
conjecture he had been in danger: and so by this Means held
the same Conceit as you and your Complices did, entring
the City of <hi>London,</hi> perswading your selves, if they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
your Cause, all would have gone well on your side.
And now, my Lord, all you have said, or can say, in answer
to these Matters, are but Shadows; and therefore, methinks,
it were your best course to Confess, and not to Justifie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, I must plead Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
for a Witness; for when the course of private Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was in hand, and most assailed me, then Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> was
the man that profered me means to the Queen, and drew a
Letter in my name, and in his Brother Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon's</hi>
name, which Letter he purposed to shew the Queen, and
<hi>Gosnal</hi> was the man that brought them unto me; wherein I
did see Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi>'s hand pleaded as orderly, and appointed
them out that were my Enemies, as directly as might be;
which Letters I know Mr. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> hath seen, and by
him it will appear what Conceit he held of me, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than he here coloureth and pleadeth the Contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bacon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I spent more hours to make you a good
Subject, than upon any man in the World besides; but since
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55351:12"/>
you have stirred up this Point my Lord; I dare warrant you
this Letter will not blush: for I did but perform the part of
an honest man, and ever laboured to have done you good,
if it might have been, and to no other end: for what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for your good, was wished from the Heart, without
Touch of any man's Honour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>Well my Lord, I do here protest before the Living
God, that an Honourable Grave and Wise Councellor hath
lamented and grieved at the Courses he hath seen taken, and
therewith hath wished himself often dead, and this I speak
upon Credible and Honourable Information; but I can prove
thus much from Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi>'s own mouth; that he, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to one of his Fellow-Councellors, should say, that none
in the world but the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> had Right to the Crown
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Here Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> stepped forth into the Court (having
kept himself private till then) and humbly desired Leave to
speak to <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Rob. Cecil.</speaker>
               <p>The Difference between you and me is great;
for I speak in the Person of an honest man, and you, my Lord,
in the Person of a Traytor: For well I know, you have it at
Will. The Preheminence hath been yours, but I have Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
Truth of Conscience, and Honesty to defend me against
the Scandal of slanderous Tongues, and aspiring Hearts; and
I protest before God, I have loved your Person, and justified
your Vertues; and I appeal to God and the Queen, that I
told Her Majesty, your Afflictions would make you a fit Ser-Servant
for her. And had not I seen your ambitious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inclined to Usurpation, I could have gone on my Knees
to Her Majesty to have done you good; but you have a
Sheep's Garment in Show, and in Appearance are humble and
Religious; but God be thanked we know you; for indeed your
Religion appears by <hi>Blunt, Davies</hi> and <hi>Tresham,</hi> your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Councellors for the present, and by promising Liberty of
Conscience hereafter. I stand for Loyalty, which I never lost,
you stand for Treachery wherewith your Heart is possessed;
and you charge me with high things, wherein I defie you to
the uttermost. You, my good Lords, Councellors of State have
many Conferences, and I do confess I have said the King of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55351:13"/>
                  <hi>Scots</hi> is a Competitor, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> a Competitor,
and you I have said are a Competitor; you would depose
the Queen, you would be King of <hi>England,</hi> and call a
Parliament. Ah my Lord, were it but your own Case the
loss had been the less; but you have drawn a number of
Noble Persons and Gentlemen of Birth and Quality into your
Net of Rebellion, and their Bloods will cry Vengeance against
you. For my part, I vow to God, I wish my Soul was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and my Body at rest, so this had never been.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>Ah Mr. <hi>Secretarie,</hi> I thank God for my humbling,
that you in the Ruff of your Bravery came to make your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
against me here this day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cecil.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I humbly thank God that you did not
take me for a fit Companion for you and your Humours, for
if you had, you would have drawn me to betray my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
as You have done; but I would have you name the
Councellour you speak of, name him, name him, name him
if you dare, if you dare, I defie you, name him if you dare.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>Here stands an Honourable Person (meaning the Earl
of <hi>Southampton)</hi> that knows I speak no Fables; he heard it
as well as I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cecil.</speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> I adjure you by the
Duty you owe to God, Loyalty and Allegiance you owe to
your Sovereign, by all tokens of true Christianity, and by
the antient Friendship and Acquaintance once between us,
that you name the Councellour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Southamp.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> If you will needs have me name
the Councellour, it was Mr. <hi>Comptroller;</hi> whereupon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
falling down upon his Knees, said, I thank God for
this day, and upon his Knee, desired the Lord High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
that a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, (or one that
might have Access to the Queen) might go, and humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
Her Highness to command Mr. Comptroller to come
before your Grace.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Here the Lord High Steward calling Mr. <hi>Knevet</hi> (a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Her Majesties Privy Chamber) said unto him, go
Mr. <hi>Knevet</hi> unto Her Majesty, and let Her understand
Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Secretaries</hi> Demand.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cecil.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knevet,</hi> You shall have free Access unto Her
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55351:13"/>
Majesty, tell Her, that I vow before the God of Heaven, that
if she refuse to send Mr. <hi>Comptroller,</hi> whereby I may clear my
self of these open Scandals; I will rather die at her Foot, (as
her Subject and Vassal) than live to do her any more Service
in this Honourable Degree, wherein her Highness employs
me. And withal, let me adjure you Mr. <hi>Knevet,</hi> that you
do not acquaint Mr. <hi>Comptroller</hi> with the Cause why you come
for him. Mr. <hi>Knevet</hi> went, and not long after returned with
Mr. <hi>Comptroller,</hi> to whom the Lord High Steward repeated
the Cause why he was sent for, and desired him to satisfie
the Lords, whether <hi>Mr. Secretary</hi> did use any such Speech in
his Hearing, or to his knowledge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Comptroller.</speaker>
               <p>I remember that once in <hi>Mr. Secretaries</hi>
Company, there was a Book read, that treated of such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but I did never hear <hi>Mr. Secretary</hi> use any such words,
or to that effect; whereupon <hi>Mr. Secretary</hi> thanked God, that
though the Earl stood there as a Traytor, yet he was found an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, and a faithful Subject; withal saying, I beseech God to
forgive you for this open wrong done unto me, as I do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounce, I forgive you from the bottom of my Heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>And I, <hi>Mr. Secretary,</hi> do clearly and freely forgive
you with all my Soul; because I mean to die in Charity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bacon.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you may now perceive that my Lord
of <hi>Essex</hi> went about to procure matter, and to give over on
the instant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Southamp.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I beseech your Lordship, let me satisfie
your Lordship and the rest thus much, that for my own part,
<hi>I</hi> did never know the Laws. Now to shew the Causes that made
me adventure so far as <hi>I</hi> did: The first occasion that made
me adventure into these Courses, was the Affinity betwixt
my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> and me, <hi>I</hi> being of his Blood, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his Kinswoman; so that for his sake, <hi>I</hi> should have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
my Life: But what <hi>I</hi> have by my forwardness offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Act, <hi>I</hi> am altogether ignorant, but in Thought <hi>I</hi> am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
never. And if through my Ignorance, in the Law <hi>I</hi> have
offended, yet <hi>I</hi> humbly submit my self to Her Majesty, and
from the bottom of my Heart do beg Her Gracious Pardon
if it please Her; and <hi>I</hi> hope that neither your Lordship nor
any of the Peers will hold any of the former Resolutions spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55351:14"/>
of by these Orators, for any Certainty which depends
no otherwise than one upon another. For if any foolish Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
have passed, I protest, as I shall be saved, that they were
never purposed by me, nor understood to be so purposed
by me, to the Hurt of Her Majesties Person.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>I beseech your Lordship to understand me, and assure
your self, that what I now speak, is not with any Desire (I
protest) to spare one Drop of my Blood; and because some
Honourable Persons are interessed in the Cause, I would (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
favour) signifie, because the Point hath been so much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> that at our Being in <hi>London</hi> when we
were past <hi>Pauls,</hi> word was brought me, that the Chain was
drawn at <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and that my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> was
there; which when I heard, I was right glad: for if there
had been Cause, I would have been glad to have put my self
into so Honourable a Persons Hands as his; but it was a false
Report, for my Lord was not then come thither. After which
I went to Sheriff <hi>Smith's</hi> House, and after my coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I sent the Sheriff and Mr. Alderman <hi>Wats</hi> to my Lord
Mayor, desiring him to come to us; if he would not, to send
four of his Aldermen to see if we demeaned our selves Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
with Intent to put our selves into their Hands to use us
as they would, or to put us into any Prison; yet in regard of
our private Enemies, and the Fear of their Treachery, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
them to shut their Gates; and this was the end for which
we went into the City.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Attorn.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if you had no other Purpose, why did
you go into <hi>Gracious-street</hi> and <hi>Fanchurch-street,</hi> crying out
all the way you went, England <hi>is bought and sold to the</hi>
Spaniard?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Southamp.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Attorn.</hi> I protest (as I hope to have mercy
in Heaven) I never heard my Lord speak any such Word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I hear of the Proclamation you speak of, made by
my Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> and the <hi>Herauld at Arms;</hi> neither did I see
them, and I deny (my Soul and Conscience bearing me Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
that I ever knew of any Intent and Meaning, or did
ever mean or intend any Treason, Rebellion or other Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against my Sovereign or the State; but only what I did,
was to assist my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> in his private Quarrel; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55351:14"/>
fore Mr. Attorney you have urged the matter very far, and
you wrong me therein, my Blood be upon your head. As for my
Lord of <hi>Rutl.</hi> whereas he inferreth against me to be a persuader
and inviter of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> to these Actions, he wrongeth
me exceedingly; for he was never the man that saw me once
discontented, and therefore had small ground or reason so to say.
And you Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> whereas you charge me for a <hi>Papist,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
most unfeignedly, I was never conversant with any of that
sort; I only knew one <hi>White</hi> a Priest that went up and down the
Town, yet did I never Converse with him in all my life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, and you that be our <hi>Peers,</hi> I beseech you
give me hearing thus far, not that I will speak it for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of my life, but with this my desire I charge the Souls of
all them that be our Censurers or Triars, because out of a Form
and Custom of speaking, these Orators would make them more
odious that come to the Barr, that I may not be thought to
have done this upon revenge: for within these few dayes
I purposed to have received the Communion, to be a testimony
that I was far from bearing of Malice to any, not so much as to
my private Enemies. But the falling out between the Earl of
<hi>Southampton</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> happening on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> hindered
my Intent; for so soon as I knew of it, I found my affections to
stirr on it exceedingly; yet I have since that time laboured and
by my Prayers to God earnestly desired, that I might be armed
with Patience to endure all afflictions. And here I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ever-living God, as he may have Mercy on me, That
my Conscience is clear from any Disloyalty, Thought or Harm
to Her Majestie; and my Desire ever hath been to be free from
bloodshed, as Mr. <hi>Dove</hi> can witness. But if in all my Thoughts
and Purposes I did not ever desire the good Estate of my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and Country as to my own Soul, I beseech the Lord then
shew some Mark upon me and my Soul in this place, for a just
Vengeance of my Untruths to all the World. And God which
knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts, knoweth that I never sought
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> nor ever wished to be a higher degree
than a Subject. I greatly endeavoured to have brought my
Conscience to Peace, onely by seeking to secure my Access to
the Presence of the Queen, that I might speedily have unfoulded
my Griefs unto Her Majestie against my private Enemies, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55351:15"/>
not to have shed one drop of their blood: And this, my Lord,
I speak, to the end I might put off all imputation of being an
Hypocrite or an Atheist; for I was never Papist, neither did I
ever favour any Sectary (as my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> knoweth, and
can testifie:) for my Religion it is sound, and as I live I mean to
die in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bacon.</speaker>
               <p>Well my Lord, may it please your Grace, you may see
how weakly he hath shadowed his purpose, and how slenderly
he hath answered the Objections against him. But my Lord,
doubting that too much variety of Matter may minister occasion
of forgetfulness, I will onely trouble your Lordships remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
with this onely Point, rightly comparing this Rebellion
of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Guises,</hi> that came upon the
Barricadoes at <hi>Paris</hi> in his Dublet and Hose attended upon with
8 men; but his Confidence in the City was such, (even as my
Lord's was) but when he had delivered himself so far, and that
the shallowness of his own Conceit could not accomplish what
he expected, the King for his defence taking Arms against him,
he was glad to yield himself, thinking to colour his pretents,
turned his practices, and alledged the occasion thereof to be a
private Quarrel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I must confess it was my fault to stand out
and to maintain my House with defence and resisting; but I will
not deny but that my Lord of <hi>Southampton</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Danvers</hi>
did persuade me to Parley with my Lord General, which I hope
your Lordship will remember I did yield upon some indifferent
Terms and Conditions; Which were, first, <hi>That I might have an
Honourable Tryal.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That I might deliver my Griefs my self
to the Queen.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That I might go in safety.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That
I might have my Minister with me.</hi> And lastly, <hi>(which I chiefly begg
of Her Majestie,), That she would be pleased to redeem some that were with
me in the House, and guiltless for Knowledg, Intent or Action, of what was
by me purposed.</hi> All which I thought good to remember, and so
humbly submit the same to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her Majesties gratious Pleasure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Serjeant at Arms.</speaker>
               <p>Then Proclamation was made. <hi>Lieutenant of
the</hi> Tower, <hi>withdraw your Prisoners from the Barr.</hi> They being
removed, the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> went together into a private place
made of purpose behind the Canopie and Chair of Estate; then
the Two Chief Judges and the Lord Chief Baron were sent for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55351:15"/>
in to them to deliver their Opinions in Law: After half an hour
they came all out again, and each man took his place; which
being done, the Serjeant at Arms begun at the punie Lord, and
called <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who stood up bare-headed; then
said the Lord High Steward,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Whether is <hi>Robert</hi> Earl
of <hi>Essex</hi> guilty of this Treason whereupon he hath been Indicted,
as you take it upon your Honour, or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lo. Tho. Howard.</speaker>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> made
answer, bending his Body and laying his Left Hand upon his
Right Side, said, <hi>Guilty, my Lord, of High Treason.</hi> After which
manner all the <hi>Peers</hi> found him guilty one after another from the
<hi>Punie</hi> to the highest, and so delivered in like sort upon their
Honours. Being called over anew, they found <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of
<hi>Southampton</hi> guilty of High Treason also.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Serjeant at Arms.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Serjeant at Arms commanded the
Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> to bring his Prisoners to the Barr

            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk of the Crown.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Clerk of the Crown speaking first
to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> said, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> you have been
Arraigned and Indicted of High Treason, you have pleaded <hi>Not
Guilty,</hi> and for your Trial you have put your self upon God and
your Peers; the Peers here (who have heard the Evidence and
your Answer in your defence) have found you Guilty: Now
what can you say for your self, why you should not have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Death?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>I onely say this, That since I have committed that
which hath brought me within the compass of the Law, I may
be counted the Law's Traitor in offending the Law, for which
I am willing to die, and will as willingly go thereto as ever did
any: But I beseech your Lordship, and the rest of the Lords here,
to have consideration of what I have formerly spoken, and do
me the right as to think me a Christian, and that I have a Soul
to save, and that I know it is no time to jest; lying and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
my Soul abhorreth: for I am not desperate nor void
of Grace now to speak falsely. I do not speak to save my life;
for that I see were vain; I owe God a death, which shall be
welcome, how soon soever it pleaseth Her Majestie. And to
satisfie the Opinion of the World, that my Conscience is free
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55351:16"/>
from Atheism and Popery, howsoever I have been in this Action
misled to transgress the Points of the Law in the Course and
Defence of private Matters, and whatsoever through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my Wit and dulness of Memory, or through violent
Courses, (if there be any violent that seek either life or death;)
or if I have omitted or may have uttered any thing otherwise,
yet I will live and die in the Faith and true Religion which here
I have professed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerk of the Crown.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Clerk of the Crown demanded
of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> What he could say for himself,
why Judgment of Death should not be pronounced against
him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Southampton.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, I must say for my part as I have said
before, That since the ignorance of the Law hath made me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the danger of the Law, I humbly submit my self to Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Mercy; and therefore my Lord High Steward, and my
Lord Admiral, I beseech you both, that seeing you are Witnesses
I am Condemned by the letter of the Law, it would please you
to let the Queen know that I Crave her Mercy. I know I have
offended her, yet if it please her to be Merciful unto me, I may
live, and by my Service deserve my life. I have been brought up
under Her Majestie, I have spent the best part of my Patrimony
in Her Majesties Service with danger of my life, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
know; if there were any that could challenge me, that I
have ever heretofore committed or intended Treason, or any
other thing prejudicial to Her Majestie or Estate, God let me
never inherit his Kingdom, neither would I desire Mercy: but
since the Law hath Cast me, I do submit my self to death, and
yet I will not despair on her Majesties Mercy; for that I know
she is Merciful, and if she please to extend it, I shall with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
receive it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Queen's Majestie hath
bestowed many Favours on your Predecessors and your Self;
I would wish therefore that you likewise would submit your self
to Her Majesties Mercy, acknowledging your Offences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
your self inwardly to Her Majestie, by laying open all
Matters that were intended to prejudice Her Majestie, and the
Actors thereof; and thereby no doubt you shall find Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
Merciful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55351:16"/>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you have made an honourable Motion; do
but send to me at the time of my death, and you shall see how
penitent and humble I will be towards her Majesty, both in
acknowledging her exceeding Favours to my Ancestors, and
to my self; whereby I doubt not but the penitent suffering of
my Death, and sprinkling of my Blood, will quench the evil
conceited Thoughts of Her Majesty against me. And I do most
humbly desire Her Majesty, that my Death may put a period to
my Offences committed, and be no more remembred by her
Highness. If I had ever perceived any of my Followers to have
harboured an evil thought against her Majesty, I would have
been the first that should have punished the same in being his
<hi>Executioner;</hi> and therefore I beseech you, my good Lord, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
me not, nor think me so proud, that I will not crave her
Majesties Mercy, for I protest (kneeling upon the very knee of
my heart) <hi>I</hi> do crave her Majesties Mercy with all humility;
yet <hi>I</hi> had rather die than live in Misery.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord High Steward, after a few exhortations unto the
Earls to prepare themselves for God, told them, seeing the Law had
found them <hi>Guilty,</hi> it followed of course that he must proceed to
Judgement.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> replied very cheerfully, and said, yea, my
Lord, with a very good will, <hi>I</hi> pray you go on.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> gave <hi>Judgment</hi> as followeth:</p>
               <p>You must go to the place from whence you came, and there remain
during Her Majesties pleasure, from thence to be drawn on a Hurdle
through <hi>London</hi> Streets, and so to the place of Execution, where you
shall be hanged, bowelled, and quartered; your Head and Quarters
to be disposed of at Her Majesties pleasure, and so God have mercy
on your Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, <hi>I</hi> am not a whit dismayed to receive this
<hi>Sentence,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> protest Death is as welcome to me as Life, and <hi>I</hi>
shall die as chearful a death upon such a testimony as ever did
man. And <hi>I</hi> think it fit my poor Quarters that hath done her
Majesty true Service in divers parts of the world should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
and disposed of at her Majesties pleasure; whereunto
with all willingness of heart <hi>I</hi> have submitted my self. But, one
thing <hi>I</hi> beg of you my Lords that have free access to her
Majesties person, humbly to beseech her Majestie to grant me
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55351:17"/>
that (during the short time <hi>I</hi> shall live) that <hi>I</hi> may have the same
<hi>Preacher</hi> to comfort me, that hath been with me since my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
began, for as he that hath been long sick is most desirous
of the <hi>Physician</hi> which hath been and is best acquainted with
the Constitution of his Body; so do <hi>I</hi> most wish to have the
comfort and Spiritual Physick from the <hi>Preacher</hi> which hath bin
and is acquainted with the inward griefs and secret affections
of my Soul. And my last request shall be only this, that it will
please her Highness that my Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the <hi>Tower</hi> may be partakers with me in receiving the
Sacrament, and be a witness of it in token of what <hi>I</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to be true in this life, for my Loyalty, Religion, and peace
of Conscience, and then whensoever it shall please her <hi>Majesty</hi>
to call me, <hi>I</hi> shall be ready to seal the same with my blood.</p>
               <p>The Lords promised they would move the Queen for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Essex.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> humbly thank your Lordships.</p>
               <p>Then the Serjeant at Arms stood up with the Mace on his
shoulder, and after <hi>Proclamation</hi> was made, said thus: All
<hi>Peers</hi> that were summoned to be here this day, may now take
their ease, and all other Persons attending here this Service
may depart in her Majestice Peace, for my <hi>Lord High Steward</hi>
is pleased to dissolve this <hi>Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Lords were rising, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> said, My Lord
<hi>De la Ware,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> I beseech your Lordships,
pardon me for your two Sons that are in trouble for my sake.
I protest upon my Soul they knew not of any thing that was
or should have been done, but came to me in the morning,
and I desired them to stay, and they knew not wherefore. And
so Farewell, my Lords.</p>
