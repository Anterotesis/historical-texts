         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that is, for <hi>Deſigning to Murther the King and alter

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44372:5"/>
and been executed for it. And, my Lord, we
will give your Lordſhip <hi>Evidence,</hi> This my Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlemain</hi>
hath at ſeveral times conſpired the <hi>Death of

among <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> where theſe Matters have been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, and this whole <hi>Deſign</hi> hath been negotiated.
And my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> hath been conſenting and
agreeing to all theſe Matters. And, my Lord, when
the <hi>Trials</hi> were in hand, it did appear upon thoſe
<hi>Trials</hi> there were many perſons brought from <hi>St. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
to be Witneſſes againſt Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> to prove he

did countenance theſe perſons, and was an Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor

had ſo great confidence in his Integrity. And, my

Lord <hi>Caſtlemain:</hi> for my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> had left
ſome things at <hi>Leige,</hi> wherein he did complain of the
Fathers, that they made no more haſte for to ſend his
things to him; ſome odd things he had left there, and,
my Lord, he gave an Account of a certain Letter he
received from the Rector of <hi>Liege,</hi> whoſe Advice he

them not fit to be truſted. My Lord, in <hi>April</hi> there
was a Conſult: I came over from St. <hi>Omers</hi> in <hi>April,</hi>
ſome three or four, or five daies before the Conſult,
I am not able to gueſs at the particular time, but it
was near upon the Conſult. My Lord, this Conſult
was divided into ſeveral Companies after they had met

               <p>Yes, my Lord, but the terms are not
convertible: For, my Lord, when we ſay the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,
there was ſomething elſe done, my Lord, as that
Conſult which had not an abſolute Relation to the
Deſign, and of that I will give your Lordſhip one

There was a Deſign for the Killing the King, there
was a Deſign of the Prieſts and Fathers for it; but,
ſaith he, <hi>Afterwards there was a general Conſultation,</hi>
and this Deſign came to be form'd by this general
Conſult, which my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> as he thinks,
had no knowledge of till the time they met together in
<hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields,</hi> and afterward went and diſcours'd
about it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>It is very fair, that he doth not know that
my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> had any knowledge before the
Conſult of this buſineſs; but, he ſays, <hi>The Deſign
upon which the Conſult was, that he might know, which
was to deſtroy the King, and bring in Popery.</hi> And he
ſays, My Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> did underſtand this word
Deſign in that ſenſe they did; becauſe he anſwered
their Letters according to their Interpretation of it.
How do you know he underſtood the word Deſign in

               <p>Now you ſee, my Lord, you think <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
ought not to be a Witneſs, who hath gone through
ſo many Pnniſhments, out-lawed for Felony, and
burnt in the hand for Felony; Mr <hi>Atturney</hi> makes
Anſwer, we have a Pardon, and by that he is reſtored,
as he ſays, to be a Witneſs again. If you deſire
Council to ſpeak to this point, Whether or no a man
branded and burnt in the hand for Felony, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
is pardoned, is capable of being a Witneſs? I
ſee no reaſon to deny it you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. General,</speaker>
               <p>If there be matter for Council to
ſpeak in that Caſe, we muſt ſubmit, if your Lordſhip
make it a doubt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I do for my own part; in this I am clear, if
a Man were Convicted of Perjury, that no Pardon
will make him a Witneſs, becauſe it is to do the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
wrong. A Pardon does not make a Man an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Man, it takes off reproaches; and the Law is
wiſe in that, the Law will not ſuffer endleſs contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to be heaped upon Men, nor to be call'd perjured
Raſcalls, and ſuch things. It is only to prevent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
Language, which tends to the breach of
the Peace. But in my Opinion, if a Man ſtands
Convicted in Court, for Perjury, no Pardon can ever
make him a Witneſs and ſet him upright again. But
that is a different Caſe from this, we are upon this
ſingle Caſe, Whether a Man that is burnt in the hand
for Felony, whether a Pardon can ſet him right or no?
For this I make more doubtful than the other: for a
Man may be, that hath committed a Robery, would
be afraid to forſwear himſelf; for though one is a
great, the other is a greater Sin, and that in the
Subject matter; which conſidered, I think it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to allow my Lord Council to ſpeak to that ſingle
point, That a Perſon being burnt in the hand for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
and afterwards Pardoned, whether he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being a Witneſs?</p>

whether it be neceſſary to protract this or no; for
your Council will hardly undertake to argue unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

the duty of my Place to diſcharge my Conſcience for
you and againſt you as the matter ſhall fall out; and
if ſo be that you ſhould inſiſt upon it; and he be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being a Witneſs, ſuppoſing it ſo; yet I muſt
ſay, you may give in the Evidence of every Record
of the Conviction of any ſort of Crimes he hath been
guilty of, and they ſhall be Read. They ſay laſt day

ſhould be Read againſt him, and they ſhall all go to

               <p>My Lord, I am ready to offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to your Lordſhip why I conceive he ought not

Read, becauſe many Perſons and Offences are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>It is a Pardon for Felonies and Out-lawries

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Darnal,</speaker>
               <p>If the Perſons and their Offences are
ſeverally and ſufficiently pardoned, then, my Lord,
I will proceed unto the other Point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Jones,</speaker>

               <p>Then, my Lord, I conceive, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this Pardon, Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ought not
to be Sworn, and that no Perſon attainted of Felony
(though Pardon'd) can be a Witneſs. My Lord, it
hath been Adjudged in 11 <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſimo
primo,</hi> that a Man Attainted of Felony (as Mr.
<hi>Dangerfield</hi> is) though he be afterwards Pardoned,
cannot be Sworn of a Jury. My Lord, the ſame

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Darnal,</speaker>
               <p>Forty Seven, my Lord, The caſe there
reported is, The King Pardon'd a Man Attaint for
giving a falſe Verdict; yet he ſhall not be at another
time Empannell'd upon any Jury; and the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
there is, that though the Puniſhment was Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
yet the Guilt remain'd.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Jones,</speaker>

               <p>I writ it word for word out of the Book,

Lord, in Mr. <hi>Juſtice Crooke</hi>'s <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Fol. 686. in
<hi>Shelborn</hi>'s Caſe, it is held, that though the King may
Pardon <hi>Simony,</hi> yet he cannot enable a <hi>Simoniack</hi> to
retain a Living.</p>

Guilt, though it may the Puniſhment of the Offence.</p>

               <p>My Lord, with your Lordſhips Favour,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44372:19"/>
this is quite contrary to the conſtant and general O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and contrary to the conſtant Practice: For,
my Lord, with your Lordſhips Favour, when a Man
is Pardon'd for any Crime, if a Man can't ſay he is a

ſo to any intent or purpoſe whatſoever.</p>

            <sp>

ſtop Mens Mouths from reviling ſpeeches that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
nothing: but it is one thing to ſay men ſhall not

there is a diſability, before Conviction he is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

               <p>Don't my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> tell you expreſly, That
the taking a Pardon doth not prove any Offence? You
take a Pardon, it ought not to be concluded that you
are Guilty; but the proper concluſion of a Wiſe
Man is, that you would be ſafe: It can't be thought
that every Man that hath a Pardon in <hi>England</hi> is
guilty of all thoſe Offences that are there Pardoned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Jones,</speaker>
               <p>There is a difference between a General
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44372:21"/>
Pardon and a particular Pardon; when a Man doth
accept of a ſpecial Pardon, it muſt be intended that
he hath ſome Conſciouſneſs of Guilt, or elſe he would
not take it; but he that is Included in a general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
may be clear, becauſe all Men are Included
in it, unleſs ſome Perſons particularly excepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the difference is taken in that very point from
accepting a General and a Special Pardon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>That the Acceptance of a General Pardon,
doth not barely of it ſelf intend Men to be Guilty of
the Crimes, is plain, and the reaſon is moſt apparent,
for beſides that Men be ſafe, ſo there be times that
give a Reaſon why Men ſhould have a Pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no man knows when he is ſafe; Perjury ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
that no man can ſay he is ſafe, and that is a
Reaſon why Men ſhould be very willing to accept of
Pardons.</p>

they take upon them to ſpeak againſt whole Societies
of Men; as if ſo be there were any thing in them that

That he was convicted of Felony and Burnt in the

That a General Pardon would not reſtore him to
be a Witneſs after an Outlawry for Felony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Intereſt that the Kings Subjects have
in him. But they ſay further, That where a Man
comes to be Burnt in the hand, there they look
upon that as a kind of more General Diſcharge,
then the Pardon alone would amount to, if he had
not been burnt in the hand. They ſay, If he had
been Convicted of Felony, and not Burnt in the

               <p>Yes, my Lord, this is the Perſon.
And, my Lord, the Contents of that Letter I know
not: but his Lordſhip made me ſtay till he wrote an
Anſwer, and the Contents of the Anſwer, my Lord,
were to this effect: For I return'd with the Anſwer,
to the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and ſhe opened and read it while I

the Contents of this Letter were, This Perſon I like
well, and though he be no Scholar, he will ſerve to

               <p>Before the Tryal, my Lord, and
my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> went along with them to the
Tryal, and his Lordſhip complained of ſome ill uſage
that the Witneſſes received there. His Lordſhip was
one of the Perſons that imployed me to get <hi>Lane</hi> out
of the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> my Lord, and his Lordſhip ſent me
to a Sollicitor of his, whoſe Name was Mr. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
(the Perſon is now in Court) to take an account
how far he had proceeded in this Affair. I did take
an Account, and I proceeded in it afterwards and got
him diſcharged.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Dangerfield,</speaker>
               <p>That was the firſt time, when my
Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ſent me with that Letter, my Lord. A
pretty while after this, in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> I went
to wait upon his Lordſhip at his Houſe in <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi>
the ſame place where I found his Lordſhip before;
and I was to take his Advice a bout ſome Letters that
came from one <hi>Nevil alias Paine.</hi> Thoſe Letters and
Liſt of Names I ſhewed his Lordſhip, and he gave
his Approbation of them, and deſired good ſtore of
Copies might be writ: for it was of conſequence
and ought not to be neglected. And ask'd me, Are
there working Perſons employ'd in that buſineſs?
And ſaid he, Encourage them, and I will pay my
part. So my Lord, after there were a great number
of Copies writ of theſe Letters, I writ a Letter to
my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> to let his Lordſhip know that
the People had finiſh'd their work, and that there
was ſomething more to be done as a Gratuity; and
then his Lordſhip in Anſwer to this Meſſenger (who
is here alſo in Court) with a Letter his Lordſhip ſent
Forty Shillings for his part. And Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> told
me ſhe received Forty Shillings and diſpoſed of it to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44372:23"/>
the uſe intended; now, my Lord, the Contents of
theſe Letters were to the ſame effect with thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and looſe Papers which I conveyed into Collonel
<hi>Manſell</hi>'s Chamber; and theſe all tended to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Sham-plot, my Lord.</p>

they received an Account from one Mr. <hi>Paine,</hi> I

a Ground or Scheme of the Presbyterian Plot;

ſo that when I came to Diſcourſe with the Lords in

Plot; and Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ſaid, This

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Dangerfield,</speaker>
               <p>Now, my Lord, ſome conſiderable
time after I had gotten <hi>Lane</hi> out of Priſon, I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by ſeveral other perſons, his Lordſhip was one,
and he ſent me to his Lordſhips Sollicitor, that is now in
Court. A pretty while after this, and the Letters and
Liſts of Names, containing matter to the ſame effect
as I told you before, as thoſe in <hi>Manſell</hi>'s Chamber,
and all tending to the Credit of the Sham Plot, or the
Presbyterian Plot. Now, my Lord, a pretty while after
this, in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> as near as I can remember; about the
middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I went to wait upon his Lordſhip,
the very next day after I had been treated withal in
the <hi>Tower</hi> to kill the King, whom God preſerve, my
Lord; and his Lordſhip had a Servant then in the
Room, and he ſent his Servant down Stairs, and
looked upon me with a very Auſtere Countenance:
Said he, Why would you offer to refuſe the buſineſs
for which you were taken out of Priſon?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Dangerfield,</speaker>
               <p>No body, but his Lordſhip and my
ſelf; for he ſent his Servant out before: So he asked
me, Why I would offer to refuſe the buſineſs I was
taken out of Priſon for? I asked his Lordſhip, What
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44372:24"/>
that was? Said he, Was not you at the <hi>Tower</hi> yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?
Yes, my Lord, I was. Would your Lordſhip
have me Kill the King, I ſuppoſe that's the buſineſs.
Yes, that is, ſaid he Upon which my Lord fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch a fury, that I was fore'd rudely to leave the
Room, and went down Stairs. I think at the ſame
time his Lordſhip was writing the Compendium of
the late Plot; for there I ſaw ſome words in a Paragraph
that lay upon the Table, which I afterwards ſaw in
that Book. There was Ink ſet upon the Table, and
open in his Lordſhips hand. And his Lordſhip did
uſe in his Diſcourſe to call his Majeſty Tyrant.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Dangerfield,</speaker>
               <p>In his familiar Diſcourſe. As to
ask when his Majeſty will return from <hi>Windſor?</hi> Says
he, When the Tyrant pleaſes. And I remember
I heard his Lordſhip mention the word Tyrant to
Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> at <hi>Powis-houſe.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, he was in a great rage,
as his Lordſhip is very cholerick; he was buſtling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and I knew not what he intended to do, and
I was unwilling to ſtand the Teſt of his Anger. His
Lordſhip ſeemed by his look to be meditating Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>

               <p>I ſay this, After his Lordſhip had
ſent his Servant out of the Room, ſaid he, Why would
you offer to refuſe the buſineſs for which you were
taken out of Priſon? Said he, Were not you at the
<hi>Tower</hi> yeſterday? Said I, Yes, my Lord, I was; Would
you have me kill the King? Is that the buſineſs? Yes,
that it is, ſaid my Lord very angrily.</p>

               <p>The Firſt thing I deſire to do, is, here are
two Gentlemen gives in Evidence againſt me, the
one is Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> the other Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
ſays, That he in <hi>Spain</hi> did ſee ſeveral Letters from
me: That when he came over into <hi>England,</hi> he
brought a Letter from <hi>Spain</hi> to me, that that Letter
was given to the Provincial, and the Provincial (he
ſuppoſes) gave it me. Now, my Lord, I only deſire
this, that the firſt thing that ſhall be done, is, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44372:25"/>
you will pleaſe to call Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> who will ſhew you
what a kind of Man Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is. And I am glad,
ſince you ſay that Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is a good Witneſs,
that I can prove that every word he ſays is a lie. And
ſo begin with Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I would offer you a Record,
a Record of ſome particular Actions from <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, the caſe is only this, My Lord,
I will tell you, here is Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> this is only to ſhew
what kind of Man this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> he
comes and accuſes a Man at <hi>Haſtings</hi> for Buggery,
there he is Indicted and comes to his Tryal, and then
he is found Innocent: Now, my Lord, I ſent for
this Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> to tell your Lordſhip what kind of
man this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was, and for that purpoſe ſhew
the whole proceeding.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you ſhall have all the Juſtice in
the World; but we muſt have right done to the Kings
Evidence. You have brought in a thing, whereby all
you can make againſt Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is this, That he
was the Proſecutor of a Man for the Crime of Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
and is ſuppoſed to have taken his Oath there,
and notwithſtanding the Jury would not believe him,
and found the Man not Guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I come to ſhew you the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
how the Jury came to clear him, that is, by
proving this man was in another place at that time,
and ſatisfied the Court and Jury, that he was from
Eleven a Clock or ſooner, till Eight or Ten a Clock
with them in Company; where it was only the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
that was between <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Parker.</hi> And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Witneſſes that were in the place where he ſaid the
Buggery was committed, ſaid that he was not there,
and they Witneſſes poſitively ſaid they were with him,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44372:25"/>
and all looked upon Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> as a deteſtable man,
and ſent him out of the Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Do you prove this by any but <hi>Parker?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Raymond,</speaker>
               <p>This ought not to be admitted; for if
it be, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſtands here to anſwer all the Faults
that ever he committed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Here is the Caſe, Suppoſing it be true now,
that Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> proſecuted a man for Felony, and
he gave Teſtimony, ſuppoſing it ſhould be ſo, and yet
the Jury acquitted him; What uſe can you make of
it? You can make no Inference; it is a thing we muſt
allow all the Juries in <hi>England:</hi> For there is Witneſs
generally given on both ſides, and when there are
for the Plantiff, the Defendants Evidence are all
Perjured, and when for the Defendant the Plaintiffs
Evidence are Perjured.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, this is the Inference. Thus much
I make of it, that this <hi>Parker</hi> is Innocent. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears
poſitively he did ſo, the other ſwears poſitively this man
was not there, to ſhew the Malice <hi>Oates</hi> had againſt him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, you can go no further than you
have gone. The reſult of all is, that the Jury found
him not Guilty: For what grounds no man can come
to ſay, but the Jury men themſelves. No man can
tell what prevailed with the Jury to find him not
Guilty, that is in their own Conſciences, and theſe
are things that cannot be Examined. His Jury, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was the only Proſecutor, they
found him not Guilty, and it amounts to nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is another thing, while
this man was in Priſon, what does <hi>Oates</hi> do, but comes
here to <hi>London,</hi> accuſes the Father, who was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
man in the Town, a Juſtice of the Peace,
and Mayor the year before; accuſes him becauſe he
ſhould not aſſiſt his Son, accuſes him before the
King of ſpeaking ſcandalous words. Then he gets
him by a Meſſenger brought up before the Council,
the King was preſent at the hearing, and there it
was proved to the King, as the order of Council
ſhews, that he was an honeſt man, and ſo the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44372:26"/>
ſent <hi>Oates</hi> away with the greateſt contempt, and
freed the other man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Was this before the Plot was diſcovered?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, in purſuance of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You ſaid it was that he ſhould not help his
Son, his Son was not free.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>No, he was in Priſon, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Recorder,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, may think hard if he hath not
ſome competent liberty; but he muſt keep to the
buſineſs. You ſay, that notwithſtanding he hath the
Opinion of the Court, that the Jury muſt take notice,
then the Jury muſt take notice it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>Very well. Having told you this, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you would be pleaſed to take notice, after <hi>Oates</hi>
was thus forced to run away from <hi>Haſtings,</hi> here it
ſeems he was converted to be a Papiſt, by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whom Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath ſince converted to be a
Proteſtant; and you ſhall ſee what an Account this
Gentleman will give of him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſoner,</speaker>
               <p>Several things, my Lord.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt not do it. If you are able to

may do it. If you alledg Teſtimony againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

I will tell you my Lord what you ſhall expect, I will
not be for one and not for t'other; but be equal as near as
I can. If he comes only to teſtifie what <hi>Hilſley</hi> told him,
it ſignifies nothing.</p>

               <p>This is only Diſcourſe what another man ſays.
If Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> himſelf ſhould have ſaid ſo, then indeed it is

not, That long before they heard of the Name of <hi>Oates,</hi>
this Gentlemau ſhould tell them one <hi>Oates</hi> was left at St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;</hi>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, You will be ſatisfied, when we have
acquainted you what the ordinary Proceedings of a Court
of Juſtice are in this Nature; what is, and what is not to
be admitted. If you ſhould come to prove Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had
falſly ſworn a thing in another Court, and five or ſix Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ſhall come and ſay it is not true; we are not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to it. The reaſon is this, firſt you muſt have him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
and we are not now to try, Whether that thing ſworn
in another place be true or falſe? Becauſe that is the way
to accuſe whom you pleaſe; and that may make a man a
Liar, that cann't imagine this will be put to him: and ſo
no mans teſtimony that comes to be a Witneſs, ſhall leave
himſelf ſafe. And this is another Caſe, If he ſwore in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place what is contradictory to what he ſays now;
then it is proper. If you could prove that he had ſworn
in another place that he never ſaw you, it is very proper:
but now to us he ſays, That he doth not remember whether
ever he had ſeen a Divorce, or that you had ſued out a
Divorce. All that he remembers is, That you ſaid, you
had expended a great deal of money about a Divorce, and
that is all he teſtifies here.</p>

               <p>My Lord, my Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> is

if he lies in one thing, he may in another.</p>

my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> doth deny that ſhe ever ſent a Letter by him

ſtands indicted of: It is for attempting to murder the King,
and change our Government and our Religion. To prove
this, there hath been Two Witneſſes only that are material,
and that is Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in the firſt place, and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

               <p>If you would be ſhort, Mr. <hi>Atturney,</hi> we would
not hinder you of any thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>I'll be very ſhort.</p>
               <p>If it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
My Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> is here charged with High Treaſon.
The proof that we have againſt him is by two Witneſſes,
that is, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> he doth
ſwear this, namely, That after the Conſult (for I will bring
it in ſhort) that after the Conſult that was for killing the <hi>King</hi>
and altering the <hi>Government,</hi> my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it at Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber, did hope it good
ſucceſs, and that he ſhould come to be reveng'd. Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi>
he hath proved, That being treated with to kill the
<hi>King,</hi> and having refuſed to do it, my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
angry with him for it; and ſaid, <hi>Why wan't you do that for
which you were taken out of Priſon?</hi> Here are two Witneſſes
expreſs. What is ſaid againſt Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſignifies nothing. As
to Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> there are ſome Exceptions, which we muſt
confeſs to be true; but he is a Witneſs, and my Lord, ſuch
matters are to be expected to be proved by ſuch Witneſſes:
for if a man will diſcover Robberies, he muſt go to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as do ſuch things; and if Treaſons, it muſt be among
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44372:36"/>
them that have been employed in ſuch things. Though he
were a diſhoneſt man before, yet he may be honeſt now. He
was never guilty of any Treaſon but as he was employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. There are ſome Witneſſes brought to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, and one is my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> who, as he ſays, ſent him
with a Letter to my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain;</hi> but ſhe ſays ſhe did
never ſend a Letter by him: And others ſay he would never
come at my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> after he was angry, which was
in <hi>June.</hi> Now for that, Gentlemen, you do hear <hi>Turner</hi> ſay,
That in <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for he can't tell which, he thinks it
might be <hi>July,</hi> he ſaw <hi>Dangerfield</hi> at my Lord <hi>Caſtlemains;</hi>
ſo that that encounters that Evidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If Mr. Atturney had not interrupted me, I would not have
left out any thing of this nature; for I would be certainly careful,
where the Kings life lies at Stake. I would be ſure to preſerve my
Sovereign above all things, and therefore no man ought to think that
I ſhould be partial in a Cauſe wherein our Religion and the Life of
the King and the Government is in danger. But I muſt ſay on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, That there ſhould be good competent Proofs of theſe
things againſt thoſe accuſed, becauſe their Lives and Fortunes, and
Honours, and a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l are at ſtake. And ſo, Gentlemen, we ſhall diſcharge
our Conſciences to the beſt of our underſtandings, and deal uprightly
on both hands.</p>
               <p>For the Caſe it ſtands thus, It is truly obſerved by Mr. Atturney,
That there are but two material Witneſſes to the Charge of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
that is to ſay, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his
Teſtimony is in two things, the one cloſe, the other is more remote.
That more remote, is, That he had a Letter to ſend to my Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlemain,</hi>
which he gave to the Provincial to ſend it, and as he ſays,
he ſaw a Letter ſubſcribed <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and that afterwards by ſeeing
him write a Superſcription, he could recollect the Character ſo well,
that he believed that to be his hand which he ſaw in <hi>Spain</hi> among
the Jeſuits, or the Fathers, as they call them there, to whom they
communicated that Letter; wherein he mentioned the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that is, the bringing in Popery; which is the bringing in the
Catholick Religion, as they call it. That is more remote. He ſays
there were Letters paſt between them, wherein my Lord approved
of ſome things and diſapproved of others, which related to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
by which, ſays Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> we meant the whole Matter and
Tranſaction of Killing the King; and that doth appear by that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he ſaw of my Lord <hi>Caſtlemains,</hi> for that annexes to Deſign the
advancing the Catholick Religion. The firſt time he ſaw him, he did
not know who he was, and there, at <hi>Wild houſe,</hi> he ſays, That my
Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> ſhould drop out ſome words which were ſuſpicious,
and one thing as if he underſtood ſomething of this matter that they
had then in agitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44372:37"/>
But more particularly, he ſays, That when he came to <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s
Chamber, there was the great matter. They talk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d before but of the
Deſign in general, at <hi>Wlld houſe;</hi> but afterwards meeting in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn
Fields,</hi> where he was told who he was, they went to <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>'s
Chamber, where they fell a diſcourſing about ſeveral things
that related to the Concern, and at laſt they tell upon the matter in
hand, and ſaid, They were glad to ſee the Fathers ſo unanimous
in this ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter. I asked about what matter? He ſaid, The Killing
of the King and bringing in Popery: To which he ſays, That
my Lord ſhould make Anſwer, He wiſhed them good ſucceſs
in their Deſign, and that then he ſhould be revenged. This
is the ſubſtance of what Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays: Againſt whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
I muſt tell you there hath been but little. There is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thrown upon Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> by way of diſgrace and infamy. For that
Verdict that the Jury ſound againſt his Evidence, it is not material;
for then every man muſt be accuſed, when the Jury does not go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the teſtimony he gives. It is not to be denied, but there
is ſomething ſaid againſt him in another particular, and that is his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
over from St. <hi>Om<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs,</hi> where he ſays that Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with him in the Pacquet Boat, but Mr. <hi>Hilſl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> denies it. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
would have ſalved it, by ſaying he left him at St. <hi>Omers.</hi> 'Tis true,
ſays Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> but I overtook him afterwards: but he ſays to the
point, that he came not with him. Now it is not denied on the other
hand, but Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> might be here, and my Lord of <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi>
ſeems to admit it, and it is probable enough Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> might be here.
This is all I remember in reference to Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> You muſt weigh
well with your ſelves how probable or not probable, what he does
ſwear is. But I muſt tell the Jury they are to weigh the natures of
people among themſelves, as they carry probability or not, or elſe the
confidence of a Swearer ſhall take away any man's life whatſoever.
And to that that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays firſt, I underſtand not how he ſhould
be ſo free, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being a Stranger to him, when he knew not my
Lord, and doth not know whether my Lord knew him or no. But
he ſays, my Lord muſt needs ſee the Jeſuits truſted him, and that
might make him more confident: That afterwards going to <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>'s
Houſe, he ſpake broader; in plain Engliſh. They were talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Deſign to kill the King and bring in the Catholick Religion,
and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays, he wiſhed them good ſucceſs in the Deſign, and
that then he ſhould be revenged. How far this Oath is to be taken
or not, I muſt leave to your Conſideration.</p>
               <p>The next is Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> for nothing infamous is proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Mr. <hi>Oates. Dangerfield</hi> is a man of whom there is enough.
You ſee what Crimes there are, for it is the Duty of every Judge,
and I can't ſee how he can diſcharge his Conſcience, and the Duty he
ows to the Government, in reſpect of his Oath and Place, if he doth
not make thoſe juſt Obſervations to the Jury which are done in all
Caſes: That is to ſay, when men have contracted great Crimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves, though by Law they may be Witneſſes; yet it hath
always been obſerved, and their Credit left to them to conſider of.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44372:37"/>
You ſee how many Crimes they have produced, a matter of ſix great
enormous Crimes; and by them you will ſee how far you ought to
conſider his teſtimony. Had Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> been guilty only of
being concern'd in the Treaſon, and come in as a Witneſs, I ſhould
have thought him a very competent Witneſs; for that is Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
his Caſe: but they prove Crimes of another ſort and nature, and
whether the man of a ſudden be become a Saint, by being become
a Witneſs, I leave that to you to conſider; and how far you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the main.</p>
               <p>The next thing is the oppoſition to his Teſtimony. He hath
ſworn that he carried a Letter from my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> to my Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlemain,</hi>
and an Anſwer return'd Lack from my Lord to her, and
that my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> did read it in the preſence of Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> and
him. Of this my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> hath been asked (it is true they are
not upon their Oaths, but that is not their fault, the Law will not
allow it) and my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> hath affirmed to it, as much as lay
upon her to do, that ſhe never ſent a Letter by Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to
my Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine,</hi> nor any Body elſe. And whereas he ſay's Mrs.
<hi>Cellier</hi> was preſent, ſhe ſays, ſhe knows of no ſuch Letter, nor was
any read in her company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is a contradicting his Evidence,
ſuppoſing him to be a man otherwiſe untouch'd. And whereas <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi>
ſays that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> he was with my Lord, and he ſaid, How
chance you would not do that thing for which you were brought
out of Priſon? <hi>What? would you have me kill the King? Yes,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>that it is.</hi> And my Lord ſpeaking very angrily and very rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
made him think it time to with-draw out of his company, and
never come into his company more; and that this was the time of
his anger, and no other time; my Lord rather complementing him,
as he would ſay, with friendly ſalutations. But they produce Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
againſt this. Says Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> this day Twelve-month, and
ſays t'other about a week after the Jeſuits were executed, which was
about the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> ſaith ſhe, I would have you carry a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain:</hi> Saith he, I would not do that, I would
go an Hundred miles upon another Errand, but I would not go to
him. Another Witneſs ſays, my Lord was mighty angry with him,
and told him the cauſe, becauſe he went in his Name to the Lords
in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Firſt, This contradicts what he ſaid, as if there
had been no anger before. The next is, That it is very improbable
that my Lord ſhould be angry with him ſo much, that my Lord
ſhould be very angry with him for going in his Name to the <hi>Tower,</hi>
and afterwards for his refuſing to kill the King; when he ſaid, <hi>Why
did you not do that you came out of Priſon for? What, my Lord,
to kill the King? Yes, that.</hi> This is an Argument in oppoſition
to his Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The next is a Conſideration for his Teſtimony, <hi>Turner</hi>-ſays in an
ſwer to that, In <hi>July</hi> he takes it, but cann't charge himſelf, whether
<hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> or <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but he himſelf thinks <hi>July;</hi> that he ſaw
him at the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>'s Houſe. And the Kings Council would
gather from that, there could not be ſuch an unwillingneſs to go
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44372:38"/>
before that time, it being after the time they ſpeak of, that this
man ſaw him there. Whether or no it was in <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> or
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> is ſomething uncertain. So that I have repeated as near as
I can all that is ſubſtantial on either part, and I have according to
the beſt of my underſtanding dealt fairly on both ſides; and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to you what hath been ſworn againſt my Lord, and what hath
been ſaid in contradiction to what they ſwear; and what appears
upon Record, as to <hi>Dangerfield.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a great deal of difference between Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s; for you may believe one, when you
may perchance not believe another. There are not thoſe things caſt
upon Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> that are upon Mr. <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> Now I muſt tell
you, though they have produced two, if you believe but one, I
think (if ſo be my Brethrens Opinions be otherwiſe, I would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
willingly contradicted in this matter) if two Witneſſes are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
both ſpeaking materially to the thing, the one is believed and
the other not, Whether upon theſe two Witneſſes the Jury can find
a Perſon Guilty, or no? I am of Opinion it is but one Witneſs, if
you don't believe one; and I am ſure one is not ſufficient to find one
Guilty; and therefore if ſo be you are of another Opinion, let us
deal fairly and above-board; that it may appear we deal rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and his Subjects, and ſo preſerve men that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
and not guilty.</p>
