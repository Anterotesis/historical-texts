            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Clear Proof.</note> A Clear Proof of the Certainty and Uſefulneſs of the Proteſtant Rule of Faith, <hi>Scripture,</hi> after the Help of <hi>Miniſterial Guides,</hi> finally Interpreted by <hi>each Man</hi>'s private Senſe.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> A Title ſeemingly belonging to a Proteſtant Book, and a Book wrote by a Proteſtant, if the Title and Book do agree: But that they are ſo far from, that if Truth and Ability had been on the Author's ſide, it might have been more truly call'd, with reſpect to his Deſign, <hi>A clear Diſproof of the Certainty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But why ſo much Caution? Why is not the <hi>Addreſs</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to it, ſo much as named in the Title? We are left to gueſs; and becauſe every man may in ſuch a caſe uſe his liberty, I could upon Peruſal of his Book, gueſs at no reaſon ſooner, than that the <hi>Prover</hi> was not very confident of the ſufficiency of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and might by ſuch a clandeſtine Title, ſecure himſelf againſt a further Reply; unleſs his Adverſary had nothing elſe to do than to read all the Pamphlets printed by <hi>H.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95556:3"/>
Chance ſhould make the Diſcovery. And to ſay the truth, the <hi>Prover</hi> might have ſucceeded in his Deſign, and have triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Victory he had thus ſecretly ſtollen, had not a little Accident, though ſomewhat late firſt, brought it under his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's eye.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Clear Proof.</note> This proof is drawn from the Anſwer to the Addreſs preſented to the <hi>Miniſters of the Church of England.</hi> The Author thereof had required that clear and plain Texts of Scripture be offer'd, which interpreted in the <hi>Proteſtant way,</hi> by thoſe who receive it thus expounded for their whole Rule of Faith, ſhould ſo prove the two principal Articles of Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, the <hi>Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as alſo the Obligation of keeping holy the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and not <hi>Saturday,</hi> as one of the Commandments ſeems to require; and that ſo convincingly, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> might ground on them his Faith. Interpreted, I ſay, in the Proteſtant-way, without any <hi>deciding</hi> Church-Authority when doubts ariſe about the ſenſe of the Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> The <hi>Prover</hi>'s Deſign is to expoſe the Proteſtant Rule of Faith, and to that end, becauſe he had no better way, is forced to Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent it. For thus he ſaith, <hi>Scripture interpreted in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way, is received by them, thus expounded, for their whole Rule of Faith.</hi> But he well knew, or ſhould know, that the Scripture is with Proteſtants, a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> as it's the Word of God, and their <hi>whole</hi> Rule of Faith, as it's the only Word of God, and ſo is as uncapable of taking in any humane Expoſition to be a part of that Rule, as it is of any new Revelation. That is, the Scripture depends not upon the ſenſe given it by any man, or Order of men for its being thus a Rule, but upon its own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he ventures a little further by way of Explication.</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> interpreted in the Proteſtant way, without any deciding Church-Authority, when doubts ariſe about the Senſe of the Letter.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing there are no <hi>doubts about the ſenſe of the Letter;</hi> then it ſeems there is in that caſe no uſe of any ſuch <hi>deciding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and that we may be certain of the ſenſe of the Letter without ſuch Authority. If ſo, then it would be known of what kind that Certainty is, which may be attained without ſuch Authority, and whether it be not attained by the uſe of Reaſon and Underſtanding; and ſo is at laſt reſolved into what he decries, <hi>Private Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95556:3"/>
But put the caſe as he would have it, and ſuppoſing there be a <hi>doubt about the ſenſe of the Letter,</hi> I demand whether we may not by the like uſe of our Reaſon, arrive to the ſame ſort of certainty in the things we now doubt of, as we have arrived to in the things we are at preſent certain of, without any <hi>deciding Church-Authority?</hi> As for example: Suppoſe a <hi>doubt ariſeth</hi> about this deciding Church-Authority it ſelf, how ſhall the doubt be decided? If we ſeek to the <hi>deciding Church-Authority,</hi> that is the thing in queſtion; if we repair to the Scripture, the Senſe of that is to be declared and determined by the <hi>deciding Church-Authority;</hi> and if we take any other meaſures for underſtanding it, we fall into the dangerous and abhorr'd extreme, of <hi>finally interpreting it by private Senſe:</hi> So that either the matter is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of proof, and muſt be taken for granted; and there is a <hi>deciding Church-Authority</hi> becauſe there is ſo: or elſe if it be to be proved, it muſt be by the ſame way that other things are proved in, and that is by producing the Reaſons for it, and according to the Judgment made upon it thereby, it's ultimately to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. And then farewel to the <hi>deciding Church-Authority,</hi> when in a matter of ſo great Conſequence, and the firſt Point to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in, it muſt be ſubmitted to <hi>each mans private Senſe.</hi>

As for example; if we ask, Whether the Scripture be their <hi>whole Rule of Faith?</hi> He anſwers, Scripture <hi>rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> is a Rule of Faith; the Goſpel revealed by Chriſt, and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> by the Catholick Church, is their whole Rule of Faith. Is it asked again, Whether there are <hi>no new Revelations, no new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles received as of Catholick Faith?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>Theſe Truths are only received which the Church propoſes as delivered to her by the Apoſtles.</hi> The meaning of which Phraſes, <hi>the Goſpel rightly underſtood,</hi> and <hi>preſerved by the Church,</hi> and <hi>the Truths which the Church propoſes as</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Clear Proof.</note> Scripture thus interpreted is a Catholick Rule of Faith; the <hi>Addreſſer</hi> therefore meant nothing leſs than to diminiſh its Divine Authority; his deſign was to preſerve it, and that each mans private ſenſe might not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly pretend to be that <hi>Word of God,</hi> which, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> minds us, <hi>is not of private Interpretation;</hi> 'Tis not againſt the Authority or Uſe of Scripture he writ, but againſt the Proteſtants unjuſt and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant method of uſing it. I will here make good the Charge, (hoping, that when he thinks fit, he will much more fully perform it) by the very anſwers given to his Queſtions, which I ſhall ſet down in that Order and Senſe in which the Anſwerer conſtrued them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> Here he tells us, <hi>'Tis not againſt the Authority or uſe of Scripture the Addreſſer writ.</hi> The Divine Authority of Scripture conſiſts in its being of Divine Revelation, and the reaſon for which it was revealed, is for the uſe, inſtruction, and ſalvation of mankind. But if it be inſufficient for attaining that end, and either is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in what is neeeſſary, or is writ in a way ſo obſcure and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious that it's not to be underſtood by thoſe for whom it was written, it's certainly a Revelation unworthy of God, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable argument againſt its Divine Authority. And therefore he that undertakes to prove this, muſt, if he be in earneſt, have a very mean opinion of that Divine Book, and deſigns to bring others to the like opinion of it. But this is the apparent deſign of the <hi>Addreſſer,</hi> who argues all along againſt the ſufficiency and perſpicuity of Scripture, even in thoſe points which our Author owns to be <hi>the two principal Articles of Chriſtian Belief,</hi> the Trinity and the Incarnation of Chriſt; clearly giving away the Cauſe to the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and frankly acknowledging, nay
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95556:4"/>
venturing in his way to prove, that the Texts uſually inſiſted on by the Orthodox in proof of thoſe Articles, are not ſufficient for it. So that in concluſion, if the Scripture be ſo perplex'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, ſo doubtful and ambiguous, ſo unintelligible and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient a Rule, they may as well lay aſide the Scripture, as that Father did the obſcure Poet, with an, <hi>If thou art not to be underſtood, thou art not fit to be read.</hi> And yet after all this charge inſinuated all along in the <hi>Addreſs</hi> againſt the Scripture, <hi>'Tis not yet againſt the Authority or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it he writ.</hi> What then did he write againſt? It was <hi>againſt the Proteſtants unjuſt and inſignificant method of uſing it; and that each mans private ſenſe might not ſacrilegiouſly pretend to be that word of God, which, as St.</hi> Peter <hi>minds us, is not of private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</hi> I muſt confeſs if <hi>each</hi> or any mans private ſenſe be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the Word of God, it's both <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> and <hi>Sacrilegious,</hi> ſince nothing can be the Word of God, but what is by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſpiration. But where are they that thus pretend? What reaſon is there for this charge? Theſe are things he takes for granted, but inſinuates that this is done by the Proteſtants, who interpret Scripture by their own <hi>private ſenſe.</hi> But why will this any more prove that becauſe they interpret Scripture by their own ſenſe, they pretend their ſenſe to be the Word of God; than it follows that thoſe that reſolve all into a <hi>deciding Church-Authority,</hi> do therefore pretend that the ſenſe given by that Authority is the Word of God? For I preſume after all, that they will not dare to ſay ſuch their Interpretations are as much the Word of God, as the Word is, which they are the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of. However, he intimates, it's <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture by each mans private ſenſe, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> minds us the <hi>Word of God is not of private Interpretation.</hi> But ſurely the Apoſtle doth not therein include the uſing and underſtanding of Scripture by private perſons, as if that was forbidden, when he tells them they did <hi>well to give heed to it,</hi> ver. 19. Neither did he ſuppoſe they were uncapable of underſtanding it, when he calls it a <hi>light,</hi> and unto which they were to <hi>give heed till the day dawn,</hi> &amp;c. Nor farther will the Apoſtles Argument admit of any ſuch Expoſition, which is thus, <hi>Ye ought to give heed to the Scripture, for it's not of private Interpretation; for holy men of God ſpake as they were moved;</hi> that is, Scripture is the Interpretation of God's will, the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt; and though wrote by men, is not of humane invention, nor was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Clear Proof.</note> But the caſe in this firſt Queſtion, as it appears ſtated by the Addreſſer, is, Whether all things neceſſary to Salvation are <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>expreſly</hi> contain`d in Scripture, or drawn thence by an <hi>evident</hi> Conſequence? Our Anſwerer proves they are ſo, by the three following Texts; his Proofs I will ſet in a due form, that their force may lie open to all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Text is taken out of</hi> Joh. <hi>20. 31. where the</hi> Evangeliſt <hi>having premiſed, (v. 30.)</hi> Many other ſigns alſo did Jeſus in the ſight of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are not written in this Book; <hi>ſays, v. 31.</hi> Theſe <hi>(which he had ſet down)</hi> are written that you may believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and that believing you may have Life in his Name. <hi>Now what Concluſion can be drawn from this Text to our preſent purpoſe, but one, in one of theſe two forms? Firſt thus:</hi> The ſigns ſet down by <hi>St.</hi> John, <hi>Ch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</hi> are ſufficient to make us believe that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to believe that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God, is all that is neceſſary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95556:6"/>
to have Life in his name, or to Salvation; therefore the <hi>20</hi>th. Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi> contains all things neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Or elſe thus, in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer's words:</hi> All that is as ſufficient in its kind to beget Faith in us, as Faith is to ſave us, contains all things neceſſary to Salvation; But the <hi>20</hi>th Chapter of St. <hi>John`s</hi> Goſpel, as it appears by <hi>ver. 31.</hi> is as ſufficient to beget Faith in us; therefore that <hi>20</hi>th Chapter contains all things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>A ſpecial piece of Logic! However his Concluſion eaſes the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Congregation from the Obligation of reading any part of Scripture beſides the 20</hi>th <hi>Chapter of St.</hi> John<hi>'s Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> Our Author from his love to <hi>Logic,</hi> and his Skill in it, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to <hi>ſet the Anſwerer's Proofs in a due form.</hi> But by his leave, I ſhall put in a ſmall Charge or two againſt it. As</p>
            <p>The firſt Charge I have againſt what he calls a ſetting the Proofs <hi>in a due form,</hi> is, that his Concluſion is falſe in its form, as his Syllogiſm has four Terms in it: For ſaith he, <hi>The ſigns ſet down by St.</hi> John 20. <hi>are ſufficient to make us believe Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God; but Preciſely, to believe that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God, is all that is neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>preciſely</hi> to believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, is to believe that and no more. Whereas, by that Phraſe, the Scripture implies the believing the whole Goſpel. So Joh. 11. 27. <hi>I believe that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> Acts 8. 37. <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> 1 John 5. 5. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He puts his Query too extravagantly. <hi>Now what Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be drawn from this Text to our preſent purpoſe, but one—therefore the</hi> 20<hi>th Chapter of St.</hi> John <hi>contains all things neceſſary.</hi> This is a Concluſion of his own forming, and before he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, muſt ask two or three things, which he may be ſure will never be granted him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He takes it for granted, that by <hi>theſe</hi> in St. <hi>John,</hi> are to be underſtood only the <hi>Signs</hi> ſet down in that Chapter.</p>
            <p>Whereas (1.) St. <hi>John</hi> in the former Verſe, ſpeaking of the Signs done by Jeſus, ſaith they <hi>are not written in this Book,</hi> but <hi>theſe are written.</hi> Where? Not in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> (for to ſay the truth on't, whatever our Author thinks, St. <hi>John</hi> did not divide <note place="margin">De Verbo l. 4. c. 10. <hi>ſſ. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeo ad pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
               </note>his Goſpel into Chapters) but in that <hi>Book.</hi> And thus inded <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> underſtands it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95556:6"/>
But (2.) The Apoſtle further enlarges this Phraſe, Chap. 21. 24, 25. <hi>This is the Diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things—And there are alſo many other things which Jeſus did.</hi> And ſo what is true of the <hi>Signs,</hi> is alſo true of the other things wrote by that Evangeliſt.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Tho St. <hi>John</hi> ſpoke this more eſpecially of the things writ by himſelf, yet the ſame is applicable to what was wrote by the reſt of the Divine Writers: And it might be ſaid of what was written by them, as well as of what was written by him, <hi>Theſe are written that ye might believe.</hi> And this was the uſe made of this place of St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Anſwer, viz.</hi> to ſhew what was the end the Scripture was written for, and the ſufficiency of Scripture in order to that end; and this that Quotation proves; for if any part, and much more the whole of Scripture <hi>was written that they might believe;</hi> Surely then they might believe by reading what was written. Thus it was argued in the Anſwer, p. 3. <hi>The Scripture muſt fail of its end, and we of the Salvation therein reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if that be not as ſufficient in its kind to beget Faith in us, as Faith is to ſave us.</hi> For ſaith St. <hi>John, Theſe things are written,</hi> &amp;c. So that inſtead of our Author's Concluſion, I ſhall give him two other, which contain the force of what was there ſaid; they are theſe. The end for which the things are written in Scripture, is that we might believe; but the things written would fail of the end for which they were written, if they are not ſufficient to beget that Faith in us, which they were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the means of. Again, If by the belief of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, we come to be ſaved (as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith) then the Scripture muſt contain all thoſe things which are neceſſary to be believed. But ſaith the <hi>Prover,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith all this of the <hi>Signs</hi> written in that Chapter: But that I have already prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or, if I ſhould ſay ſo, it's as tolerable, as it is for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to affirm, that all the uſeful ends for which Scripture was wrote, are to be found in the 2<hi>d</hi> Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> the ſhorteſt Book <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Verbo,</hi> l. 4. c. 10. <hi>ſſ. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</hi>
               </note>of Scripture. But however, here is a dreadful Charge at the heels of it. For, ſaith the <hi>Prover, The Concluſion eaſes the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Congregation from the Obligation of reading any part of Scripture, beſides the</hi> 20<hi>th Chapter of St.</hi> John<hi>'s Goſpel.</hi> We may gueſs to what Church our Author belongs, when he will have it an <hi>eaſe</hi> to the People, to be diſcharged from reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95556:7"/>
Tho at the ſame time, I wonder how he came to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the word <hi>Obligation:</hi> For how is this to be reconciled to the Practice of that Church, which <hi>eaſes</hi> the People of the whole, and permits them not to read the 20<hi>th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> nor any other part of Scripture, tho they are under a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Obligation</hi> ſo to do?</p>
            <p>But in the Name of <hi>Logic</hi> and the Univerſity our Author was of, how comes this Concluſion on, That if all things neceſſary to Salvation are contained in the 20<hi>th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> That <hi>therefore the People are eaſed from the Obligation of reading more?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ut ſupra.</note>I remember <hi>Bellarmin</hi> at this place argues much at this rate, If <hi>St.</hi> John<hi>'s Goſpel contains all things neceſſary, then the reſt of Scripture</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>C. 12.</hi> ſſ. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeo ad.</note>
               <hi>is Superfluous.</hi> But the ſame <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> when preſs'd another way, aſſerts, <hi>There are many things in Scripture, which of themſelves do not pertain to Faith, that is, which are not therefore written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">C. 11. <hi>ſſ. Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>they are neceſſary to be believed.</hi> And again, <hi>There may be things ſufficient for Baptiſm, but which ſuffice not abſolutely for the Church.</hi> So that it ſeems there are things neceſſary and ſufficient in one reſpect, and not in another; ſome neceſſary for Salvation abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, ſome for Edification. And therefore it follows not, that becauſe all things abſolutely neceſſary, are contained in ſome part of Scripture, therefore the others are <hi>Superfluous,</hi> and <hi>there is no Obligation to read them.</hi> For then it would alſo follow, that becauſe all things neceſſary are contained in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> therefore the Church in our Author's Phraſe, <hi>is eaſed from the Obligation of reading the old.</hi> And becauſe three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were converted by one Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. therefore all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what was contained in that Sermon, would have been <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Clear Proof.</note> The ſecond Text of Scripture is, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16 where the Apoſtle having thus warned <hi>Timothy</hi> immediately before, v. 14. <hi>Continue in thoſe things which thou haſt learnt, and are committed to thee, knowing of whom thou haſt learnt;</hi> by which words he renews the commands he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, <hi>O</hi> Timothy! <hi>keep the depoſitum; have a form of ſound words,</hi>

to every good work,</hi> Hence the Miniſter argues thus; <hi>The ſame Apoſtle that ſays all Scripture, (i. e.</hi> each part of Scripture) <hi>is given by Inſpiration of God, ſays that the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe to Salvation; But men cannot be wiſe to Salvation, without knowing what is neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> Here he leaves us, but I will make up the Syllogiſm; <hi>Therefere the Old Teſtament alone, nay every part of Scripture, contains all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> Thus you ſee the Miniſter reſts ſatisfied with the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> for his <hi>whole Rule of Faith.</hi> The truth is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> only teaches there, that the Teſtament, or any part of Scripture, is of good uſe, is <hi>profitable</hi> to inſtruct any one in the concerns of his Salvation. What's this to the containing of all neceſſaries to Salvation? Bread is of very good uſe to preſerve Life, and enables a man to perform all the duties of it; is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing elſe neceſſary? What pitiful ſhifts are theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> Here I muſt take leave to charge our Author with notorious Sophiſtry, not only from the falſe Conſtruction of his Syllogiſm (whether out of Ignorance or Deſign I know not) but alſo for the falſeneſs of the matter contained in it. The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> indeed undertook to prove the Scripture contains all things neceſſary to Salvation; and that <hi>we are as ſure of its ſufficiency in that kind, as we are of its Divine Authority: foraſmuch as the ſame Apoſtle that ſaid all Scripture is of Divine Inſpiration, doth alſo immediately before as poſitively affirm that the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16. This is the whole of what the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer</hi> ſaid upon this place; and now with what Conſcience could our Author charge this following Conſequence upon him? <hi>Hence the Miniſter argues thus, The ſame Apoſtle that ſays all Scripture</hi> (i. e. <hi>each part of Scripture) is given by Inſpiration of God, ſays that the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe to Salvation; but men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wiſe to Salvation, without knowing what is neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Is this He that ſaid he would <hi>ſet down the Anſwerers Proofs in due Form?</hi> Then God deliver us from ſuch Undertakers. In ſhort, it's very evident that the Argument in the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> reduced into <hi>due Form,</hi> is this; <hi>If the ſame Apoſtle ſaith the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, that ſaith they are of Divine Inſpiration, then we are as certain of their Sufficiency as we are of their Authority; but the ſame Apoſtle ſaith the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that ſaith they are of Divine Inſpiration: Therefore we are as certain of their Sufficiency as we are of their Authority.</hi> This is the Argument, and this I will abide by; and if our Author had been a fair Diſputant, he would have ſhewed how either the Premiſes were falſe, or the Concluſion not juſtly inferred from them; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95556:8"/>
ſince the place in which his Cauſe was moſt concerned, is <hi>ver.</hi> 15. that <hi>the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> he ſhould have directed his Anſwer to it; but he found it too hard for him, and ſo ſhuffles it off to the next verſe, <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas ſuppoſing that <hi>all Scripture</hi> there, was after his wild way (which I am not at preſent concerned to refute) to be applied <hi>to each part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> yet what is that to <hi>ver.</hi> 15. where it's ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the holy Scriptures,</hi> the ſame which <hi>Timothy</hi> had <hi>known from a child,</hi> are <hi>able to make wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> But though for fear of being engaged further, he durſt not undertake it; yet he inſinuates in an inference of his own, that it was the old Teſtament only that <hi>Timothy</hi> had read.</p>
            <p>But 1. How doth it appear that he read not alſo the Books of the New that were then extant, of which there were many? <note place="margin">Cap. 10. 8. Quod autem.</note>For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his Anſwer to this, only ſays, <hi>When this Epiſtle was writ, the Apocalypſe was not then extant, nor the Goſpel of</hi> John, <hi>and perhaps ſome other Book was wanting, of the Body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Thereby yielding, the reſt were then Written and Publiſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Old Teſtament was able to make them that then read it <hi>wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> then ſurely both Old and New is as ſufficient now, as the Old alone was then.

            <p>I ſhall ſtill therefore conclude, that the Scripture is not only profitable, but neceſſary; and not only neceſſary, but ſufficient to anſwer that end for which it was revealed and written; and that is, that <hi>we might believe,</hi> and <hi>be wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> Here our Author again prevaricates. The words in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> are theſe, <hi>From which Conſideration</hi> (that all things neceſſary are in Scripture) <hi>it was, that all doubts relating to Salvation were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be reſolved, which could not be, were not all things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation contained in it.</hi> In which there are theſe Two plain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, 1. That all doubts relating to Salvation might and were to be reſolved by Scripture. 2. That they could not be reſolved by Scripture, unleſs all things neceſſary to Salvation were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. The firſt of theſe, which is the chief thing to be proved, the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſhewed from <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 25, 26. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17, 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. In the firſt of theſe places, our Saviour upon the Queſtion put to him, <hi>Maſter, What ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> Replies, <hi>What is written in the Law? how readeſt thou?</hi> And he anſwcring, ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. To which our Saviour replies, v. 28. <hi>Thou haſt anſwered right, this do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſaith the <hi>Prover</hi> to this? His Anſwer from <hi>Bays,</hi> p. 7. might well be returned, were it ſeemly in ſo ſerious an Argument as we are upon. He is indeed ſilent, and (in his words elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) <hi>one may gueſs at the reaſon without caſting a Figure.</hi> The ſame Queſtion is again put to our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17. and our Saviour anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou knoweſt the commandments,</hi> &amp;c. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, That in the Law, of which the Decalogue was a part, there was the way preſcribed, by which Eternal Life was to be obtained.</p>
            <p>The Third place in the Anſwer is, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. where the Rich man in Hell intreating that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent to his Five brethren, <hi>leſt they come into that place of torment;</hi> he was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> And when he ſuppoſed that was not ſufficient, but <hi>if one went from the dead, they would repent; Abraham</hi> anſwers again, <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded,</hi> &amp;c. In which there are theſe things: Firſt it's ſuppoſed, That if they did repent, they would not come into that place of Torment. 2. That if they hearkned to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophers, they would repent. 3. That whatever was neceſſary to their Repentance, they might find, and was contained in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. What ſaith
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95556:9"/>
the <hi>Prover</hi> to this? Why, inſtead of an Anſwer, he will be at his <hi>Logic,</hi> and putting <hi>the Anſwerer's Proof in a due Form;</hi> which he uſhers in with great Triumph, <hi>Behold another Logical Inference, of great Credit to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>univerſity this Anſwerer was brought up in!</hi> Well, what is this <hi>Logical Inference?</hi> It's this, <hi>By reading Moſes and the Prophets, I am moved to repent of my ſins; and if I will know what I muſt do to inherit Eternal Life, I muſt know the Commandments; therefore all things neceſſary to Salvation, are contained in Scripture.</hi> If our <hi>Prover</hi>'s Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity be no better than his Logic, he is no more a Credit to his Religion, than he is to his Univerſity, if ever he was of one. Here's a defect in both, but which prevails is not eaſie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I can relieve him by no other way, but by ſuppoſing the Argument in the Anſwer gave him a Shock, and his Brain was out of order before his Inference. But without expoſing his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs further, I will ſet him right, and leave him to his Cell for the reſt. The <hi>Anſwerer</hi>'s Argument is this, when ſet in <hi>due form, If all queſtions and doubts relating to Salvation are to be reſolved by Scripture, then all things neceſſary to Salvation are contained in Scripture; but all queſtions and doubts relating to Salvation are to be reſolved by Scripture (as appears from the Texts quoted above) therefore,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall here return him my words again, becauſe in repeating he has perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, <hi>He takes up with ſuch a ſort of Arguments, which how uſeful ſoever they may prove</hi> [I will recall it, and ſay with him <hi>tho not uſeful] to make ſome men of their Religion, have a plainer tendency to</hi> (not as he corrupts them, <hi>may very well) make others of none.</hi>

               <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Whether all things neceſſary to Salvation are clearly contained in Scripture?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>From Scripture,</hi> not a word.</p>
            <p>However he condeſcends to deliver His ſenſe, and that of his Church, on this Qneſtion; It is, That all perſons cannot <hi>immediately</hi> learn all the neceſſaries to Salvation by <hi>meer reading</hi> of Scripture; that many other helps are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> to wit, <hi>attention, conſideration,</hi> to be cleared from <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> and <hi>prepoſſeſſions,</hi> from <hi>pride, love of the world, intereſt, obſtinacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, ſloth;</hi> and beſides all this, the aſſiſtance of <hi>teaching Guides,</hi> and a <hi>dependency</hi> from God for the Wiſdom he hath promiſed, (ſuch promiſes I find made to the Church, but not any to particulars that ſhall refuſe to be abſolutely guided by the Church;) <hi>So that Scripture is plain in this ſenſe only, that by theſe means it may be apprehended.</hi> Now by <hi>Guides</hi> he means <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15.</note>not falſe ones, ſuch as Chriſt bid us beware of, and conſequently till a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant hath a reaſonable conviction that his Church-Teachers, tho' di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Catholic Church, and condemned by General Councils, tho' Abettors of a Religion of not 150 years ſettlement, tho not in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95556:9"/>
with <hi>one</hi> Biſhop in the whole World out of His Majeſty's Dominions, yet ſtill are <hi>true Guides;</hi> and till he be morally ſure that he wants not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any one of the ten other diſpoſitions requir`d, is to perſuade himſelf that he may very well be one of thoſe who <hi>wreſt</hi> the Scripture <hi>to their perdition,</hi> and conſequently hath no good ground for any one Act of Faith. This will create but ſmall comfort to any Proteſtant. Leſs yet will he find in St. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Sentence, <hi>The things that are eaſie, are yet to Heretics hard to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In Jo. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> L. <hi>4.</hi> de Bapt. cont. Don c. <hi>16.</hi>

               <hi>underſtand;</hi> eſpecially if all thoſe be Heretics, according to St. <hi>Auguſtin, who when the Doctrine of Catholic Faith is declared to them, chuſe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and rather embrace what is their own ſenſe;</hi> if the Catholic Faith <note place="margin">L <hi>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> He ſaith that as to this ſecond Queſtion, there is <hi>from Scripture not a word</hi> in the <hi>Anſwer.</hi> And what needed it, when the ſame Texts that were brought to prove the Scripture contains all things neceſſary, do prove that it <hi>plainly</hi> contains them? As for inſtance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Theſe are written that ye might believe, and that believing ye might have life.</hi> Where the end for which they were written, which was <hi>that they might believe;</hi> and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom they were written, for all Chriſtians; ſufficiently prove, that they were for the manner ſo expreſt, as well as from the matter ſo evident, that they might believe.</p>
            <p>So again, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The Scriptures are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> If they were the Scriptures that <hi>Timothy knew from a child,</hi> and were able to make him <hi>wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> ſurely they were plain in thoſe things.</p>
            <p>So again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10 25. <hi>What is written in the Law? How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou?</hi> muſt needs imply the Law was plain to be read and underſtood. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets.</hi> But to what purpoſe, if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by them?</p>
            <p>But, 2. What proof would he have of this? Can he have any plainer proof, than from the things contained therein? <hi>Tolle lege,</hi> will ſhew there is a God, and God alone is to be worſhipped. That the Soul is immortal. That there is a future ſtate, and that a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. That man is fallen. That Chriſt redeemed him. That Chriſt is the Son of God. That he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95556:10"/>
became man. That he was Crucified, and died a Sacrifice for us. That he roſe from the dead, aſcended into Heaven, is there our Mediator, &amp;c. of which and the like, we may ſay as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> did to <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew, Attend to what I ſhall rehearſe out of the holy Scriptures, proofs which need not to be explained, but only to be heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he goes on, <hi>However the Anſwerer delivers his ſenſe on this Queſtion: It is, That all perſons cannot immediately learn all neceſſaries by meer reading of Scripture; that many other helps are neceſſary, to wit, attention, conſideration.</hi> And can he ſay any thing to the contrary? Some things are ſo plain, as that <hi>with the meer reading of them,</hi> they are immediately underſtood; Others require attention and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and yet be plain, though not equally as plain as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> further proceeded to ſhew the mind ought to <hi>be clear'd from prejudices.</hi> And doth this detract any thing from the perſpicuity of Scriptures? For the Propoſitions may be plain, but yet be obſcure to him that is under prepoſſeſſions, as was ſhewed at large in the <hi>Anſwer.</hi> All which were there ſum'd up thus, <hi>If men come with an honeſt heart, and uſe a competent dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, with a dependence upon God's aſſiſtance for the wiſdom he hath promiſed, I know nothing neceſſary to Salvation but what is plainly taught in Scripture, and may be learn'd from it.</hi> What hath the <hi>Prover</hi> to ſay to this? <hi>Such promiſes</hi> [of obtaining wiſdom from God] <hi>I find made to the Church, but not to any particular that ſhall refuſe to be abſolutely guided by the Church.</hi> But is not this promiſe made to <hi>particulars</hi> without any mention of the Church, that he is to learn it from? What thinks he of the place <hi>the Anſwerer</hi> had his eye upon? <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> What of <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God?</hi> Now it ſhould have been, according to our Author's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, If any man lack wiſdom, or would know whether the Doctrine be of God, let him go to the infallible Church, to the Vicar of Chriſt, or a Council called by him, or to the Guides of that Church. <hi>For unleſs the Scripture be explain'd by ſome one that cannot err, it cannot be underſtood;</hi> and ye will dangerouſly err by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">De Verbo l. 4. c. 4. ſſ. ſeptimo.</note>it, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> argues. And yet whether there be ſuch a Church, or whether the Church pretending to it, be not a fallible, and what is worſe, a deceiving Church; or whether the <hi>Guides</hi> be not <hi>falſe ones;</hi> a man cannot be ſo much as <hi>morally ſure,</hi> without
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95556:10"/>
he conſult and underſtand the Scripture; and when all is done (according to this Author's way of arguing) <hi>he may very well be one of thoſe who wreſt the Scripture to his own perdition, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath no good ground for any one act of Faith;</hi> or can be certain that there is a Church, or this or that is the true Church, &amp;c. This Paragraph of his is a kind of <hi>Jargon.</hi> But it affords occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put it to him, Who are the <hi>falſe</hi> Teachers, thoſe that with the Phariſees ſet up Tradition to an equal Authority with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or thoſe that maintain Scripture alone to be of Divine Authority? Thoſe that make Scripture to depend upon the Church; or thoſe that make the Church to depend upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Thoſe that teach we are <hi>abſolutely</hi> to ſubmit to the Church and the Guides of it; or thoſe that with the Apoſtle direct us to follow them only as they follow Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1? Thoſe that ſay men err by reading the Scriptures, and ſo take away from them that Key of Knowledg; or thoſe that with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teach them they err for not knowing them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 29? Thoſe that diſcourage men from reading the Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their pretended obſcurity; or thoſe that with our Saviour require that they ſearch them, and that becauſe they are (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith) a light to their paths? Thoſe that, with the Fathers, hold the Doctrines of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Incarnation, may be clearly proved from Scripture; or thoſe that make them to depend upon Church Authority? Thoſe that derive theirs down for a thouſand years after Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proof from Scripture and precedent Antiquity; or thoſe that Reformed their Church 1500 years after Chriſt, but can deduce the Genealogy of their Doctrines from Scripture and Genuine Antiquity for 4, 5, and 600 years after?</p>
            <p>I ask him again, Who are the <hi>Hereticks</hi> (in the ſenſe he gives us) thoſe that with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time confine the Church to their own party; or thoſe that with the Apoſtle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in it <hi>all that in every place call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord both theirs and ours,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2? Thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole world if not of their corrupt Communion; or thoſe that, according to his Quotation from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> maintain <hi>a communion with the whole world?</hi> Methinks, after all he might, to return his own words, <hi>be as much afraid to mention that word Heretic, as a Murtherer to come up to the murther'd Corps,</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what havoc and devaſtation they have made amongſt thoſe

            <p>Here plain and full Scripture will be of great uſe; we may expect ſhoals of Texts: What anſwer from Scripture is given to this Queſtion, think you? E'en the ſame as honeſt <hi>Bays</hi> returns to a hard one in the <hi>Rehearſal, YGad I won't tell you.</hi> No, he gives not one word of anſwer to it, tho it be ſo material.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> With what Confidence can the <hi>Prover</hi> thus impoſe upon the Reader? Was there <hi>not one word of Anſwer</hi> returned to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? Of that let the <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſpeak; Where it's thus put, Q. 3. <hi>What are theſe Neceſſaries to Salvation?</hi> The <hi>Anſwer</hi> begins thus. <hi>Our Author offers three Inſtances of ſuch Neceſſaries as are not clearly revealed in Scripture,</hi> viz. <hi>the Trinity, the Incarnation of our Saviour, and the Obſervation of the Lords Day.</hi> And of theſe, the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> Diſcourſes for near eight Pages together, to ſhew that the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer</hi> had to little purpoſe objected againſt them. So that if the Trinity, and Incarnation, and the Lord's day, are neceſſaries, and for that reaſon were ſingled out as Inſtances of the Scriptures inſufficiency and obſcurity by the <hi>Addreſſer,</hi> and on the contrary were defended by the <hi>Anſwerer;</hi> then ſurely, the 3<hi>d</hi> Queſtion no more wants an Anſwer, than the <hi>Prover</hi> wants Confidence that denies it. He writes indeed, as if the Queſtion was barely propoſed in the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and he has uſed ſome art to confirm it, when he has made as many Queſtions as there are Inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Trinity, Incarnation, and the Lord's day: So that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the 4<hi>th,</hi> in the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> is Queſtion the 7<hi>th</hi> in the <hi>Proof.</hi> And this he does, that the Reader, if he has not the <hi>Anſwer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, may not be aware of his Falſification, nor ſuſpect that a man that firſt of all writes for the Publick, and then engaged to <hi>ſet down the Queſtions in the order of the</hi> Anſwerer, could be ſo falſe to both, as to affirm, <hi>there is not one word of Anſwer.</hi>

               <hi>Q 4 'Tis in its whole extent this;</hi> By what Text of Scripture are we plainly taught that God is One in Subſtance, Three in Perſon? For as <hi>Joh. 10 50.</hi> Chriſt ſays, <hi>I and my Father are One;</hi> ſo <hi>17. 21.</hi> he prays, <hi>That all Believers may be One, as he and his Father are one;</hi> This ſecond place may ſeem to expound the firſt, and then Chriſt and his Father will be One only morally, as all the Believers be One. Or elſe, what Texts declares the Three Perſons to be One by identity of ſubſtance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not one Text of Scripture to give us the dubious Senſe of the two in Queſtion! And yet theſe men pretend to clear Scripture for each Fundamental Point! The Anſwerer ſupplies this want of Scripture with two Reaſons. The firſt is this, <hi>Of the Three that bear record in Heaven, `tis ſaid they</hi> are <hi>One; but of the Three that bear witneſs on Earth, they</hi> agree <hi>in one.</hi> (I will admit this Engliſh Tranſlation, tho Apocryphal.) But what then? <hi>But if in both were meant only a moral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, it would have been as well ſaid of the Three that bear record in Heaven, they</hi> agree <hi>in One; therefore they have more than a moral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Is not this ſpecial Logic? Would not this way of arguing prove equally that the <hi>Believers</hi> are one with more than a moral Union, becauſe otherwiſe it might as w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll have been ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>May they agree in one.</hi> The Queſtion is, Whether this ſecond clear Text concerning the Three that bear Witneſs on Earth, and which we know to be only <hi>morally One,</hi> doth not expound what that Unity is, that is found in the Three which bear record in Heaven? We ask a proof out of Scripture to decide this doubt; but our Anſwerer hath none to give us, or is grown Churliſh, and will not allow us any. Hath he any to expound the other Text? No, not any; but he offers at ſome Inſinuation from Scripture, and `tis this: <hi>When Chriſt ſaid,</hi> I and my Father are One, <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>took up ſtones to ſtone him for blaſphemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that thou being a Man (ſaid they) makeſt thy ſelf God: The</hi> Jews <hi>then underſtood him to have ſpoken of a Natural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, therefore he did ſo.</hi> Well, I will let my good nature work upon me once, and for quiets ſake I will let this Diſcourſe paſs as allowable; But in return of Curteſy I hope each ſober Proteſtant will own this following Argument to be of at leaſt as good Alloy; <hi>When Chriſt ſaid,</hi> Joh. 6. Unleſs you eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, you have no Life in you; <hi>The</hi> Jews, <hi>who ſaid, how can this man give us his Fleſh to eat? and his Diſciples, who walked no more with him, underſtood that he ſpake of his natural Body which they ſhould corporally eat; therefore Chriſt did really mean they ſhould corporally feed on his natural Fleſh.</hi> This Popiſh Concluſion is in the ſame Form.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> This is the firſt Inſtance of Scripture's obſcurity in matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, offered by the <hi>Addreſſer:</hi> And here the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſhewed in general, how frivolous and abſurd the way of arguing uſed on this matter, by that Author, was; (to which we have not a word of Reply) and then particularly, that the two Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. and <hi>John</hi> 10. 30. uſually inſiſted on amongſt others in proof of the Doctrine of the Trinity, remain in their

Would he have ſome Chapter and Verſe, where are theſe or the like Words, <hi>The word</hi> One, <hi>in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St.</hi> John; <hi>Item, in St.</hi> John<hi>'s Goſpel, ſignifies a ſtrict Identity;</hi> yes by all means, for ſaith the <hi>Addreſſer, This ought to be, if all neceſſaries to Salvation are contained in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought our Author might by this time have been ſenſible of this weakneſs; certainly this Gentleman's Condition calls for ſome Commiſeration; and he would do well to adviſe upon it, whether the Scripture was originally divided into Chapter and Verſe; and whether <hi>Hugo Cardinalis,</hi> and <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> were not very Ignorant, or unadviſed to Labour in this Work anew, if ſo it had been.</p>
            <p>But is there no other way to give the Senſe of theſe Texts? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we conſider the Words and Phraſes, the Context and Scope of the Places in queſtion, and compare them with others, and from all draw ſome good and ſubſtantial <hi>Reaſons;</hi> will not that be as proper, and as much to the purpoſe, as if we had Chapter and Verſe in his way? And this was the way taken by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer.</hi> As for Example, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was there obſerved, that it's as plainly ſaid the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, are <hi>One,</hi> as that they are <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Union betwixt theſe Three, was not a mere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Union, or a Union only of Will and Conſent; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>makes a plain difference betwixt the Three that bear Record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and the Three that bear Witneſs in Earth: For of the Three in Heaven, it's ſaid, they are <hi>One;</hi> but of the Three in Earth, they <hi>agree in one.</hi> Of this the <hi>Prover</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will admit this Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tranſlation</hi> [agree in one] <hi>tho Apocryphal.</hi> Why an <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation?</hi> or why <hi>Apocryphal?</hi> Unleſs it be that it's nor Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, according to what they call the <hi>Authentick</hi> Vulgar Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For otherwiſe their own <hi>Clarius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> &amp;c. do thus tranſlate it, <hi>Conveniunt in unum, &amp; conſpirant in unum.</hi> But <hi>admit
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95556:12"/>
this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>What then?</hi> Then the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> thus proceeded in his Argument, <hi>Now if it had been a mere moral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt (who are the Three in Heaven) it would have been as well ſaid of them as of the Spirit, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Blood (which are the Three in Earth) that they agree in one.</hi> Here the <hi>Prover</hi> exults. <hi>Is not this ſpecial Logic? Would not this way of arguing prove equally, that the Believers are one, with more than a moral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; becauſe, otherwiſe it might as well have been ſaid</hi> Joh. 17. <hi>May they agree in one?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Logic, it is <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s as well as the <hi>Anſwerer</hi>'s, who from the different Phraſes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thus argues, <hi>Whence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De Chriſto l. 1. c. 4. <hi>ſſ.</hi> Quod autem.</note>
               <hi>you may plainly ſee, that the Spirit, Water, and Blood, are not One,</hi> (as the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>but only do agree in one Teſtimony.</hi> And as for the Inference the <hi>Prover</hi> makes, <hi>Would not this way of Arguing prove,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, the Caſe is not alike. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Force of the Argument doth not lie merely upon the difference of Phraſe (for both <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> knew how <hi>One</hi> is ſometimes applied to a Moral Union, as <hi>John</hi> 17.) but upon its being uſed in this place by way of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt things of a different nature; for proof of which it's to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle deſigning to ſhew the validity of the Teſtimony given to the Son of God, <hi>v.</hi> 5. which was twofold; he further amplifies this, and diſtinctly ſpeaks to each of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and tho both do give Teſtimony to the ſame Truth, yet one in an higher, and the other in a lower degree. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, and Three in Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Three in Heaven are One, and the Three in Earth agree in One. By which way of arguing, and the diſtinction obſerved betwixt them, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtle ſhows, That the Three that bear Record in Heaven, are not more different in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Place from the Three in Earth, than in their Union: That they are both alike Three, and both alike in their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that the one are in Heaven, the other in Earth: The Three in Heaven are One, but the Three in Earth <hi>agree</hi> in One: So that the Three in Earth are no more One, as the Three in Heaven, than the Three that bear Record in Earth, are the Three that bear Record in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95556:13"/>
2. In confirmation of this, it's obſervable, that one of theſe Phraſes is more fit to expreſs a Natural than a Moral Union; that is, <hi>they are One,</hi> doth more aptly expreſs it, than <hi>they agree in One:</hi> And therefore whereas <hi>they are One,</hi> may ſometimes ſignifie a Moral Union, and may then be interpreted by, they <hi>agree in One;</hi> yet <hi>agree in One</hi> cannot be interpreted by, <hi>they are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. From hence we have an anſwer to that Queſtion of his,</hi> Whether this ſecond clear Text concerning the Three that bear witneſs on Earth, and which we know to be only Morally One, doth not expound what that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is that is found in the Three which bear Record in Heaven:</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No; for tho <hi>One</hi> ſometimes ſignifies a Moral Union, yet here, if ſo underſtood, it would quite deſtroy that diſtinction betwixt the one Three, and the other, and the Preference that the one Three had above the other Three in their Union.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. By this we are prepared alſo to anſwer to his other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he ſaith, that when</hi> our Saviour prays, <hi>John 17. 21.</hi> that all believers may be one, as he and his Father are one, may ſeem to expound, <hi>John 10. 58.</hi> I and my Father are one: and then Chriſt and his Father will be one only Morally, as all the Believers are one. <hi>In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It's granted that the Father and the Son may be ſaid to be one in a Moral Senſe, as one in conſent. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not follow, that becauſe the Father and Son are thus One, that therefore they are no otherwiſe One; and that all Believers are as much One, as the Father and Son are One.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's evident from what is ſpoke by way of Explication in that place, that it's otherwiſe; for when <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Chriſt prays, <hi>that they may be one as we are one,</hi> it's added <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (the ſame Phraſe as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 8.) <hi>that they may be made perfect in one;</hi> implying that the Unity betwixt Believers, is of another nature than the Unity betwixt the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Union of Believers in <hi>John</hi> 17. cannot be applied to the Union betwixt the Father and the Son, in <hi>John</hi> 10. 50. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this latter is a Union of Eſſence, as well as Will: And for confirmation of this, the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> offered an Argument from the Text it ſelf; to take off the force of which, the <hi>Prover</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating it, leaves out a main branch of it; for thus he frames it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95556:13"/>
for the Anſwerer; <hi>When Chriſt ſaid, I and my Father are one, the Jews took up ſtones to ſtone him for blaſphemy, becauſe that thou being a man (ſaid they) makeſt thy ſelf God; The Jews then underſtood him to have ſpoken of a Natural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, therefore he did ſo.</hi> But the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> was this, <hi>It follows that neither did our Saviour ſpeak, nor the</hi> Jews <hi>underſtand him to have ſpoken of a Moral, but a Natural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> The firſt and the main Branch was, That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf ſpoke of a Natural Union; the next was, That the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood him alſo to have ſpoken of it: And for the firſt, I referred him to the Book, called, <hi>The Doctrine of the Trinity and Tranſubſtantiation compared;</hi> but it wants an Anſwer, and ſo he cautiouſly takes no notice of it. But becauſe he is herein ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, let me recommend him to his Friend <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this Argument with, Conſtat eos rectè intellexiſſe, <hi>It's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>

               <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>rightly underſtood our Saviour.</hi> But it ſeems this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice comes too late; for faith he, <hi>I will let my good nature</hi> (I wiſh he could ſay ſincerity) <hi>work upon me for once; and for quiets ſake, I will let this diſcourſe paſs as allowable.</hi> Whence is it that all o'th' ſudden he is in ſo good a humour, and ſo forward in his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances? The good man could not contain himſelf longer; for from a ſmall advantage he eſpied (and which is ſomewhat rare with them now-a-days, and therefore not to be let ſlip) he will yield, tho the thing he yields be never ſo impertinent and abſurd. <hi>Let this paſs;</hi> What then? <hi>In return of Courteſie,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I hope each ſober Proteſtant will own this following Argument to be at leaſt of as good alloy: When Chriſt ſaid,</hi> John 6. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you eat the Fleſh, &amp;c. the Jews, &amp;c. underſtood that he ſpake of his Natural Body, therefore Chriſt did really mean they ſhould corporally feed on his Natural Fleſh.</hi> But ſurely ſober Proteſtants are for Reaſon, Pertinence, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; but however, his Argument ſhall be <hi>allowable,</hi> if he can make it as evident the <hi>Jews</hi> did not miſtake when they underſtood Chriſt ſpake of <hi>his Natural Fleſh, and a corporal feeding on it:</hi> as it may be made appear, they did not miſtake him, when they thought by his calling himſelf the Son of God, that he meant he was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially of the ſame Nature, and one with God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the firſt part, not one word of Scripture; and for excuſe he tells us, That <hi>there was no need of an expreſs abrogation,</hi> becauſe <hi>Sunday being ſet apart for the publick and ſolemn Worſhip of God, the Sabboth-day as well as the Holy-days and New-moons of the</hi> Jews, <hi>being a ſhadow, muſt ſurrender to the Sunday.</hi> Here is as little Reaſon as Scripture; for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both did appertain to the Law of Nature, and was not a ſhadow only of a thing to come, but a memory of the paſt, and never-to-be-forgotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>Creation,</hi> from the work whereof God reſted on that day, and <hi>bleſſed the ſeventh day.</hi> Here 'tis pity at what a loſs the Anſwerer is <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 3.</note>to find the Chapter and Verſe wherein the abrogation of Circumciſion is clearly expreſt; 'Tis a charitable condeſcendency to inſtruct him; let him look then in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. where <hi>behold</hi> Paul <hi>tells you,</hi> that <hi>if you be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi>

            <p>For the ſecond part, he produces a Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>I was in ſpirit on the Lords day;</hi> then he flouriſhes to teach us ignorant people, that <hi>'tis uſual in Scripture, after that Times, Places, Things and Perſons were ſet apart for the ſervice of God by Divine Inſtitution, to have his Name as a mark of propriety given to them.</hi> But in the name of ſenſe and reaſon, what means all this? There is a Lords day, no doubt; St. <hi>John</hi> was in ſpirit that day, 'tis certain; but the queſtion is, <hi>What day of the week</hi> was it? or was it only ſome peculiar day of the year, as <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> or <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friday?</hi> Hath he Scripture for this?

               <hi>Q. 1.</hi> What Scripture hath abſolved us from, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I gave, in ſhort, a Threefold anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He requiring Chapter and Verſe, I told him, <hi>When he could find out Chapter and Verſe for an expreſs and clear abrogation of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, I would ſhew him Chapter and Verſe for that of the Sabbath.</hi> Here out of his abundant <hi>charitable condeſcendency</hi> he vouchſafes <hi>to inſtruct</hi> me, and hands me to <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Where behold Paul tells you, that if you be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> And yet I do not find there is a <hi>clear and expreſs abrogation</hi> of it. An Abrogation is a total abolition of it; and if it was abrogated ſo as that whoever was thereafter Circumciſed, could have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Chriſt; then all ſo Circumciſed were in a ſtate of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And here it would be fit to know when this abrogation did commence? For <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. we find <hi>Paul</hi> to Circumciſe <hi>Timothy;</hi> and not long before St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s being a Priſoner, and being carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſolemn Aſſembly declared that there <hi>were many thouſands</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians which <hi>were zealous of the Law;</hi> and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was reputed to be too forward in teaching <hi>the Gentiles ought not to circumciſe their children,</hi> Act. 21. 20, 21. So that the Apoſtle's cenſure of it is not to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally underſtood; but is only a preventing of their impoſing it upon the Gentiles, and requiring it as neceſſary to Juſtification and Salvation. And of theſe that held it thus neceſſary, he ſaith, <hi>If ye be circumciſed,</hi> upon theſe terms, <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing; if ye are juſtified,</hi> and expect juſtification <hi>by the Law, ye are fallen from grace,</hi> ver. 4.</p>

2.

Or, was it then ſo a Memorial of what was paſt, as not to be a Shadow of ſomewhat to come? Let him ſee how the Apoſtle applies it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9, 10. But, ſuppoſe that it was a Memorial of the Creation (as it was) and a Shadow to the <hi>Jews</hi> (as he owns) then being both were but one and the ſame day, how could the Obſervation of the Sabbath be abrogated as a Shadow, and not alſo as a Memorial, ſince the ſame Day that was for the one, was alſo for the other?

               <hi>The Queſtion is,</hi> What day of the Week that was in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or, was it only ſome peculiar day of the year, as <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> or <hi>Good-Friday?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95556:16"/>
1. If the Name of the Lord be not without a reaſon applied to a Day, then it's evident that no day of the Week has any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or Pretence to it, but the Firſt day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed to be <hi>ſome peculiar day of the year,</hi> as <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> or <hi>Good-Friday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe we are certain, that the firſt day of the Week was obſerved in Apoſtolical times (as I ſhewed from Scripture) but we are not certain of theſe; there being not one word of Scripture, that looks that way. And when St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of <note place="margin">Epiſt. 118.</note>the Anniverſary Obſervation of the days of Chriſt's Paſſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Aſcenſion, and the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, that they <hi>were obſerved in the whole World;</hi> he adds, <hi>it's to be belived ſuch things ſo obſerved, were commanded and appointed by the Apoſtles, or General Councils.</hi> He ſaith, it's to <hi>be believed</hi> they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one or the other; not being able to determine which; but we know that there was no General Council till above 300 years after Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> (which has the neareſt pretence both in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Antiquity) cannot be the Lord's day, becauſe they were diſtinguiſhed. So St. <hi>Auſtin, We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſolemnly celebrate the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Contr. Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. c. 16.</note>
               <hi>Lord's day, and</hi> Eaſter. And the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, particularly, that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (where St. <hi>John</hi> more eſpecally was, did obſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> according to the Moon, and not the day of the Week; and that ſo early, as <hi>An.</hi> 197. when <hi>Polycrates</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and a Council of Biſhops concurring with him, wrote to <note place="margin">Nova Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio Concil.

               <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who threatned to Excommunicate them for it; that they feared him not, <hi>for it was better to obey God than Man.</hi> As for <hi>Good-Friday</hi>'s being the Lord's day, that I believe is a <hi>Noſtrum</hi> of our Author's, as well as the Queſtion put by him, is, <hi>What day of the Week the Lords day is on?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He anſwers, <hi>I find forty Texts that call the day of general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that of each man's death, the Lords day, but not one that mentions Sunday under that name.</hi> What follows? Therefore the Lord's day St. <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit upon, was the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or death, and not Sunday. But he will ſay this is a little too much; for the uſe he makes of this Obſervation, is to ſhew, that that day, whatever it was, might be called the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> and yet not be of Divine Inſtitution. Very well: but yet I find the day of Judgment, (for indeed the day of death is not, as far as I remember, call'd the <hi>Lord's day</hi> in Scripture) to be of Divine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95556:17"/>
Ordination: So <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 36. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. <hi>He hath appointed a day;</hi> and is therefore a confirmation of what he would confute by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I offer'd further in proof of a Divine Inſtitution, That that day was conſecrated by the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon it. But to this he found nothing to reply.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I proved it from the obſervation of that day, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice celebrated upon it, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. What has he here to ſay? <hi>I find,</hi> Acts 2. 46. ſaith he, <hi>how they that believed were daily continuing in the Temple; but not a word of a day appointed for ſolemn Aſſemblies.</hi> What uſe can be made of this accurate Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the ſtreſs he lays upon <hi>daily;</hi> What but this? The believers <hi>daily</hi> reſorted to the Temple, therefore they had no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar day; and ſo it follows moſt admirably, the <hi>Jews daily</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Temple, therefore they had no peculiar day, no Sabbath. But he finds <hi>not a word of a day appointed for ſtated Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,</hi> no not ſo much as Acts 20. 7. &amp;c. quoted and inſiſted on in the <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus diſmiſs'd the third queſtion of the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> with all the ſupernumerary Queſtions collected out of it by <hi>the Prover;</hi> I went to look for Queſtion the fourth, as it is in <hi>the Anſwer,</hi> and put by the <hi>Addreſſer;</hi> and that is, <hi>Whether it be neceſſary to ſalvation for him to believe the Trinity and Incarnation, that cannot find them clearly expreſs'd in Scripture, though he reads it ſincerely, and with humility.</hi> But of this, not a word. We <hi>may gueſs at the reaſon without caſting a figure.</hi> However, it's a little more honeſt to omit a Paragraph, than it is to pervert it. The former is an implicit acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truth, the latter is a renouncing it.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, plainly No: And he hath two Texts for it; the firſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Not for that we have dominion over your Faith, but are helpers,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>Call no man Maſter on earth, for one is your Maſter.</hi> Here not only the Walls of the City of God are broken down, but the very Foundations (of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles)</hi> are digg'd up; is it all St. <hi>Paul</hi> could do, all you allow him, to give <hi>ſome light, ſome helps,</hi> when his Proſelytes had any doubt about the ſenſe of Scripture? Were they not oblig'd to believe the Senſe and Interpretation <hi>He</hi> gave to the Text? Then that Faith is vain which was founded on the Apoſtles Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all Chriſtianity ſtands on a wrong bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95556:17"/>
               <note place="margin">Vindication.</note> Here our Author is guilty of another omiſſion; For the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer</hi> exhibited a five-fold Charge againſt him of Fallacy and Colluſion, which he has taken no manner of care to clear himſelf of; but ſuffers it to remain in its full force againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>He has indeed proceeded otherwiſe in this laſt Queſtion; For whereas before in the <hi>Addreſs</hi> he ſet up a Guide that is a Judge, whom it's neceſſary ſo to believe, and to ſubmit to, as to receive from him ſuch Neceſſaries to Salvation as are not contained in Scripture, and the ſenſe of ſuch Neceſſaries as are not clearly contained in it; he now in the <hi>proof</hi> ſoftens, and extenuates, and expounds, and the Queſtion now is reduced to this, <hi>Am I bound to believe the Senſe given to doubtful Texts, becauſe my Guide tells me I muſt do ſo?</hi> This indeed may better ſerve his purpoſe, but after all is neither true in it ſelf, nor can be accommodated to his former notion of a Guide, and the authority given to him. For what has doubtful Texts to do with the Caſe, where there are no Texts concerned? What has a Senſe given to Scripture, to do with a Caſe which is to be determined without Scripture; As it is in Neceſſaries not contained in Scripture, and which we are to learn from our Guide that we are <hi>bound to follow?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing we take his Expoſition, that this is when the <hi>Texts</hi> be <hi>doubtful;</hi> yet the Things thoſe Texts are ſuppoſed to be concerned in, are Things neceſſary to Salvation; and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Guide <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as to <hi>the ſenſe of a doubtful Text,</hi> is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the believing him where there is no Text pretended. Since the Perſon in doubt is no more aſſur'd of the ſenſe of theſe Texts in a Point neceſſary, than he was without a Text. For when there is no Text for a thing neceſſary, he abſolutely relies upon his Guide, who tells him, it is neceſſary: And when there is a <hi>ſenſe given to a doubtful</hi> Text, he <hi>believes</hi> that ſenſe, becauſe his Guide tells him that is the ſenſe of it, and ſo he ſtill relies upon his Guide; and his Faith is thus immediately reſolved into the Guide.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems this the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> doth deny, and that upon the Authority of our Saviour, who diſallows it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. and the Apoſtle who diſclaims it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. But here our Author is beſide all patience, and anſwers it with a dreadful Exclamation. <hi>Here, not only the Walls of the City of God are broken down, but the very Foundations of Prophets and Apoſtles are digg'd up.</hi> And why
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95556:18"/>
ſo? becauſe we will not admit a Guide of their own Impoſition, in defiance of our Saviour's and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s prohibition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But O, ſaith our Author, <hi>Is it all St.</hi> Paul <hi>could do, all you allow him, to give ſome light, ſome helps, when his Proſelytes had any doubt about the Senſe of Scripture? Were they not obliged to believe the Senſe and Interpretation he gave to the Text? Then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>the Prover</hi> is either confounded in his own thoughts, or intends to confound and amuſe his Reader. The Opinion he maintains is, That in matters of doubt, a Perſon doubting is to be abſolutely concluded by his Guide; <hi>I am to believe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Guides tell me I muſt do ſo.</hi> Now he would have it, that to deny this Authority to the Apoſtles, is to allow them only to give <hi>ſome light, ſome helps,</hi> that is, (as I conceive he means) to make them no more than Common Teachers. But I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, if it may be, to ſet our Author right in this matter. Toward which it's to be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is an abſolute and ſovereign Authority in the Church, which all are bound to follow, believe and obey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſpute, and that Authority is ſoly the prerogative of our Saviour, and which no man, or ſociety of men can claim, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſubordinate Authority, which is immediately derived from him; and this was peculiar to inſpired Perſons, and is extraordinary. So the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 11, 12. <hi>The Goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man; For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But as ſuch Perſons were ſent, ſo they were able to prove their Commiſſion and their Doctrine to be received from Chriſt: And they did not require any to believe them, becauſe they told them they were their Guides, and they muſt believe them, <hi>becauſe they tell them ſo;</hi> (for that was to have <hi>dominion</hi> over their Faith) but they appealed to the Scriptures, to their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. and encouraged their Auditors to try and examine their Doctrines; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. And this way of trying is ſo far from making Faith <hi>Vain</hi> (as our Author pretends) that it would be vain without it.</p>
            <p>But, ſaith he, <hi>Were not the Proſelytes of St.</hi> Paul <hi>obliged to believe the Senſe and Interpretation he gave to the Text?</hi> Without doubt; but then he did not require them to receive and believe it, becauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95556:18"/>
               <hi>he told them ſo,</hi> but becauſe it was revealed, and that they beforehand were ſatisfied in the Confirmation he brought of his Apoſtleſhip. For where there was a new Revelation of any Point to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or matter to be done, being that could not be any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examined by Scripture than as it was not contrary to it, it wholly was to be reſolved into his Miſſion; and they had the ſame reaſon to believe his Doctrine, as his Miſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is another ſort of ſubordinate Authority, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives both its Miſſion and Doctrine in an ordinary way: And therefore muſt needs be ſubject to the like ways of tryal and proof as the former. But with this difference, that what inſpired Perſons taught as revealed from God, that upon proof of their Miſſion by Miracles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. was to be believed: but now when we have only ordinary means, and the written Word for our Rule, there is no other Doctrine to be received, than what is contained in that Rule, and ſo neither can they oblige us, nor are we obliged to believe them, becauſe they tell us ſo, but as it's conſonant with, or contained in, or rightly inferred from the Scripture, which we are to compare it with, and to judge of it by.</p>
            <p>But now our Author makes their Guides not only equal, but ſuperior to the Apoſtles, when he tells us, We <hi>are bound to believe them, becauſe they themſelves tell us ſo;</hi> and that without any exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. So that if a man miſtakes his Guide, or his Guide miſtakes, he muſt unavoidably miſtake alſo, being wholly to be determined by them. And then he muſt be an <hi>Arian</hi> with the Popes <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Liberius,</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> with <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> a <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> with <hi>Honorius,</hi> and deny the immortality of the Soul with <hi>John</hi> XXIII. And now let any judg <hi>where the Foundations of the Prophets and Apoſtles are digg'd up;</hi> whether in the Reformed Churches, that teach us we are not bound to believe any Guide, without tryal of their Doctrine; or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, with our Author, affirms <hi>we are bound to believe our Guides, becauſe they tell us we muſt do ſo.</hi>

He tells us further, That <hi>for the firſt he has a pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one. 'Tis this, If I muſt know the Church by ſome Marks, then I muſt find out thoſe Marks firſt; and where muſt I ſeek them?</hi> But, why is this called the <hi>firſt</hi> Queſtion when there are ſeveral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it? He might better have called it the only Queſtion, ſince it's what he has ſingled out of many to try the power of his Logic upon. And now let us ſee how he quits himſelf, when he comes to be Reſpondent. His Anſwer to the Queſtion, is, <hi>Suppoſe in a Gazette, &amp;c. and the Marks, and the Man are found at once, for they are to be ſeen in his Face.</hi> Where his whole buſineſs is to go off from the Queſtion that is ask'd, to a Queſtion that is not ask'd. The main Queſtion in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> was, <hi>How ſhall I find out the true Church?</hi> Is it becauſe She her ſelf ſo declares? Or that She is knowable by a ſelf-evident Light? Or is She to be found out by Marks? If by Marks, then we muſt find out the Marks before we find out the Church, which is to be known by thoſe Marks; and then the pinching Queſtion comes on; <hi>Where muſt I ſeek them? That, it's to be fear'd, will lead us to the Scriptures.</hi> Now what is the Senſe of the Queſtion, <hi>Where muſt I ſeek them?</hi> Certainly, it is not in diſpute, whether the Marks are not to be found in the thing ſought for, by thoſe Marks (as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently lays it) For if they are the proper Marks of the thing; then, ſurely, they are to be found with the thing that

they are the Marks of; or elſe it is impoſſible to find out the thing by theſe Marks. But the meaning of the Queſtion is the ſame as it was in the <hi>Addreſs,</hi> (and from whence the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> borrowed the Terms) and that is, Where are the Notes? Where are they deſcribed? Or, How ſhall I come to know them? And thus it follows in the <hi>Anſwer, It is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this will lead us to the Scripture.</hi> But becauſe ſome men are hard of Underſtanding, whether for a weak or a bad reaſon, I determine not, I ſhall begin the matter again. It is agreed, that there is a Church, and that there are certain Marks by which the Church may be found: Now the Queſtion is, What are thoſe Marks? Whether <hi>Continual Succeſſion, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Extent, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Viſible Paſtor,</hi> &amp;c.? Or, <hi>The Profeſſion of the true Faith, right Adminiſtration of the Sacraments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how ſhall we know, or where ſhall we find, which of theſe are the Marks belonging to the Church, and by which it is to be known?</p>
            <p>I ſhall make it plain by his own inſtance; Suppoſing that there is ſomewhat of great Importance depends upon finding out a particular perſon; and that he that would find him out, knows not the man, but for his better direction applies himſelf to one that knows ſomewhat of this matter, and asks him, <hi>Sir,</hi> How ſhall I find out ſuch a Man, or where may I ſeek the Marks by which he may be diſcover'd? Would it not <hi>force a Smile</hi> to have this Anſwer? Do you ask that? <hi>Why Friend, the Marks and the Man are found at once, for they are to be ſeen in his Face.</hi> Would he not be made much the Wiſer, by this grave Reply; and forthwith be able to find out the Man he ſeeks for, by this goodly Direction? Or would he not ſay, <hi>Sir,</hi> I came not to be informed of that which every one that is not a ſtark Fool un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands as well as your Worſhip; but I would know, what are thoſe Marks which <hi>are to be ſeen in his Face,</hi> and by which I may know him from your ſelf, or any other, and where are they deſcrib'd? And will not the other, if he be able and willing to inform him, then tell him, the Marks are in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette,</hi> and there you may find them. Now, which is to be found out firſt, the Marks or the Man? And what are thoſe Marks, and <hi>where muſt I ſeek them?</hi> Surely it needs no Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for his Triumphant Marks of the Church, he may find

            <p>The Queries Propounded in the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and yet remaining to be reſolved, are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">Q. 1. What thoſe Neceſſaries to Salvation are, that are not contained in Scripture, and where each of them is to be found?</p>
            <p n="2">Q. 2. Whether the Articles of Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s Creed joined to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, are as clearly to be proved from Scripture, as thoſe of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; or that thoſe of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed are no more to be proved from Scripture, than thoſe of Pope <hi>Pius?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">Q. 3. Whether it's as neceſſary to believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches, and the Pope to be the Vicar of Chriſt, and all the other Articles of that Creed, of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> as it is to believe that our Lord Jeſus was Incarnate, and the reſt of the Articles of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95556:21"/>
Q. 4. Which has the firſt and Supreme Authority, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or the Church?</p>
            <p n="5">Q. 5. Whether the Church can ordain new Articles of Faith, and which when ſo ordained, are as much to be received and believed, as thoſe which have their Authority immediately from Scripture?</p>
            <p n="6">Q. 6. Which is to be ſought for firſt, the Notes, or the Church that is to be found out by theſe Notes? If the Church, then how ſhall I know it? If the Notes, where muſt I ſeek them?</p>
            <p n="7">Q. 7. If the Church be to be an Infallible Guide, when it's found out; then what is the Guide that will infallibly lead to the Church? And whether is that Guide to be ſought for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, or without it?</p>
            <p n="8">Q. 8. Whether we may be infallibly certain out of the Church; or how we can find out the Church infallibly, if the Church alone be infallible, and that we cannot be infallibly certain till we come into the Church?</p>
            <p n="9">Q. 9. Where is the Seat of Infallibility in the Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in every particular Perſon, or the Supreme Paſtor, or a General Council? And whether they all agree in this matter?</p>
            <p n="10">Q. 10. Whether what they diſagree in can be the <hi>Sentiment</hi> of the whole Church; or that we are hound to believe what they cannot agree in?</p>
            <p n="11">Q. 11. Whether we are any more bound to believe the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of their Church, which they thus diſagree in, than the <hi>Addreſs</hi> would perſwade us we are not obliged to believe the Trinity, becauſe the <hi>Arians, tho Chriſtians, deny it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">Q. 12. How one at a vaſt diſtance of Time or Place, can be infallibly aſſured of the Certainty of thoſe Decrees which are ſaid to proceed from an Infallible Power; or that he can be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95556:21"/>
any more certain of the Truth, Certainty, and Senſe of theſe, than he can be of the Truth, Authority, and Senſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p n="13">Q. 13. Whether our Saviour has not ſpoken as plainly and intelligibly in Scripture, as his pretended Vicar, or their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have done in their Decrees and Canons?</p>
            <p n="14">Q. 14. Whether, when the Perſons that publiſh or give the Senſe of thoſe Decrees and Canons are Fallible, a Perſon can be infallibly certain that theſe are the very Decrees, or that the true Senſe of them? Or whether a Perſon in theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can be any more certain, tho a Member of an Infallible Church, than another may be, that is a Member of a Fallible Church?</p>
            <p>Q. 15. Whether, for example, we can be any more certain that there ever was ſuch a Pope as Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> or that ever there was ſuch a Creed drawn up by him, or that this or that is an Article, or the Senſe of it, than we are that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and that the Doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation are clearly contained in them?</p>
