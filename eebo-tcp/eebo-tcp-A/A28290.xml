            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Foraſmuch as it is openly known, that there be divers evil perſons within the Realm, going from County, to County, and from Town, to Town, in certain habits, under diſſimulation of great Holyneſs, and without the Lycens;e of the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the places, or other ſufficient Authority, Preaching daily, not only in Churches, and Church-yards; but alſo in Markets, Fairs, and other open places, where a great Congregation of people is, divers Sermons containing Hereſies, and notorious Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to the great embleamiſhing of the Chriſtian Faith, and deſtruction of the Laws, and of the eſtate of Holy Church, to the great peril of the ſouls of the people, and of all the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>as more plainly is found, and ſufficiently proved, before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father in God the Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and the Biſhops and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Maſters of Divinity, and Doctors of canon and of civil Law, and a great part of the Clergy of the ſaid Realm, eſpecially aſſembled for this cauſe: which perſons do alſo preach divers matters of ſlander, to engender diſcord and diſſention, betwixt divers Eſtates of the ſaid Realm, as well Spiritual as Temporal, in exciting of the people to the great peril of all the Realm: which Preachers cited or ſummoned before the Ordinaries of the places, there to anſwer of that whereof they be Impeached, will not obey to their Summons and Commandments; nor care not for their Monitions nor Cenſures of the Holy Church, but expreſly deſpiſe them: and moreover, by their ſubtil and ingenious words, do draw the people to hear their Sermons, and do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in their Errors, by ſtrong hand and by great Routs: It is ordained and aſſented in this preſent Parliament, that the King's Commiſſions be made, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Sheriffs, and other Miniſters of our Soveraign Lord the King, or other ſufficient perſons Learned, and according to the Certifications of the Prelates thereof, to be made in the Chancery from time to time, to arreſt all ſuch Preachers, and alſo their Fautors, Maintainers and Abettors, and to hold them in Arreſt and ſtrong Priſon, till they will juſtifie them according to the Law and Reaſon of Holy Church, and the King will and commandeth, That the Chancellor make ſuch Commiſſions at all times, that he by the Prelates or any of them, ſhall be certified and thereof required as is aforeſaid.</hi>

               </note> An Act of Parliament was made, called an Act for aboliſhing of Opinions in certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles concerning Chriſtian Religion, ſix Articles were agreed on, and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That in the moſt Bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, by the ſtrength and efficacy of Chriſt's mighty word (it being ſpoken by the Prieſt) is preſent really under the form of Bread and Wine, the natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Jeſu Chriſt, Conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the Conſecration, there remaineth no ſubſtance of Bread or Wine, nor any other ſubſtance, but the ſubſtance of Chriſt God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Communion in both kinds, is not neceſſary</hi> ad ſalutem <hi>by the Law of God, to all perſons, and that it is to be believed, and not doubted of, but that in the Fleſh under the form of Bread, is the very Blood, and with the Blood, under the form of Wine, is the very Fleſh, as well a part, as though they were both together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That Prieſts, after the Order of Prieſthood received, may not marry by the Law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That Vows of Chaſtity, Widdowhood, by Man or Woman, made to God adviſedly, ought to be deſerved, by the Law of God, and that it exempts them from other Liberties of Chriſtian People, which without that they might enjoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That it is meet, and neceſſary, that private Maſſes be continued, and admitted in the King's</hi> Engliſh <hi>Church, and Congregations, as whereby good Chriſtian People, ordering themſelves accordingly, do receive both Godly and goodly conſolations and benefits, and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable alſo to God's Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That Auricular Confeſſion is expedient, and neceſſary to be retained and continued, uſed and frequented, in the Church of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that by word of Mouth, Writing, Printing, Cyphering, or in any otherwiſe, doth Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Preach, Teach, Say, Affirm, Declare, Diſpute, Argue, or hold any Opinion contrary to the firſt Article, is by that Act of</hi> 31 H. 8. ca. 14. <hi>Declared a Heretick, to ſuffer Death by burning, and to forfeit his Eſtate as in caſe of High Treaſon: The publick Preaching, and affirming in a Court of Juſtice, any thing contrary to the other five Articles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying after a vow of Chaſtity, is declared Felony, without Benefit of Clergy, and to forfeit as in caſes of Felony. And if any Perſon by Words, Writing, Printing, Cyphering, or otherwiſe, publiſh, declare, or hold Opinion, contrary to the ſaid five Articles, he forfeits his Goods and Chattels for ever, the Profits of his Lands, Tenements, and other his real Eſtate, during his life, his Spiritual Promotion ſhall be utterly void, and his body impriſoned, at the King's Pleaſure, for the firſt offence, and for the ſecond offence to be adjudg'd a Felon,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57626:7"/>
and ſuffer and forfeit as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy.</hi> By which Act it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the denying of Tranſubſtantiation, was by this Law made High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The publiſhing or holding the neceſſity of Receiving in both kinds, the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Prieſts Marrying, the unlawfulneſs of vowing Chaſtity, of private Maſſes, and Auricular Confeſſion, was no leſs than <hi>Felony,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>Premunire</hi>; So that in a word, to be a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> was to be a <hi>Traytor,</hi> a <hi>Felon,</hi> or ſubject to a <hi>Premunire</hi>: And could they have found any puniſhment inflicted by our Laws, that is worſe, they would (no doubt) have made the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſubject to it, and that, not as Offenders againſt the Polity of the Civil State, but purely upon the Account of their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, the next thing that is done by theſe deſtroyers of Souls as well as Bodies, is to take away all means of Knowledge (as well as to inhibit the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof,) upon ſuch ſevere Penalties; and for that purpoſe was the Act of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. made: Whereby,</p>

But before I can carry on the account of the reſt of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> made by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (the Reformation in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>'s time, of Glorious Memory, intervening) I ſhall ſhew how the <hi>Reformers</hi> uſed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in his Reign.</p>

            <p>IT may be expected that I ſhould ſay ſomething of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi>'s Reformation: But as to what was done in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi>'s time, I ſhall not trouble the Reader with any thing, becauſe the Reverend and Learned Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi> is ſo far from giving him the Character of good; that he concludes his firſt part of the Hiſtory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, vol. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>362.</hi>
               </note> with this, (ſpeaking of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi>) I do not deny that he is to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the ill Princes, yet I can't rank him with the worſt. Which Character cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the preceeding account of the Laws made in his time againſt the Proteſtants, does evidence to be very favourable to him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore begin with the Laws made in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> and the manner of introducing them. King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> coming to the Crown young, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> and others deſigning throughly to reform the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57626:7"/>
from the Errors and Corruptions that were crept into Her, during the time ſhe was under the <hi>Popiſh Tyranny</hi>: The firſt ſtep that was ſet in order to it, was the viſiting the <hi>Clergy</hi> quite over <hi>England,</hi> and compiling ſome wholeſome <hi>Homilies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mild Methods us'd by King <hi>Ed.</hi> the <hi>6</hi>th. before any Laws made.</note> to ſupply the defect of Sermons, by reaſon of the ignorance of the then <hi>Clergy,</hi> and to prevent unneceſſary Diſputes in the Pulpits: Their Articles and Injunctions for the Viſitation, were to be obſerved, under the pains of <hi>Excommunication, Sequeſtration,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,</hi> not upon the Penalty of being <hi>burnt</hi> as a <hi>Heretick,</hi> or forfeiture either of Lands in fee ſimple, or Goods or Chattels, or either, or any of them: This was done before the Parliament was called.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> 1547. The <hi>Parliament</hi> met, and the firſt <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> that was made, was an <hi>Act</hi> againſt ſuch as ſhould unreverently ſpeak againſt the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and of the receiving thereof under both kinds, which <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the Preamble, takes notice:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the King, minding the Governance and Order of his moſt loving Subjects,<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>1</hi> Ed. <hi>6.</hi> ca. <hi>1. Raſt. Stat.</hi> f. <hi>902.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper reſtored and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted on deſpiſers and neglecters of it, more moderate than what the Papiſts inflicted on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
                  </note> to be in moſt perfect unity and concord in all things, and in eſpecial in the true Faith and Religion of God, and wiſhing the ſame to be brought about with all Clemency and Mercy on his Highneſs part towards them, as his moſt Princely Serenity and Majeſty, hath already declared by evident proof, to the intent that his moſt loving Subjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by Clemency and Goodneſs of their Prince and King, ſhould ſtudy rather for love than fear, to do their duties, firſt to Almighty God, and then to him and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, nouriſhing concord and love amongſt themſelves; yet conſidered and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that in a Multitude, all were not of that ſort, that Reaſon and the Knowledge of their Duty could move them from Offences, but many had need of ſome bridle of fear, and that ſame were men moſt contentious and arrogant, for the moſt part, or elſe moſt dlind and ignorant: by the means of which ſort of men, many things well and godly inſtituted, and to the Edification of many were perverted and abuſed, and turned to their own and others great loſs, and hindrance, and ſometime to extream deſtruction, the which doth appear in nothing more, or ſooner, than in matters of Religion, and in the great and high Myſteries thereof, and particularly, inſtanceth in the moſt comfortable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body and blood of our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt</hi>; and ſets forth, <hi>that the ſame was Inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf, the words of the Inſtitution, and for what end,</hi> and then ſaith, <hi>that notwithſtanding this, the ſaid Sacrament had been marvelouſly abuſed, by ſuch manner of men before rehearſed, who of wickedneſs, or elſe of ignorance, and want of learning, for certain abuſes then-to-fore committed, of ſome, in miſuſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, had condemned in their hearts and ſpeech the whole thing, and contemptuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, deſpiſed, or reviled the ſame moſt holy and bleſſed Sacrament, and not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and reaſoned unreverently and ungodly of that moſt high Myſtery, but alſo in their Sermons, Preachings, Readings, Lectures, Communications, Arguments, Talks, Songs, Plays, or Ieſts, name or call it by ſuch vile and unſeemly words, as Chriſtian Ears do abhor to hear rehearſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this preamble, I gather, that the Popiſh Clergy had been greatly guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as uſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, according to our Saviour's Inſtitution, and that this Law was made to inhibit ſuch defamations, and to effect the ſame with as much Clemency and Gentleneſs, as the nature of the thing and the circumſtances of time would bear, as will appear by what was Enacted for Reformation of ſuch abuſe, which was, <hi>That whoever was guilty of the like abuſe, after the time in the Act for that purpoſe mentioned, ſhould be impriſoned, and make fine and ranſome at the King's Will and Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That three Juſtices of the Peace at leaſt, whereof one to be of the</hi> Quorum, <hi>ſhould have power to take Informations and Accuſations by the Oaths and Depoſitions of two able, honeſt, and lawful Perſons, at the leaſt, and then to trye the party accuſed, by a Jury at their Quarter Seſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which I obſerve, Firſt, that the <hi>Reformers</hi> did not make any Offence, relating to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> high Treaſon, as the Papiſts had done denying <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they did not leave it to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to examine in a <hi>Summary way,</hi> and convict, and then deliver the Offender over to the <hi>Secular</hi> power to be burnt; but left the Party to be accuſed by <hi>Legal Witneſſes,</hi> and Tryed by a Jury of Honeſt and Legal Men, according to the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Laws of the Kingdom: Nay,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> They were ſo far from reſtraining the party accuſed of his <hi>Liberty,</hi> That it is particularly provided by the ſaid Statute, that they might take Bail for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. After which it was Enacted, by the ſame <hi>Act</hi> (and which I deſire you to take in Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi>'s own words) <q>That it being more agreeable to Chriſt's firſt Inſtitution, and the practice of the Church for five hundred years after Chriſt,<note place="margin">Hiſt Reform. pt. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>41.</hi>

that the Sacrament ſhould be given in both the kinds of Bread and Wine, than in one kind only, it ſhould be commonly given in both kinds, except neceſſity did otherwiſe require; and it being alſo more agreeable to the firſt Inſtitution and the Primitive Practice; that the People ſhould receive with the Prieſt, than that the Prieſt ſhould receive it alone: Therefore the day before every Sacrament, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation was to be made to the People, to prepare themſelves for it, in which the benefits and dangers of worthy and unworthy Receiving, were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the Prieſts were not without a lawful Cauſe, to deny it to any who humbly asked it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which I obſerve, That this <hi>Act</hi> was made to reſtore the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> to its Antient and Primitive uſage, in both kinds with the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had not power to refuſe giving it to any, without juſt ground; and that however here is no <hi>Penalty</hi> annexed either Spiritual or Temporal.</p>
            <p>Several other Laws were made, in order to carrying on the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which inflicted no Penalty upon the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy or Layety, but were made for the well governing the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as it ſtood then Reformed, and put it out of the power of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to hurt them,<note place="margin">Raſt.

Which were the ſevere Laws, that the <hi>Popiſh Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> had obtained againſt the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the true <hi>Religion,</hi> whom they had nick-named, in deriſion, <hi>Lollards, Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Goſpellers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Reformation, in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>'s time, had reſtored the right Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, they reſted for two years, before they reformed the <hi>Liturgy</hi>; to the end, they might by degrees, and with all Acts of Clemency and Kindneſs, draw the <hi>Papiſts</hi> off from their Innovations, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, but finding that would not do, in the 3<hi>d.</hi> year of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>An Act for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Service and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments throughout the Realm was made and enjoyned,</hi> upon much milder penalties than any Laws relating to Religion, that were made by the <hi>Papiſts</hi>; for the Excellency of the Preamble of which Act, and that the truth of the Penalties may appear, I have inſerted both.</p>

            <p>I cannot omit the Account that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> gives, of the Method,<note place="margin">The Methods of the Perſecution of Proteſtants in this Reign.</note> of the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of this Reign.

But now it was far otherwiſe. For in the Council Books there is an Entry made of a Letter, written the</hi> 1ſt. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt 1558, <hi>to Sir</hi> Richard Pexhall, <hi>Sheriff of</hi> Hampſhire, <hi>ſignifying, That the Queen thought it very ſtrange, that he had delayed the Execution of one</hi> Bembridge, <hi>Condemned of Hereſie, becauſe he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted; Requiring him to Execute it out of hand, and if he ſtill continued in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, which he outwardly pretended, he was then to ſuffer ſuch Divines as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Wincheſter <hi>ſhould appoint, to have acceſs to him for confirming him in the Faith, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And as ſoon as the</hi> Sheriff <hi>had thus burnt him, he was to come to the Council, and anſwer for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in deferring it ſo long. The matter of Fact was thus:</hi> Bembridge <hi>being had to the Stake, and the Fire taking hold of him, he through the violence of it yielded, and cryed out, I recant; upon which, the Sheriff made the Fire to be put out, and</hi> Bembridge <hi>ſigned ſuch a Recantation, as Dr.</hi> Seton, <hi>who was near him, writ for him:</hi> But for all that, upon this Order of Council, he was burnt; and the Sheriff was put in the <hi>Fleet.</hi> So that now it appeared, that it was not ſo much the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe they called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as their Deſtruction, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> deſired: and I think, the Inſtance of Burning Arch <hi>Biſhop Cranmer,</hi> after he had recanted,<note place="margin">Hiſt.

            <p>And now they that can expect any better uſage from the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and Prelates of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> under a Prince of that perſwaſion, muſt, I think, have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Reaſon, and are fitter to converſe with <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Tygers,</hi> than men, much leſs the moſt refined of them, thoſe who are ſincerely of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, commonly called <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

            <p>My deſign in being thus long in ſetting forth the cruel Penal Laws that were made or revived, and put in Execution in this Reign, was, that the Reader might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Penal Laws in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>'s time, with the Penal Laws in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, and then judge, whether his are not merciful, compared with theſe, eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Execution, there being not one put to Death for Religion in all King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>'s Reign, that ſo the Moderation of the one may be admir'd, and the Cruelty of the other abhor'd: And not as any Reaſon, why the Penal Laws againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, were made upon ſuch ſevere Penalties, for I ſhall ſhew that they were made upon quite different reaſons, than in revenge (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> maliciouſly ſuggeſt) for the ſevere uſage of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in this Reign.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That if any perſon dwelling, inhabiting, or reſiant within the Queens Dominions, ſhould after</hi> 1 Apr. 1563<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The reaſon of the making</hi> which Law appears from the Preamble of the Act, and the Hiſtory of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>The Preamble takes notice, <hi>that Hures, Perils, Diſhonours, Inconveniences, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time befallen the Queens Majeſties Noble Progenitors, Kings of this Realm, and the whole eſtate thereof by means of the Juriſdiction of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>unjuſtly claimed, and uſurped within this Realm, and the Dominions thereof, and alſo takes notice of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Queen and ſtate was then in, by the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57626:13"/>
neceſſary to have more ſharp reſtraint, and correction of Laws, then before in the time of the Queens Majeſties moſt mild, and merciful Reign had been eſtabliſh'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it plainly appears, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> thought the Queens Perſon, and the Kingdom in great Danger from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who are all favourers of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Authority in <hi>England,</hi> and if <hi>Cambden</hi> may be believed, not without reaſon,<note place="margin">Cambd Annals <hi>fol.</hi> 58.</note> for he tells us, That <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1562 in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> were moſt grievouſly afflicted: And that thereupon the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> muttered many and Great matters in ſecret talk amongſt Companies, of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in like manner the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And every one that is acquainted with the Hiſtory of thoſe times, knows, that at the ſame time that theſe things were bruited about, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> here, the <hi>Guiſes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (that reſtleſs and unwearied Enemy of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion) were plotting and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving againſt the Queen, and that thoſe Plots and Contrivances of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> were never at an end, till the Axe put a period to her Life and them together.</p>
            <p>And how forward the Prieſts of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> eſpecially of the Order of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> are, to aſſert the <hi>Pope's</hi> juriſdiction, and bring in and Execute his <hi>Bulls</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> is well known amongſt <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And that this is laid by the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts themſelves to the Charge of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> I ſhall hereafter make appear. So that certainly it muſt be owned, that there was very good reaſon to make this Law; and as for the Penalties, they were annexed <hi>in terrorem,</hi> rather, than with any deſign to be inflicted to the ruine of them, againſt whom the Laws were made, as plainly appears from the Hiſtory of the firſt 12 years of this Queens Reign, during which time, the Perſons of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Queens mild uſage of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note> (notwithſtanding theſe Laws) remained in the Kingdom quiet, and undiſturbed, till they themſelves gave juſt occaſion, for putting theſe, and the Antient Laws of the Kingdom in Execution againſt them, and making further proviſion by the adding new Laws, with more ſevere Penalties, or rather inforcing the Execution of the old ones. <note n="1" place="marg1">

in you, and Our Paternal Affection towards both you and other Catholicks in that Kingdom, ought to affect us; for beſides that Common Duty of Paſtoral Charity, wherewith we ought to rejoice at the Welfare, or to be grieved at the Calamity of all the Faithful of Chriſt, and of every Province in which the Chriſtian Name is profeſſed, we are affected with an Epiſcopal prerogative of Love and Benevolence towards that Kingdom, both becauſe We remember it was heretofore by the Labour and Induſtry of our Predeceſſor, the Bleſſed <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (next after God Omnipotent) Converted from the Worſhip of Wood and Stones, to the Chriſtian Faith; and by fit Men ſent thither from him, inſtituted in Manners, and in the Catholick Doctrine, and alſo becauſe it uſed to exhibit to the Apoſtolick See, an excellent Faith and ſincerity of Devotion; therefore how much we grieve and are troubled at theſe your Evils, and the Evils of that Kingdom, which you in the ſame Letters no leſs Truely than Miſerably Lament, cannot eaſily be expreſt in Words. We grieve that ſo many and ſo great Poiſonous Infections of wicked Hereſies, and ſo deadly Wounds of the Chriſtian Common-Wealth, ſhould chiefly happen in the times of Our <hi>Pontificate</hi>: We are troubled, becauſe We are Compelled to be Solicitous about the Danger of you and other Catholicks; but yet when We remember the Power of his Prayers, who entreated for St. <hi>Peter, that his Faith might not fail</hi>; and who enlarging his Church in Tribulation, does by ſo much the more admirably govern it by the Providence of his ſecret Council, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not, but what we have heard to have been done in former times, may alſo by the Divine aſſiſtance, be done in ours. That the Church which often ſeems by the prevailing Perſecution of <hi>Hereticks</hi> to be trodden down, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to its State of Antient Felicity, (the Lord Conſpiring with her to a good Omen) and may receive encreaſe from that wherein ſhe ſeemed to have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Loſs. For Behold, even now, he that of old things makes new ones, and of new things old ones, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath by you, (Men, Dear to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and Eminent, as well by the Study of Catholick Piety, as by Nobleneſs of Birth) determined, peradventure to renew and confirm the Antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Romiſh Church, with that Kingdom; and therefore hath infuſed into you that mind, moſt worthy of the Zeal of your Catholick Faith, that you ſhould attempt to reduce back that Kingdom (delivered from the moſt vile Servitude of a Womans Luſt) to the Antient Obedience of this Holy <hi>Roman</hi> See, which Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Religious endeavour of your Minds, We recommend (as is fit) with juſt Praiſes in the Lord, and giving it that Our Bleſſing, which you deſire; We do with the Benignity which becomes us, receive your Honours flying to the Power and Protection of us, and of this Holy See, to whoſe Authority they Subject themſelves; exhorting you in the Lord, and with all poſſible earneſtneſs of Our Mind, entreating you to Perſevere conſtantly in this your ſo exceeding good will and lawdable Purpoſe: Being aſſured that the Omnipotent God, whoſe Works are Perfect, and who hath excited you to deſerve well of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith in that Kingdom, will be aſſiſting to you. But if in aſſerting the Catholick Faith, and Authority of this Holy See; you ſhould ſuffer Death, and your Blood be ſpilt, it would be much better for the Confeſſion of God, to flye by the Compendium of a Glorious Death to Life Eternal, than living Baſely and Ignominiouſly, to ſerve the Luſt of an Impotent Woman, with the Loſs of your Souls. For think not, Beloved Sons in Chriſt, that thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Biſhops, or Princes of that Kingdom whom you name, are ill dealt with, who becauſe they would not forſake the Profeſſion of the Catholick Faith, are either Impriſoned, or undeſervedly affected with other Puniſhments, for the Conſtancy of theſe Men, which is even now confirmed by a new Example (as we conceive) of the Bleſſed <hi>Thomas,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> no man can ſufficiently commend, as it deſerves. This ſame Conſtancy, you alſo imitating; be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57626:15"/>
of a Couragious and Conſtant mind, and deſiſt not from the Enterprize by any Threats or denunciation of Danger. For God in whom you ought to repoſe your Truſt, who did caſt the Chariot and Army of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the Sea, is able to break the Strength and Power of his Adverſaries; ſo that by you, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Religion and Ancient dignity of that Realm may be reſtored, which that it may be Compaſſed, we ſhall not only help you in performing with thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes whom you would, thoſe Offices which you deſire, but alſo in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing at preſent, that Sum of Money, which according to our Ability, in anſwer to your Requeſt, We can ſupply you with, as you ſhall more clearly and fully underſtand by our Beloved Son <hi>Robert Rodolphus,</hi> We being alſo ready to endeavour hereafter to contribute a Greater Sum than the Imbecility of Our Power will bear, and with a ready and chearful Mind to help your Pious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with all our Eſtate and Power, which We can in the Lord.</p>

                        <p>He that raigneth on high, to whom is given all Power in Heaven and in Earth, hath Committed his one, Holy, Catholick, and Apoſtolick Church, out of which there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to one alone upon Earth, namely, To <hi>Peter</hi> the Chief of the Apoſtles, and to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Succeſſor, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be by him govern'd with plenary Authority. Him alone hath he made Prince over all People, and all Kingdoms, to pluck up, deſtroy, ſcatter, conſume, plant, and build; that he may preſerve his faithful People, (knit together with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57626:16"/>
the band of Charity) in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, and preſent them ſpotleſs and unblamable to their Saviour. In diſcharge of which Function, we, who are by God's Goodneſs ſo called to the Government of the aforeſaid Church, do ſpare no pains, labouring with all earneſtneſs, that unity and the Catholick Religion, (which the Author thereof hath for the tryal of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Faith, and for our amendment ſuffered to be toſſed with ſo great Afflictions) might be preſerved ſincere. But the number of the ungodly hath gotten ſuch power, that there is now no place in the whole world left, which they have not aſſayed to corrupt with their moſt wicked Doctrines, and amongſt others, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the pretended Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the Servant of Wickedneſs, lendeth thereunto her helping hand, with whom, as in a Sanctuary, the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons have found a refuge. This very Woman having ſeized on the Kingdom, and monſtrouſly uſurped the place of Supream Head of the Church in all <hi>England,</hi> and the chief Authority and Juriſdiction thereof; hath again reduced the ſaid Kingdom into a miſerable and ruinous condition, which was ſo lately reclaimed to the Catholick Faith and a thriving Condition.</p>
                        <p>For having by ſtrong hand prohibited the exerciſe of the true Religion, which <hi>Mary</hi> the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Queen of Famous Memory, had by the help of this See reſtored, after it had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrown by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, a Revolter there-from, and following and embracing the Errors of Hereticks, ſhe hath changed the Royal Council, conſiſting of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and filled it up with obſcure Men, being Hereticks; ſuppreſſed the Embracers of the Catholick Faith; Conſtituted lewd Preachers and Miniſters of Impiety; Aboliſhed the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, Prayers, Faſtings, choice of Meats, unmarried Life, and the Catholick Rites and Ceremonies; commanded Books to be read through the whole Realm, containing manifeſt Hereſie, and appointed Impious Rites and Inſtitutions, by her ſelf entertained and obſerved according to the Preſcript of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to be likewiſe obſerved by her Subjects; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to eject Biſhops, Parſons of Churches, and other Catholick Prieſts, out of their Churches and Benefices, and to beſtow them and other Church Livings upon Hereticks, and to determine of Church Cauſes; prohibited the Prelates, Clergy, and People, to acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or obey the Precepts or Canonical Sanctions thereof; compelled moſt of them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to her wicked Laws, and to abjure the Authority and Obedience of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to acknowledge her to be ſole Lady in Temporal and Spiritual Matters, and this by Oath; impoſed Penalties and Puniſhments upon thoſe which obeyed not, and exacted them of thoſe which perſevered in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and their Obedience aforeſaid; caſt the Catholick Prelates and Rectours of Churches into Priſon, where many of them, being worn out with long languiſhing and ſorrow, miſerably ended their Lives: All which things being ſo manifeſt and notorious to all Nations, and by the ſerious Teſtimony of very many ſo ſubſtantially proved, that there is no place at all left for excuſe, defenſe or evaſion: We ſeeing that Impiety and Wicked Actions are multiplyed one upon another, as alſo that the Perſecution of the Faithful and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for Religion groweth every day heavier and heavier, through the inſtigation and by means of the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſince we underſtand her Heart to be ſo hardened and obdurate, that ſhe hath not only contemned the Godly Requeſts and Admonitions of Catholick Princes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her cure and Converſion, but alſo hath not ſo much as ſuffered the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From the precedent Hiſtory of Fact, and the Preamble of theſe two Acts of Parliament, and the Acts themſelves, I obſerve three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> That the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is in it ſelf a Free State; exempt from all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction whatever, by the Common Law of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That there had been deep Deſigns on foot, before the making of theſe Acts of Parliament, for the inſlaving this Kingdom to the Biſhop and See of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion, and introducing Popery; and in order thereunto, there were ſeveral Plots laid to deſtroy the perſon of the Queen.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That theſe were all laid and carried on by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſome Papiſts that were the Queens own Subjects, and others their adherents, and therefore certainly it muſt be granted that it was very neceſſary at that time to make theſe Laws againſt the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>And that it was but reaſonable to make them,<note place="margin">

That ſome of this money was ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſome delivered to the Duke; That King <hi>Philip,</hi> at the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Inſtance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſend the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with all his forces out of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>; which they confeſs in this manner. That theſe things their Adverſaries the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Charged on them as true, and that they were in hand whilſt her Majeſty dealt ſo mercifully with them, and therefore ask'd them how they could excuſe theſe deſigns ſo Unchriſtian, ſo unprieſtly, ſo Treacherous, and ſo unprince-like?

               </note> 
               <hi>we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, as reaſonable men, that the State had great Reaſons to make ſome Laws againſt us, except they ſhould have ſhown themſelves careleſs for the continuance of it, but be the Law, as any would have it, never ſo extream, yet ſurely it muſt be granted, that the occaſions of it were moſt outragious, and likewiſe that the Execution of it was not ſo Tragical, as many have ſince written and reported of it; for whatſoever was done againſt us, either upon the pretence of that Law, or of any other, would never we think have been attempted, had not divers other prepoſterous occaſions, beſides the Cauſes of that Law, daily fallen out amongſt us, which procured matters to be urged more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely againſt us.</hi> And afterwards they accuſe <hi>Saunders</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> for writing a Book in 1572, <hi>de viſibili Monarchia,</hi> and therein juſtifying the Excommunicating the Queen, and the ſaid Rebellion in the <hi>North,</hi> and do themſelves own, that the perſons that ſuffered upon that account, were Arraigned, Condemned, and Executed, by the Antient Laws of the Country, for High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>As to the Acts themſelves, It is not to be denyed, but they are very ſevere, yet not ſevere enough to deter the Papiſts from carrying on their deſigns againſt the Queen, and the Proteſtant Religion, as I ſhall by and by make appear; but before I do that, let us a little enquire,<note place="margin">

            <p>This <hi>Parſons</hi> was of <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> a violent, fierce natur'd Man, and of rough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, <hi>Campian</hi> was a <hi>Londoner,</hi> of a ſweet diſpoſition, and a well polliſh'd Man, both of them were, by Education <hi>Oxford</hi> Men, and known there to <hi>Cambden</hi> himſelf, as he avers; <hi>Campian</hi> being of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge, bare the Office of <hi>Proctor</hi> of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, in the Year 1568. and being made <hi>Deacon,</hi> made a ſhew of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, he withdrew himſelf out of <hi>England, (they can turn themſelves into all ſhapes, to carry on their Barbarous and Cruel Conſpiracies againſt the</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>and the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they profeſs: Modern Inſtances of this we have not a few.)

            <p>Neither wanted there others alſo of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Faction (<hi>for Religion was then grown into faction as it was very lately here in</hi> England) who Laboured Tooth and Nail at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſewhere in Princes Courts, to raiſe War againſt their own Country: Yea, they publiſhed alſo in Print, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together, to Conquer <hi>England</hi>; and expoſe it for a Spoil and Prey. And this they did on purpoſe to give Courage to their own Party, and to terrifie others from their Allegiance to their Prince and Country. This forced a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> from the Queen,<note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Annals,</hi> f. 247.</note> wherein (after acknowledgment of the goodneſs of God towards her;) She declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>that ſhe had attempted nothing againſt any Prince, but for preſervation of her own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; nor had ſhe Invaded the Provinces of any other, tho ſhe had been ſundry times thereunto both provoked by Injuries, and invited by Opportunities, that if any Prince go about to attempt ought againſt her, ſhe doubts not but to be able (by the Bleſſing of God) to defend her People, and to that purpoſe ſhe had Muſtered her Forces, both by Sea, and Land, and had them now in readineſs againſt any Hoſtile Invaſion; her faithful Subjects ſhe Exhorts, to continue immoveable in their Allegiance and Duty towards God and their Prince, the Miniſter of God,</hi> (not their abſolute Supream Lord, to diſpoſe of them and theirs according to will and pleaſure,)

               <hi>That our moſt Gracious Queen, did at her firſt Entry looſen us from the Yoke of</hi> Rome, <hi>and did Reſtore unto this Realm the moſt pure and holy Religion of the Goſpel, which for a time was overſhaddowed with Popery, is known of all the World, and felt of us to our ſingular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But from hence as from the Root, hath ſprung that implacable Malice of the Pope, and his Confederates againſt her, whereby they have and do not ſeek only to trouble, but if they could, to bring the Realm again into a Thraldom; the rather for that, they hold this as a firm and ſetled opinion, that</hi> England <hi>is the only ſetled Monarchy that moſt doth maintain and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Religion, being the chief Sanctuary for the afflicted Members of the Church, that fly thither from the Tyranny of</hi> Rome, <hi>as Men being in danger of Shipwrack, do from a raging and tempeſtuous Sea to a calm and quiet Haven.

               <hi>The Pope turned thus the Venom of his Curſes, the Pens of his malitious Paraſites into Men of War and Weapons, to win that by force, which otherwiſe he could not do. And though all theſe are ſaid to be done by the Pope, and in his Name; yet who ſeeth not, that they be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under hand by ſome Princes his Confederates?

               <hi>But yet notwithſtanding, ſeeing our Enemies ſleep not, it behoveth us not to be careleſs, as tho all were paſt, but rather to think that there is but a piece of the Storm over, and that the greater part of the Tempeſt remaineth behind, and is like to fall upon us, by the Malice of the Pope, the moſt capital Enemy of the Queen and of this State, the Determinations of the Councils of</hi> Trent, <hi>and the Combinations of the Pope with other Monarchies and Princes devoted unto</hi> Rome, <hi>aſſuring our ſelves, That if their Powers be anſwerable to their Wills, this Realm ſhall find at their Hands, all the Miſeries and Extremities that they can bring upon it. And though by the late good Succeſs, which God hath given in</hi> Ireland, <hi>theſe leud and malicious Enterpriſes ſeem for a time to be as it were at a ſtand; yet let us be aſſured, that neither their Attempts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Ireland, <hi>neither the Miſchief intended againſt</hi> England, <hi>will ceaſe thus; but if they find us negligent, they will be ready with greater Forces then have been yet ſeen. The certain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination which the Pope and his combined Friends have to root out the Religion of the Goſpel in all Places, and to begin here as their greateſt Impediment, is Cauſe ſufficient to make us the more vigilant, and to have a wary Eye to their Doings and Proceedings, how ſmoothly ſoever they ſpeak or diſſemble their Friendſhips for the time, for let us think ſurely, that they have joyned Hands together againſt us, and if they can, they will procure the Sparks of the Flames that have been ſo terrible in other Countries, to fly over into</hi> England, <hi>and to kindle as great a Fire here. And as the Pope by open Hoſtility, as you ſee, hath ſhewed himſelf againſt her Majeſty, ſo the better to anſwer in time the Purpoſes that he hath ſet down in the mean Seaſon, till they may come to Ripeneſs, he hath and doth by ſecret Practices within the Realm, leaving nothing unprovided, emboldning many undutiful Subjects to ſtand faſt in their Diſobedience to her Majeſty and her Laws. For albeit, the pure Religion of the Goſpel hath had a free Courſe, and hath been freely preached now many Years within this Realm, by the Protection of Her Majeſties moſt Chriſtian Government; yet ſuch have been the Practices of the Pope and his ſecret Miniſters, as the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſtiff-necked Papiſt is ſo far from being reformed, as he hath gotten Stomach to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to ſhew his Diſobedience, not only in arrogant Words, but alſo in contemptuous Deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To confirm them herein, and to increaſe their Number, you ſee how the Pope hath and doth comfort their hollow, Hearts with Abſolutions, Diſpenſations, Reconciliations, and ſuch other things of</hi> Rome. <hi>You ſee how lately he hath ſent hither a ſort of Hypocrites, naming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Jeſuits, a Rabble of Vagrant Fryars, newly ſprung up, and running through the World, to trouble the Church of God; whoſe principal Errand, is by creeping into the Houſes of Men of Behaviour and Reputation, not only to corrupt the Realm with falſe Doctrine, but alſo under that Pretence, to ſtir up Sedition, to the Peril of Her Majeſty and her good Subjects. How theſe Practiſes of the Pope have wrought in the diſobedient Subjects of this Land, is both evident and lamentable to conſider; for ſuch Impreſſions hath the Eſtimation of the Popes Authority made in them, as not only thoſe, which from the Beginning have refuſed to obey, but many, yea, very many of theſe, who divers years together, did yield and conform themſelves in their open Accounts, ſince the Decrees of that unholy Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and ſince the publiſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of that Blaſphemous Bull against Her Majeſty, and ſince thoſe ſecret Abſolutions and Reconciliations, and the ſwarming hither of a number of Popiſh Prieſts, and Monkiſh Jeſuits, have, and do utterly refuſe to be of our Church, or to reſort unto our Preaching and Prayers.

               <hi>By this you ſee what Cauſe we have juſtly to doubt great Miſchief threatned to this Realm, and therewith you may eaſily ſee alſo, how far the preventing and withſtanding of the ſame, it behooveth her Majeſty, not only to provide in time, ſufficient Laws for the continuing of this Peaceable Government, but alſo to be ready with Forces to repreſs all Attempts that may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed, either by Enemies abroad, or by evil Subjects at home.</hi>

proof, we find that this favorable and gentle Manner of Dealing with the Diſobeyers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Religion, to win them by fair Means, if it were poſſible, hath done no good, but hath bred in them a more arrogant and contemptuous Spirit, ſo as they have not only preſumed to diſobey the Laws and Orders of the Realm, but alſo to accept from</hi> Rome <hi>ſecret Abſolutions, Reconciliations and ſuch like; and that by the Hands of leud Runnagates, Prieſts and Jeſuits, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and entertaining them even in their Houſes, thereby ſhewing an Obedience to the Pope, by their Directions; alſo nouriſhing and training up their Children and Kinsfolks, not only at home, but alſo abroad in the Seminaries of Popery; Now, I ſay, it is time for us to look more narrowly and ſtrictly to them, leaſt as they be corrupt, ſo they prove dangerous Members to many born within the Entrails of our Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing that the Lenity of the Time, and the Mildneſs of the Laws heretofore made, are no ſmall Cauſe of their arrogant Diſobedience, 'tis neceſſary that we make a Proviſion of Laws, more ſtrict, and more ſevere, to conſtrain them to yield their open Obedience, at the leaſt, to her Majeſty, in Cauſes of Religion, and not to live as they lift, to the perillous Example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to the encouraging of their own evil affected Minds; but if they will needs ſubmit themſelves to the Benedictions of the Pope, they may feel how little his Curſes can hurt us, and how little his Bleſſings can ſave them from that Puniſhment, which we are able to lay upon them; letting them alſo find, how dangerous it ſhall be for them to deal with the Pope, or any thing of his, or with thoſe Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits; and therewith, alſo how perillous it ſhall be for thoſe Seditious Runnagates to enter into the Land, to draw away from Her Majeſty that Obedience, which by the Laws of God and Man, are due unto her.</p>
            <p>This then is one of the Proviſions which we ought to take care of in this Council, whereby we may both enjoy ſtill that happy Peace we live in, and the Pope take the leſs Boldneſs to trouble us, by any Favour he ſhall find here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, ſeeing the Malice of the Pope and his Confederates are ſo notorious unto us, and ſeeing the Dangers be ſo great, ſo evident, and ſo imminent, and ſeeing that Preparations to withſtand them, cannot be made without ſupport of the Realm, and ſeeing that our Duty to God, our Queen and Country, and the Neceſſity that hangeth upon our own Safeguards, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient to perſwade us; let us think upon theſe Matters as the Weight of them deſerveth, and ſo provide in time, both by Laws to reſtrain and correct the evil affected Subjects, and by Proviſion of that which ſhall be requiſite for the Maintainance of Forces, as our Enemies finding our Minds ſo willing, and our Hands ſo ready, to keep in order our Country, and to furniſh her Majeſty with all that ſhall be neceſſary, may either be diſcouraged to attempt any thing againſt us, or if they do, they may find ſuch Reſiſtance, as ſhall bring Confuſion to themſelves, Honour to our moſt Gracious Queen, and Safety to all of us.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſeconding the Motion, it was referred to a Committee to prepare Bills.</p>

               <hi>An Act to retain the Queens Majeſties Subjects in their due Obedience</hi>; which Act recites, <hi>That, where ſince the making of the</hi> 13th. <hi>of the Queen,</hi> Ca. 2. <hi>divers evil affected Perſons have promiſed, contrary to the meaning of the ſaid Statutes, by other means then by Bulls, or Inſtruments written or printed, to withdraw divers the Queens Majeſties Subjects from their natural Obedience to Her Majeſty, and to obey the uſurped Authority of</hi> Rome, <hi>and in reſpect of the ſame, to perſwade great Numbers to withdraw their due Obedience to Her Majeſties Laws, eſtabliſhed for the due Service of Almighty God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is thereby enacted, that they ſhould be guilty of High Treaſon,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>From the Hiſtory of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Conſpiracies, and the Queens Carriage towards them, during theſe laſt ten Years, whereof I have given an Account, I cannot but obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:57626:22"/>1. That the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are a moſt perverſe and diſingenuous Generation of Men, who never have lived, (<hi>nor is it to be believed ever will</hi>) in Obedience to any Prince who is not of their own Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That, notwithſtanding their many Treaſons and Rebellions in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yet, in ten years time, there were not above five exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon any of the Penal Laws made againſt them; and that ſhe was hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to execute any of them, although for the moſt apparent Treaſon; and would not have yielded, but that it appeared neceſſary, for the Preſervation of her ſelf, her Proteſtant Subjects, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That therefore the Penal Laws were not made ſo much with deſign to offend the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as to defend the Queen and her Government from the Treaſons, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Outrages and Violences every where committed by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſtirred up and egged on by the <hi>Seminary Prieſts, Jeſuits,</hi> and ſent hither for that very Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That notwithſtanding all their Plots and Contrivances, there was no reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their exerciſing their Religion in their own private Families; nor no Prohibitions of ſaying or hearing Maſs, till this laſt Act of Parliament was made; which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from the State by their horrid Abuſe of their former Liberty.</p>
            <p>So that he that denies the Reaſonableneſs of thoſe Penal Laws againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> muſt (one would think) offer Violence to his own Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But yet leaſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould object, and any <hi>weak Proteſtant</hi> think, with too great <hi>Colour</hi> of Reaſon, that theſe Facts are the Relation of <hi>Proteſtant Hiſtorians,</hi> who will be ſure to write all things with the greateſt plauſibleneſs and ſhew of Reaſon and Juſtice on their own ſide, and will be ſure to blacken and villifie the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as much as they are able, although they have never ſo little reaſon ſo to do.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, to back what I have related from our own <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> and to convince all mankind that it is true, ſubjoyn what the <hi>Seeular Prieſts</hi> themſelves, in their important Conſiderations have owned, was the true ground and reaſon of making this Act of Parliament, of 23 <hi>Eliz.

This Stratagem accompliſht, and ground laid, whereupon they imagined to work great Matters: theſe good Fathers (as the Devil would have it) came into <hi>England,</hi> and intruded themſelves into our Harveſt, being the Men in our Conſciences (we mean both them and others of that Society, with ſome of their Adherents) who have been the chief Inſtruments of all the Miſchiefs that have been intended againſt her Majeſty, ſince the beginning of her Reign, and of the Miſeries which we, or any other Catholics, have upon theſe Occaſions ſuſtained. Their firſt repair hither, was <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. when the Realm of <hi>Ireland</hi> was in great Combuſtion,<note place="margin">Parſons <hi>and</hi> Campians <hi>coming into</hi> England <hi>in</hi> 1580.</note> and then they entred (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Campian</hi> the Subject, and Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> the Provincial) like a Tempeſt, with ſundry ſuch great Brags and Challenges, as divers of the graveſt Clergy then living in <hi>England</hi> (Dr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and others) did greatly diſlike
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57626:22"/>
them, and plainly foretold, that (as things then ſtood) their Proceedings after that faſhion, would certainly urge the State to make ſome ſharp Laws, which ſhould not only touch them, but likewiſe all others, both Prieſts and Catholics, upon their Arrival; and after theſe brags, Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> preſently fell to his Jeſuitical Courſes; and ſo be-laboured both himſelf and others in matters of State, how he might ſet her Majeſties Crown upon another Head (as appeareth by a letter of his own to a certain Earl,) that the Catholics themſelves threatned to deliver him into the hands of the Civil Magiſtrate, except he deſiſted from ſuch kind of practices.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In theſe tumultuous and rebellious proceedings by ſundry Catholics, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> it could not be expected, but that the Queen and the State would be greatly incenſed with indignation againſt us. We had (ſome of us) greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the ſaid Rebellion, highly extoll'd the Rebels, and pitifully bewailed their Ruin and Over-throw. Many of our affections were knit to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and for our Obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> we all do profeſs it. The attempts both of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> failing in <hi>England</hi>; his Holineſs as a temporal Prince,<note place="margin">The Popes Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſplayed in <hi>Ireland</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Queen.</note> diſplayed his Banner in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This Plot was to deprive Her Highneſs firſt from that Kingdom (if they could) and then by degrees to depoſe her from this. In all theſe Plots, none were more forward then many of us that were Prieſts: The Layity, if we had oppoſed our ſelves to theſe deſignments, would out of doubt) have been over-ruled by us. How many of our Calling were addicted to theſe Courſes the State knew not. In which Caſe (the premiſes diſcreetly conſidered) there is no King, or Prince in the World, diſguſting the See of <hi>Rome</hi>; and having either force or Metal in him,<note place="margin">The Queen Vindicated and commended.</note> that would have indured us, if poſſible he could have been revenged, but rather (as we think) have utterly rooted us out of his Territories, as Traytors, and Rebels both to him and his Country. And therefore we may rejoyce unfeignedly, that God hath bleſſed this Kingdom with ſo gracious and merciful a Soveraign, who hath not dealt, in this ſort with us. Aſſuredly if ſhe were a Catholic, ſhe might be accounted the Mirrour of the World; but as ſhe is, both we and all other Catholics, her natural Subjects, deſerve no longer to live, then we hereafter ſhall Honour her from our Hearts, obey her in all things (ſo far as poſſibly we may) pray for her Proſperous Reign and long Life, and to our Powers, defend and Protect, both her and our Country againſt any whatſoever, that ſhall by force of Arms attempt to damnifie either of them; for in the ſaid Garboils, and very undutiful Proceedings; how hath her Highneſs dealt with us? From the time of the ſaid Rebellion and Parliament;<note place="margin">The Papiſts themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs not above twelve Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ten years.</note> there were few above twelve, that in ten Years, had been Executed for their Conſciences (as we hold) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho our Adverſaries ſay for Treaſon, and of thoſe twelve, ſome parhaps can hardly be drawn within our Account, having been tainted with matters of Rebellion. The moſt of the ſaid number were Seminary Prieſts, who if they had come over with the like intents, that ſome others have done, might very worthily have been uſed as they were: But in our Conſciences; nay, ſome of us do know it, that they were far from thoſe Seditious humours; being Men that intended nothing elſe then ſimply the good of our Country; and the Converſion of Souls. Marry, to ſay the Truth, as we have Confeſſed before, how could either her Majeſty or the State, know ſo much.</q> They had great Cauſe, as politic Perſons, to ſuſpect the worſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Beſides to the further Honour of Her Majeſty we may not Omit, that the States of the whole Realm Aſſembled in Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1576. Were pleaſed to paſs us over, and made no Laws at that time againſt us: The Antient Priſoners that had been reſtrained more narrowly in the Year 1570. were (notwithſtanding the ſaid Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes in <hi>Ireland</hi>) again reſtored to their former Liberty, to continue with their Friends as they had done before; ſuch as were not ſuſpected to have been Dealers or Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, in the ſaid Treaſonable Accounts, were uſed with that humanity, which could not well be expected. But when the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were come, and that the State had notice of the ſaid Excommunication, there was then within a while great alteration; for ſuch were the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> proceedings, and with ſo great boldneſs, as tho all had been theirs, and that the State ſhould preſently have been changed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Her Majeſty had ſeen what followed in her Kingdom upon the firſt Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and was therefore in all worldly Policy to prevent the like by the ſecond.

I ſent to him by <hi>Ragozonio,</hi> his Nuncio in <hi>France</hi>; who highly commended my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and ſent my Letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> being returned into <hi>England,</hi> I procured acceſs to the Queen, to whom after all By-ſtanders were removed, I diſcovered the whole Conſpiracy, how be it, cloaked with the beſt Art I could, ſhe heard me without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daunted, I departed not without being terrified; and cannot now forget what ſhe then ſaid; That no Catholic ſhould be called in Queſtion meerly for Religion, or the Popes Supremacy, ſo that they ſhewed themſelves good Subjects: In the mean time, whilſt I was a daily Suitor in the Court, for the Maſterſhip of St. <hi>Catharines,</hi> I received Letters from the Cardinal of <hi>Como,</hi> wherein my enterprize was commended, and my ſelf abſolved in the Popes Name. Theſe Letters I imparted to the Queen, what effect they wrought with her I know not; to me they certainly added Courage, and took away all ſcruples; yet was I not minded to offer her any violence, if ſhe could by any means be perſwaded to deal more favourably with the Catholics. And therefore leaſt I ſhould commit the Murther, I layed away my Dagger ſtill, as often as I had acceſs to her; when I ſeriouſly conſidered her, and her truly Royal vertues, I was diſtracted with doubtful thoughts, for my Vows were recorded in Heaven, my Letters and Promiſes amongſt Men; theſe things I often pondered with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Mind, I was never much beholden to her for any thing; my Life indeed ſhe once Pardoned me; but to have taken it away upon that occaſion, had been cruel and tyrannical; hereupon, I departed from Court much unſatisfied with my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I lighted upon Dr. <hi>Allens</hi> Book againſt the Juſtice of <hi>Brittain,</hi> where he taught, That Princes Excommunicate for Hereſie, were to be deprived of Kingdom and Life; which Book did ſtrongly encourage me, to proſecute my attempt. This Book I read to <hi>Nevil</hi> (whom I ſometimes invited to my Table) ſix whole Months before he accuſed me; afterwards he came to me and ſaid, let us venture upon ſomewhat, ſince we can get nothing from the Queen, and he propounded ſeveral things about the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>: But I have (ſaid I) a greater buſineſs in my Mind, and of more advantage for the Catholic Church. The next day he came and ſwore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bible, that he would conceal, and conſtantly perſue any thing that ſhould be for the good of the Catholic Religion, and I ſware the like, we then reſolved with ten more Men to ſet upon the Queen, as ſhe rode abroad to take the Air, and to kill her: All which <hi>Nevil</hi> concealed till now. But having heard, that the Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> was dead, whoſe Eſtate he hath already ſwallowed in hopes, he preſently brake his Oath, and accuſed me of theſe things.</q>

               <q>Very unpleaſing is that way where the ſetting out Progreſs and Journeys end, yield nothing but trouble and vexation. I have this day been in greater conflict with my ſelf then ever I was in all my Life; whether I ſhould ſpeak or hold my peace? If I ſhould ſpeak and not complain, I ſhall diſſemble, if I ſhould be ſilent; all your Labour and Pains taken were in vain; and if I ſhould complain, it might ſeem a ſtrange and unuſual thing. Yet I confeſs, that my hearty deſire was, that ſome other means might have been deviſed to provide for your ſecurity and my own ſafety, then this which is now propounded: So that I cannot but complain, tho not of you; yet to you, ſince I perceive by your Petition, that my ſafety dependeth wholly upon the ruin of another. If there be any that think I have ſpun out the time on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to get commendation by a ſeeming ſhew of Clemency; they do me wrong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly, as he knoweth, who is the ſearcher of the moſt ſecret thoughts of the Heart; or if there be any that are perſwaded, the Commiſſioners durſt pronounce no other Sentence, for fear they ſhould diſpleaſe me, or ſeem to fail of their Care for my preſervation, they do but wrong me with ſuch injurious conceits; for either thoſe whom I have put in Truſt, have failed of their Duties; or elſe they acquainted the Commiſſioners in my Name, that my will and pleaſure was, that every one ſhould act freely according to his Conſcience; and what they thought not fit to be made publick, that they ſhould communicate to me in private. It was of my favourable inclination towards her, that I deſired ſome other way might be found out to prevent this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. But ſince it is now reſolved, that my ſecurity is deſperate without her death, I find a great reluctancy and trouble within me, that I, who have, in my time, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many Rebels, wincked at ſo many Treaſons, or neglected them by ſilence, ſhould now ſeem to ſhew my ſelf cruel towards ſo great a Princeſs.</q>

But what is it which they will not venture to write now, when they ſhall hear that I have given my conſent, that the Executioners hands ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed in the Blood of my neareſt Kinſwoman? But ſo far am I from cruelty, that though it were to ſave my own Life; I would not offer her the leaſt violence: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I been ſo careful how to prolong mine own Life, as how to preſerve both hers and mine: which that it is now impoſſible to do, I am heartily troubled; I am not ſo void of ſence and judgment; as not to ſee mine own danger before mine Eyes; nor ſo indiſcreet as to ſharpen a Sword to cut my own Throat; nor ſo egregiouſly careleſs, as not to provide for the ſafty of mine own Life. This I conſider with my ſelf; that many a Man would hazzard his own Life; to ſave the Life of a Princeſs; but I am not of their opinion, theſe things have I many times thought upon ſeriouſly with my ſelf.</q>

            <p>
               <q>But ſince ſo many have both written and ſpoken againſt me, give me leave I pray you, to ſay ſomewhat in mine own defence, that ye may ſee what manner of Woman I am, for whoſe ſafety and preſervation you have taken ſuch extraordinary care, wherein as I do with a moſt thankful heart diſcern and read your great vigilancy; ſo I am ſure, I ſhall never requite it, had I as many lives as all you together.</q>

Hence it is, that ſo

many Treacheries and Conſpiracies have been attempted againſt me, that I might well admire to find my ſelf alive at this preſent day, were it not that Gods holy hand hath ſtill protected me beyond all Expectations. Next, to the end I might make the better progreſs in the Art of Ruling well; I had long and ſerious Conſultations with my ſelf, what things were moſt worthy and becoming Kings to do, and I found it abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould be compleatly furniſhed with thoſe prime Capital Vertues, Juſtice, Temperance, Prudence and Magnanimity: Of the two latter I will not boaſt my ſelf, my Sex doth not permit it, they are proper to Men; but for the two former and leſs rough, I dare ſay (and that without oſtentation) I never made a difference of Perſons, but high and low had equally right done them; I never preferred any for favour, whom I thought not fit and worthy; I never was forward to believe Storys at the firſt telling; nor was I ſo raſh as to ſuffer my Judgement to be foreſtalled with prejudice before I had heard the Cauſe. I will not ſay but many reports might happily be brought me too much in favour of the one ſide or the other: for a good and wary Prince may ſometimes be bought and ſold, whilſt we cannot hear all our ſelves; yet this I dare ſay boldly, my Judgment (as far as I could underſtand the Caſe) ever went with truth. And as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> adviſed his friend, not to give any anſwer till he had run over the Letters of the whole Alphabet, ſo have I never uſed raſh and ſudden reſolutions in any thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And therefore as touching your Councils and Conſultations, I acknowledge them to have been with ſuch care and Providence, and ſo advantageous, for the preſervation of my Life, and to proceed from hearts ſo ſincere and devoted to me, that I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour what lyes in my power, to give you cauſe to think your pains not ill beſtowed, and ſtrive to ſhew my ſelf worthy of ſuch Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And now for your Petition, I deſire you for the preſent to content your ſelves, with an anſwer without anſwer; your Judgement I condemn not, neither do I miſlike your reaſon, but I muſt deſire you to excuſe thoſe thoughtful doubts and cares, which as yet perplex my Mind; and ſo reſt ſatisfied with the profeſſion of my thankful eſteem of your affections, and the anſwer I have given, if you take it for any anſwer at all; if I ſhould ſay I will not do what you requeſt, I might ſay perhaps more than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; and if I ſhould ſay I would do it, I might plunge my ſelf into as bad inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies as you endeavour to perſwade me from: which I am confident your wiſdom and diſcretions would not that I ſhould, if you conſider the circumſtances of place, time, and the manner and conditions of Men.</q>

               </note> being commended to her, to fit her for Death, ſhe rejected them, and ſharply taxed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſaying that the <hi>Engliſh, had many times put their own Kings to death, no marvel there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore if they now alſo ſhewed their cruelty upon her, who was iſſued from the Blood of their Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After her Sentence was publiſhed (before any Warrant for her Execution) People vented their ſeveral Opinions, ſome for it, ſome againſt it, I ſhall Wave all but the then <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours Reaſons on the behalf of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Anſwer to thoſe Reaſons, as they are related by <hi>Cambden,</hi> as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it very much concerned the moſt Chriſtian King of</hi> France, <hi>and all other Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours Reaſons againſt executing the Queen of <hi>Scots. Camb.</hi> Annals f. <hi>374.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that a Queen, a free and abſolute Princeſs, ſhould not be put to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Queens ſafety would not be more endangered by the death of Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>then it would be by her Life: That if ſhe were delivered out of Priſon, ſhe could probably attempt nothing againſt the Queen, being now in a ſickly condition and having but a ſhort time to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That although ſhe had laid claim to the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>ſhe was not to be blamed for it, but it was wholly to be imputed to her young and tender Years, and to bad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57626:39"/>
               <hi>That ſhe came at firſt a ſupplicant into</hi> England, <hi>and therefore having been unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſhe was now at length to be either ranſomed, or mercifully dealt withal. Moreover, that an abſolute Prince was not to be called in queſtion, which made</hi> Tully, <hi>ſay,</hi> So unſual a thing it is for a King to be put to death, for any Crime, that before this time, it was never ſo much as heard of,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if ſhe were Innocent, ſhe were not to be puniſhed; if Guilty ſhe was to be ſpared; for this would turn to far greater honour and advantage, and would be recorded eternally, as an example of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Clemency. That the ſtory of</hi> Porſenna <hi>in this Caſe was to be remembred, who ſnatched the right hand of</hi> Mutius Scaevola <hi>out of the Fire, and ſet him at Liberty, though he had Conſpired his Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it was a prime Rule and Precept for well Governing, to be ſparing of Blood; that Blood cryeth for Blood: That to uſe the extreamity of rigour towards her, could not but ſeem a cruel and bloody Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>King would do his beſt to repel and fruſtrate the Attemps of all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, who ſhould offer violence to the Queen: and that the</hi> Guiſes, <hi>the Queen of</hi> Scots <hi>near Kinſmen, would engage themſelves to do the like by Oath and Covenant under their hands, who in Caſe ſhe ſhould be put to death, would take it very hardly and haply not leave her unrevenged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, they required ſhe might not be proceeded againſt according to ſo rigorous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a Sentence: Otherwiſe the</hi> French <hi>King, could not but take very great diſpleaſure thereat, howſoever other Princes ſhould hap to reſent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Anſwer to thoſe Reaſons.</note>To theſe Reaſons Anſwer was made from Point to Point as followeth.</p>
            <p>That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> truſted, the moſt Chriſtian King of <hi>France</hi> would have no leſs a regard and reſpect for her, then he had for the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who had practiſed the deſtruction of an Innocent Princeſs, her near Kinſwoman, and a Confederate with the <hi>French</hi> King. That it was expedient and neceſſary for Kings and Common-wealths, that wicked attempts (eſpecially againſt Princes) ſhould not go unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which acknowledged the Soveraign Authority of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> only in <hi>England,</hi> could not acknowledge two Supream free and abſolute Princes in <hi>England</hi> at one time, or account any other whomſoever, equal to her in <hi>England</hi> as long as ſhe lived. Neither indeed did they ſee, how the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and her Son who at preſent Reigneth, can be reputed both at one time for Supream and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Princes.</p>
            <p>Whether the Queens ſafety would be expoſed to greater danger upon her being Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, depended upon future Accidents and Contingences; the Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi> upon ſerious deliberations of the Matter, thought otherwiſe there would never be occaſions wanting for bad attempts, eſpecially when the Matter was now come to that paſs, that the one had no hope of ſafety, unleſs the other were ruined: and this ſaying they might call to Mind <hi>aut ego illam, aut illa me,</hi> either I muſt take away her Life, or ſhe will take away mine. The ſhorter the time to come of her Life was, the ſooner and more eagerly would the Conſpirators haſten the Queens danger.</p>
            <p>That the Title which ſhe claimed to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe would not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and therefore ſhe was with good reaſon detained in Priſon, and ſo to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (though ſhe came a Supplicant into <hi>England</hi>) till ſhe had renounced the ſame, and the Crimes which ſhe had committed ſince ſhe was Priſoner, ſhe ought to ſuffer for, whatever were the Cauſe of her firſt caſting into Priſon.</p>
            <p>That the Queen had formerly moſt Graciouſly ſpared her Life, when by unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of the Eſtates, ſhe was Condemned for a Rebellion raiſed, about an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Marriage between her and the Duke of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> and to ſpare her again, were but unadviſed and cruel pity; that no man was ignorant of that ſaying of the Lawyers. <hi>A Man offending in anothers Territory, and there found, is puniſhed in the Place of his Offence, without regard of his Dignity, Honour or Priviledge</hi>: And that this was both juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Examples of <hi>Licinius, Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scicily,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57626:39"/>
Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy, Couradine, Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary, Joan</hi> Queen of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Dejotants</hi>; for whom <hi>Tully</hi> pleading, ſaid, it was no unjuſt thing that a King ſhould be found Guilty, and put to Death, though it were not uſual: For thus the words run, <hi>which I ſpeak firſt touching a Kings forfeiture of Life and Eſtate, which thing though it be not unjuſt, eſpecially when thy Life is in danger from him, yet is it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That ſhe ought to be puniſhed, having been found Guilty upon a juſt and legal Tryal; conſidering that what is juſt, the ſame is honeſt, and what is honeſt, is alſo profitable and Expedient.</p>
            <p>That the Story of <hi>Porſenna</hi> ſuited not with the preſent Caſe, unleſs a Man ſhould imagine a numerous Combinations of men to have laid wait for the Queens Life, and ſhould thereupon perſwade her to let the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> at Liberty without any hurt, out of a fear of them, with ſome regard to her own honour, but none to her ſafety, as <hi>Porſenna</hi> diſcharged <hi>Mutius,</hi> after he had affirmed that three hundred like himſelf had Conſpired and vowed his death: Moreover, <hi>Mutius</hi> attempted this againſt <hi>Porſenna,</hi> in a juſt and declared War; and when <hi>Mutius</hi> was let go, <hi>Porſenna</hi> verily perſwaded himſelf that all the danger was over; but the Caſe here is quite otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>That Blood indeed is to be ſpared, but it muſt be inoncent Blood, this God hath commanded. True it is indeed, that the voice of innocent Blood crieth for Blood; and this can <hi>France</hi> both before and ſince the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> well witneſs and teſtifie.</p>
            <p>That Death that is juſtly inflicted cannot ſeem Bloody; as is neither Phyſic prapared duly, and as it ought to be, eſteemed violent.</p>
            <p>That howſoever the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Kinſmen, might take the Matter, yet it highly concerned the Queen, to regard rather the ſafety of her ſelf, the Nobility and People of <hi>England</hi> (upon whoſe love and affection ſhe wholly depended) then the diſpleaſure of any whomſoever.</p>
            <p>That the Matter was come to that paſs, that what was ſaid of old concerning two Princes, <hi>Couradine</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> might now be ſpoken of two Queens, it might now be truely ſaid, <hi>the Death of</hi> Mary <hi>is the Life of</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and the Life of</hi> Mary <hi>the Death of</hi> Elizabeth.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>French</hi> King or the <hi>Guiſes</hi> promiſes could not ſecure the Queen and Realm, much leſs make ſatisfaction for her Life, if ſhe ſhould be made away.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>French</hi> King could neither diſcover nor hinder ſecret Plots againſt himſelf at home, much leſs was he like to hinder thoſe againſt the Queen of <hi>England</hi>: For Treaſon is plotted in ſecret, and therefore hard to be prevented, if the fact were once committed, what would it avail to claim their Promiſes? how ſhould an incomparable Prince's death be made amends for? and in ſo ſad and woful a Confuſion of all things, what Remedy could be found for the languiſhing Common-wealth?</p>
            <p>That the Obligations and Oaths of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> were of ſmall value, who judged it Meritorious to kill the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Adverſaries, and could eaſily procure Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their Oaths, and what <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were ſlain, and the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> advanced to the Crown, durſt accuſe them of the Murther? and if any ſhould accuſe them; could they thereby make her alive again?</p>
            <p>And the Ambaſſadors in calling this a <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Sentence, have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken raſhly and unadviſedly (for as much as they have neither ſeen Proceſs nor Proofs) and have more ſharply then is fitting, taxed the Eſtates of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> choice Men for their Nobility, Vertue, Prudence, and Piety: Yea, they have very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately uttered ſuch Words in the <hi>French</hi> Kings Name, as if they meant by threats to terrifie the Queen, and the Eſtates of the Land. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men uſe not to be terrified by the <hi>French</hi>-mens threats from taking Courſes to ſecure their own Tranquility, when they, in the mean time, could direct them no proper way to avoid the inſtant and threatning Dangers.</p>

               </note>At this time there were divers Rumors, and terrifying Reports ſpread over <hi>England, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was already arrived at <hi>Milford Haven</hi>; that the <hi>Scots</hi> were broken into <hi>England</hi>; that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was Landed in <hi>Suſſex</hi> with a ſtrong Army; that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was eſcaped out of Priſon, and had raiſed an Army; that the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts were up in Rebellion; that there was a new Conſpiracy on foot to kill the Queen, and ſet the City of <hi>London</hi> on Fire: Theſe Reports haſtned on the Queens ſigning a Warrant for the Execution of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; to do which, ſhe being by her Courtiers, as before ſhe had been by the Parliament, preſſed, both by Reaſons, and alſo by Examples; did command a Warrant to be drawn up for her Execution; which Command ſhe delivered in Writing to <hi>Daviſon,</hi> one of her Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, but commanded him to acquaint no Man therewith. But the next Day, having changed her Mind, ſhe commanded <hi>Daviſon,</hi> by <hi>William Killigrew,</hi> that the Warrant ſhould not be drawn.

            <p>As ſoon as the Report was brought to Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Ears (<hi>who little thought of ſuch a thing</hi>) that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was put to Death, ſhe heard it with great Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; her Countenance altered, her Speech faltered and failed her, and through exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Sorrow, ſhe ſtood in a manner aſtoniſhed, inſomuch, as ſhe gave her ſelf over to paſſionate Grief, puting her ſelf into mourning Habit, and ſhed abundance of Tears.

            <p>They practice to frame Subjects againſt all Duty, and bring in Doctrine of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Merit to kill the Queen, and have ſent their Inſtruments abroad to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding things ſtood thus, yet the Parliament having made ſo many Laws, thought convenient, to make but one Law this <hi>Seſſion</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which was not made Proviſory of any new Remedy againſt them, but to enforce the Execution only of a former Law. It is entitled, An <hi>Act for the more ſpeedy and due Execution of certain Branches of the</hi> Stat. 23.

            <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> ſome Religious Perſons in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitives,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Pope plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again.</hi> Camb. Annal. <hi>f.</hi> 402.

They ſuggeſted, that this War would be juſt, becauſe it was neceſſary, as alſo becauſe it was for the Maintainance of Chriſts Religion; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, That the Queen of <hi>England</hi> being excommunicate, perſiſted contumaciouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſupported his Rebels in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> annoyed the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> by continual Depredations, ſuppreſſed and ſackt his Towns in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and had very lately put the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to Death, violating thereby the Majeſty of all Kings: That it would be no leſs profitable than juſt, for ſo he ſhould add to his Empire thoſe three Kingdoms, quell the Rebellion in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> ſecure his Voyages to the <hi>Indies,</hi> without the Expence of Convoys. To prove this, they ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Navy did far exceed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Number, Largeneſs of Ships, and Strength, eſpecially conſidering the Addition of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Fleet; that <hi>England</hi> had no Forts nor defences, that it was unprovided of Commanders, Souldiers, Cavalry and Munition, bare of Wealth and Friends; that there were many <hi>Papiſts</hi> who would preſently joyn with him; that ſo great was the Strength of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo unmatchable their Valour, that none durſt oppoſe them; and confidently aſſured themſelves of Victory; That this Opportunity was offered by God himſelf, a Peace being then concluded with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> embroiled in a Civil War: That the Conqueſt of <hi>England</hi> would be far eaſier than the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in reſpect the Cut from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>England</hi> was much more ſhort and convenient, than from <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi> That in order to the Conqueſt of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> it was neceſſary, firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> being once conquered, the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be ſubdued.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King being perſwaded to believe all this, reſolves on the Attempt,<note place="margin">The Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Spaniſh Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Camb.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. f. <hi>403, 404.</hi>
               </note> and the next thing conſidered, was, in what Way, and Means, to effect it. And the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod agreed on, was, to do it with a well-provided Army from <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> to be landed by a powerful Navy at the <hi>Thames</hi> Mouth, in order to ſurprize the City of <hi>London,</hi> by a ſudden Aſſault; this being reſolved on, the Preparation was made, which was ſo great throughout all <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Scicily,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves were amazed at it, and named it the <hi>Invincible Armada.</hi> Their Cauſe, the Armada and Army, they recommended to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to the Prayers of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, to God and the Saints, and ſet forth a Book in Print for a Terror, wherein the whole Preparation was ſet down.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> alſo in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings Command, built Ships, and many Flat-bottomed Boats, and other great Preparations in the Sea Towns of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he had an Army of an hundred and three Companies of Foot, and four thouſand Horſe; amongſt which were one thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitives, who of all others, were leaſt eſteemed; neither was <note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> before named.</note>

            <p>
               <q>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> at length, as well by his <hi>Holineſs</hi>'s Authority and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as by his own unſpeakable Zeal and Piety, moved alſo not a little by my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and continual Suit, together with the afflicted and baniſhed <hi>Catholicks</hi> of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of all and every Degree, who have been by his ſpecial Compaſſion, and Regal Munificency, principally ſupported in this our long Exile, hath condeſcended at laſt, to take upon him this ſo holy and glorious an Act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>

withſtanding all they ſhould do, they ſhould but defend her bootleſs, to their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deſtruction and eternal Shame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Foulis</hi> relates out of <hi>Clark</hi> a Secular Prieſt, is ſo remarkable with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Invaſion, that I cannot omit it, ſaith he, and quotes his Author.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> you ſhall hear what <note n="(c)" place="marg2">

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It is moſt certain, that all the World had very admirable Expectance of that Army, and the Jeſuits more than any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It is plain by the Cardinals Book (if</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="marg2">They would hint to us, as if <hi>Parſons</hi> were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; but its certain that <hi>Allen</hi> was the Author of it, and <hi>Parſons</hi> with the other Romaniſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <hi>Allen</hi> to be the Author.</note> 
               <hi>it were his) writen as a Preparative to that Account, that he was made Cardinal on purpoſe for that Exploit, and to have been ſent hither preſently upon the</hi> Spaniards <hi>Conqueſt.

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is certain, that the Jeſuits in</hi> Rome <hi>were great with the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> Leger <hi>there, and had great recourſe unto him, when the Matter was on foot, doth not this then urge them to be Concurrers thereunto?</hi>

                  </gap> if they had not ſome Intereſt in that Affair</hi>?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>We know that they were more forward in</hi> Rome <hi>concerning this Matter, than the Cardinal or any other</hi>; inſomuch, <hi>as, at the firſt News of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>coming down into the narrow Seas, they would have had</hi> Te Deum <hi>ſung in the Colledge for joy of Victory, if the Cardinal had not ſtayed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to conclude, <hi>Doth not the poſting of Father</hi> Parſons <hi>into</hi> Spain, <hi>preſently after the Overthrow of this Army, for further dealing with the</hi> Spaniard <hi>for the time to come, and his better information in</hi> Engliſh <hi>Affairs; and Father</hi> Holt <hi>poſting into the</hi> Low-Countries, <hi>for the like Purpoſe, to keep the</hi> Spaniard <hi>ſtill in hope of future times, that this Miſhap might not withdraw him from ever enterprizing the like afterwards, ſhew, that they were Dealers in the former?

            </p>
            <p>This done, he perſuades him to kill the Queen; commends the Action to him as pious and meritorious, offers him large promiſes, and at laſt <hi>Squire</hi> is fully perſuaded, and undertakes the Murther.

            <p>This ſaid, he embraceth him, then throwing his left Arm about <hi>Squires</hi> Neck; ſo hugging him with his right-hand, he makes the ſign of the Croſs upon <hi>Squires</hi> Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; thus Bleſſing him, <hi>God Bleſs thee my Son, and ſtrengthen thee, be of good Chear; I will pawn my Soul for thine, and thou ſhalt always have the benefit of my Prayers; and whither thou liveſt or dyeſt, thou ſhalt enjoy a full pardon and remiſſion of all thy Sns.</hi> And another time thus encourageth him: <hi>There is one thing neceſſary, which if thou prefer before all other things, and doſt fulfil it, I have my deſire, and thou ſhalt be a glorious Saint in Heaven.</hi>

               <hi>Squire</hi> thus diveliſhly reſolved, gets into <hi>England,</hi> goes to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the Court then was, watcheth opportunity; and being inform'd that the Queen was to Ride abroad, goeth to her Horſe, holdeth him according to his place; and cunningly puts ſtrong Poyſon upon the pumel of the Saddle; yet ſaying with a loud Voice, as ſhe mounted, <hi>God ſave the Queen.</hi> But ſuch was the providence; that her Majeſty, neither in getting up, riding, or going down, once touched the Pumel; yet he doubted not, but that in time it would work the intended ruin, fully perſuaded the Queen had laid her hands on it.</p>
            <p>Of this Poyſon, being great expectation amongſt ſome, and ſeeing no ſigns of any ſuch effect, they became incenſed againſt <hi>Squire,</hi> thinking that he had left them and the Cauſe in the lurch, and meerly deluded them: Thus jealous and enraged, a revenge is reſolved on, and <hi>Squire</hi> cunningly accuſed of ſome deſign againſt the Queen, <hi>Squire,</hi> upon the noiſe, is Examined, and wondring how any thing ſhould be known againſt him, yet ſuſpecting <hi>Walpool</hi> his confeſſion, and believing all was fully diſcovered, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſeth all as above is ſaid; ſo, as a Traytor, is Condemned and Executed. I ſhall cloſe my account of the Hiſtory of making the Penal Laws in this Queens Reign, with the words of the ſecular Prieſts in their important conſiderations relating to what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did, and writ, from 1588 to the end of her Reign; whereby they juſtyfie the Queen, and lay blame on the Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57626:45"/>But now we are come to the Year 1588. and to that moſt Bloody attempt, not only againſt Her Majeſty and our common Enemies, but againſt our ſelves, all Catholics:<note place="margin">The Secular Prieſts confeſs all the matters before related to be true.

(as our Memory ſerveth us) Prieſts and Catholics of all ſorts, within the Compaſs of the ſaid ten Years were put to Death; we ſay, upon our knowledges (concerning the moſt of them) for their Conſciences; but our Adverſaries (as they think) do ſtill affirm for Treaſon: Such Prieſts as in their Examination were found any thing moderate, were not ſo hardly proceeded with inſomuch as 55.

            <p>This Proclamation I thought fit to inſert, becauſe by it, it appears that King <hi>James</hi> himſelf was of opinion; that the before mentioned Conſpiracy was conceived by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts, however they prevailed upon ſome of the Proteſtant Profeſſion to joyn with them in Midwiving it into the World, and therefore may truly be called <hi>Popiſh.</hi>

               </note>
               <q>For the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I muſt put a difference betwixt my own private Profeſſion of my Salvation, and my politick Government of the Realm for the weal and quietneſs thereof. As for my own Profeſſion, you have me your Head now among You, of the ſame Religion that the Body is of, as I am no ſtranger to you in Blood, no more am I a ſtranger to you in Faith, or in Matters concerning the Houſe of God. And altho' this my Profeſſion be according to my Education, wherein (I thank God,) I ſuckt the Milk of Gods truth, with the Milk of my Nurſe, yet I do here proteſt unto you, that I would never (for ſuch a Conceit of Conſtancy, or other prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Opinion) have ſo firmly kept my firſt Profeſſion, if I had not found it agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Reaſon, and to the Rule of my Conſcience: But I was never violent, nor unreaſonable in my Profeſſion; I acknowledge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be our Mother Church; altho defiled with ſome Infirmities and Corruptions, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, before they Crucified Chriſt. And as I am no Enemy to the Life of a ſick Man, becauſe I would have his Body purged of ill Humours; no more am I an Enemy to their Church, becauſe I would have them reform their Errors, not wiſhing the down-throwing of the Temple, but that it might be purged and cleaned from Corruption: Otherwiſe how can they wiſh us to enter, if their Houſe be not firſt made clean? But as I would be lother to diſpenſe in the leaſt point of mine own Conſcience, for any Worldly reſpect, then the fooliſheſt Preciſian of them all: So would I be as ſorry to ſtreighten the politick Government of the Bodies and Minds of all my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to my private Opinions: Nay, my Mind was ever ſo free from Perſecution, or inthralling of my Subjects in Matters of Conſcience,<note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> his Mildneſs to Papiſts.</note> as I hope thoſe of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion within this Kingdom have a proof ſince my Coming, that I was ſo far from increaſing their Burthens with <hi>Rhehoboam,</hi> as I have ſo much as either time, occaſion or Law could permit, lightned them. And even now at this time, have I been careful to reviſe and conſider deeply upon the Laws made againſt them, that ſome Overture might be made to the preſent Parliament, for clearing theſe Laws, by reaſon, (which is the Soul of the Law) in Caſe they have been in times paſt, further, or more rigorouſly extended by Judges, then the meaning of the Law was, or might tend to the hurt as well of the innocent, as of the guilty Perſons. And as to the Perſons of my Subjects which are of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I muſt divide them into two ranks <hi>Clericks</hi> and <hi>Laicks,</hi> for the <hi>Laicks</hi> I ever thought them far more excuſeable then the other ſort, becauſe their Religion containeth ſuch an ignorant, doubtful and implicite kind of Faith grounded upon their Church, that except they do generally believe whatſoever their Teachers pleaſe to affirm, they cannot be thought guilty of theſe particular points of Hereſies, and Corruptions, which their Teachers ſo wilfully profeſs. And again I muſt ſubdivide the <hi>Laick</hi> into two Ranks, which are either quiet and well minded Men, peaceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who either being old, retain their firſt Drunk in Liquor, upon a certain Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facedneſs to be thought Curious, or Changeable: Or being young Men through evil Education, have been Nurſed and brought up upon ſuch Venome, inſtead of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Nutriment; and this ſort of People I would be ſorry to puniſh their Bodies for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57626:49"/>
the Error of their Minds, the Reformation whereof muſt only come of God, and the true Spirit. But the other Rank of <hi>Laicks,</hi> who either through Curioſity, Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Novelty, or Diſcontentment, have changed their Coats, only to be Factious, ſtirers of Sedition, and perturbers of the Common-wealth, this giveth a ground to me (the Magiſtrate) to take better heed to their Proceedings, and to correct their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But for the <hi>Clericks,</hi> I muſt directly ſay and affirm, that as long as they maintain one ſpecial point of their Doctrine, and another of their Practiſe, they are no way ſufferable to remain in this Kingdom, the point of Doctrine is, that Arrogant and Ambitious Supremacy of their Head the Pope, whereby he not only Claims to be ſpiritual Head of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but alſo to have an <hi>Emperial</hi> Civil power over all Kings and Emperors, Dethroning and Crowning Princes with his Foot as pleaſeth him, and diſpenſing and diſpoſing of all Kingdoms and Empires at his Appetite. The other point which they obſerve, in continual Practiſe, is the Aſſaſſinates and Murthers of Kings: Thinking it no ſin, but rather a Matter of Salvation, to do all Acts of Rebellion, and Hoſtility againſt their natural Sovereign Lord, if he be once Curſed, his Subjects diſcharged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their Fidelity, and his Kingdom given a prey, by that three Crowned <hi>Monarch,</hi> or rather <hi>Monſter</hi> their Head. And in this point I have no occaſion to ſpeak further here, ſaving that I could wiſh from my Heart, It would pleaſe God to make me one of the Members of ſuch a general Chriſtian Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Religion, as (laying Wilfulneſs aſide on both hands) we might meet in the midſt, which is the Center, and perfection of all things. For if they would leave and be aſhamed of ſuch new and groſs Corruptions of theirs, as themſelves cannot maintain, nor deny to be worthy of Reformation, I would for my own part be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to meet them in the mid way, ſo that all Novelties might be renounced on either ſide: For as my Faith is the true Ancient and Apoſtolick Faith, grounded upon the expreſs word of God; ſo will I ever yeild all reverence to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> in the points of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Policy: And by that means ſhall I ever, with Gods Grace, keep my ſelf from either being an <hi>Heretick</hi> in Faith, or <hi>Shiſmatick</hi> in Matters of Policy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But of one thing would I have the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of this Land to be admoniſhed, that they preſume not ſo much upon my Lenity (becauſe I would be loath to be thought a Perſecutor) as thereupon to think it lawful for them, daily to encreaſe their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſtrength in this Kingdom; whereby if not in my time, at leaſt in the time of my Poſterity, they may be in hope to erect their Religion again. No,<note place="margin">As they were very lately.</note> let them aſſure themſelves, that as I am a Friend to their Perſons, if they be good Subjects; ſo am I a vowed <hi>Enemy,</hi> and do denounce Mortal War to their Errors; And as I would be ſorry to be driven, by their ill Behaviour, from the Protection and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Bodies and Lives; ſo I will never ceaſe, as far as I can,<note place="margin">Suffering the increaſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery called by <hi>Jam. 1.</hi> a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> to tread down their Errors, and wrong Opinions. For I could not permit the increaſe and growing of their Religion, without betraying my ſelf, and my own Conſcience, and this whole <hi>Iſland,</hi> as well the part I am come from, as the part I remain in, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their Liberties, and reducing them to the former ſlaviſh Yoke, which both had caſt off before I came among them, as alſo the Liberty of the Crown in my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, which I ſhould leave again under a new Slavery, being left free to me by my Predeceſſors. And therefore I would wiſh all good Subjects, that are deceived with this Corruption, if they find any beginnings in themſelves, of Knowledge, and Love to the truth, to foſter the ſame by all lawful Means, and to beware of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit that worketh within them. And if they can find as yet no Motion tending that way, to be ſtudious to read and confer with Learned men, and to uſe all ſuch means as may further their reſolutions; aſſuring them, that as long as they are diſconformable in Religion to us, they cannot be but half my Subjects, be able to do but half ſervice, and I ſhall want the beſt half of them, which is their Souls.</q> After which, the Parliament conſidering the ſaid Proclamation and Speech, and that notwithſtanding, the Jeſuites, and Seminary Prieſts flockt over in great numbers into <hi>England,</hi> made an Act of Parliament; intituled,<note place="margin">1 Jac. cap. 4.

Then he opened the Hainouſneſs of the Crime in all the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating Circumſtances of it. He ſaid, that as the <hi>Powder-Treaſon</hi> was of its ſelf prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unnatural, ſo was it in its Conception and Birth moſt monſtrous, as ariſing out of the dead Aſhes of former Treaſons; and then takes notice of very many, if not all the Treaſons before mentioned; I think in this Speech, and the Speech he made at <hi>Garnets</hi> Tryal, all, I am ſure the moſt, are taken in. He then conſidered the <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> it ſelf, with regard to the Perſons by whom the ſame was conſpired: And they were <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. The Laity, Gentlemen of good Houſes, of excellent Parts, however moſt perniciouſly ſeduced, abuſed, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and <hi>Jeſuited,</hi> of very competent Fortunes and Eſtates. It being then ſaid, that there was never a <hi>Religious</hi> Man in the Action; ſaith he, in anſwer, I never yet knew a Treaſon without a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, and names, as ingaged in this, <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> alias <hi>Wally,</hi> the Superior of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> Legier here in <hi>England</hi>; Father <hi>Creſwel,</hi> Legier Jeſuit in <hi>Spain</hi>; Father <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Legier in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as <hi>Parſons</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Curſory Men, as <hi>Gerrard, Oſwald, Teſmond,</hi> alias <hi>Greenway, Hamond</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi>; then he opened the Doctrines and Practices of the Jeſuits and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts of the Romiſh Church, which he proves from <hi>Simanca, Creſwels, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopater</hi> and other Books. Then he conſidered the Perſons againſt whom this Treaſon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57626:51"/>
was conſpired; the King, the Queen, the Royal Iſſue Male, the moſt honourable and prudent Councellors, and all the true hearted and worthy Nobles, all the Reverend and Learned Biſhops, all the Grave Judges, and Sages of the Law, all the principal Knights, Citizens and Burgeeſſs of Parliament, the Flower of the whole Realm. Then he conſidered, that this was deſigned, notwithſtanding the King had uſed ſo great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity toward the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that by the ſpace of a whole Year and four Months, he took no Penalties of them due upon the Statutes; and beſides this, divers of the Papiſts were greatly preferred. Then he conſidered the Houſe of Parliament, which they pretended they choſe, becauſe there the Penal Laws were made againſt them; which he anſwered, by briefly ſhowing what Laws were made againſt them, and that their own Treaſons were the true Grounds of making them. Then he conſidered the End of this Conſpiracy, which was to bring a final and fatal Confuſion upon the State, and this is to be effected by damnable Means, by mineing, by thirty ſix Barrels of Powder, having Crows of Iron, Stone and Wood laid upon the Barrels, to have made the Breach the greater. Then he conſidered the Secreſie of the Contrivance and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of this Treaſon, in three Reſpects; the firſt, that <hi>Catesby</hi> had Recommendation for a Regiment of Horſe in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> that under that Pretence, he might furniſh this Treaſon with Horſe without Suſpicion. The Second was, the Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. The Third, the Sacrament. He then took notice of the admirable Diſcovery of this Treaſon, and proceeded to make nine ſeveral Obſervations upon the whole, which were theſe: Firſt, The Mine had never been diſcovered, had not the Cellar been hired. 2. The Kings Directing the Search to be made there, from thoſe dark Words, <hi>A Terrible Blow.</hi> 3. <hi>Catesby, Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Grants,</hi> their narrow Eſcapes, having a few Days before they were taken, been in very great Danger of being blown up by Gun-powder. 4. Gun-powder was the Invention of a <hi>Fryar.</hi> 5. <hi>Binham</hi> was ſent to the Pope, to give notice of this Blow, and to crave his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aid. 6. Notwithſtanding their riſing in open Rebellion, and giving out, that the <hi>Catholics</hi> Throats would be cut, not one Man came in to take their Parts, but their own Company. 7. The Sheriff immediately ſuppreſt them. 8. The Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was made a few hours before it was to have been put in Execution. 9. That there never was any <hi>Proteſtant Miniſter</hi> in any Treaſon and Murther that had been then attempted within the Realm. Then he compared this Plot with that of <hi>Raleigh</hi> and <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark.</hi> 1. They had both one end. 2. Both to be effected by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> and diſcontented Perſons, <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Laymen.</hi> 3. They all played at Hazzard, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were at the By, <hi>Raleigh</hi> at the Main, but theſe in at all, purpoſing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy King, Iſſue, whole State. 4. All obliged by the ſame Oath and Sacrament. 5. The ſame Proclamation (after the Fact) for Reformation of Abuſes. 6. The like Army provided for Invading. 7. The ſame Penſion of Crows promiſed. 8. The Agreeing of the Times, which was when the Conſtable of <hi>Spain</hi> was coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was intended a Colour to the <hi>Invaſion,</hi> that it might not be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

            <p>This Conſpiracy being diſcovered in ſo wonderful a manner, and the Deliverance attended with ſo many amazing Circumſtances, the Parliament took the ſame into their Conſideration, and in the firſt place, made a Law for keeping an Anniverſary Day of Thanks-giving on the <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and enacted the ſame Law ſhould be read in the Churches publickly upon the ſame Day, and then made an Act for the Attainder of the Offenders.

What influence this Letter had the ſequel will evince, for the ſaid Oath was immediately confirmed by Act of Parliament, and the Papiſts injoyned to take it, in the Circumſtances, and upon the Penalties in the Act for that purpoſe mentioned: the ſum and ſubſtance of which Act followeth; it is Intitled, <hi>An Act for the better diſcovering and repreſſing of Popiſh Recuſants.</hi> The Preamble of the Act runs thus.</p>

                           <p>IT is reported unto us,<note place="margin">The Popes <hi>2</hi>d. Bull againſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Oath of Allegiance. <hi>Foulis</hi> l. <hi>10.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi> f. <hi>528.</hi>
                              </note> that there are found certain amongſt you (who) when as we have ſufficiently declared by ous Letters, Dated the laſt year on the 22<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the form of a Breve, that ye cannot with ſafe Conſcience take the Oath which was then required of you, and when as we have further ſtraitly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, that by no means you ſhould take it.</p>
                           <p>Yet there are ſome (I ſay) among you, who dare now affirm, that ſuch Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forbidding of the Oath, were not written of our own accord, or of our own proper Will. But rather for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and at the inſtigation of other Men; and for that cauſe the ſame Men go about to perſwade you, that our Commands in the ſaid Letter are not to be regarded.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57626:58"/>Truly this News did trouble us, and that ſo much the more, becauſe having had experience of your obedience (moſt dearly beloved Sons) who to the end you might obey this holy See, have Godlily and Valiantly contemned your Riches, Wealth, Honour, Liberty, yea and Life it ſelf: We ſhould never have ſuſpected, that the truth of our Apoſtolical Letters could once be called in queſtion amongſt you, that by this Pretence you might exempt your ſelves from our Commandments.</p>
                           <p>But we do perceive herein the ſubtilty and craft of the Enemy of Mans Salvation, and we do attribute this your backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather to him, then to your own Will.</p>
                           <p>And for this cauſe we have thought good to write the ſecond time unto you, and to ſignifie unto you again, that our Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Letters, dated the laſt year on the 22<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> concerning the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oath, were written not only upon our proper motion, and of our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge; but alſo after long and weighty Deliberation uſed concerning all thoſe things, which are contained in them: And that for that cauſe you are bound fully to obſerve them, rejecting all interpretation perſwading to the contrary.</p>
                           <p>And this is our meer, pure and perfect Will; who being always careful of your Salvation, do always mind thoſe things which are moſt profitable unto you. And we do pray without ceaſing, that he who hath appointed to our Lowlineſs the keeping of the flock of Chriſt, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our thoughts and counſels; whom we do alſo continually beſeech, that he would increaſe in you (our moſt beloved Sons) Faith, Conſtancy, with mutual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Peace, one to another. All whom we moſt Lovingly bleſs with all Charitable affection.</p>

            <p>This I have ſet down in <hi>Willſons</hi> own words, becauſe it appears by this that the Men that were ſuſpended, were proceeded againſt not for <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> or <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to the diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but for non-complying with things obtruded on them, by right down <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or thoſe (who whether they ſaw it or no I cannot tell) were carrying on the <hi>Popiſh</hi> deſigns.</p>

the Power he left him, to reſtabliſh him in the Eſtate and Dignitys of his Father on the 27th of <hi>March</hi> in the Twenty third Year of his Reign he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>From what Account I have given of Matters relating to the making the Penal Laws, and the Reaſons of not putting them in Execution in this Kings Reign, I gather theſe things,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. That when it is to ſerve the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt, they are allowed to deny the plaineſt truths, although confeſt by Men <hi>in Articulo Mortis,</hi> at the very point of Death.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. That when they found themſelves loſt as to more private <hi>Conſpiracies,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in War, to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, upon the Colour of the Elector <hi>Palatines</hi> having Uſurped the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> notwithſtanding he was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally Elected; and made uſe of the <hi>Cowardiſe</hi> of King <hi>James</hi> to carry on that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That they want not Arts to deceive even <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves, if they look not narrowly to them; ſo much can they transform themſelves into the likeneſs of <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Certainly then, there was good reaſon for the making the Penal Laws in this Kings Reign, and the Parliament are greatly juſtified in preſſing an Execution of them, which had it been granted, a Man may with good reaſon believe all the Civil Wars in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Reign had been prevented.</p>

                  <p>LET not the damp of aſtoniſhment ſeize upon your Ardent and Zealous Soul,<note place="margin">A Letter from a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Ruſhw. Coll. <hi>1. pt.</hi> f. <hi>474.</hi>
                     </note> in apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuddain and unexpected calling of a Parliament: We have not oppoſed but rather furthered it; ſo that we hope as much in this Parliament as ever we feared any in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know the Council is engaged to aſſiſt the King by way of Prerogative, in Caſe the Parliament any way ſhould fail. You ſhall ſee this Parliament will reſemble the <hi>Pelican,</hi> which takes a pleaſure to dig out with her Beak her own Bowels.</p>
                  <p>The Election of Knights and Burgeſſes hath been in ſuch confuſion of apparent faction, as that which we were wont to procure heretofore with much Art and Induſtry (when the <hi>Spaniſh Match</hi> was in Treaty) now breaks out naturally as a botch or boyl and ſpews out its own Rankor and Venom.</p>
                  <p>You remember how that famous and immortal Stateſman the Connt of <hi>Gondomar</hi> fed King <hi>James</hi> his fancy and Rocked him aſleep with the ſoft ſweet ſound of Peace, to keep up the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treaty; likewiſe we were much bound to ſome Stateſmen of our own Country, for gaining time by procuring the moſt advantageous Ceſſation of Arms in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and advancing the Honour and integrity of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, and villifying the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> remonſtrating to King <hi>James</hi> that the State was moſt ungrateful both to his Predeceſſor Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and his Sacred Majeſty; that the States were more obnoxious then the <hi>Turk,</hi> and perpetually injured his Majeſties Loving Subjects in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and likewiſe they have uſurped from his Majeſty the Regality and unvaluable profit of the narrow Seas, in fiſhing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This great Stateſman had but one principal means to further their great and good deſigns, which was to ſet on King <hi>James</hi> that none but the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction, which plotted nothing but Anarchy and his Confuſion were averſe to this moſt happy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. We Steered on the ſame Courſe, and have made great uſe of this Anarchical Election, and have prejudicated and anticipated the great one, that none but the Kings Enemies, and his, are choſen of this Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have now many Strings to our Bow, and have ſtrongly Fortified our Faction, and have added two Bulwarks more: For when King <hi>James</hi> lived (you know) he was very violent againſt <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and interrupted (with his pestilent Wit and Learning) our ſtrong deſigns in <hi>Holland,</hi> and was a great Friend to that Old Rebel and Heretick the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> Now we have planted that Soveraign drug <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which we hope will purge the Proteſtants from their Hereſie; and it Flouriſheth and beareth Fruit in due Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Materials which build up our Bulwark, are the Projectors and Beggars of all Ranks and Qualities, howſoever both theſe Factions co-operate to deſtroy the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a new Species and Form of Government, which is <hi>Oliargchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſerve as direct Mediums and Inſtruments to our End, which is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Monarchy.</hi> Our Foundation muſt be Mutation, and Mutation will cauſe a Relaxation, which will ſerve as ſo many violent Diſeaſes, as the Stone, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the ſpeedy Diſtraction of our perpetual and inſufferable Anguiſh of Body, which is worſe than Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now by Councel and mature Deliberation, how, and when to work upon the <hi>Dukes</hi> Jealouſie and Revenge, and in this we give the Honour to thoſe which merit it, which are the <hi>Church Catholics.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another Matter of Conſequence, which we take much into our Conſideration and Tender care, which is to ſtave off <hi>Puritans,</hi> that they hang not in the <hi>Dukes</hi> Ears, they are impudent ſubtil People.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be feared, leaſt they ſhould negotiate a Reconciliation between the <hi>Duke</hi> and the Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> but now we aſſure our Selves, we have ſo handled the Matter, that both <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> are irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:57626:70"/>For the better prevention of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> have already lockt up the <hi>Dukes</hi> Ears, and we have thoſe of our own Religion which ſtand continually at the <hi>Dukes</hi> Chamber, to ſee who goes in and out; we cannot be too circumſpect and careful, in this Regard.</p>
                  <p>I cannot chuſe but laugh, to ſee how ſome of our <hi>Coat</hi> have accoutred themſelves; you would ſcarce know them if you ſaw them; and 'tis admirable, how in Speech and Geſture they act the <hi>Puritans.</hi> The <hi>Cambridge</hi> Schollars, to their woful Experience, ſhall ſee we can act the <hi>Puritan</hi> a little better than they have done the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>: They have abuſed our ſacred Patron, St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in jeſt, but we will make them ſmart for it in earneſt. I hope you will excuſe my merry Digreſſion, for I confeſs unto you, I am at this time tranſported with Joy, to ſee how happily all Inſtruments and Means, as well great as leſs, co-operate unto our Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>But to return unto the main Fabrick, our Foundation is <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Projectors,</hi> as it appears in the Premiſes, affect Mutation, this we ſecond, and enforce by probable Arguments; in the firſt place, we take into Conſideration, the Kings Honour and preſent Neceſſity, and we ſhew how the King may free himſelf of his Word, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh did, and for his great Splendor and Luſtre, he may raiſe a vaſt Revenue, and not be beholden to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which is by way of Impoſition and Exciſe, then our Church <hi>Catholicks</hi> proceed, to ſhow the Means how to ſettle this Exciſe, which muſt be by a <hi>mercenary</hi> Army of Horſe and Foot. For the Horſe, we have made that ſure, they ſhall be Forreigners and <hi>Germans,</hi> who will eat up the Kings Revenues, and ſpoil the Country where-ever they come, though they ſhould be well paid; what Havock will they make there, when they get no Pay, or are not duly paid? they will do more Miſchief then we hope the Army will do.</p>
                  <p>We are provident and careful that this <hi>mercenary Army,</hi> of two thouſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot, ſhall be taken on and in Pay before the Exciſe be ſetled. In forming the Exciſe, the Country is moſt likely to riſe: If the <hi>Mercenary Army</hi> ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Country, then the Souldiers and <hi>Projectors</hi> ſhall be paid out of the Confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if the Country be too hard for the Souldiers, then they muſt conſequently mutiny, which is equally advantagious unto us, our ſuperlative Deſign, is to work, the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as well as the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to welcome in a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and that is by this Means: We hope inſtantly to diſſolve Trades, and hinder the building of Shipping, in deviſing probable Deſigns, and putting on the State upon Expeditions, as that of <hi>Cadiz</hi> was, in taking away the Merchant Ships, ſo that they may not eaſily catch and light upon the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Fleet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Before this Act of Parliament was made, the Papiſts were ingaged in a moſt <hi>Horrid Plot</hi> againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Parliament having now made this Act, whereby the Papiſts are excluded from all Places of Profit and Truſt; it is not hard to believe that their Malice was thereby greatly heightned, and their Rage very much increaſed againſt the Proteſtants; and their Actings put it beyond doubt that it was ſo. For this Act paſſed in the Year 1673. and then it is we find them deeply ingaged in contriving our Deſtruction; and ſo inhumane were they, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Kindneſs to them, yet, unleſs he would fully comply with them in the butchering his Proteſtant Subjects, extirpating the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion (which they called a <note n="*" place="margin">Coleman's <hi>Tryal,</hi> p. 69.</note> Peſtilent Hereſie) and the introducing of the Romiſh Superſtition and Idolatry, he muſt be taken out of the way, to make room for one that would.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I have met with very many that have owned the Diſ-believing of any ſuch Deſign, but when I ſeriouſly reflect upon the Letters that were produced againſt Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and owned by himſelf to be his; when I conſider the Evidence that was given by all the Witneſſes that proved the Horrid and Treaſonable Popiſh Plot, that was diſcovered in 1678. and the Agreement that there is in the Subſtance of the thing (although there may be ſome Variations as to Circumſtances) when I conſider the Witneſſes were Strangers to one another, that did ſo agree in their Teſtimony, and that the Diſcovery was ſo ſudden, and the Witneſſes came in ſo quick one after another, after the Diſcovery, that it is not to be preſumed there could be any Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when I conſider the Credit they had with the King himſelf, and with four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; when I conſider the great Attempts notwithſtanding, to take the Odium off the Papiſts, and caſt it upon the Proteſtants; when I conſider the unwearied Pains taken by the Papiſts, and ſome that are much worſe, becauſe they eſpouſed their Cauſe under a Proteſtant Vizar, to lay the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury-Godfrey</hi> at the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Door, and to wipe off the Stain thereof from the Papiſts; when I conſider the Methods that were taken in the late King <hi>James</hi> the Seconds his Reign, ſo exactly purſuant to what was deſigned, in caſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Second had fallen (as was contrived) <note n="*" place="margin">Either by Shooting, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Stobing.</note> the firſt of which Methods was, by granting a general <note n="†" place="margin">The Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in caſe the Popiſh Plot had then taken effect, you may find printed in <hi>Coleman's</hi> Trial, <hi>p. 58.</hi>
               </note> Liberty of Conſcience, and thereby deluding divers Proteſtants to ſerve a Popiſh Intereſt, although againſt their Wills; it is to me matter of Amazement, that there ſhould remain the leaſt doubt of the Truth of that Plot, in the Minds of any that are really Proteſtants; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I conſider that there wanted nothing in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, but a Parliament to take off the Penal Laws and Teſts, to bring that Popiſh Plot to the higheſt Perfection that the Papiſts ever deſigned, and what Endeavors there were to obtain that, is ſufficiently known.</p>
            <p>To run through the whole Series of that Popiſh Plot, would be to draw out this Account of the Grounds of making the Penal Laws to a Length beyond what its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign can warrant, which is the publick Good, and therefore as a Confirmation of the Truth of that Plot, and to refreſh the Memory of thoſe, who perhaps are willing to forget it, I ſhall here only inſert <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, as you will find them printed in his Tryal, and alſo <hi>Bedloes</hi> Depoſitions, as they were taken before, and printed by Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi> then Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas, and afterwards made

And I am ſo ſenſible of the Honour you are pleaſed to do me, that though I cannot deſerve it, yet to ſhew at leaſt the Senſe I have of it, I will deal as freely and openly with you this firſt time, as if I had had the Honour of your Acquaintance all my Life. And ſhall make no Apology for ſo doing, but only tell you, that I know your Character perfectly well, though I am not ſo happy as to know your Perſon; and that I have an Opportunity of putting this Letter into the Hands of Father St. <hi>Germans</hi> Nephew (for whoſe Integrity and Prudence he has undertaken) without any ſort of Hazard.</p>
                  <p>In order then Sir, to the plainneſs I profeſs, I will tell you what has formerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between your Reverences Predeceſſor, Father <hi>Ferryer</hi> and my ſelf. About three Years ago, when the King my Maſter ſent a Troop of Horſe Guards into his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Service, under the Command of my Lord <hi>Duraſs,</hi> he ſent with it an Officer, called Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> with whom I had a particular Intimacy, and who had then very newly imbraced the Catholic Religion; to him did I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly write, and by him addreſs my ſelf to Father <hi>Farryer.</hi> The firſt thing of great Importance, I preſumed to offer him (not to trouble you with leſſer Matters, or what paſſed here before, and immediately after the fatal Revolution of the Kings Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience (to which we owe all our Miſeries and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards) was in <hi>July, Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> 1673. when I conſtantly inculcated the great Danger the Catholic Religion, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Intereſt would be in at our next Seſſions of Parliament, which was then to be in <hi>October</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at which I plainly foreſaw, that the King my Maſter would be forced to ſomething in prejudice to his Alliance with <hi>France.</hi> Which I ſaw ſo evidently and particularly, that we ſhould make Peace with <hi>Holland</hi>; that I urged all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I could, which to me were Demonſtrations, to convince your Court of that Miſchief, and preſſed all I could to perſwade his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to uſe his utmoſt Endeavor to prevent that Seſſion of our Parliament, and propoſed Expedients how to do it: But was anſwered ſo often and ſo poſitively, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was ſo well aſſured by his Embaſſador here, our Embaſſador there, the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and even the King himſelf, that he had no ſuch Apprehenſions at all, but was fully ſatisfied to the contrary, and looked upon what I offered as a very zealous Miſtake; that I was forced to give over arguing, though not believing as I did, but confidently appealed to Time and Succeſs to prove who took their Meaſures righteſt. When it happened what I foreſaw came to paſs; the good Father was a little ſurpriſed to ſee all the great Men miſtaken, and a little one in the Right, and was pleaſed by Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> to deſire the Continuance of my Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which I was mighty willing to comply with, knowing the Intereſt of our King, and in a more particular manner, of my more immediate Maſter, the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>James</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> Duke, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to be ſo inſeparably united, that it was impoſſible to divide them, without deſtroying them all. Upon this I ſhewed that our Parliament, in the Circumſtances it was, managed by the timerous Councels of our Miniſters, who then governed, would never be uſeful either to <hi>England, France,</hi> or Catholic Religion; but that we ſhould as certainly be forced from our Neutrality at their next Meeting, as we had been from our active Alliance with <hi>France</hi> the laſt Year: That a Peace, in the Circumſtances we were in, was much more to be deſired than the Continuance of the War; and that the Diſſolution of our Parliament would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure a Peace: For that the Confederates did more depend upon the Power they had in our Parliament than upon any thing elſe in the World: And were more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb facs="tcp:57626:74"/>
from them to the continuing of the War: So that if they were Diſſolved, their meaſures would be all broken, and they conſequently in a manner neceſſitated to a Peace.</p>
                  <p>The good Father minding this Diſcourſe ſomewhat more then the Court of <hi>France</hi> thought fit to do my former, urg'd it ſo home to the King, that his Majeſty was pleaſed to give him Orders to ſignifie to his <hi>R. H.</hi> my Maſter, that his Majeſty was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied of his <hi>R. H's.</hi> good intention towards him, that he eſteemed both their Intereſts, but as one and the ſame: That my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament were both to be lookt upon as very unuſeful to their Intereſt. That if his <hi>R. H.</hi> would endeavour to diſſolve this Parliament, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would aſſiſt him with his Power and Purſe to have a new one, as ſhould be for their purpoſe. This and a great many more Expreſſions of kindneſs and confidence, <hi>Father Ferryer</hi> was pleaſed to Communicate to Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> and commanded them to ſend them to His Royal Hhighneſs, and withal to beg his Royal Highneſs to propoſe to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, what he thought neceſſary for his own Concern, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Religon, and his Majeſty would certainly do all he could to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance both or either of them. This Sir <hi>William Throckmorton</hi> ſent to me by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who left <hi>Paris</hi> the Second of <hi>June</hi> 1674. <hi>Stilo novo.</hi> I no ſooner had it, but I Communicated it to his <hi>R.

H.</hi> was very ſenſible of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Friendſhip, and that he would Labour to cultivate it with all the good Offices he was capable of doing for His Majeſty: That he was fully convinced that their Intereſts were both one: That my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament were not only unuſeful, but very dangerous both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>: That therefore it was neceſſary, that they ſhould do all they could to diſſolve it. And that his <hi>R. H's.</hi> opinion was, that if his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would write his thoughts freely to the King of <hi>England</hi> upon this Subject, and make the ſame proffer to his Majeſty of his Purſe to diſſolve this Parliament, which he had made to his <hi>R. H.</hi> to Call another, he did believe it very poſſible for him to ſucceed with the Aſſiſtance we ſhould be able to give him here: And that if this Parliament were diſſolved, there would be no great difficulty of getting a new one, which would be more uſeful. The Conſtitutions of our Parliaments being ſuch, that a new one can never hurt the Crown, nor an old one do it good.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>R. H.</hi> being pleaſed to own theſe Propoſitions which were but only General, I thought it reaſonable to be more particular, and come cloſer to the Point, we might go the faſter about the work, and come to ſome iſſue before the time was too far ſpent.</p>
                  <p>I laid this for my Maxim: The diſſolving of our Parliament will certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Peace: Which Propoſition was granted by every Body I converſed withal; even by <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> himſelf, with whom I took Liberty of converſing ſo far, but durſt not ſay any thing of the Intelligence I had with Father <hi>Ferryer.</hi> Next, that a Sum of Money certain, would certainly procure a Diſſolution; this ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I am ſure I never did: For I knew perfectly well, that the King had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſputes with himſelf at that time, whether he ſhould diſſolve or continue them: And he ſeveral times declared that the Arguments were ſo ſtrong on both ſides, that he could not tell to which to incline; but was carried at laſt to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of them by this one Argument; if I try them once more, they may poſſibly give me Money; if they do, I have gained my Point: If they do not, I can diſſolve them then, and be where I am now: So that I have a poſſibility at leaſt of getting Money for their continuance, againſt nothing on the other ſide. But if we could have turn'd this Argument, and ſaid, Sir, their Diſſolution will certainly procure you Money, when you have only a bare poſſibility of getting any by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and have ſhewn how far that bare poſſibility was from being a Foundation to build any reaſonable hope upon, which I am ſure His Majeſty was ſenſible of: And how much 300000 Pounds Sterling certain (which was the Sum we propos'd) was better than a bare poſſibility (without any reaſon to hope that, that could ever be Compaſſed) of having half ſo much more (which was the moſt he deſign'd to ask) upon ſome vile diſhonourable Terms; and a thouſand other hazards; which he had great reaſon to be afraid of; if I ſay, we had had Power to have argued this, I am moſt Confidently aſſured, we could have Compaſſed it, for Logick in our Court built upon Money, has more powerful Charms than any other ſort of reaſoning.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57626:74"/>
But to ſecure his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty from any hazard, as to that Point I propos'd His Majeſty ſhould offer that Sum upon that Condition, and if the Condition were not perform'd, the Money ſhould never be due; If it were, and that a Peace would certainly follow thereupon (which no Body doubted) His Majeſty would gain his Ends, and ſave all the vaſt Expences of the next Campaign, by which he could not hope to better his Condition, or put himſelf into more advantagious Circumſtances of Treaty then he was then in: But might very probably be in a much worſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the mighty oppoſition he was like to meet with, and the uncertain Chances of War. But admitting that His Majeſty could by his great Strength and Conduct main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf in as good a Condition to Treat the next Year, as he was then in (which was as much as could then reaſonably be hoped for) he ſhould have ſaved by this Propoſal, as much as all the Men, he muſt needs loſe, and all the Charges he ſhould be in a Year, would be valued to amount to more than 300000 Pounds Sterling, and ſo much more in Caſe his Condition ſhould decay, as it ſhould be worſe than it was when this was made: And the Condition of his <hi>R. H.</hi> and of the Catholick Religion here (which depends very much upon the ſucceſs of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty) delivered from a great wany frights and real hazards, Father <hi>Ferryer</hi> ſeemed to be very ſenſible of the benefit, all Parties would gain by this Propoſal. But yet it was unfortunately delayed by an unhappy and tedious Fit of Sickneſs, which kept him ſo long from the King in the <hi>France Comte,</hi> and made him ſo unable to wait on His Majeſty after he did return to <hi>Paris.</hi> But ſo ſoon as he could compaſs it, he was pleaſed to acquaint His Majeſty with it, and wrote to the Duke himſelf; and did me the Honour to write unto me alſo the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1674. and ſent his Letter by Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> who came Expreſs upon that Errand. In theſe Letters he gave his <hi>R. H.</hi> freſh aſſurance of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Friendſhip, and of his Zeal and readineſs to comply with every thing his <hi>R. H.</hi> had or ſhould think fit to propoſe in favour of Religion, or the buſineſs of Money. And that he commanded <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> as to the latter, to Treat and deal with his <hi>R. H.</hi> and to receive and obſerve his Orders and Directions, but deſired that he might not at all be concerned as to the former, but that his <hi>R. H.</hi> would cauſe what Propoſition he ſhould think fit to be made about Religion to be offered, either to Father <hi>Ferryer,</hi> or <hi>Monſieur Pompone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters came to us about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> and his <hi>R. H.</hi> expected daily, when <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> ſhould ſpeak to him about the Subject of that Letter: But he took no notice at all of any thing till the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and the Duke went to <hi>Newmarket</hi> for a Fortnight, and then only ſaid that he had Commands from his Maſter to give his <hi>R. H.</hi> the moſt firm aſſurance of his Friendſhip imaginable, or ſomething to that purpoſe, making his <hi>R. H.</hi> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Complement, but made no mention of any particular Orders, relating to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ferryer's</hi> Letter. The Duke wondring at this Proceeding, and being obliged to ſtay a good part of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and ſoon after his coming back, hearing of the Death of Father <hi>Ferryer,</hi> he gave over all other further proſecuting of the former Project. But I believe, I ſaw <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi>'s Policy all along, who was willing to ſave his Maſters Money upon aſſurance, that we would do all we could to ſtave off the Parliament for our own ſakes, that we would ſtruggle as hard without Money as with it. And we having by that time upon our own Intereſt, prevailed to get the Parliament Prorogued to the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> he thought that Prorogation being to a day ſo high in the Spring, would put the Confederates ſo far beyond their meaſures, as that it might procure a Peace, and be as uſeful to <hi>France</hi> as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Upon theſe Reaſons, I ſuppoſe he went. I had ſeveral Diſcourſes with him and did ſo far open my ſelf, to him as to ſay, I could wiſh his Maſter would give us, leave to offer to our Maſter 300000 Pounds for the Diſſolution of the Parliament. And ſhewed him that a Peace would moſt certainly follow a Diſſolution (which he agreed with me in) and that we deſired not the Money from his Maſter to excite our Wills, or to make us more induſtrious to uſe our utmoſt Powers to procure a Diſſolution, but to ſtrengthen our Power and Credit with the King, and to render us more capable to ſucceed with his Majeſty, as moſt certainly we ſhould have done, had we been fortified with ſuch an Argument.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, I preſs'd <hi>Monſieur Pompone</hi> frequently by Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> who returned hence again into <hi>France,</hi> on the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Day our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould have met, but was Prorogued. <hi>Monſieur Pompone</hi> (as I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57626:75"/>
by Sir <hi>William</hi>) did ſeem to approve the thing: But yet had two Objections againſt it: Firſt, that the Sum propos'd was great, and could be very ill ſpar'd in the Circumſtances his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was in. To which we anſwer'd, That if by his Expending that Sum he could procure a Diſſolution of our Parliament, and thereby a Peace, which every Body agreed would neceſſarily follow: His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would gain his Ends, and ſave five or ten times a greater Sum, and ſo be a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by his Expence: And if we did not procure a Diſſolution, he ſhould not be at that Expence at all: For that we deſired him only to promiſe upon that Condition, which we were content to be obliged to perform firſt. The ſecond Objection was, the Duke did not move, nor appear in it himſelf. To that we anſwer'd, That he did not indeed to <hi>Monſieur Pompone,</hi> becauſe he had found ſo ill an effect of the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with Father <hi>Ferryer</hi> when it came into <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny's</hi> hands: But that he had concern'd himſelf in it to Father <hi>Ferryer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I continued to proſecute and preſs the Diſſolution of the Parliament, deteſting all Prorogations as only ſo much loſs of time, and a means of ſtrengthening all thoſe, who depend upon it in oppoſition to the Crown, the intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, in the Opinion they had taken, that our King durſt not part with his Parliament, apprehending that another would be much worſe. Second, that he could not live long without a Parliament, therefore they muſt ſuddenly meet: The longer he kept them off, the greater his neceſſity would grow, and conſequently their Power to make him do what they liſted, would increaſe accordingly. And therefore, if they could but maintain themſelves a while, the Day would certainly come in a ſhort time, in which they ſhould be able to work their Wills. Such Diſcourſes as theſe kept the Confederates, and our Male-contents in heart, and made them weather on the War in ſpight of all our Prorogations. Therefore I preſs'd (as I have ſaid) a Diſſolution until <hi>February</hi> laſt, when our Circumſtances were ſo totally Changed, that we were forced to change our Councels too, and be as much for the Parliaments ſitting, as we were before againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Our Change was thus; before that time the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was the only Miniſter in Credit, who thought himſelf out of all danger of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: He having, been accuſed before them, and juſtified, and therefore was Zealous for their Sitting: And to increaſe his Reputation with them, and to become a perfect Favourite, he ſets, himſelf all he could to Perſecute the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion and to oppoſe the <hi>French.</hi> To ſhew his Zeal againſt the firſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived ſome old dormant Orders, for prohibiting <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to appear before the King, and put them in Execution at his firſt coming into his Office of Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain: And to make ſure work with the Second as he thought, prevailed with the King to give him, and the Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> (who married two Siſters of <hi>Myne Heere Odyke</hi>'s) leave to go over into <hi>Holland</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Heere,</hi> to make a Viſit as they pretended to their Relations. But indeed and in truth, to propoſe the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (eldeſt Daughter of his Royal <hi>H.</hi>) as a Match for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; not only without the Conſent, but againſt the good liking of his <hi>R. H.</hi> Inſomuch that the Lord <hi>Arlington's</hi> Creatures were forced to excuſe him with a Diſtinction, that the ſaid Lady was not to be looked upon as the Dukes Daughter, but as the Kings, and a Child of the State was, and ſo the Dukes Conſent not much to be conſidered in the diſpoſal of her, but only the intereſt of State. By this he intended to render himſelf the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Parliament and Proteſtants, who look'd upon themſelves as ſecured in their Religion by ſuch an Alliance, and deſign'd further to draw us into a cloſe Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with <hi>Holland</hi> and the Enemies of <hi>France.</hi> The Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> ſet forth upon this Errand the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1674 and returned not till the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following. During his abſence the Lord Treaſurer; Lord Keeper, and the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who were the only Miniſters of any conſiderable Credit with the King, and who all pretended to be entirely united to the Duke, declaimed loudly, and with great violence againſt the ſaid Lord, and his Actions in <hi>Holland</hi>: And did hope in his abſence to have totally ſupplanted him, and to have routed him out of the Kings favour. And after that, thought they might eaſily enough have dealt with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. But none of them had Courage enough to ſpeak againſt the Parliament, till they could get rid of him: For fear they ſhould not ſucceed, and that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would Sit in ſpight of them, and come to hear that they had uſed their endeavours againſt it. Which would have been ſo unpardonable a Crime with our <hi>Omnipotent Parliament,</hi> that no Power could have been able to have ſaved them from Puniſhment. But they finding at his Return that they could not prevail againſt him,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57626:75"/>
by ſuch Means and Arts as they had then tryed, reſolved upon new Councels: Which were, to out-run him in his own Courſe: Which accordingly they undertook, and became as fierce Apoſtles, and as Zealous for Proteſtant Religion, and againſt Popery, as ever my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> had been before them, and in purſuance thereof perſuaded the King to iſſue out thoſe ſevere Orders, and Proclamations againſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, which came out in <hi>February</hi> laſt: By which they did as much as in them lay to extirpate all Catholicks, and Catholick Religion out of the Kingdom. Which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were in my poor Opinion ſo deteſtable, being levelled (as they muſt needs be) ſo directly againſt the Duke by People which he had advanced, and who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſo much Duty and Service to him, that we were put upon new thoughts, how to ſave his <hi>R. H.</hi> now from the deceits and ſnares of thoſe Men, upon whom we formerly depended. We ſaw well enough, that their Deſign was to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as grateful as they could to the Parliament if it muſt Sit; they thinking nothing ſo acceptable to them, as the Perſecution of Popery: And yet they were ſo obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Parliaments diſpleaſure in General, that they would have been glad of any Expedient to have kept it off: Though they durſt not engage againſt it openly themſelves; but thought this Device of theirs might ſerve for their purpoſes; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Duke would be ſo alarm'd at their Proceedings, and by his being left by every Body, that he would be much more afraid of the Parliament than ever; and would uſe his utmoſt power to prevent its Sitting: Which they doubted not but he would endeavour: And they were ready enough to work underhand too for him (for their own ſakes, not his) in order thereunto, but durſt not appear openly: And to encourage the Duke the more to endeavour the Diſſolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Creatures uſed to ſay up and down, That this Rigour againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks was in favour of the Duke, and to make a Diſſolution of the Parliament more eaſie (which they knew he coveted) by obviating one great Objection which was commonly made againſt it, which was, That if the Parliament ſhould be Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it would be ſaid, That it was done in favour of Popery: Which Clamour they had prevented before hand, by the Severity they had uſed againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as we ſaw theſe Tricks put upon us, we plainly ſaw what Men we had to deal withal, and what we had to truſt to, if we were wholly at their mercy: But yet durſt not ſeem ſo disſatisfyed as really we were, but rather magnified the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance as a Device of great Cunning and Skill. All this we did purely, to hold them in a belief, that we would endeavour to diſſolve the Parliament, and that they might rely upon his <hi>R. H.</hi> for that which we knew they long'd for, and were afraid they might do ſome other way, if they diſcovered, that we were reſolved we would not. At length when he ſaw the Seſſions ſecured, we declared, that we were for the Parliaments meeting, as indeed we were, from the moment we ſaw our ſelves handled by all the Kings Miniſters at ſuch a Rate, that we had reaſon to believe they would Sacrifice <hi>France,</hi> Religion and his <hi>R. H.</hi> too, to their own Intereſt, if occaſion ſerved: And that they were led to believe, that that was the only way they had to ſave themſelves at that time. For we ſaw no Expedient fit to ſtop them in their Carreer of Perſecution, and thoſe other deſtructive Councels, but the Parliament: Which had ſet it ſelf a long time to diſlike every thing the Miniſters had done, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared violently againſt Popery, whilſt the Court ſeem'd to favour it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were Confident, that the Miniſters having turned their Faces, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would do ſo too, and ſtill be againſt them: And be as little for Perſecution then as they had been for Popery before. This I undertook to mannage for the Duke and the King of <hi>France</hi>'s intereſt: And aſſured <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> (which I am ſure he will teſtifie, if occaſion ſerves) that that Seſſions ſhould do neither of them any hurt: For that I was ſure I had Power enough to prevent miſchief: though I durſt not engage for any good they would do: Becauſe I had but very few Aſſiſtances to carry on the Work; and wanted thoſe Helps which others had, of making Friends. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſpared no Pains, or expence of Money to animate as many as they could againſt <hi>France:</hi> Our Lord Treaſurer, Lord Keeper, all the Biſhops, and ſuch as called themſelves Old Cavaliers (who were all then as one Man) were not leſs induſtrious againſt Popery, and had the Purſe at their Girdle too: Which is an excellent Inſtrument to gain Friends with, and all united againſt the Duke as Patron both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion. To deal with all this Force, we had no Money but what came from a few private hands: And thoſe ſo mean ones too, that I dare venture to ſay, that I ſpent more my particular ſelf out of my own Fortune, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57626:76"/>
upon my ſingle Credit, then all the whole Body of Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> beſides: Which was ſo inconſiderable in Compariſon of what our Adverſaries commanded, and we verily believe did beſtow in making their Party, that it is not worth mentioning. Yet notwithſtanding all this we ſaw, that by the help of the Non-conformiſts as Presbyterians, Independants, and other Sects (who were as much afraid of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution as our ſelves) and of the Enemies of the Miniſters, and particularly of the Treaſurer, who by that time had ſupplanted the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> and was grown ſole Manager of all Affairs himſelf, we ſheuld be very able to prevent what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd againſt us, and ſo render the Seſſions ineffectual to their Ends, though we might not be able to Compaſs our own: Which were, to make ſome brisk ſtep in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his <hi>R. H.</hi> to ſhew the King that his Majeſties Affairs in Parliament were not obſtructed by reaſon of any Averſion they had to his <hi>R. H.</hi> Perſon, or Apprehenſions they had of him or his Religion: But from Faction and Ambition in ſome, and from a real Diſſatisfaction in others, that we have not had ſuch Fruits and good Effects of of thoſe great Sums of Money which have been formerly given, as was expected. If we could then have made but one ſuch ſtep, the King would certainly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored his <hi>R. H.</hi> to all his Commiſſions: Upon which he would have been much greater than ever yet he was in his whole Life, or could probably ever have been by any other Courſe in the World, than what he had taken of becoming Catholick <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we were ſo very near gaining this Point, that I did humbly beg his <hi>R. H</hi> to give me leave to put the Parliament upon making an Addreſs to the King, that His Majeſty would be pleaſed to put the Fleet into the hands of his <hi>R H.</hi> as the only Perſon likely to give a good Account of ſo important a Charge as that was to the Kingdom, and ſhewed his <hi>R. H.</hi> ſuch Reaſons to perſwade him that we could carry it, that he agreed with me in it, that he believ'd we could. Yet others tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, how great a damage it would be to him, if he ſhould miſs in ſuch an undertaking (which for my part I could not then ſee, nor do I yet) he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon not to venture, though he was perſwaded he could carry it. I did Communicate this Deſign of mine to <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny,</hi> who agreed with me, that it would be the greateſt advantage imaginable to his Maſter, to have the Dukes Power and Credit ſo far advanced as this would certainly do, if we could Compaſs it: I ſhew'd him all the Difficulty we were like to meet with, and what Helps we ſhould have: But that we ſhould want one very material one; Money to carry on the Work as we ought: And therefore I do Confeſs, I did ſhamefully beg his Maſters help, and would willingly have been in everlaſting Diſgrace with all the World, if I had not with that Aſſiſtance of twenty thouſand Pounds ſterling, (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is not the tenth part of what was ſpent on the other ſide) made it evident to the Duke that he could not have miſſed it. <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> uſed to tell me, that if he could be ſure of ſucceeding in that Deſign, his Maſter would give a very much larger Sum: But that he was not in a Condition to throw away Money upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. I anſwered, That nothing of that Nature could be ſo infallibly ſure, as not to be ſubject to ſome Poſſibilities of failing; but that I durſt venture to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to make it evident, that there was as great an aſſurance of ſucceeding in it as any Husbandman can have of a Crop in Harveſt, who ſowes his Gound in its due Seaſon, and yet it would be counted a very imprudent piece of warineſs in any body to ſcruple the ventring ſo much ſeed in its proper time, becauſe it is poſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be totally loſt, and no benefit of it found in Harveſt. He that minds the Winds and the Rains at that rate, ſhall neither Sow nor Reap. I take our Caſe to be much the ſame as it was the laſt Seſſions. If we can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Dukes Intereſt one ſtep forward, we ſhall put him out of the ſtep of Chance for ever: For he makes ſuch a Figure already that cautious Men do not care to Act againſt him, not always without him, becauſe they do not ſee that he is much out-power'd by his Enemies. Yet is he not at ſuch a pitch as to be quite out of danger, or free from Oppoſition. But if he could gain any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable new addition of Power, all would come over to him as to the only ſtedy Centre of our Government, and no body would contend with him further. Then would <hi>Catholics</hi> be at reſt, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Intereſt ſecured with us in <hi>England</hi> beyond all Apprehenſions whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>In Order to this, we have two great deſigns to attempt this next Seſſions. Firſt that which we were about before, <hi>viz.</hi> To put the Parliament upon making it their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt to the King that the Fleet may be put into his R. H<hi>'s.</hi> care. Secondly,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57626:76"/>
to get an Act for general Liberty of Conſcience. If we carry theſe two, or either of them, we ſhall in effect, do what we liſt afterwards: And truly we think we do not undertake theſe great points very unreaſonably, but that we have good Cards for our Game: Not but that we expect great oppoſition, and have great reaſon to beg all the Aſſiſtance we can poſſibly get; and therefore if his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would ſtand by us a little in this Conjuncture and help us with ſuch a Sum as 20000 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> (which is no very great Matter to Venture upon ſuch an undertaking as this) I would be content to be Sacrificed to the utmoſt Malice of my Enemies, if I did not ſucceed. I have propoſed this, ſeveral times to Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny,</hi> who ſeemed always of my Opinion; and has often told me that he has writ into <hi>France</hi> upon this Subject, and has deſired me to do the like. But I know not whether he will be as Zealous in that point as a <hi>Catholic</hi> would be; becauſe our prevailing in theſe things would give the greateſt blow to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> here, that ever it received ſince its Birth, which perhaps he would not be very glad to ſee; eſpecially when he believes there is another way of doing his Maſters buſineſs well enough without it: Which is by a Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament, upon which I know he mightily depends, and concludes that if that comes to be Diſſolved, it will be as much as he needs care for, proceeding perhaps upon the ſame manner of Diſcourſe, which he had this time twelve Months. But with ſubmiſſion to his better Judgment; I do think that our Caſe is extreamly much altered to what it was, in relation to a Diſſolution, for then the Body of our Governing Miniſters (all but the Earl of <hi>Arlington)</hi> were intirely United to the Duke and would have govern'd his way, if they had been free from all fear and controul, as they had been if the Parliament had been removed.</p>
                  <p>But they having ſince that time engaged in quite different Councels, and Embarkt themſelves and Intereſts upon other Bottoms, having declared themſelves againſt <hi>Popery, &amp;c.</hi> To diſſolve the Parliament ſimply and without any other ſtep made, will be to leave them to Govern what way they liſt, which we have reaſon to ſuſpect, will be to the prejudice of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Catholic Religion.</hi> And their late Declarations and Actions have Demonſtrated to us that they take that for the moſt popular way for themſelves, and liklieſt to keep them in abſolute Power. Whereas if the Duke ſhould once get above them (after the Tricks they have plaid with him) they are not ſure he will totally forget the uſage, he has had at their hands. Therefore it imports us now to advance our Intereſt a little further by ſome ſuch Project as I have named, before we diſſolve the Parliament: Or elſe perhaps we ſhall but change Maſters (a Parliament for Miniſters) and continue ſtill in the ſame Slavery and Bondage as before. But one ſuch ſtep as I have propoſed, being well made, we may ſafely ſee them Diſſolved, and not fear the Miniſters; but ſhall be Eſtabliſhed and ſtand firm without any Oppoſition; for every body will then come over to us and worſhip the Riſing Sun.</p>
                  <p>I have here given you the Hiſtory of three years, as ſhort as I could, though I am affraid it will ſeem very long and troubleſome to your Reverence, among the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of affairs you are concern'd in. I have alſo ſhewn you the preſent State of our Caſe, which may (by Gods providence and good Conduct) be made of ſuch advantage to Gods Church, that for my part I can ſcarce believe my ſelf awake, or the thing real, when I think on a Prince in ſuch an Age as we live in, converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal and Piety as not to regard any thing in the World in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>God</hi>

I doubt not but your Reverence will conſider our Caſe, and take it to heart, and afford us what help you can, both with the King of Heaven, by your Holy Prayers and with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, by that great Credit which you moſt juſtly have with him. And if ever his Majeſties affairs (or your own) can ever want the Service of ſo inconſiderable a Creature as my ſelf, you ſhall never find any Body rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to Obey your Commands, or faithfuller in the Execution of them to the beſt of his power, than</p>

                           </gap>ryal,</hi> p. 66.</note>THe ſecond of <hi>June</hi> laſt paſt, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty offered me moſt generouſly his Friendſhip, and the uſe of his Purſe, to the Aſſiſtance againſt the Deſigns of my Enemies and his, and proteſted unto me, that his intereſt, and mine were ſo cloſely link'd together, that thoſe that oppoſe the one ſhould be lookt upon as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the other; and told me moreover, his Opinion of my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> and the Parliament which is, that he is of Opinion, that neither the one nor the other is in his Intereſt or mine: And thereupon he deſired me to make ſuch propoſitions as I ſhould think fit in this conjuncture.</p>
                  <p>All was tranſacted by the means of Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> who made uſe of Sir <hi>William Throgmorton,</hi> who is an honeſt Man, and of truth, who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> and hath held correſpondence with <hi>Coleman,</hi> one of my Family, in whom I have great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>I was much ſatisfied to ſee his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty altogether of my Opinion, ſo I made him Anſwer the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> by the ſame means he made uſe of to write to me, that is by <hi>Coleman,</hi> who addreſt himſelf to Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> (by the Forementioned Knight) and entirely agreed to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty as well to what had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Union of our Intereſt, as the unuſefulneſs of my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament in order to the Service of the King my Brother, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty; and that it was neceſſary to make uſe of our joynt and utmoſt Credits to prevent the ſucceſs of thoſe evil deſigns, reſolved on by the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the Parliament, againſt his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and my ſelf, which of my ſide I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe really to perform, of which, ſince that time, I have given reaſonable good proof.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I made ſome propoſals, which I thought neceſſary to bring to paſs what we were obliged to undertake, aſſuring him, that nothing could ſo firmly eſtabliſh our Intereſt with the King my Brother, as that very ſame offer of the help of his Purſe, by which means I had much reaſon to hope I ſhould be enabled to perſwade to this Diſſolving of the Parliament, and to make void the deſigns of my Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi> who works inceſſantly to advance the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to leſſen that of the King your Maſter, notwithſtanding all the proteſtations he hath made to this hour to render him Service.</p>
                  <p>But as that which was propoſed was at a ſtand by reaſon of the ſickneſs of Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> ſo our affairs ſucceeded not according to our deſigns, only Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> wrote to me, the 15<hi>th.</hi> of the laſt Month, that he had Communicated thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and that they had been very well liked of; but as they contained things that had regard to the <hi>Catholic Religion,</hi> and to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and uſe of his Purſe, he gave me to underſtand he did not deſire I ſhould Treat with <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> upon the firſt, but as to the laſt, and had the ſame time acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that <hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> had order to grant me whatſoever the conjuncture of our affairs did require; and have expected the effects of it to this very hour: But nothing being done in it, and ſeeing on the other hand that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and ſeveral others endeavoured by a thouſand deceits to break the good Intelligence which is between the King my Brother, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and my ſelf, to the end they might deceive us all three, I have thought fit to advertiſe you of all that is paſt, and deſire of you your aſſiſtance and friendſhip to prevent the Rogueries of thoſe, who have no other deſign then to betray the concerns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and who by their pretended Service, are the occaſion they ſucceed not.</p>
                  <p>As to any thing more I refer you to Sir <hi>William Throgmorton</hi> and <hi>Coleman,</hi> whom I have commanded to give an Account of the whole State of our affair, and of the true condition of <hi>England,</hi> with many others, and principally my Lord <hi>Arlington's</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to repreſent to you quite otherwiſe then it is.</p>

                  <p>I Sent your Reverence a tedious long Letter on our 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Coleman's <hi>Tryal,</hi> p. 68.</note> to inform you of the Progreſs of affairs for theſe two or three laſt years. I having now again the opportunity of a very ſure hand to conveigh this by, I have ſent you a Cipher, becauſe our Parliament now drawing on, I may poſſibly have occaſion to ſend you ſomething, which you may be willing enough to know, and may be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us that you ſhould, when we may want the conveniency of a Meſſenger: When any thing occurs of more concern other than which may not be fit to be truſted even to a Cipher alone; I will, to make ſuch a thing more ſecure write in Limon between the lines of a Letter, which ſhall have nothing in it viſible, but what I care not who ſees, but dryed by a warm Fire, ſhall diſcover what is written; ſo that if the Letter comes to your hands and upon drying it any thing appears, more then did before, you may be ſure no Body has ſeen it by the way. I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with that way of writing, but upon ſpecial occaſions, and then I will give you a hint to direct you to look for it, by concluding my viſible Letter with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Fire or Burning, by which mark you may pleaſe to know, that there is ſomething underneath, and how my Letter is to be uſed to find it out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We have hear a mighty Work upon our Hands, no leſs then the Converſion of three Kingdoms and by that perhaps the utter ſubduing of a <hi>Peſtileat Hereſie,</hi> which has domineered over great part of this Nothern World a long time, there were never ſuch hopes of ſucceſs ſince the Death of our Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>as now in our days when God has given us a Prince, who is become, may I ſay a Miracle, zealous of being the Author and Inſtrument of ſo glorious a Work; but the oppoſition we are ſure to meet with, is alſo alike to be great.</hi> So that it imports us to get all the Aid and Aſſiſtance we can, for the Harveſt is great, and the Labourers but few, that which we rely upon moſt next to God Almighty's providence, and the favour of my Maſter the Duke, is the mighty mind of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe generous Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to great undertakings, which being managed by your Reverence's exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Piety and Prudence, will certainly make him look upon this as moſt ſuitable to himſelf, and beſt becoming his Power and thoughts, ſo that I hope you will pardon me if I be very troubleſome to you upon this occaſion, from whom I expect the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt help we can hope for; I muſt confeſs, I think his Chriſtian Majeſties Temporal Intereſt is ſo much attracted to that of his R. H. (which can never be conſiderable, but upon the growth and advancement of the Catholic Religion) that his Miniſters cannot give him better advice, even in a Politic Sence, abſtracting from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the next World, that of our Bleſſed Lord, to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, that all other things may be added unto him: That I know his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty has more powerful motives ſuggeſted to him by his own devotion, and your Reverences zeal for Gods Glory, to engage him to afford us the beſt help he can in our preſent circumſtances, but we are a little unhappy in this, that we cannot preſs his Majeſty by his preſent Miniſter here upon theſe latter Arguments (which are moſt ſtrong) but only upon the firſt, Mr. <hi>Rouvigny</hi>'s ſence and ours differing very much upon them, though we agree perfectly upon the reſt. And indeed, though he be a very able Man as to his Maſters Service in things where Religion is not concerned, yet I believe it were much more happy (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the poſture he is now in) and his temper were of ſuch a ſort, that we might deal clearly with him throughout, and not be forced to ſtop ſhort in a diſcourſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and leave the moſt material part out, becauſe we know it will ſhock his particular Opinion; and ſo perhaps meet with diſlike and Oppoſition, though never ſo neceſſary to the main concern. I am afraid we ſhall find too much reaſon for this Complaint in this next Seſſion of Parliament, for had we had one here from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, who had taken the whole buſineſs to Heart, and who would have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57626:78"/>
repreſented the State of our Caſe truly as it is, to his Maſter; I do not doubt but his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would have engaged himſelf further in the affair then at preſent I fear he has done, and by his approbation have given ſuch Councels as have been offered to his R. H. by thoſe few <hi>Catholics,</hi> who have acceſs to him, and who are bent to ſerve him and advance the <hi>Catholic Religion</hi> with all their might, and might have more Credit with his R. H. then I fear they have found, and have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them alſo with his Purſe as far as 10000. Crowns or ſome ſuch Sum (which to him is very inconſiderable but would have been to them of greater uſe than can be imagined) towards gaining others to help them, or at leaſt not to oppoſe them. If we had been ſo happy as to have had his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty with us to this Degree; I would have anſwered with my Life for ſuch ſucceſs this Seſſions, as would have put the Intereſt of the <hi>Catholic Religion,</hi> his R. H. and his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty out of all Danger for the time to come. But wanting thoſe helps of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending thoſe neceſſary Councels, which have been given his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuch manner as to make him think them worth his accepting, and fit to Govern himſelf by, and of thoſe advantages which a little Mony well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged would have gained us; I am afraid we ſhall not be much better at the end of this Seſſions then we are now; I pray God we do not looſe ground. By my next, which will be er'e long, I ſhall be able to tell your Reverence more particularly what we are like to expect.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I moſt humbly beg your <hi>Holy Prayers</hi> for all our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and that you will be pleaſed to Honour me ſo far, as to eſteem me what I am entirely and without any reſerve.</p>

Then I told them; I believed the Duke loved his Brother ſo well; he would ſuffer no violence to be done to him: they ſaid, no; if the Duke could be brought to that, as he had been Religiouſly to every thing elſe, they might do their work: their other buſineſs was ready; and they might do it preſently. But they knew they could not bring him to that point: but they would take care for that themſelves, they had not begun with him, to leave him in ſuch ſcruples as that.

                        <p>
                           <q>AT my firſt coming to Mr. <hi>Rumſey</hi>'s Houſe, where I was to Lodge at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Afternoon, being the firſt day of the Aſſizes, Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> came to me, and ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> lay dangerouſly ill of a Fever, and had little hopes of Life, and deſired that I would give him a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57626:78"/>
Viſit, that he might impart ſomething of great conſequence to me before his death.</q> I told him I would give him a Viſit that Night after Supper, about Nine a Clock, if I might be ſatisfied of two things, firſt that there was no infection in his diſtemper; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the time would not be inconvenient, but he might diſcourſe to me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to his Condition. After a little while, two Phyſitians came to me, and aſſured me, that there was no danger of Infection, and that the time I had appointed would be moſt proper; for commonly he took his repoſe in the Afternoon, and at nine a Clock, he would, in all probability, be refreſhed, and fit to Diſcourſe with me: thereupon I declared my reſolution of going, and deſired the company of the two Sheriffs, and my Brother <hi>Roger North,</hi> and appointed my Marſhal <hi>William Janes</hi> to go with me to him. As we were upon the way, Mr. <hi>Croſsman,</hi> a Miniſter in that City, told me <hi>Mr. Bedlow</hi> had deſired him to come with me to him. I ſaid it was very well, and I ſhould be glad of his Company, whereupon we went altogether; and being come into the Room where <hi>Mr. Bedlow</hi> lay, I ſaluted him, and ſaid, I was extream ſorry to find him ſo ill; I came to viſit him upon his own deſires, I did imagine he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to impart to me as a Privy Counſellor, and therefore if he thought fit, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany might withdraw. He told me that needed not yet, for he had much to ſay, which was proper for the Company to hear, and having ſaluted the Sheriffs, and <hi>Mr. Croſsman,</hi> he diſcourſed to this purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>That he looked upon himſelf, as a dying man, and found within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he could not laſt long, but muſt ſhortly appear before the Lord of Hoſts, to give an account of all his actions: and becauſe many Perſons had made it their buſineſs to baffle and deride the Plot, he did, for the ſatisfaction of the World, there declare upon the Faith of a dying Man, and as he hoped for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that <hi>whatever he had teſtifyed concerning the</hi> Plot, <hi>was true.</hi> And that <hi>he had wronged no Man by his Teſtimony, but had teſtifyed rather under that over what was truth. That he had nothing lay upon his Conſcience upon that account.</hi> That he ſhould appear chearfully before the Lord of Hoſts, which he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe he muſt do in a ſhort time. He ſaid, he had many Witneſſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, who would make the Plot as clear as the Sun, and he had other things to diſcover, which were of great importance to the King and the Country. Hereupon he making ſome pauſe, I told him, the Plot was ſo evidently made out, that no reaſonable Man, no Proteſtant, I was ſure, could doubt of the Truth of it, but he ought not to have concealed any thing that concerned the King ſo highly, he ought to diſcover his whole knowledge in Matters of Treaſon, that Traytors may be apprehended and ſecured; who otherwiſe may have opportunity to execute their Treaſonable Deſigns. To this he reply'd, that much of that which he had not diſcovered, was to coroborate his former Teſtimony; that he had concealed nothing that was neceſſary to the Kings preſervation. That he thought it not fit to accuſe more Perſons, till he had ended with thoſe whom he had already accuſed: He expreſſed great grief and trouble at the the Condition of this poor King and Country (ſo he termed them) whom he knew, at that time, to be in eminent Danger from the Jeſuites, who had reſolved the Kings death; and he was ſure they would ſpare him no longer then he continued to be kind to them; he ſaid, he was privy to their Conſultations at <hi>Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Valadolid,</hi> where they uſed to obſerve the favourable Conjuncture they had to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Religion into <hi>England,</hi> which conſiſted in their having a <hi>Head,</hi> he muſt be ſet up what ever came of it, and if they let ſlip that opportunity, they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſuch another, for without a <hi>Head</hi> they could do nothing, he ſaid further, he knew the wickedneſs and reſolution of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> they ſtuck at nothing to compaſs their own ends, they had attempted to poiſon him, but he had eſcaped.</p>
                        <p>When he had finiſhed this Diſcourſe (which laſted about a quarter of an hour) I asked him if the Company ſhould not withdraw, and he ſaid yes, and ordered his Nurſes to go out, and only his Wife to ſtay to tend him. And thereupon all went out ſaving Mrs. <hi>Bedlow</hi> and my ſelf, and my Servant <hi>William Janes</hi>; then I told him, I thought it convenient, that what he ſhould then ſay unto me, ſhould be upon Oath; he replyed, that it was neceſſary it ſhould be ſo; and called for a Bible, but my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant having brought a Book with him, adminiſtred the Oath to him, and laying his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon a Chair by the Bed-ſide, writ down his Depoſition as he delivered it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57626:79"/>When Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> had concluded and ſaid, That was all he had to inform me of, I took the Paper, and read it over diſtinctly to him and he approved it, and ſigned it laying the Paper upon a Pillow.</p>
                        <p>I thought it not fit, conſidering his Condition to perplex him with Queſtions, but took his Information as he offered it, and held no diſcourſe with him, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was withdrawn, but concerning the true ſetting down his Depoſitions, and when he ſeemed to be weary, to mind him of taking Cordials, which his Wife reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him as he deſired them.</p>
                        <p>The next day Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Brother came to me, and told me that his Brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Copy of the Depoſition he made before me. But I told him, I had well conſidered it, and could not give him a Copy without the Kings leave. But I would move the King in it, and if he gave leave I would take care to ſend one to him. And Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Brother then told me, That it was his Brothers deſire, that I ſhould repreſent to his Majeſty his Condition and that his Sickneſs was very chargable, and move his Majeſty on his behalf for ſome ſupply of Money for his Subſiſtance, which I promiſed to do.</p>
                        <p>This is all that I can recollect of what paſſed upon this Occaſion, and is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance true, but the very Words, or the Order, I cannot poſitively remember.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Always intended to write from hence, to pay my thanks for the whole Circuit which was much more pleaſant, by your Favour of holding Correſpondence with me. But now I have buſineſs of ſome Importance, for as I ſoon as I came to this City, I received a Meſſage from Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> by Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ill, and in the Judgment of Phyſitians, in great danger of Death, had ſome buſineſs of great moment to impart to me. I knowing the Man, and the Seaſon, would not refuſe the pains to give him a Viſit: and being ſatisfied by Phyſitians that there was no Contagious quality in his Diſtemper, (though I did not much fear it) I went well accompanied, and in the preſence of the Company he declared, that <hi>what he had ſaid relating to the Plot was true; and be being a dying Man had nothing lay upon his Conſcience upon that ſcore.</hi> The greateſt trouble he had, was the danger the King (whom he loved above all things) was in from the Papiſts at this time, who would attempt his Life as ſoon as ever he ſhould ceaſe to be kind to them: and many other expreſſions of this kind. After this I asked, if he had any thing to impart to me in private, he told me he had, and having made the Company withdraw, all but my Clark, I took the incloſed Examination upon Oath, you may imagine I was not curious to perplex him with Queſtions; I took it juſt as he delivered it, of what ſignification it will be, I leave to wiſer Men, I think my duty is to ſend it to you, that you may inform his Majeſty of the truth. I ſhall wait upon you at <hi>Windſor</hi> upon <hi>Sunday</hi> next, to receive your further Commands,</p>

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:57626:79"/>And now the Truth of this is thus confirmed by as ſtrong Teſtimony as can well be given, the firſt part of it, premeditated Letters of one of the Conſpirators themſelves, nay the chiefeſt, thoſe Letters owned and acknowledeged by him to be his own Writing, and he after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards fairly tryed, legally convicted and condemned, and afterwards juſtly executed for the Treaſon; The other, <hi>verba morientis,</hi> which have always weight, unleſs they be dilivered Men who, 'tis known, think it meritorious to dye with a falſehood in their Mouth, when 'tis to ſerve the intereſt of the Church whereof they profeſs to dye Members; I ſay, the Truth of this being thus apparent, there certainly needs no other ground, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be given for the making the 30. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. <hi>for excluding Papiſts from ſitting in either Houſe of Parliament,</hi> eſpecially if it be conſidered, how much they, by being at Court, and ſitting in Parliament in the precedent Reigns had interrupted the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the meaſures they deſigned to take for their own preſervation; which things were examined into upon the diſcovery of this Plot, and therefore it appeared abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to exclude them both the Court and the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Preamble of the Act and the Subſtance of the Enacting Part, take as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOR, as much as divers good Laws have been made for preventing the increaſe and danger of Popery in this Kingdom, which have not had the deſired effects,</hi>

                     <hi>30. Car. c. 1.</hi> An Act for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> 
                  <hi>by reaſon of the free acceſs which Popiſh Recuſants have had to his Majeſties Court, and by reaſon of the Liberty, which of late ſome of the Recuſants have had and taken, to ſit and vote in Parliament. Wherefore for the ſafety of his Majeſties Royal Perſon and Government,</hi> It was Enacted, <hi>that from the firſt day of</hi> December 1678. <hi>No Member of the Houſe of Peers or Commons ſhould vote or ſit in either Houſe after the Speaker was choſe, till every ſuch Peer or Member had firſt taken the ſeveral Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and made, ſubſcribed and credibly repeated the Declaration following.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do ſolemnly and ſincerely in the preſence of God profeſs, teſtifie and declare, that I do believe that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, there is not any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation of the Elements of the Bread and Wine, into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, at or after the Conſecration thereof by any Perſon whatſoever, and that the Invocation or Adoration of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or any other Saint, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs, as they are now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are Superſtitious and Idolatrous. And I do ſolemnly in the preſence of God, profeſs, teſtify and declare, that I do make this Declaration and every part thereof, in the plain and ordinary ſence of the Words read unto me, as they are commonly underſtood by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, without any evaſion, equivocation or mental reſervation whatſoever, and without any diſpenſation already granted me for this purpoſe by the Pope, or any other Authority or Perſon whatſoever, or without any hope of any ſuch diſpenſation from any Perſon or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whatſoever, or without thinking that I am, or can be, acquitted before God or Man or abſolved of this Declaration, or any Part thereof, although the Pope or any other Perſon or Perſons, or Power whatſoever, ſhould diſpence with or annul the ſame, or declare that it was null and void from the beginning.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame Oaths and Declarations to be made in every ſucceeding Parliament in full Houſe, that all members of Parliament not ſwearing and declaring as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and Popiſh Recuſants convict, are forbidden the Kings and Queens preſence, That if any Member of the Houſe of Peers or Commons, do any thing contrary to this Act, or ſhall offend in any of the Caſes aforeſaid, ſuch Member ſhould be thenceforth judged a Popiſh Recuſant Convict, and ſhould be diſabled to hold or execute any Office in any of his Majeſties Dominions, and likewiſe to ſit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the Places of Members of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57626:80"/>
the Houſe of Commons diſabled to vote ſhould be void, and new Writs iſſue out for new Elections, that the King and Queens ſworn Servants ſhould ſwear as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and ſubſcribe the Declaration, and that if after refuſal of the ſame, they preſumed to come into their Majeſties preſence, they ſhould be diſabled to hold any place, and incur the Penalties aforeſaid. Nothing contained in this Act to relate to the Subjects of the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>being in the Queen Dowagers ſervice, not exceeding the number of eighteen at one time. That during the taking the Oaths all proceedings in Parliament ſhould ceaſe, and the Oaths,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Names of the Perſons who ſhould take them, ſhould be entred in Parchment Rolls, and for every ſuch entry not above the ſum of Twelve pence to be paid. This Act not to extend to ſuch who come into the King or Queens preſence, being Licenſed by ſix Privy-Counſellors, upon ſome urgent occaſion therein to be expreſſed, and ſuch Licenſe not to exceed Ten days at a time, and not above Thirty days in a Year: That all offenders againſt this Act, that ſhall take the ſaid Oaths,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and freed from all Penalties and Incapacities incurred thereby, but ſuch freedom and diſcharge not to extend to reſtore any ſuch perſon to any office or place filled upon voidance by this Act, nor to any other Officer till after the Expiration of one Year from taking the ſaid Oath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor to diſcarge the ſaid forfeiture of Five hundred Pounds as aforeſaid, nothing in this Act to extend to the then Duke of</hi> York.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus I have given an Hiſtorical Account of the making of theſe Laws, and of the Laws themſelves; and as they were highly reaſonable in their Making; ſo certainly it is as highly reaſonable to continue them, if the attemps of the Popiſh party under King <hi>James</hi> the Second be duly weighed: which were carried ſo far, that the Proteſtant Religion had been inevitably deſtroyed with the Profeſſors thereof, had not we been redeemed out of their hands by the <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Valour</hi> of his preſent Majeſty, to whom (under God) we owe our Deliverance; and therefore can never ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our gratitude. He hath given ſufficient Teſtimony of his Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and therefore it is reaſonable to believe, that he will readily concur to the Making any Laws, that ſhall be thought fit to preſerve it, I know of but one; and that is Caſtration, of all Prieſts and Jeſuites when ever they are found here, and breeding up the Children of Papiſts in the Proteſtant Religion. Which I humbly offer to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Parliament, for I believe this will terrify them more than Gallows or Galleys.</p>
            <p>And how neceſſary it is for this Kingdom, to rid themſelves of this Vermin every one ſees, but they that are either Papiſts, or ſo blinded, with hopes or expectations of the late Kings return, that they neither can nor will ſee.</p>
            <p>And now, methinks I hear <hi>ſome</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> tell me; I have ſhewn the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the Laws againſt the Papiſts, but have not ſaid one word in vindication of the Laws againſt the Diſſenters, who have been as violent againſt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as ever the Papiſts were, and the Laws againſt them are equally as juſt.</p>
            <p>To this I give this Anſwer, that I ways alwas of Opinion, that the differences between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Diſſenters, have been made and carried on by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. And I wiſh there were not too much truth in it, that the Papiſts influenced the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels when the Laws were made againſt the Diſſenters: I am ſure a very Learned Pen <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Sherlock.</note> of the Church <hi>England</hi> own'd the putting them in ſevere Execution the laſt ſeven or eight years to have proceeded from Popiſh Councils. And I doubt not but the ſevere uſage of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Diſſenters, when in Power, was promoted by the ſame Party. Since therefore the Papiſts can transform themſelves into all ſhapes to promote differences amongſt Proteſtants; in order to their Ruine; it can't certainly but be honeſt Policy, for the Proteſtants, in order to the preſervation of the whole, to unite againſt them as the common Enemy. And therefore as we, who are Lawyers, never love to go to Law, eſpecially with one another; ſo the Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> under the denomination of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Diſſenter, being now pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty even as to ſeverities on both hands, let them no more quarrel, but ſhake hands and be friends, which will tend more to the preſervation of the true Religion amongſt us than all the Laws that can be made.</p>
