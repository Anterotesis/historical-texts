            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I chooſe to be rather jealous it is not ſo, then boaſt it as a reaſon that it is, I can indeed ſay and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I am an honourer, and lover of <hi>Order, Decency,</hi> and good Government in a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, City,</hi> or <hi>Town;</hi> and from a naturall and moral principle, do deteſt theſe three ſins of <hi>Drunkenneſſe, Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as they ſtrike at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Order, Government:</hi> and the <hi>Reputation</hi> of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, place</hi> or <hi>perſon:</hi> and I wiſh this principle were wrought in ſuch ingenuous perſons, as otherwiſe are not perſwaded of a greater

evill in theſe ſins; they are evills that wound the glory of God, honour of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſtate, and the good of a civill Government; yet have I been wound up to more then a common hatred of theſe notorious ſinnes, ſince I have ſeen the face of them in the glaſſe of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Swearing,</hi> and the <hi>ſlight obſervance</hi> of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> with the <hi>profanation</hi> of it, to grow the more by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which I think is, becauſe but ſlenderly punniſhed, like the Seas, where but bounded with
<pb facs="tcp:154184:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weak banks, rages and roares the more, when they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down; I have likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that that which ſhould be our greateſt honor, is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſin, in that they which are under the ſtricteſt tye to Chriſtianity by profeſſion, ſhould ſo profane the Lords day, and keep it with leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe, then the Heathens do their dayes of worſhiping the Devil, whilſt we in troops runne to the profanation of God and his holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by more then the one halfe of moſt Pariſhes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves from the Congregation, and either prophane the day by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:154184:28"/>
or, which is as ſad, by a more then Heatheniſh idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſloathfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay, and this is ſo common, that it ſeems not otherwiſe, then if it were turned into a Law to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the meanes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and ſlight, and abuſe ſuch as would turn them aſide from hell and eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and by this meanes they ſlight the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, that labour night and day for the good of our ſoules, which I account the firſt ſtep to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy from the ways of God.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe obſerved the
<pb facs="tcp:154184:28"/>
ſlack execution of lawes, by Juſtices not performeing their duties, diſcourageing under Officers, and leaving them a ſcorn and a reproach to wicked and ungodly men; and if it pleaſe not the Lord to ſtir up the hearts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to ſearch diligently, to go about and find out diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered houſes, (the plagues of the Nation) and hunt men out of their houſes to the congregation, ſin will grow impudent, and bold; If I ſay they do not ſhew their faces, to encourage and ſet a rate upon others under them; men will be hardened in
<pb facs="tcp:154184:29"/>
their wayes, and be taught to grow worſe by the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of juſtice; and this I account a duty, which a good conſcience rightly principled cannot ſhift, nor excuſe before God or their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe things, with the tendency of all to ruine, where theſe evills are not redreſſed, put me upon this, (I hope uſeful, and may I not ſay neceſſary?) work; eſpecially conſidering the uſe of Judgements; their Energy if pondered in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and deliberate mind; they walk not alone, the cauſes and ends are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined;
<pb facs="tcp:154184:29"/>
nor are they only limited to the perſons or ſins they puniſh, but for warning others from the like ſins, or any other ſinnes whatſoever. And we ſee how God loves to warne before he ſtrike, ſo he did to <hi>Nineve</hi> and <hi>Belſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and uſed very much of long-ſuffering and patience to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe heart at laſt not taking warning, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154184:48"/>
over all ſorts of croſſe and deſperate wayes, till he thus fell under the ſtroak of Divine wrath.</p>
               <p>About the year 1630. nigh <hi>Maldon,</hi> five or ſix notorious Drunkards had plotted a meeting, and laid in beer for their prophane drinking healths: But (Divine Juſtice that can with his breath blaſt all our undertakings) did ſo juſtly give them up to exceſſe in this ſin and meeting, as they never met more, but all yielded up their ſpirits to the Juſtice of that God, whom they abuſed by his creatures.</p>
               <p>A man coming home drunk, would needs ſwim in a Mill dam, which his ſervants and wife diſſwaded him from, becauſe he could not ſwim, and once got him out after he was in, but he gets in again, and by the juſt hand of God there periſhed.

               <p>A Butcher in <hi>Haſlingfield,</hi> ſcoffing at the Preacher for his reproving of this ſin, was in the inſtant of his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <p>In the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Caſtle-terra,</hi> was much given to delight in drunken company, wherein healths went down ſwiftly, and glaſſes broke againſt the walls at every health; by this ſin he was ſo much addicted to wickedneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, as his ſport was to repeat the Miniſters Sermons in ſcorn, and deriſion, eſpecially at one time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard a Sermon upon faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Miniſter if he could remove mountaines, elſe he would not believe he had faith. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is by Gods hand ſtruck with the ſmall pox, which gets into his throat, in ſuch extremity, that he could not ſwallow any meat or drink to cool and refreſh the violence of his internall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154184:52"/>
heat; that throat that had been the gutter and channel of many a pounds worth of drink, could not now, in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like <hi>Dives,</hi> ſuffer one drop to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him. In this ſad and bitter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, he breaks out into theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to an honeſt man ſtanding by. <hi>Oh Thomas,</hi> would <hi>I</hi> could now receive one of thoſe glaſſes of drink, which formerly I profuſely and profanely have thrown againſt the walls! And growing worſe and worſe, without hopes of life, perceiving no remedy but death for all his ſoares, he breaks out again in his agony and torment; oh that now I had but as much faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired the 57. year of his Age. I pray, and cordially deſire, that ſuch ſinners as parallel this example, may not be reacht with the like Juſtice! Many there are in this Nation grown up to a height of <hi>Malice,</hi> and Rage againſt Gods Miniſters, and ſome in this place boyled up to a proportion of envy, ready to break; The Lord break their hearts, and humble their ſoules, under that two-edged ſword of his word, that they may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1654. One <hi>John Coultred</hi> of <hi>Orton</hi> Pariſh nigh <hi>Carliſle,</hi> coming drunk out of an Ale-houſe from <hi>Thursby,</hi> fell from his horſe, not far from the Ale-houſe, and died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>1650. <hi>VVilliam Howe,</hi> who kept an Ale-houſe in <hi>Carliſle,</hi> one time was drunk with two of his gueſts that were borderers, and going to convey them over the bridge, did all three fall into the River <hi>Caud;</hi> the two gueſts were drowned, <hi>Howe</hi> eſcaped by means of ſome buſhes, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up alive: which may be as a warning to ſuch as keep drink, to beware of other mens blood; I would

               <p>Theſe are ſad examples of Gods Severity and Juſtice, Who can ſtand before a conſuming fire? <hi>when once his anger is but a little kindled, bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.</hi> Our Judges find in their Circuit, few that are arraigned, which are not brought to it by this ſin, like ſlaves to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat; and are ſent quick, from their ſins to judgement, forcing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelf to cenſure their eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; the eccho of whoſe ſins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds in their puniſhments with ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from heaven.</p>

Here is a double ſin, profaneing it and neglecting that which is ordained by God for the eternall good of our ſoul; beſides, it is a premeditated act, and goes along with a great aggravation, as we ſhall ſee in a word preſently. It is now become ſo great a cuſtome to

prophane the Lords day, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt becomes a ſcoffe to others, that offers to reform or puniſh it; and that men may not ſo much ſlight it, I have collected a few reaſons to perſwade men to obſerve it, and diſſwade from the profanation of it, for God will not be mocked.</p>

               <p>This Relation is inſerted <hi>verbatim,</hi> as I have it from a godly Miniſter of the Goſpel, in the ſame County, and not farre from the ſame place, and is indeed a ſad example of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not only againſt the ſin of profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lords day, but alſo of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, and contempt of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe I obſerve this day ſo greatly neglected by the generality of the Nation, not onely neglecting to hear the Word preached, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave their ſoules, but alſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of it by profanation; give me a word, and that only to ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the obſervance of it as lawfull; for if ſuch a ſlighting of this day grow, we ſhall from it, run to Atheiſme, by contempt of Gods holy Ordinances, and Commandments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:154184:80"/>Let us firſt conſider the end of God in the Sabbath, which is chiefly for ſanctification of his name; and what creature dare ſay he is not ſtrictly ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the obligations expreſſable; It is a day of liberty, not of bondage, God can be ſanctified without us; he ſhineth not with borrowed lights, theſe tapers that burne from mortall breach, can adde no glory to God, but as in his great mercy and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is pleaſed to accept of us.</p>
               <p>Then the intent of this day as to our advantages, it's for the eternall good of our ſoules, that the Lord may by this occaſion reach our ſlow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and with his Word preached, that he may dwell with the humble &amp; and contrite ſpirit. We are not only to avoyd profaning it, by not <hi>Working, Drinking, Playing,</hi> Idleneſſe, Travelling, &amp;c but we ought to frequent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God in the Aſſemblies of his people, and there to hear his word with Godly reverence and fear.</p>
               <p>The reaſonableneſſe of one day in ſeven for God and our own ſouls, may convince us in a great meaſure of this day, &amp; that is a ſin leſs excuſable that's ſo reaſonable, &amp; that we may have the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154184:80"/>
leſſe to ſay for our excuſe, he gives us 6 for our outward affairs, oh then who can grudge the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>! eſpecially when God links in our immortal happineſſe together with his own glory. It was the cuſtom of Chriſtians in <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperours time, to meet on the Lords Day morning, ſing a Pſalm, receive the Sacrament, and covenant to flie ſin on that day: and when Chriſtians were ſummoned before the Heathen Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and demanded; <hi>Doſt thou believe the Lords Day?</hi> the anſwer was, <hi>I am a Chriſtian. Take away the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> ſayes a Reverend Divine, <hi>and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will ſoon wither and decay.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> might as well have been choſen the ſubjects of this profitable Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and we in their conditions, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſtead of a Sabbath to God, every day to the Devil. It will be more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, I am afraid, for them at that Great day, than for us.</p>
               <p>If we had been left to our own choice, What ſquarer diviſion of time could have been thought upon, than one day for our ſouls, and another for our bodies, one for the World, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Heaven? This had been the reaſonable rule of proportion; its
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154184:81"/>
more grace than reaſon, that God ſhould deſire but one day in ſeven, and that day alſo to be for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good. Oh how inexcuſable will it be for us that prophane it, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the advantages of it! Is refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from labour a toil to us? Is to be eaſed of ſin a burden? Lord then let me be burdened? for Lord, <hi>thy yoke is eaſie, and thy burden is light.</hi> What is a more unſpeakable mercy, than for ſouls to have communion with God, as well as our own hearts? And, as Divines ſay, glory is but grace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: So that eternal Sabbath of reſt, is but, as I may ſay, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>This ſin is accompanied with many aggravations, and this is none of the leaſt, that we have a will given us to refuſe to prophane it; Beſides its a deliberate act of the mind, its not ſudden, as an oath, or murder; but in the very act it ſelf, thou canſt not but know thou art ſinning againſt the light of thy conſcience: its the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſin, that is accompanied with time to conſider, an enlightened mind to underſtand the evil: to purpoſe to evil, is an aggravation as high as the ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:154184:81"/>If aggravations face not this ſin with a dreadful countenance, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in reaſon think; Is it not juſt with God to ſuffer thy frail com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of corruption to ſhrink under his heavy judgements? that at night Gods protection ſhould leave us, as in our graves, when we are in our beds? Or canſt thou expect any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thy outward eſtate, when it is in the power of God to diſpoſe of <hi>life, being, health, eſtate,</hi> and all? Is it not juſt; if we travel on this day, that God ſhould judge us with ſudden death in the like ſeverity, as he hath made others examples of to all Ages? Yet if God do ſuffer thy corn, wine, and oil, to encreaſe, fear a curſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Strawberry leaves of thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; for a bleſſing is not the ſhadow of ſin, it will not follow thee in the wayes of wickedneſſe; rather fear ſome judgement will overtake thy ſwift motion to impiety.</p>
               <p>A word to two ſorts.</p>
               <p>Firſt thoſe that prophane it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning not onely Gods Lawes, but the Lawes of the Nation; know that what is lawful on other dayes, are ſins on this day; and ſuch of you as need
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:154184:82"/>
not (by Gods bleſſings in a full eſtate) toil all the week, whereby you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plead a wearineſſe to waite on God upon his own day, you turn his bleſſings into a curſe, if you prophane it: you play all the ſix dayes, its a ſin with a witneſſe if you play away the ſeventh alſo. You that cannot cloſe this Holy Day without an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> inſtead of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Lord that made Heaven and Earth, Gods Judgements ſleep not, you are preparing your ſelves as fuell for the fire of Gods vengeance and diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Nextly, to you that ſit idly at home, never dreaming how to eſcape that wrath to come; methinks I read your ſad conditions in your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; That never think of God all the week; you cannot for your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, you will not for your pleaſures on the Lords Day: if there be any difference betwixt you and Heathens, it is, that you know your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it come: you will be at the Great Day, witneſſes for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelves.</p>
               <p>To ſee ſo many idly ſit at home, and never mind to hear the Word, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154184:82"/>
I am amongſt the <hi>Indians;</hi> Its a very heavy thing to conſider in ſome places, half the Pariſh at home in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or walking abroad in Sermon-time; nay, I have heard it credibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the mouth of a Miniſter in this County, that of ſome thouſands in a Pariſh, there hath not been, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, a hundred at a Sermon, nay, not fifty, nay not twenty, ſhall I ſay not ten? Is not this a ſad caſe to be in a Chriſtian Common-wealth? Nay its the ſad experience of this place where I live, and I may ſpeak it to my own knowledge, that three quarters of the people able to come, of this populous place, do idly ſtay at home, or walk abroad, not a family of ten, but the moſt of them are at home in idleneſſe, if not at play or drinking.</p>
               <p>Upon this account I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with one word; Good people, let me perſwade you to ſerve God, rather than gratifie the Devil with your own damnation: Is your labour leſſe to ſit at home, than in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? Do you think you have no ſouls to ſave, nor to loſe? you had better be working than idle, for that is a ſin in it ſelf, and is made greater
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154184:83"/>
on this day. You live more like the brute beaſts that are fed by the ſenſes onely. How can you be ſaved if you will not come unto him that you may have life? Are you Chriſtians or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels? Do you profeſſe to worſhip God,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 14, 17.</note> or Mahomet? <hi>How ſhall you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him of whom you have not heard? how can you hear without a Preacher?</hi> not to hear that Bleſſed Goſpel which Chriſt hath ſent into our Coaſts, our Houſes, is to do as the <hi>Gadereans</hi> did, drive Chriſt from our Habitations.

Judgements of God.

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:154184:91"/>To my knowledge, at <hi>Compton-Chamberlin</hi> in <hi>VViltſhire,</hi> at the houſe of Sir <hi>J. Penruddock,</hi> a dancing match was held on the Lords Day, where a ſtranger uſhers in, to act his part, and after a few turns about, and a few capers, he in the midſt of the ſin, falls dead to the ground, before all the company. Here was a ſad diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence from Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand, as many elſe beſides are; here was no inſtrument to take off any of the moſt ſevere vengeance of God; and ſuch examples in my mind, ſhould be taken as pregnant teſtimonies, to let all men know this day ought to be kept as Holy. Oh take heed of ſlighting this day, that God ſo ſeverely puniſhes in his ſore diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> upon his own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, brings in a ſad relation thus. When I lived in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> there was one Sir <hi>T. S.</hi> a Papiſt, and at that time a Favorite at Court, who at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the Country was very much feaſted and entertained by the Gentry: once amongſt the reſt, he was invited to a Knights houſe on the Lords day, where many accompanied
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:154184:92"/>
him: towards evening, the proper time for the deeds of darkneſſe, they fell to dancing: but look to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, and ſee what fell upon their ſinful prophaneſſe; In the midſt of their ſport, there was one Sir <hi>J.D.</hi> had a blow given him on his leg by ſome inviſible hand; for none was ſeen to touch him, as was atteſted by all the company: and thus he went lame for a good while after. It may be it ſet him upright in his practiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ever after; if it did, it was a good providence that ſaved him from a more ſevere Judgement.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> on Sabb.</note>One Sabbath day in the afternoon, a match at Football was made in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire:</hi> as two of the company was tolling a Bell to ſummon the reſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſome that ſat in the Porch of the Church ſuddenly hear a terrible clap of Thunder, and ſaw a flaſh of Lightning, coming through an obſcure lane; which flaſht in their faces, to their great terrour and fear, ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on to theſe that were tolling, it trips up the heels of the one, and leaves him ſtark dead: the other ſo blaſted, that he died alſo in few dayes.
