            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Sir VValter Raleigh.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Determine to write the Life, the Rise, Fortunes and End of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> Knight; his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs being certainly worthy to be transmitted to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who hath been so successfully industrious in retrieving the Actions of former Ages from the Ruines of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96690:3"/>
Time, even in its very Infancy, in a well-compil'd, masculine, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed History of the World. The Image of so great a Person should not be quite lost, though drawn in little, which deserves to be pourtraid by the greatest Masters of Policy, and with the boldest Touches. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Shadows cannot now well be left exact, seeing they must be taken so long after his Death; when Time hath defac'd his best Features, and shed <hi>Oblivion</hi> on the most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Actions. Who follows Truth (as Sir <hi>Walter</hi> has wisely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqu'd) too near the heels,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>face to the History of the World</hi>
               </note> may have his teeth struck out: and he that goes after her, oft loseth her sight, and himself too. Distance of time doth sometimes, like some <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums,</hi> make the streightest Actions seem crooked, and sometimes gives them the advantage of Landscapes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96690:3"/>
which appear taking and agreeable afar off, tho when nearly search'd, and pry'd into by a curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Eye, they seem rude, harsh, and unpleasant. We must therefore despair of a just and exact Account of him, unless we could by some Magick-Power (as the Author of a Pamphlet has done, to terrify and make <hi>Gondamore</hi> speak the Truth) raise him from the dead, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse a while with his Ghost. I shall however with what imperfect Clue our Histories have bequeath'd, trace him through the various Labyrinths of Fortune, and take a Prospect of him in the several Scenes of Court and Camp, Peace and War, till I have followed him to the Scaffold, the place of his much lamented and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy End; keeping as near as I can a <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>Those</hi> who in their Annals drive on with an implicit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96690:4"/>
faith; and <hi>Those,</hi> who to get the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Observers and Men of Reach, steal into the private Recesses of Princes, and disrobe Majesty it self to find some Deformities; which love to their Prince, and Interest of State should cover; The best Vail for all deform'd Actions.</p>
            <p>I find him born at a place, call'd <hi>Budely,</hi> or <hi>Budleigh,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> in an House which his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had long possest, call'd <hi>Hays:</hi> A County (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> has observ'd) renown'd among forreign Nations for the Valour of its Inhabitants in Sea-Services of all sorts.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his</hi> Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> That <hi>Spain</hi> thought so, Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> with many others of that County, as well as our Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> are very convincing Arguments.</p>
            <p>That he was well descended, was never yet questioned, but by my Lord of <hi>Oxon,</hi> who indeed was wont
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96690:4"/>
to call him the Jack, and Upstart. But these were words which only Envy and Emulation could extort, and every one very easily confute.</p>
            <p>Indeed that he was a Gentleman, because a Favourite, was no ill Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument amongst the Politicians of those Times, if we may believe a Secretary of State,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Rob. Nanton.</hi>
               </note> who hath left this as a Maxim then, That the Queen through her whole Reign never was guilty of creation, never in her choice took into her Favour a mere New-Man, or a Mechanick.</p>
            <p>That he was but poor in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning seems not strange, if we consider him the youngest Brother, and the Fortunes of his Family much diminished by the Generosity (if not Prodigality) of his Ancestors. But the wants of Fortune are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd with the richer gifts of the Mind; Nature foreseeing the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96690:5"/>
disability of his Estate, stock'd him with a larger portion of Sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd him the fairer Patrimony of a faithful Memory, plausible Tongue, strong Wit, and solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But because the natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Mind, though never so great, are capable of Advancement by the help of Education, he resolv'd for one of the Universities. <hi>Oxon</hi> had the happiness to own him, where I find him in <hi>Oriel</hi> Colledg. His slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fortune, and his active Genius, always pointed with a restless Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, would not let him settle here, so that he could only (like a Spy) take a transient view of, or (like an hasty Enemy) make some incursions and inrodes into those parts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which he afterward conquer'd, and was entirely Master of.</p>
            <p>Therefore that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96690:5"/>
feed those Hopes Ambition had kindled in his thoughts, and remove nearer to the Mistress he courted; He resolved for one of the Inns of Court, which he knew were always Places of Esteem with the Queen, who would say, <hi>they fitted Youth for the future.</hi> Here he spent his time, and improv'd himself in the intricate knowledge of our Laws, and in the studies of all Manly and Real Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments.</p>
            <p>But he staid not long here neither; for Fate it seems would have him of the Sword first. Yet though he laid aside his Gown, it was not with a design of never reassuming it; for through the frequent Vicissitudes of his whole Life, he challenged a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation amongst the most Eminent States-men, being upon all Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of Affairs consulted, as one of the best Oracles of Government
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96690:6"/>
and Policy in his time. It's true he was never sworn, for some Reasons of State which Courts spread a Vail over, but was frequently called to Council. Through his Life he made good his Motto, <hi>Tam Marti, quam Mercurio</hi>: and it is still a Question, Whether he was the better States-man or Souldier? incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in both the Arts of Peace and War. To rise by his Studies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably his Condition and Ambition would not let him judg the speediest course; much time and a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fortune being often spent in climbing up the tedious steps of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment that way. He thought it more easie to fight, than talk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a Reputation. Active-Times, and a busie War-like Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, pointed him out the readiest way to the Temple of Honour. The Sword he judged, with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96690:6"/>
the quickest Instrument to unty all the Knots and tedious Obstacles of Greatness.</p>
            <p>Nor could he want Occasions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to draw forth his Spirits into Action. <hi>France</hi> was engaged in a Civil-War; And the Queen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of concern for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> or for Reason of State, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Giant-Enemy the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> assisted the poor distressed <hi>Dutch.</hi> And the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by a Policy of the same nature, raises Rebellions in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; which, like subterranean Fires, broke out over all that Kingdom at several times; When one <hi>Mac</hi> had in one place spent his Force, presently we hear of the eruption of another. This Fire was kept in to the end of her Reign, being maintained by that lasting fewel of Rebellion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pretext of change in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>RELIGION:</hi> the Pope
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96690:7"/>
pretending the Kingdom belonged to <hi>St. Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1569.</note>Of his first Publick Appearance Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> hath given us this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: The <hi>Queen</hi> though imbroil'd in a Rebellion at home of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Dacres</hi> in the North, yet failed not to relieve the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who were now brought into a distressed and almost desperate condition; she exhorted all the <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes to assist the Common-Cause, supplied the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Navar</hi> with Money, taking Jewels in pawn; Permitted <hi>Henry Champer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun</hi> to carry into <hi>France</hi> a Troop of Gentlemen-Volunteers, who were resolv'd to make good the Motto their Colours bore, <hi>Finem det nobis Virtus.</hi> Among these Sir <hi>Walter</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himself, though (as Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> goes on) very young, and now first beginning to be of any note.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96690:7"/>
So soon the early blossoms of his Valour began to appear, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards grew up to an exact ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and perfection. <hi>France</hi> was the first School, wherein he learnt the Rudiments of War; and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (the Military Academies of those Times) made him Master of that Discipline; for in both places he exposed himself afterwards to Land-Service: But their slender Pay discouraged him from staying long in either. The Service of <hi>Ireland</hi> especially, scarce supplying the necessities of a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Life.</p>
            <p>Being restless and impatient of a narrow and low Condition, and his Services being not so successful as his Hopes were great, and his Merits not answered with a Fortune strong enough to buoy up his Reputation, he was resolv'd to leave no stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96690:8"/>
nor any Method of living unexperimented. And since his Land-Expeditions could make no Additions to his Fortunes, Novelty, and a desire of putting himself into a better capacity, urg'd him to a Sea-Voyage. At both Sea and Land he was the true Pattern of Industry; and if any Man ever manag'd Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to its furthest Improvements, it was He. No expert Souldier or Mariner escap'd his Acquaintance or Enquiries; nothing that related to the Arts of War and Navigation missd his perusal: and one who was Master of those parts he enjoy'd, could with no great difficulty make those Arts his own. Add to this the Methods he used to improve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: He slept but five hours; four he spent in reading and mastering the best Authors, two in a select Conversation and an Inquisitive Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96690:8"/>
the rest in Business. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all the labours that attend a Souldier, and fared as the meanest. No common Mariner took more pains, or hazarded more in the most difficult Attempts.</p>
            <p>What his Sea-Voyages produc'd Histories are silent in; but not long after his return I find him got again into <hi>Ireland,</hi> appearing with his own Colours flying in the Field,<note place="margin">1580.</note> under the command of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Pelham</hi> in the Deputyship of that Kingdom. He had not been long there, before a Quarrel was rais'd between the Lord-Deputy and our Captain, (for with that Title he went into <hi>Ireland</hi>) which being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of to a Council of War, was referr'd to the Council-Table in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Our Historians would make the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s Cause the fairest; but Justice, and the Result of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96690:9"/>
Council, gave <hi>Raleigh</hi> the Victory. What were the occasions of this Quarrel our Annals slip over, and have only left a large Field for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to tire it self in. Whether an eager pursuit after Honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exact obedience to Military-Command, occasioned by a restless desire of doing something Great, or what ever else it might be, we leave the Reader to fancy: However if his Cause had not been good, no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, how well soever manag'd, could have brib'd the Judgment of so wise a Council, wholly strangers to his Worth and Person.</p>
            <p>About this time Authors place the <hi>Aera</hi> of his Rise, but cannot well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about the occasion of it. Some would have <hi>Leicester</hi> to be the chief Agent in it, and that he related the whole business at Council to the Queen with no little advantage to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96690:9"/>
our Captain. Not so much probably out of respect to <hi>Raleigh,</hi> as to his own Interest. For Favourites, like their Princes, seldom espouse any Cause upon any other ground than what advances or stands with their own Designs. His own Designs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed on the Queen were blasted, and finding the burden and envy of a Statesman too heavy for his aged shoulders, he was willing handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to impart them to a more active <hi>Genius.</hi> Though great Favourites seldom admit of a Partner, till Age makes them willing to withdraw, and leave the trouble of Business to more spritely years. They care not to have new Plants set, till them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are almost wither'd and sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>Others would have his Rise attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Sussex,</hi> who brought him to Court to outshine <hi>Leicester,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96690:10"/>
the splendor of his Enemy. But what was the strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and only Perswasive with the Queen was his Merits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which she soon saw, and presently encouraged. Nor must I here pass by one small step to his future Heighth, which our Chronicles have over-look'd, as below the Pen of an Historian, thô some have judged an Account of some little transactions the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to Truth and Mysteries of State. The occasion was thus: Our Captain coming over out of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the afore-mention'd Cause to Court, in very good habit, (which it seems was the greatest part of his Estate) which is often found to be no mean Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer where Deserts are not known, found the Queen walking, till she was stopt by a plashy-place which she scrupled treading on; presently he spread his new Plush-Coat on the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96690:10"/>
Ground, on which the Queen gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trod, being not a little pleas'd, as well as surpris'd with so unexpected a Complement. Thus, as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon this Story,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fuller's Worthies</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>An Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Admission into the first Notices of a Prince, is more than half a degree to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</hi> For he presently after found some gracious Beams of Favour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on him, which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, and well knew how to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and contract. To put the <hi>Queen</hi> in remembrance, he wrote in a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow obvious to her Eye, <q>
                  <l>Fain would I climb, yet fear I to fall.</l>
               </q>
Which her Majesty either espying, or being shewn, under-wrote this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <q>
                  <l>If thy heart fail thee, climb not at all.</l>
               </q>
But his aspiring Soul could not rest
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96690:11"/>
in the lower, though safer way of living; He could not be mean, whose Resolutions were so great, and whose Prudence and Activity made him capable of the highest Preferments. Inspir'd with a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and ambitious <hi>Genius,</hi> he design'd nothing but what was extreme; and had rather not be, than not be one of the most Eminent. And to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est height probably he had arrived, had he lived in any other Princes Reigns than that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>; the former being not over-hasty to raise any to any great Honour, and the latter not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Men of War and Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raleigh</hi> was so towardly an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice in the Court-Trade, that he soon set up for himself, and would have improved this stock of Favour to a great advantage, had he not lost by those common Enemies to it, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96690:11"/>
and Jealousy. In a short time he is become a <hi>Minion,</hi> obtains the <hi>Queens</hi> Ear, is often consulted, and nothing done without him. Her Favour and his Parts began to alarm his Rivals, who like some envious Neighbours will not easily permit any Fabrick to stand long that hinders their own Prospect. Jealous Favourites, like wise Planters, will not suffer the Under-Wood to rise, which may obstruct the growth of taller Trees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leicester</hi> began to repent his choice of his Creature, and thought he grew too fast in his Mistresses Favour. To stop the current of her Affection, he privately endeavours to undermine his Esteem, and introduce a new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite that might be his Rival. To bring about this Design, <hi>Leicester</hi> thought there would be nothing wanting, if by <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s absence he could have opportunity to introduce
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96690:12"/>
the Earl of <hi>Essex;</hi> nor did he long expect before one offer'd it self: for the Queen being willing to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Raleigh,</hi> (who, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> is pleased to tell us, was never suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to be commended for the great pains he took to discover re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries, and to advance the Glory of the <hi>English</hi> Navigation and Trade) sent him on a Voyage to Sea. Nor did he make a vain and fruitless one; for at his Return he brought news of a new Country, discover'd by him in the Year 1584, called in honour of the Queen <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> before call'd <hi>Wingandacoa</hi> by the barbarous Inhabitants. A Country that hath been since of no inconsiderable Profit to our Nation. But though Patents were granted to him to settle a Plantation there, it grew not famous till the Reign of King <hi>James:</hi> Wherein this Nation
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96690:12"/>
quickly found out the Excellency and Fruitfulness of the Place, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our <hi>English</hi> Bodies, and profitable to the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> Nature there is prodigal, and makes amends for her parsimony to other parts of the World. An Acre there yieldeth often forty Bushels of Corn; and, which is more strange, there being three Harvests in a Year: For, their Corn is sow'd, ripe, and cut down in little more than two Months.</p>
            <p>For this, and other beneficial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions and Designs,<note place="margin">1584.</note> this Year her Majesty was pleas'd to confer on him the honour of Knighthood, which in her Reign was more estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med than in her Successors. The Queen keeping the Temple of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour close shut, and never open'd but to Vertue and Desert. Nor was she indeed ever hasty to reward; for she seldom paid in any other Coin
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96690:13"/>
than Patents and good Words. So that the greatest number of those who might pretend to Favour, were the Architects of their own Fortunes, and had little or no Encouragement from her, more than that of a <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who praises the Workmanship, and commends the handsom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of a Building, but is at no part of the Expences of raising it. Hence our Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Rewards are quickly enumerated, for he got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after all his Exploits and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, but the Wardenship of the <hi>Stanneries,</hi> Command of the Guard, and the Government of <hi>Iersey</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi>; Places of no very great Profit, nor answerable to his Worth, or just Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1588.</note>In 1588, the grand <hi>Clymacterick</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> (for Bodies Politick have their <hi>Critical</hi> Times) I find Sir <hi>Walter</hi> by his Example encouraging others of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96690:13"/>
the Gentry to set out Ships at their proper Charges, and by his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conduct and Courage to put them to the best use. Which hired Ships were Actors of no small use in that fatal Blow given to the <hi>Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Armada.</hi> Three Years this Giant had been growing to that portentous Greatness, with infinite Expences and Industry; but was beaten, ruin'd, and dishonourably overthrown in less than a Months space: the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> finding that our Ships as well as the Heavens could fight against them.</p>
            <p>But this Shock, like some Ague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, was easily recover'd, and in a short time after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to renew their former Designs. For in the Parliament which began <hi>Febr.</hi> 19. 1592,<note place="margin">1592.</note> I find Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the House, that the Queen could not without Subsidies prevent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96690:14"/>
the eminent dangers threatned from the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Of which Subsidies he spake (as he protested) not only to please the <hi>Queen,</hi> to whom he was infinitely oblig'd, but for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity he both saw and knew; He told them, he very well discovered the great Strength of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; and to shew his Mightiness, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the House how he possest all the World. And that his Malice and ill purposes against this Realm might be evident, he shewed how on every side he had beleaguer'd us; In <hi>Denmark,</hi> the King being young, he had corrupted the Council and Nobility; so it was very likely he would speed himself of Ships from thence. In the Maritime Towns of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and in <hi>Norway</hi> he hath laid in great store of Shipping. In <hi>France</hi> he hath the Parliament-Towns at command; In <hi>Britanny</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96690:14"/>
he hath all the best Havens; and in <hi>Scotland</hi> he hath corrupted the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and promis'd them Forces to assist the <hi>Papists,</hi> and that they were ready to joyn with any Foreign-Aids, that would make them strong enough to be by themselves, and to resist others; for, as he thought, there were not six Gentlemen of that Country of one Religion. In his own Country there are all possible Preparations making, and he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with sixty Galleys besides other Shipping. If our Subsidies are not sudden, he may with ease invade us riding at Anchor; but all will be little enough to withstand him. At his coming he fully resolveth to get <hi>Plymouth,</hi> or at least to possess some of the Havens this Summer within our Land. And <hi>Plymouth</hi> is in most danger; for no Ordnance can be carried thither to remove him, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96690:15"/>
Passages will not give leave. Now the way to defeat him, is to send a Royal Army and supplant him in <hi>Britanny,</hi> and to possess our selves there; and to send a strong Navy to Sea, and to lie with it on the Cape, and at <hi>Lambuck</hi>; to which places come all his Ships with Riches from all places, and there they may set upon all that come.</p>
            <p>What success this Speech alone had I know not, but the Subsidy was granted with the general Consent of the House, to carry on the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Spain.</hi> His Expedition a little after demonstrates that the Queen took his Advice, which was to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at a distance; and whilst she could not handsomly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault his more neighbourly and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parts, to disturb those that were more naked and further off, his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> The Moneys brought from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96690:15"/>
thence being the Nerves and Sinews of his Power, and the chiefest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary in the <hi>Irish Rebellion,</hi> which if handsomly stopt, would put an end to his Greatness, and humble the Mighty Monarch.</p>
            <p>That he might not want an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to shew his Valour and Conduct in this Affair, the Queen sends him to Sea to manifest both; thinking none more fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in a Business, than the Person that counsell'd and started it; having the Courage of a Souldier to put in execution the sober Advices of the Gown-man. To <hi>America</hi> he is sent with 15 Men of War to possess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of <hi>Panama,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ship their Riches, or to intercept them in their passage homewards. But he found more Encouragement from the willingness of the Seamen than from the Winds, which held
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96690:16"/>
the Ships in their Havens for three Months: A Circumstance which put an ill look upon the Enterprize, and had almost made it vain. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could allay the Courage of the Seamen, who were bouy'd up with the hopes of Prey, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their Commander. Having set sail at last, they got beyond the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cape, called the <hi>Lands-end,</hi> where they met with unwelcome Intelligence, <hi>viz.</hi> That by express command from his <hi>Catholick</hi> Majesty no Ship was to stir from the <hi>West-Indies</hi> that Year. Together with this News, instead of meeting with the long'd-for Enemy, they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd with a more invincible one, a furious Tempest, which disperst and disorder'd the Fleet, and sunk their Ship-Boats. Thus being on all sides assaulted with Tempests, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters, and the worse news of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96690:16"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> stay in the other World, he thought the Heavens had dash'd his Designs, and rendred a well-ordered Contrivance abortive. Upon which at first he intended to make for home with the whole Fleet; but another Project offer'd it self after second thoughts, of dividing the Navy into two Squadrons, from the hope that thô while together they had been successless, yet Fortune might offer to them when separated something worthy their patience and desires. Immediately one Squadron is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Conduct of Sir <hi>Iohn Burroughs,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi>; the other to Sir <hi>Martin For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisher,</hi> with their respective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions. Sir <hi>Martin</hi>'s charge was to lie off and on the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> to hinder the coming in of their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s to wait at the <hi>Azores</hi> for the coming of the Caracks out of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:96690:17"/>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was much blam'd for this Action, and thought short in his Politicks, in giving over the hopeful part of the Design to Sir <hi>Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> and retiring himself to Court. But the Success was the only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Oversight, and nothing but the Event could charge him with Imprudence. The Division of the Fleet prov'd a wise Design, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> For while the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral eyed <hi>Forbisher,</hi> the mighty Caracks were unregarded, and left to the mercy of <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Men of War as an easy Prey. Who having according to Order arriv'd at <hi>Sancta Cruce,</hi> a small Town in the Isle of <hi>Azores,</hi> a little after got sight of a <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchant-man, (brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued by a Privateer of the Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s) but could not reach her, an unhappy Calm keeping him at too far a distance. But a more
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96690:17"/>
welcom Storm arising in the night, forc'd both to weigh Anchor. Assoon as day appear'd, the <hi>Portuguees</hi> was unlading as fast as she could at <hi>Flores,</hi> and upon the approach of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> fired their Carack: But though their Designs were ruin'd as to that Ship, yet the news they got from some Prisoners taken, gave them fresh hopes, and heartned them with the Information, that several other Merchant-men were behind coming for <hi>Spain.</hi> This put Sir <hi>Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> upon placing his Men of War at several distances, to reach as far about as was possible. But they had not long waited, before their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was rewarded with the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal of a large Vessel, call'd <hi>The Mother of God,</hi> which was 165 foot long from Head to Stern, and seven Decks high, laden with Goods to the value of 150000 <hi>l. English,</hi> besides
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96690:18"/>
vvhat the Seamen privately took for their own use.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> having now deserted his Naval Employ, and become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a Courtier, it vvas not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he vvas seiz'd vvith the idle Court-Disease of Love, the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate occasion of the vvorst Action of his vvhole Life. For in the Year 1595,<note place="margin">1595.</note> I find him under a Cloud, banish'd the Court, and his Mistresses Favour vvithdrawn, for devirgina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Maid of Honour. But vvhy for this one Action he should lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the imputation of an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and from a single crime get the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Debauch, is the Logick of none but the Vulgar. By the same reason the other Favourites of those Times (<hi>Leicester, Cecil,</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi>) bid as fair for those titles, the latter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Parallel good in this Vice with his successor <hi>Buckingham,</hi> thô
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96690:18"/>
in other Circumstances there was a great disparity. Neither ever vvas it accounted any great Crime in the Orb of Courts. But to stop the Mouth of Fame, which is always open on such occasions, and to wipe out the Infamy of the Fact, he vvas shortly after married to the Object of his Love, the defloured Lady. And to get Reputation among the People, vvho always vvere unjust to him in their sentiments, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on a Voyage to <hi>Guiana,</hi> for the Improvement and Honour of his Country. Having therefore obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Liberty, (for, for this Action he vvas imprisoned some months) and finding all things vvith an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant Aspect, he followed his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of discovering New Places, and tracing Nature in her more retired and hidden Paths; thinking that Absence, and a Fortunate Voyage,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96690:19"/>
might reinvest him in his Mistresses thoughts, and merit a new Esteem.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiana</hi> had been talk'd of much by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as an excellent Country, and for one Commodity the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had a great reverence for, very famous, GOLD, which put Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> upon the Attempt, judging it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a place (if master'd) very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for its situation to annoy and disturb the <hi>Spaniards American</hi> Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, and would be no little help in building his Fortunes, and what was more estimable, place him in his Mistresses Favour again.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Plymouth</hi> he set sail on the sixth of <hi>February,</hi> and on the 22d of <hi>March</hi> arriv'd at the Isle of <hi>Trinidado,</hi> eight degrees on this side the <hi>Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial</hi>-Line; where he soon made himself Master of St. <hi>Iosephs,</hi> a small City; and, which was more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, of the Governour <hi>Antonio
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96690:19"/>
Bereo,</hi> from whom he got the best account of those Parts, and its Trade. Leaving his Ship at <hi>Trinidado,</hi> with some Pinaces and an hundred Men, and the small stock of Knowledge he obtain'd of <hi>Bereo,</hi> he made up the great River <hi>Ormus,</hi> in search of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi> What he found, saw, and performed there, his most Ingenuous History of those Parts may satisfy the Curious.</p>
            <p>In his Return he fired <hi>Cumana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Inhabitants would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it with Money; besides seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cottages at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and <hi>Rio de la Hach.</hi> Neither did he desist in this Design of <hi>Guiana,</hi> for once or twice Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> tels us afterwards he prosecuted it with vast Expences, although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had plac'd a Colony at <hi>Trinidado</hi> to hinder his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attempts.</p>
            <p>Whilst Sir <hi>Walter</hi> is searching for a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96690:20"/>
new World, <hi>Hawkins</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi> are attempting fresh Things in those parts of <hi>America</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vvere already possest of. But their old Fortune had left them, and the unhappiness of the Action put an end to their Lives;<note place="margin">1596.</note> In the Year 1596 both died with Grief, and bequeath'd their Hatred of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to revenge their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
            <p>Who this Year return'd, being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with his Expedition, and much more vvith the Reception he found at Court. The Storm vvas blown over, and his Mistresses Brow vvas more smooth than at his departure; after his Eclipse he shone brighter at Court, and the Death of those two famous Sea-men, put them upon courting Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> whom the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of State forc'd them to cherish and encourage. It's strange, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96690:20"/>
vvhat was <hi>Essex</hi>'s Ruine should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Sir <hi>Walter</hi> in Favour, frequent Absence from his Mistress. But Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Obsequiousness work'd much upon the humour of the Queen, who lov'd Pliantness, and exact Obedience, which <hi>Essex</hi> could not always counterfeit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> being encouraged with the possession of <hi>Cales,</hi> from whence it was but a short cut over into <hi>England,</hi> the Death of <hi>Hawkins,</hi> and their former scourge, <hi>Drake,</hi> and the earnest Sollicitations of the <hi>Irish,</hi> (who through her Reign had got the Itch of Rebellion, which vvas fed and maintained by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> thô they had been sufficiently blooded by the <hi>English;</hi>) And the Queen fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing a Storm gathering, thought 'twas the best way to scatter it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it grew too great, and came too near. She resolved therefore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96690:21"/>
with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> first, and fairly set on the Enemy in his own Ports. She speedily riggs a brave Fleet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 150 Ships, Mann'd by 6360 Souldiers, 1000 Volunteer-Gentlemen, 6772 Seamen. <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> were Commanders of equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, having been both at an excessive charge in carrying on the War. To these were joyn'd a Council of War, consisting of several eminent Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Souldiers, among whom was our Sir <hi>Walter.</hi> The Fleet was divided into four Squadrons; the first commanded by the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Howard</hi>; the second by <hi>Essex</hi>; the third by Sir <hi>Thomas Howard;</hi> the fourth by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> they set sail, and got to <hi>Gades</hi> the 20th: their Design being perfectly unknown, as well to their Enemies as their own
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96690:21"/>
Men. <hi>Essex</hi> heated with Youth, and an ambition of doing bravely, would have presently landed and assaulted the Enemy: but this heat was allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrected by Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, vvho impugned all such rash Attempts. At last a fit Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty presented it self, and by all it was resolv'd to fight them. At which News the Earl threw up his Hat for joy. The Ebbing-Waters would not permit the great Ships to engage, the Shelves being of greater hazard than the Enemy. Therefore <hi>Raleigh</hi> is pitch'd on as the most proper Person in the midst of the Channel to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them, vvho accordingly in a little Ship, called the <hi>Wastspight,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prow against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Men of War, vvho thereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fell back. Upon this the rest of the Feet came in, and burnt and took several of their Ships. After
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96690:22"/>
this Victory at Sea, the Men were very importunate to go on shore, whom <hi>Essex</hi> landed at <hi>Puntal,</hi> a league from the City. At first the <hi>Spaniards</hi> received them with a great deal of Courage, but the <hi>English</hi> charged so warmly, that they thought it their prudentst way to retire with more speed than they came out. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> pursued so close that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most recover'd the City-Gates as soon as they. The Earl got upon a Bulwark near the Gate, and from thence he espyed an Entrance into the Town, but very hazardous, it being down a very steep Precipice: but this did not affright several of our <hi>English,</hi> who leap'd from thence into the Town, and engaged the Enemy in the Streets. In the mean time Sir <hi>Walter</hi> and others having forced the Gates, entred the Town, and the Castle was surrendred upon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96690:22"/>
Merciful Conditions. But Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was not idle, or eager after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his Conquest; for whilst others vvere reaping the plentiful Harvest of War, he with some small Ships who could pass up the Chanel, fired their Merchant-Men vvhich were withdrawn to <hi>Port-Real,</hi> althô they offered two millions of Ducats for their Redemption. Great vvere the Losses to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by this War; and if we may believe our Histories, amounted to no less than Twenty Millions of Ducats. Upon Consultation it was resolv'd to quit the Town, though contrary to the Opinion of <hi>Essex,</hi> vvho vvas for keeping it, as a future Annoyance to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> After this they took <hi>Faro</hi> in <hi>Algarbe</hi>; and being weary at last of their Victories, they resolv'd for home, though much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Essex</hi>'s will, vvhose youthful
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96690:23"/>
heat was but inflam'd by their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, but was wisely slack'd by the Prudence of the Admiral, and the sober Advice of Sir <hi>Walter</hi>: vvho finding their Men sick, and having gotten so ample Rewards, were not again for hazarding their Fortune upon hopes of a future Prey.</p>
            <p>At their Return the Queen wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd and encourag'd her Souldiers vvith new Honours. All but <hi>Essex</hi> were pleased, who found State-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments not dispos'd of according to his mind. <hi>Vere</hi> was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Briel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>To recover their Losses at <hi>Gades,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> riggs out a new Fleet, vvhich were baffled alone by the Winds; for the greatest part were cast away and wreck'd. With the Reliques of this Fleet, in the Year following I find him upon his old
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96690:23"/>
Designs of <hi>Ireland:</hi> But the Queen was always too nimble for the grave <hi>Don,</hi> whose Designs, like his Ships, mov'd slow and heavy.</p>
            <p>Twenty Ships were rigg'd out at present,<note place="margin">1597.</note> and afterwards encreased to an hundred and twenty Men of War and Victuallers; five thousand Men rais'd, besides a thousand old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers brought from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> by <hi>Vere.</hi> To appease <hi>Essex,</hi> the whole Conduct of the Expedition is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. The Navy was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Squadrons; The first led by <hi>Essex</hi> himself; The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by <hi>Howard</hi>; The third by Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> who now was esteemed the ablest Seaman of his Age. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oble this Expedition, several Persons of quality of all sorts engag'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who look'd rather like Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers than Souldiers, being more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd with Feathers and gay Clothes,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96690:24"/>
than arm'd with Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. On the ninth of <hi>Iuly</hi> they set out with these Instructions, <hi>viz.</hi> To steer to <hi>Farol</hi> and the <hi>Groine,</hi> to surprize the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and to intercept their <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet (the Bait of the War) at the <hi>Azores.</hi> Which Design was built upon very good Maximes of State: For it would hinder the Fleet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against <hi>England</hi>; Their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men wanting Convoys, might be seized on; The <hi>Azores</hi> vvon, (where the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet always call'd for fresh Water in their Return); the Queen have the Dominion of the Seas, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> be obliged to a Treatment of Peace. <hi>Essex</hi> gave out that he was resolv'd to sacrifice Himself and the Navy for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: But his brisk Resolutions were quickly daunted by a dismal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, which astonish'd the Mariners
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96690:24"/>
themselves, and forc'd home our gaudy Volunteers, who thought no Enemy so terrible as a Tempest, and the severe motions of a Sea-sick stomack. Thus by this Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heaven their Ships were torn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Victuals spent, and they upon this Emergency forc'd to a Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation what to do. Some were for laying aside the <hi>Farol</hi> and the <hi>Groine</hi> Attempts; others for a Voyage to the <hi>Azores,</hi> which was contradicted by <hi>Vere.</hi> So that at last <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Raleigh</hi> were pitch'd on to ride Post for Advice to the Queen. <hi>Essex</hi> talkt to the Queen of strange <hi>Chimaera's</hi>; how that if he were permitted to have the Fleet, he would with ease fire the <hi>Spanish</hi> Navy, and perform many other bold Designs; about which the Queen caution'd him, and desir'd the whole Business should be managed as their joynt discretion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96690:25"/>
should prompt, and opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it self. But if it were possible, if any occasion courted them to it, they should fire the Ships in <hi>Farol</hi> Haven, and intercept what other Ships they could from the <hi>Indies</hi>; And upon all Occasions manifest their Conduct and Valour. With these Instructions they set sail again from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> (whither they were returned the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of <hi>August</hi>) but were sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by a Tempest near the Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end. A cross Yard in <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Ship was broken by the impetuousness of the Storm, and fell, which forc'd him to stay behind to make it good; And having been falsly inform'd that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was bound for the <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> after having repaired his Ship, he steer'd his course thitherwards. In the mean time <hi>Essex</hi>'s Jealousy, and the pernicious Insinuations of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>'s Enemies, had wrought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96690:25"/>
a belief that this Division of the Navy was on purpose laid and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>design'd by <hi>Raleigh</hi>: But however the business was put up at his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and <hi>Essex</hi> welcom'd him, making an <hi>Apologie</hi> for acquainting the <hi>Queen</hi> with the Division falsly represented, and built (as it appear'd) on wrong suppositions.</p>
            <p>Here wanting Water, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> landed without leave, and scarce had taken in Water before he received Orders immediately to follow <hi>Essex</hi> to <hi>Fayal,</hi> whither he repaired: but not finding <hi>Essex</hi> there according to his Order, he spent his time in taking an exact survey of the Haven, and of the People there, who from the fear and apprehension of what followed, vvere hastily packing away their Goods. This fair Opportunity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Consultation, puts him upon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Town, and egg'd on the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96690:26"/>
Souldiers in hopes of an ample Prey. Sir <hi>Gilly Merrick</hi> (one of <hi>Essex</hi> his Creatures) disswaded Sir <hi>Walter</hi> from the Design, alledging it would rob the Earl of the Honour of taking it, and so confirm him his Enemy. But <hi>Sir Walter</hi>'s desire of Glory, and the Souldiers Avarice, urg'd him (after he had staid some time for <hi>Essex</hi>'s Arrival) to the Assault of the Place, which was at last taken. The next day after this Exploit <hi>Essex</hi> arrived at <hi>Fayal,</hi> where he was quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of what <hi>Raleigh</hi> had done, and that the whole Business was transacted with no other design than to rob him of the Glory, which his Jealousy made him easily believe.</p>
            <p>Some perswaded the Earl to try <hi>Sir Walter</hi> by a Council of War, and Cashier him; others without more ado would have him put to Death, for landing without Orders: At last
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96690:26"/>
some of <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Officers were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier'd, He himself frown'd on, and severely reprov'd by <hi>Essex.</hi> But he never wanted an Apology for his Ambition; instancing that he was not obliged to the Orders the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers and Souldiers were; that the Commission did not reach Him, being one of the three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; Moreover, that he staid for him four days; and that he was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated at last to land, being in extreme want of Water, vvhich was not to be had without fighting. However, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> became his Mediator, and perswaded him to an honorable submission; which was perform'd, and accepted of; and thereupon both himself, and the cashier'd Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers were again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into favour. But this was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laying their Passions asleep awhile, which in the sequel of our story were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96690:27"/>
again awaken'd. I cannot here omit a speech of the Earls upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (which <hi>Sir Henry Wotten</hi> calls a Noble Word) who being urged to put <hi>Sir Walter</hi> on Martial Law: <hi>That I would do,</hi> said he, <hi>if he were my Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, this Expedition was not so glorious and great as at first they hoped it might have been. For after burning the Town, and taking <hi>Flores, Gratiosa,</hi> and <hi>Villa Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> in <hi>St. Michaels,</hi> with three <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Spanish</hi> Ships, together with the burning of a <hi>Carack,</hi> they came home much torn, leaky, and weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the end of <hi>October.</hi> This Expedition was commented on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously by the People, who were strangely carried on with a blind Passion for <hi>Essex,</hi> and so very prone to misconstrue <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Actions, from a Prejudice they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96690:27"/>
that because he was not <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>'s friend, he must be an enemy to his Country. However, the Queen look'd on him with another eye, and he grew faster in her favour than his Rival, who from this time began ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to decline, by a fault <hi>Sir Walter</hi> was afterwards guilty of, Insatiable Ambition; a Principle that put him on those Practices which brought him afterwards to the Block. <hi>Essex</hi> was incens'd that Sir <hi>Robert Cecil, Raleigh</hi>'s Friend, was preferr'd in his absence. And because the Earl's Concerns are woven amongst <hi>Sir Walters,</hi> it will not be impertinent to give some Account of him here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Essex</hi> was arrived to the heighth of Favour, and might have staid there, had he taken his Measures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; had he own'd an Obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to the Queen, or been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the great Requisit in a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96690:28"/>
               <hi>Dissimulation</hi>; but it was a part of his Character to be a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter, and a weak Dissembler of the least Disgrace. His <hi>Ireland</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions were ill construed, and his Miscarriages nicely dissected by the curious Eyes of those State-Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, the Lord-Treasurer <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> the Lord-Admiral <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and his mortal Enemy Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> who began to remove him out of that Favour he had long possest. But it was true, as the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> has observ'd, <q>That though he was Rival'd by a strong and subtile Faction, which cared, consulted for his Ruine; yet the Danger was thus allayed, that they were all his publick and professed Enemies, and so known to the Queen, that they durst never impertinently urge ought against him, since they were sure that Malice was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96690:28"/>
when the Reason of their Objection haply might not be considered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However, in 1601 the Earl drew near his Ruine: for being hurried on by <hi>Cuffs</hi> ill Counsel, and his own Discontents, he projects new Plots against the State, and tampers with the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to remove his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Court by force, informing him that the Power of the Nation lay in their hands, <hi>Raleigh</hi> being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Iersey, &amp;c.</hi> and other of his Enemies having the strength of the Nation at their command. And vainly presuming upon the Love of the Citizens, he projects to seize the Court, and secure <hi>Raleigh,</hi> as the most considerable Enemy he had. Of which Designs <hi>Gorges</hi> informs Sir <hi>Walter.</hi> The better to carry on his designs, <hi>Essex</hi> goes into <hi>London,</hi> where he endeavour'd to excite the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96690:29"/>
to an Insurrection: But the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then being Rich, was not so apt to rebel; Rebellion being usually the Daughter of Poverty and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. For these Treasonable Actions, being found guilty, he was condemned and executed.</p>
            <p>That he died bravely and like a Gentleman, is not to be question'd; but that Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> should come openly to see him die, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose only to fat his Eyes with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his Enemy, can never be granted, if we may believe himself in the same circumstances on the Scaffold, where he told his Auditors on the words of a Dying-man, he only came there to defend himself if any thing had been urg'd against him by the Earl.</p>
            <p>Thus ended that Favourite, whose Death struck a damp on the Queens prosperous days, and gave blackness
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96690:29"/>
to her declining Reign. This Blow, like that of Gunpowder, not only blew up his Friends and Neighbours, but shook his Enemies at a distance; for it reach'd Sir <hi>Walter</hi> too, who wanting strength to grapple with his Rival the Treasurer, and not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humility enough to be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, perish'd at last in the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This himself presag'd (if we may believe <hi>Osborn</hi>) as he came from the Execution of <hi>Essex,</hi> in a Boat, when he was heard to say, <hi>That it was more safe to have many Enemies at Court of equal power, than one false and ambitious Friend who hath attain'd to the absoluteness of Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen could not long sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her Favourite; for I find her Death to be the next year following. A Queen who had enrich'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reform'd Religion, curb'd the Pride of <hi>Spain,</hi> supported <hi>France,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96690:30"/>
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> protected the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd his Armies by Sea and Land, reduc'd <hi>Ireland</hi> to obedience not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the subtil Practices of <hi>Spain,</hi> and open Assistance given in Arms to her <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels; with many other things, which might seem too much to be the Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of one Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1602</note>King <hi>James</hi> her Successor came to the possession of a Kingdom arrived at the heighth of Prosperity, which like other Bodies when they are at their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> tend to Corruption, and degenerate. This Sir <hi>Walter</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, &amp; would have (as he thought) remedied. Sir <hi>Iohn Fortescue,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cobham, Sir Walter,</hi> and others, would have obliged the King by Articles before his coming to the Crown, that his Country-mens num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should be limited: But this was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96690:30"/>
stopt by the prudent Treasurer, and the bold <hi>Northumberland. Sir Walter</hi> fear'd that the <hi>Scots,</hi> like Locusts, would quickly devour this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it being probable that (like the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>) they would settle in any Country rather than their own, and would make it their business to render our Nation as poor as their own: for this, he, with the rest of them, was afterwards frown'd on by the King, and lost his Command of the Guards.</p>
            <p>However, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> still pursued the Good and Glory of his Country; and as formerly in Active Times, gave his Advice against the Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> which might now with no great difficulty be brought on its knees. At the entrance of the King he presented him with a Manuscript of his own writing, with no weak Arguments against the Peace. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96690:31"/>
Sir <hi>VValter</hi> was mistaken; for his Counsel was ill tim'd, and a new <hi>Part</hi> was now to be acted, the <hi>Scene</hi> being changed. Peace was the King's Aim, whether out of Fear, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Principles I determine not. But with <hi>Spain</hi> a Peace is concluded, with an Enemy already humbled, who now had time given them to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their former Losses, and were as it were cherish'd to assault us with the greater vigor: which how true it proved every Man can tell. And as if the King would quite run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Queens Politiques, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> are despised, slighted, and deserted, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it were of ill example for a Monarch to protect them.</p>
            <p>The King is hardly warm in his Throne, but there is a great noise of a Plot, generally call'd <hi>Sir Walter Raleigh's Treason;</hi> but upon vvhat
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96690:31"/>
Grounds I know not, since he had the least hand in it, as by his Tryal will appear. A Plot that is still a Mystery, and hath a Vail spread over it; A Plot compos'd of such a Hodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podg of Religion and Interests, that the World stands amazed Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> should ever be drawn into it; A Plot so unlikely to hurt others, or benefit themselves, that as <hi>Osborn</hi> tells us, <hi>If ever Folly was capable of the title, or Pity due to Innocence, theirs might claim so large a share, as not possibly to be too severely condemn'd, or slightly enough punished.</hi> Envy and Disdain, as <hi>Sir Walter</hi> has told us in his <hi>Remains,</hi> seek Innovation by Faction. Discontent is the great Seducer, which at first put him to search into a Plot, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was betray'd into. The chief Ingredients in this Medley were two Priests, <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clerk,</hi> and Count <hi>Arembergh,</hi> Ambassador Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96690:32"/>
for the Arch-Duke, who brought in <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he his Brother <hi>George Brook,</hi> both <hi>Protestants,</hi> at least seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so; <hi>George Brook</hi> hook'd in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and others, and they the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> a rank <hi>Puritan;</hi> then came in Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> the wisest of them all according to <hi>Sanderson,</hi> who as he tells us, dallied like a Fly in the flame till it consum'd him. Willing he was to know it, and thought by his Wit to over-reach the Confederates, whom he knew well enough, thô he dealt with none but <hi>Cobham,</hi> as I can find out. One Mr. <hi>Lawrency</hi> an <hi>Antwerp</hi>-Merchant, was the property made use of by <hi>Arembergh,</hi> and a Crony of the Lord <hi>Cobhams.</hi> These carried on the Contrivance a long while, which (as <hi>Sanderson</hi> tells us) was betray'd by <hi>Lawrency,</hi> and the vigilancy of <hi>Cecil.</hi> And indeed it was morally impossible that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                              <p>THat he did Conspire, and go about to deprive the King of his Government; to raise up Sedition within the Realm; to alter Religion, to bring in the <hi>Roman Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to procure Foreign Enemies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Kingdoms. That the Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the ninth of <hi>June</hi> last, did meet with the said Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in <hi>Durham</hi>-House, in the Parish of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the <hi>Fields,</hi> and then and there had Conference with him, how to advance <hi>Arabella Stuart</hi> to the Crown and Royal Throne of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that then and there it was agreed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96690:34"/>
that <hi>Cobham</hi> should treat with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> Embassador from the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> to obtain of him <hi>600000</hi> Crowns, to bring to pass their intended Treasons. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that <hi>Cobham</hi> should go to the Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> to procure him to advance the pretended Title of <hi>Arabella</hi>: from thence knowing that <hi>Albert</hi> had not sufficient means to maintain his own Army in the <hi>Low-Countries, Cobham</hi> should go to <hi>Spain</hi> to procure the King to assist and further her pretended Title.</p>
                              <p>It was agreed, the better to effect all this Conspiracy, that <hi>Arabella</hi> should write three Letters, one to the Arch-Duke, another to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a third to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and promise three things: First, to establish firm Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Secondly, To tolerate the <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Superstition. Thirdly, To be ruled by them in contracting of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                              <p>And for the effecting these Traiterous
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96690:35"/>
Purposes, <hi>Cobham</hi> should return by the Isle of <hi>Jersey,</hi> and should find Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> Captain of the said Isle there, and take Counsel of <hi>Raleigh</hi> for the distributing of the aforesaid Crowns, as the Occasion or Discontentment of the Subjects should give cause and way.</p>
                              <p>And further, That <hi>Cobham</hi> and his Brother <hi>Brook</hi> met on the <hi>9</hi>th of <hi>June</hi> last, and <hi>Cobham</hi> told <hi>Brook</hi> all these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: To the which Treasons <hi>Brook</hi> gave his Assent, and did joyn himself to all these; and after on the Thursday following, <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Brook</hi> did speak these words: <hi>That there would never be a good World in</hi> England, <hi>till the King</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Soveraign Lord) <hi>and his Cubs</hi> (meaning his Royal Issue) <hi>were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And the more to disable and deprive the King of his Crown, and to confirm the said <hi>Cobham</hi> in his Intents, <hi>Raleigh</hi> did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish a Book, falsly written against the most
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96690:35"/>
just and Royal Title of the King, knowing the said Book to be written against the just Title of the King; which Book <hi>Cobham</hi> after that received of him. Further, for the better effecting these Traiterous Purposes, and to establish the said <hi>Brook</hi> in his Intent, the said <hi>Cobham</hi> did deliver the said Book unto him the <hi>14</hi>th of <hi>June.</hi> And further, the said <hi>Cobham,</hi> on the <hi>16</hi>th of <hi>June,</hi> for accomplishment of the said Conference, and by the traiterous Instigation of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> did move <hi>Brook</hi> to incite <hi>Arabella</hi> to write to the three forenamed Princes, to procure them to advance her Title; and that she, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had obtained the Crown, should promise to perform three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain. 2.</hi> To tolerate with impunity the <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions. <hi>3.</hi> To be ruled by them three in the contracting of her Marriage.</p>
                              <p>To these Motions the said <hi>Brook</hi> gave his Assent. And for the better effecting of the said Treasons, <hi>Cobham</hi> on the seventeenth

of <hi>June,</hi> by the Instigation of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> did write Letters to Count <hi>Aremberg,</hi> and did deliver the said Letters to one <hi>Matthew</hi> de <hi>Lawrency,</hi> to be delivered to the said Count: which he did deliver for the obtaining of the <hi>600000</hi> Crowns; which Money by other Letters Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> did promise to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the payment of; and this Letter <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> received the eighteenth of <hi>June.</hi> And then did <hi>Cobham</hi> promise to <hi>Raleigh,</hi> that when he had received the said Mony, he would deliver <hi>8000</hi> Crowns to him: to which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he did consent; and afterwards <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offered <hi>Brook,</hi> that after he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the said Crowns, he would give to him <hi>10000</hi> thereof; to which Motion <hi>Brook</hi> did assent.</p>

                  <p>You have heard of <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s bloody Attempts to kill the King and his Royal Progeny, and in place thereof to advance one <hi>Arabella Stuart</hi>: The particulars of the Indictment are these. First, That <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> met with <hi>Cobham</hi> the ninth of <hi>Iune,</hi> and had Conference of an Invasion, of a Rebellion, and an Insurrection, to be made by the King's Subjects, to depose the King, and to kill his Children, poor Babes that never gave offence: Here
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96690:37"/>
is Blood, here is a new King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. In our King consists all our Happiness, and the true use of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, a thing which we all wished to be setled after the death of the Queen. Here must be Money to do this, for Money is the Sinew of War. Where should that be had? Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> must procure it of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> five or six hundred thousand Crowns, and out of this Sum <hi>Raleigh</hi> must have eight thousand. But what is that Count <hi>Aremberg?</hi> though I am no good <hi>French</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet it is as much as to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> Earl of <hi>Aremberg.</hi> Then there must be Friends to effect this: <hi>Cobham</hi> must go to <hi>Albert</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> for whom <hi>Aremberg</hi> was Ambassador at that time in <hi>England.</hi> And what then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He must perswade the Duke to assist the pretended Title of <hi>Arabella.</hi> From thence <hi>Cobham</hi> must go to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and perswade him to assist the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96690:38"/>
said Title. Since the Conquest there was never the like Treason. But out of whose Head came it? Out of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi>'s, who must also advise <hi>Cobham</hi> to use his Brother <hi>Brook</hi> to incite the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> to write three several Letters, as aforesaid in the Indictment; all this was on the ninth of <hi>Iune.</hi> Then three days after <hi>Brook</hi> was acquainted with it: After this <hi>Cobham</hi> said to <hi>Brook,</hi> It <hi>will never be well in</hi> England <hi>till the King and his</hi> Cubs <hi>are taken away.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Raleigh</hi> delivered a Book to <hi>Cobham,</hi> treacherously written against the Title of the King. It appears that <hi>Cobham</hi> took <hi>Raleigh</hi> to be either a God, or an Idol. <hi>Cobham</hi> endeavours to set up a new King, or Governour. God forbid mine Eyes should ever see so unhappy a change. As for the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> she upon my Conscience hath no more title to the Crown than I have, which before God I utterly renounce.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96690:38"/>
                     <hi>Cobham</hi> a Man bred in <hi>England,</hi> hath no experience abroad: but <hi>Raleigh,</hi> a Man of great Wit, Military, and a Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Now whether these things were bred in a hollow Tree, I leave to them to speak of, who can speak far better than my self. <hi>And so sate him down again.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sir Edward Cook, the Kings Atturney.</speaker>
                  <p>I must first, my Lords, before I come to the Cause give one Caution, because we shall often mention Persons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Places, some of them great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs: What ever we say of them, we shall but repeat what others have said of them; I mean the Capital Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders in their Confessions: We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Law, must speak reverently of Kings and Potentates. I perceive these honourable Lords, and the rest of this great Assembly, are come to hear what hath been scattered upon the Wrack of Report. We carry a just Mind, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96690:39"/>
no man but upon plain Evidence. Here is Mischief, Mischief in <hi>summo Gradu,</hi> exorbitant Mischief. My Speech shall chiefly touch these three Points; <hi>Imitation, Supportation,</hi> and <hi>Defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Imitation of Evil ever exceeds the Precedent; as on the contrary Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Good ever comes short. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief cannot be supported but by Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; yea, it will so multiply, that it will bring all to confusion. Mischief is ever underprop'd by Falshood of foul Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. And because all these things did concur in this Treason, you shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Main, as before you did the Bye.</p>
                  <p>The Treason of the Bye, consisteth in these Points: First, That the Lord <hi>Grey, Brook, Markham,</hi> and the rest, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Force in the Night to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the King's Court: which was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the Heart of the Realm, yea in the Heart of the Heart, in the Court.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96690:39"/>
They intended to take him that is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, to make him subject to their Power, purposing to open the Doors with Musquets and Calievers, and to take also the Prince and Council. Then under the King's Authority to carry the King to the Tower; and to make a <hi>Stale of the Admiral.</hi> When they had the King there, to extort three things from him: First, A Pardon for all their Treasons. Secondly, A Toleration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Superstition: Which, their Eyes shall sooner fall out than they shall ever see; for the King hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken these words in the hearing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>I will lose the Crown, and my Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever I will alter Religion.</hi> And, thirdly, To remove Counsellors: In the room of the Lord Chancellor, they would have plac'd one <hi>Watson</hi> a Priest, absurd in Humanity, and ignorant in Divinity. <hi>Brook,</hi> of whom I will speak nothing, Lord-Treasurer. The great Secretary
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96690:40"/>
must be <hi>Markbam, Oculus Patriae.</hi> A Hole must be found in my Lord Chief Justice's Coat. <hi>Grey</hi> must be Earl-Marshal, and Master of the Horse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would have a Table in the Court: marry, he would advance the Earl of <hi>Worcester</hi> to an higher Place. All this cannot be done without a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Therefore <hi>Watson</hi> the Priest tells a Resolute Man that the King was in danger of <hi>Puritans</hi> and <hi>Iesuites;</hi> so to bring him in blindfold into the Action, saying, that the King is no King till he be Crown'd; therefore every Man might right his own Wrongs: but he is <hi>Rex natus,</hi> His Dignity descends as well as yours, my Lords. Then <hi>Watson</hi> imposeth a <hi>blasphemous Oath,</hi> That they should swear to defend the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; to keep secret what was given them in charge, and seek all ways and means to advance the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Then they intend to send for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96690:40"/>
the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, in the King's Name, to the Tower, lest they should make any Resistance, and then to take Hostages of them; and to enjoyn them to provide for them Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and Munition. <hi>Grey,</hi> because the King removed before <hi>Midsommer,</hi> had a further reach, to get a company of Sword-men to assist the Action: Therefore he would stay till he had obtained a Regiment from <hi>Ostend,</hi> or <hi>Austria.</hi> So you see these Treasons were liste <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Foxes, which were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Tails, though their Heads were severed.</p>

                  <p>You Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I pray remember I am not charged with the Bye, being the Treason of the Priest.</p>

                  <speaker>Attorney.</speaker>
                  <p>You are not. My Lords, you shall observe three things in the Treasons: First, They had a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word (the King's safety) their Pretence
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96690:41"/>
was <hi>Bonum in se,</hi> their Intent was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in se.</hi> Secondly, They avouched Scripture; both the Priests had <hi>Scriptum est</hi>; perverting and ignorantly mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Scriptures. Thirdly, They avouched the Common Law, to prove that he was no King till he was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; alledging a Statute of <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13. This, by way of Imitation, hath been the course of all Traytors.</p>
                  <p>In the 20th of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2<hi>d, Isabella</hi> the Queen, and the Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> gave out, that the King's Person was not safe, for the good of the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop of <hi>Carlile</hi> did preach on this Text, <hi>My Head is grieved:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Head, the King; that when the Head began to be Negligent, the People might reform what is amiss.</p>
                  <p>In the 3<hi>d Hen.</hi> 4. Sir <hi>Roger Claringdon</hi> accompanied with two Priests, gave out, that <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96690:41"/>
Alive, when he was Dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> caused <hi>Mortimers</hi> Head to be cut off, for giving counsel to murther the King.</p>
                  <p>The 3. <hi>Hen</hi> 7. Sir <hi>Henry Stanly</hi> found the Crown in the Dust, and set it on the King's Head; when <hi>Fitzwater</hi> and <hi>Garret</hi> told him that <hi>Edward</hi> the 5<hi>th</hi> was alive, he said, <hi>If I be alive, I will assist him.</hi> But this cost him his Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edmond de la Pool,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> killed a Man in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> for which the King would have him hold up his hand at the Bar, and then Pardoned him. Yet he took such an Offence thereat, that he sent to the Noblemen, to help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Common-wealth; and then said, he would go to <hi>France,</hi> and get Power there. Sir <hi>Roger Compton</hi> knew all the Treason, and discovered <hi>Windon</hi> and others, that were Attainted.</p>
                  <p>He said there was another thing that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96690:42"/>
would be stood upon, namely, <hi>that they had but one Witness.</hi> Then he vouched one <hi>Appleyard</hi>'s Case, a Traytor in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> who said a Man must have two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers. <hi>Helms</hi> was the Man that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him; but Mr. <hi>Iust. Catlin</hi> said, that that that Statute was not in force at that day. His words were [<hi>Thrust her into the Ditch.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Then he went on speaking of Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, and made this difference: An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser is a speaker by Report, when a Witness is he that upon his Oath shall speak his knowledg of any Man.</p>
                  <p>A third sort of Evidence there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and this is held more forcible than either of the other two; and that is, when a Man by his Accusation of another, shall by the same Accusation also condemn himself, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self liable to the same Fault and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: this is more forcible than many Witnesses. So then so much by way
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96690:42"/>
of Imitation. Then he defined Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; there is Treason in the Heart, in the Hand, in the Mouth, in Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: comparing that in <hi>Corde</hi> to the Root of a Tree; in <hi>Ore,</hi> to the Bud; in <hi>Manu,</hi> to the Blossom; and that which is <hi>in Consummatione,</hi> to the Fruit.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to your Charge, you of the Jury. The greatness of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is to be considered in these two things, <hi>Determinatione finis,</hi> and <hi>Electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne mediorum.</hi> This Treason excelleth in both, for that it was to destroy the King and his Progeny. These Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are said to be <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis</hi>; this goeth further, and may be term'd <hi>Crimen exterpandae Regiae Majestatis, &amp; totius Progeniei suae.</hi> I shall not need, my Lords, to speak any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, nor of the Bounty and Sweetness of his Nature, whose Thoughts are Innocent, whose Words are full of Wisdom and Learning, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96690:43"/>
whose Works are full of Honour; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a true saying, <hi>Nunquam nimis quod nunquam satis.</hi> But to whom do you bear your Malice? to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>

                  <p>Oh Sir, do I? I will prove you the Notoriousest Traytor that ever came to the Bar. After you have taken away the King, you would alter Religion: as you, Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> have followed them of the Bye in Imitation; for I will charge you with the words.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Attourney</hi> is but yet in the General, but when the Kings Counsel have given the Evidence wholly, you shall Answer every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Cecil.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Attourney,</hi> when you have done with this General Charge,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96690:44"/>
do you not mean to let him answer to every Particular?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Attourney.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, when we deliver the Proofs to be read. <hi>Raleigh</hi> procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Cobham</hi> to go to <hi>Aremberg,</hi> which he did by his Instigation: <hi>Raleigh</hi> supped with <hi>Cobham</hi> before he went to <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>; after Supper, <hi>Raleigh</hi> conducted him to <hi>Durham</hi> House; from whence <hi>Cobham</hi> went with <hi>Lawrency,</hi> a Servant of <hi>Aremberg</hi>'s, unto him, and went in by a Back-way. <hi>Cobham</hi> could never be quiet until he had entertain'd this Motion, for he had four Letters from <hi>Raleigh. Aremberg</hi> answered, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney should be performed, but knew not to whom it should be distributed. Then <hi>Cobham</hi> &amp; <hi>Lawrency</hi> came back to <hi>Durham</hi> House, where they found <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh. Cobham</hi> and <hi>Raleigh</hi> went up, and left <hi>Lawrency</hi> below, where they had secret Conference in a Gallery, and after <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Lawrency</hi> departed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96690:44"/>
from <hi>Raleigh.</hi> Your <hi>Jargon</hi> was Peace! What is that? <hi>Spanish</hi> Invasion, <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Subversion. And again, you are not a fit Man to take so much Money for procuring of a Lawful Peace, for Peace procur'd by Money is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. Then <hi>Cobham</hi> must go to <hi>Spain,</hi> and return by <hi>Iersey,</hi> where you were Captain: And then because <hi>Cobham</hi> had not so much Policy, or at least Wickedness as you, he must have your advice for the distribution of the Money. Would you have deposed so good a King, lineally descended of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Eldest Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi>? why then must you set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? I think you meant to make <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabella</hi> a Titular Queen, of whose Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I will speak nothing, but sure you meant to make her a Stale: Ah good Lady! you could mean her no good.</p>

                  <p>By this Book you vvould persvvade Men that he is not the Lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King. Novv let us consider some Circumstances: My Lords, you know my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> (for vvhom vve all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96690:45"/>
Lament, and Rejoyce; Lament in that his House, which hath stood so long unspotted, is now Ruinated; Rejoyce, in that his Treasons are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd): he is neither Politician nor Sword-Man; <hi>Raleigh</hi> was both, united in the Cause with him, and therefore cause of his Destruction. Another Circumstance is the secret Contriving of it. <hi>Humphry Stafford</hi> claimed Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for Treason. <hi>Raleigh</hi> in his Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian Policy hath made a Sanctuary for Treason. He must talk with none but <hi>Cobham,</hi> because (saith he) one Witness can never condemn me. For <hi>Brook</hi> said unto Sir <hi>Griffith Markham, Take heed how you do make my Lord</hi> Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>acquainted; for whatsoever he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> Raleigh <hi>the Witch will get it out of him.</hi> As soon as <hi>Raleigh</hi> was examined on one Point of Treason concerning my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> he wrote to him thus; <hi>I have been examined of you, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96690:46"/>
confessed nothing.</hi> Further you sent to him by your trusty <hi>Francis Kemish,</hi> that one Witness could not condemn; and therefore bad his Lordship be of good Courage. Came this out of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Quiver? No: But out of <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Machivilian and Devilish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Yea, but <hi>Cobham</hi> did retract it; Why then did you urge it? Now then see the most horrible Practices that ever came out of the bottomless Pit of the Lowest Hell. After that <hi>Raleigh</hi> had Intelligence that <hi>Cobham</hi> had Accused him, he endeavoured to have Intelligence from <hi>Cobham,</hi> which he had gotten by young Sir <hi>Iohn Payton:</hi> But I think it was the Error of his Youth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>The Lords told it me, or else I had not been sent to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Attourney.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Cobham</hi> by the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> entred into these
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96690:46"/>
Actions: So that the Question will be, Whether you are not the principal Traitor, and he would nevertheless have entred into it? Why did <hi>Cobham</hi> retract all that same? First, because <hi>Raleigh</hi> was so Odious, he thought he should fare the worse for his sake. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he thought thus with himself, If he be free, I shall clear my self the better. After this <hi>Cobham</hi> asked for a <hi>Preacher</hi> to Confer with, pretending to have Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi>; but indeed he meant not to have him, but Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi>; a Worthy and Reverend <hi>Preacher,</hi> who can do more with the King (as he said) than any other; that he, seeing his constant Denial, might inform the King thereof. Here he plays with the <hi>Preacher.</hi> If <hi>Raleigh</hi> could perswade the Lords, that <hi>Cobham</hi> had no Intent to travel, then he thought all should be well. Here is Forgery. In the Tower <hi>Cobham</hi> must write to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96690:47"/>
Sir <hi>Thomas Vane,</hi> a worthy Man, that he meant not to go into <hi>Spain</hi>; which Lettter <hi>Raleigh</hi> devised in <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Name.</p>

                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I will wash my hands of the Indictment, and die a true Man to the King.</p>

                     <hi>The Lord</hi> Cobham's <hi>Examination Read.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>He confesseth he had a Passport to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> intending to go to the Arch-Duke to confer with him about these Practices; and because he knew the Arch-Duke had not Money to pay his own Army, from thence he meant to go to <hi>Spain,</hi> to deal with the King for the 600000 Crowns, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by <hi>Iersey,</hi> and that nothing should be done, until he had spoken with Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> for distribution of the Money, to them which were discontented in <hi>England.</hi> At the first beginning he breathed out Oaths and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96690:48"/>
Exclamations against <hi>Raleigh,</hi> calling him Villain and Traytor; saying he had never entred into these Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but by his Instigation, and that he would never let him alone.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here Mr. <hi>Attourney</hi> willed the Clerk of the Crown Office to read over these last words again (<q>

Further, he said, He was afraid of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> that when he should return by <hi>Iersey,</hi> that he would have him and the Money to the King. Being Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of Sir <hi>Arthur Gorge,</hi> he freed him, saying:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:96690:49"/>They never durst trust him, but Sir <hi>Arthur Savage</hi> they intended to use, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought him a fit Man.</p>

                  <p>Let me see the Accusation: This is absolutely all the Evidence can be brought against me; poor shifts! You Gentlemen of the Jury, I pray you understand this: This is that which must either condemn, or give me Life; which must free me, or send my Wife and Children to beg their Bread about the Streets. This is that must prove me a notorious Traytor, or a true Subject to the King. Let me see my Accusation, that I may make my Answer.</p>

                  <p>I did read it, and shew you all the Examinations.</p>

                  <p>At my first Examination at <hi>Windsor,</hi> my Lords asked me, what I knew of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Practice with <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>? I answered Negatively: And as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96690:49"/>
concerning <hi>Arabella,</hi> I protest before God, I never heard one word of it. If that be proved, let me be guilty of ten thousand Treasons. It is a strange thing you will impute that to me, when I never heard so much as the Name of <hi>Arabella Stuart,</hi> but only the Name of <hi>Arabella.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After being Examined, I told my Lords, that I thought my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had Conference with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected his Visiting of him: For after he departed from me at <hi>Durham</hi> House, I saw him pass by his own Stairs, and passed over to <hi>St. Mary Saviours,</hi> where I knew <hi>Lawrency,</hi> a Merchant, and a Follower of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> lay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore likely to go unto him. My Lord <hi>Cecil</hi> asked my Opinion concerning <hi>Lawrency</hi>; I said, that if you do not apprehend <hi>Lawrency,</hi> it is dangerous he will flie; if you do apprehend him, you shall give my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> notice
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96690:50"/>
thereof. I was asked likewise, who was the greatest Man with my Lord <hi>Cobham?</hi> I answered, I knew no Man so great with him, as young <hi>Wyat</hi> of <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Assoon as <hi>Cobham</hi> saw my Letter to have discovered his Dealing with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg,</hi> in his Fury he accused me, but before he came to the Stair-foot he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and said he had done me wrong. When he came to the end of his Accusation, he added, That if he had brought this Money to <hi>Jersey,</hi> he fear'd that I would have deliver'd him and the Money to the King. Mr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney,</hi> you said this never came out of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Quiver, he is a simple Man. Is he so simple? No: He hath a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his own, he will not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be guided by others, but when he has once taken Head in a Matter, he is not easily drawn from it; he is no Babe. But it is strange for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise

with <hi>Cobham,</hi> that he should go to <hi>Spain,</hi> to perswade the King to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse so much Money, he being a Man of no Love in <hi>England,</hi> and I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving resigned my room of chiefest Command, the Wardenship of the <hi>Stanneries</hi>: Is it not strange for me to make my self <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> or a <hi>Kett,</hi> or a <hi>Cade</hi>? I knowing <hi>England</hi> to be in better Estate to defend it self than ever it was. I knew <hi>Scotland</hi> United; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Quieted, wherein of late our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were dispersed; <hi>Denmark</hi> assured, which before was Suspected. I knew, that having a Lady whom Time had surprized, we had now an active King, a lawful Successor, who would himself be present in all his Affairs. The State of <hi>Spain</hi> was not unknown to me. I had written a Discourse, which I had intended to present unto the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Peace with <hi>Spain. I</hi> knew the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had six Repulses, three in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:96690:51"/>
and three at Sea, and once in 1588 at <hi>Cales,</hi> by my Lord Admiral. I knew he was Discouraged and Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. I knew the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be the proudest Prince in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but now he cometh Creeping to the King my Master for Peace. I knew whereas before he had in his Port six or seven score Sail of Ships, he hath now but Six or Seven. I knew of Twenty five Millions he had from his <hi>Indies,</hi> he hath scarce one left. I knew him to be so Poor, that the Jesuites in <hi>Spain,</hi> who were wont to have such large Allowance, were fain to beg at the Church-Door. Was it ever read or heard, that any Prince should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse so much Money without a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pawn? I knew her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> would not lend her Majesty Money without Lands in Mortgage. I knevv the Queen did not lend the States Money
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96690:51"/>
without <hi>Flushing, Brill,</hi> and other Towns for a Pawn. And can it be thought, that he vvould let <hi>Cobham</hi> have so great a Sum?</p>
                  <p>I never came to the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s but about matters of his Profit, as the Ordering of his House, Paying of his Servants Board-vvages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I had of his vvhen I vvas examined, Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds vvorth of Jewels for a Purchase; a Pearl of three thousand Pound, and a Ring vvorth five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound: If he had had a fancy to run avvay, he vvould not have left so much to have purchased a Lease in Fee Farm. I savv him buy three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds vvorth of Books to send to his Library at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of thirty Pound to give to Mr. <hi>Attourney,</hi> for dravving the Conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and God in Heaven knovveth, not I, vvhether he intended to travel or no. But for that Practice vvith <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:96690:52"/>
or Letters to <hi>Aremberg</hi> framed, or any Discourse vvith him, or in vvhat Language he spake unto him; if I knevv any of these things, I vvould absolutely confess the Indictment, and acknovvledge my self vvorthy ten thousand Deaths.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> being required to Subscribe to an Examination, there vvas shevved a Note under Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s hand, the vvhich vvhen he had perused, he paused, and after brake forth into these Speeches; Oh Villain! Oh Traytor! I will now tell you all the Truth: And then said, His purpose vvas to go into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and into <hi>Spain,</hi> for the obtaining the aforesaid Money, and that <hi>Raleigh</hi> had appointed to meet him in <hi>Iersey</hi> as he returned Home, to be advised of

him about the Distribution of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>When <hi>Cobham</hi> answer'd to the Interrogatories, he made scruple to subscribe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing urged to it, he said, If he might hear me affirm, that a Person of his Degree ought to set his Hand, he would; I lying then at <hi>Richmond,</hi> for fear of the Plague, was sent for; and I told he ought to subscribe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it were a Contempt of a high Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Then he subscribed. The Lords questioned with him further, and he shewed them a Letter, as I thought written to me, but it was indeed written to my Lord <hi>Cecil</hi>: He desired to see the Letter again, and then said, Oh Wretch! Oh Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! Whereby I perceived you had not performed that Trust he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in you.</p>

as lives, for he hath not spared the best Friends he hath in <hi>England</hi> in his Passion. My Lords, I take it, he that has been examined, has ever been asked at the time of his Examination, if it be according to his meaning, and then to subscribe. Methinks, my Lords, when he accuses a Man, he should give some Account and Reason of it; it is not sufficient to say, we talked of it. If I had been the Plotter, would not I have given <hi>Cobham</hi> some Arguments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to perswade the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and answer his Objections.

                  <speaker>Lord Cecil.</speaker>
                  <p>I am in great Dispute
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96690:53"/>
with my self to speak in the Case of this Gentleman: A former Dearness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and him tied so firm a Knot of my Conceit of his Virtues, now broken by a Discovery of his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. I protest, did I serve a King that I knew would be displeased with me for speaking, in this Case I would speak whatever came of it: But seeing he is compacted of Piety and Justice, and one that will not mislike of any Man for speaking a Truth, I will answer your Question.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> was staid by me at <hi>Windsor,</hi> upon the first News of <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> that the Kings Person should be surprised by my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Brook</hi>; when I found <hi>Brook</hi> was in, I suspected <hi>Cobham,</hi> then I doubted <hi>Raleigh</hi> to be a partaker. I speak not this, that it should be thought I had greater Judgment than the rest of my Lords, in making this haste to have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96690:54"/>
them examined. <hi>Raleigh</hi> following to <hi>Windsor,</hi> I met with him upon the <hi>Tarras,</hi> and willed him, as from the King to stay, saying, The Lords had something to say to him: Then he was examined, but not concerning my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> but of the Surprising Treason. My Lord <hi>Grey</hi> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and likewise <hi>Brook</hi>; by <hi>Brook</hi> we found, that he had given notice to <hi>Cobham</hi> of the surprising Treason, as he delivered it to us, but with as much sparingness of a Brother as he might: We sent for my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> where he stood upon his Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and his Quality; sometimes being froward, he said he was not bound to subscribe, wherewith we made the King acquainted. <hi>Cobham</hi> said, if my Lord Chief Justice would say it were a Contempt, he would subscribe; whereof being resolved, he subscribed. There was a Light given
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96690:54"/>
to <hi>Aremberg,</hi> that <hi>Lawrency</hi> was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but that <hi>Raleigh</hi> knew that <hi>Cobham</hi> was examined, is more than I know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>If my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had trusted me in the Main, was not I as fit a Man to be trusted in the Bye?</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Cecil.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Raleigh</hi> did by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters acquaint us, that my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had sent <hi>Lawrency</hi> to <hi>Aremberg,</hi> when he knew not he had any Dealings with him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord H. How.</speaker>
                  <p>It made for you, if <hi>Lawrency</hi> had been only acquainted with <hi>Cobham,</hi> and not with you. But you knew his whole Estate, and were acquainted with <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Practice with <hi>Lawrency,</hi> and it was known to you before, that <hi>Lawrency</hi> depended on <hi>Aremberg.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Raleigh</hi> protested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the surprising Treason. 2. That he knew not of the Matter touching
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96690:55"/>
                     <hi>Arabella.</hi> I would not charge you, Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> with a matter of Falshood: You say, you suspected the Intelligence that <hi>Cobham</hi> had with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> by <hi>Lawrency.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought it had been no other Intelligence, but such as might be vvarranted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Attourney.</speaker>
                  <p>Then it was but lawful Suspicion. But to that whereas you said, that <hi>Cobham</hi> had accused you in Passion, I answer three Ways: 1. I observed vvhen <hi>Cobham</hi> said, Let me see the Letter again? he paused, and vvhen he did see that Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> vvas touched, he cried out, Oh Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! Oh Villain! Now vvill I confess the vvhole Truth. 2. The Accusation of a Man on Hear-say, is nothing: Would he accuse himself on Passion, and ruinate his Cause and Posterity, out of Malice to accuse you? 3. Could this be out of Passion? Mark the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96690:55"/>
of it: <hi>Cobh.</hi> had told this at least two months before to his Brother <hi>Brook, You are Fools, you are on the Bye,</hi> Raleigh <hi>and I are on the Main, we mean to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the King and his Cubs;</hi> this he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered two months before. So mark the manner and the matter, he vvould not turn the Weapon against his ovvn Bosom, and accuse himself to accuse you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>Hath <hi>Cobham</hi> confessed that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Chief Iustice.</speaker>
                  <p>This is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Mr. <hi>Attourney,</hi> to prove that <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Speech came not out of Passion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>Let it be proved that <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> said so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Attourney.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cobham</hi> saith, He vvas a long time doubtful of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> that he vvould send him and the money to the King. Did <hi>Cobham</hi> fear lest you vvould betray him in <hi>Iersey</hi>? Then of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96690:56"/>
necessity there must be Trust betvveen you. No man can betray a man but he that is trusted, in my understanding. This is the greatest Argument to prove that he vvas acquainted vvith <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Proceedings. <hi>Raleigh</hi> has a deeper reach than to make himself, as he said, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin Hood,</hi> a <hi>Kett,</hi> or <hi>Cade,</hi> yet I never heard that <hi>Robin Hood</hi> vvas a Traytor; they say he vvas an Outlavv. And vvhereas he saith, that our King is not only more Wealthy and Potent than his Predecessors; but also more Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Wise, so that he could have no hope to prevail. I ansvver, There is no King so Potent, Wise and Active but he may be overtaken through Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Whereas you say <hi>Spain</hi> is so Poor, discoursing so largely thereof: it had been better for you to have kept in <hi>Guiana,</hi> than to have been so well acquainted with the State of <hi>Spain.</hi> Besides, if you could have brought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96690:56"/>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to have joyned, you might have hoped to prevail a great deal the better. For his six Overthrows, I answer; He hath the more Malice, because Repulses breed desire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Then you say, you never talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Cobham</hi> but about Leases, and letting Lands, and ordering his House; I never knew you Clerk of the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you had fallen on your Knees at first, and confessed the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it had been better for you. You say, he meant to have given me a Cabinet of thirty Pound, perhaps he thought by those means to have anticipated me therewith. But you say, all these are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. I answer, all this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in Circumstance is true: Here now I might appeal to my Lords, that you take hold of this, that he subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed not to the Accusation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord H. How.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cobham</hi> was not then pressed to subscribe.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>His Accusation being testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Lords, is of as great force, as if he had subscribed. <hi>Raleigh</hi> saith again, if the Accuser be alive, he must be brought face to face to speak, and alledges 25<hi>th Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> That there must be two sufficient Witnesses that must be brought face to face before the Accused, and alledgeth 10. and 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Evertere hominem justum in Causa sua injustum est</hi>: Good my Lords, let it be proved either by the Laws of the Land, or the Laws of God, that there ought not to be two Witnesses appointed; yet I will not stand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this Point in Law, if the King
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96690:57"/>
will have it so: it is no rare thing for a Man to be falsly accused. A Judg condemned a Woman in <hi>Sarum</hi> for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her Husband, on the Testimony of one Witness; afterwards his Man confessed the Murder, when she was executed. Who after being touched in Conscience for the Judgment, was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to say, <hi>Quod nunquam de hoc facto ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam in vita sua purgaret.</hi> It is also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Scripture, <hi>Allocutus est Iehova Mosen, In Ore duorum aut trium Testium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If Christ requireth it, as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Matth</hi> 18. If by the Canon, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, and God's Word, it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that there must be two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses at the least, bear with me if I desire one.</p>
                  <p>I would not desire to live, if I were privy to <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Proceedings: I had been a Slave, a Villain, a Fool, if I had endeavoured to set up <hi>Arabella,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:96690:58"/>
and refused so Gracious a Lord and Sovereign: But urge your Proofs.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Chief Iustice.</speaker>
                  <p>You have offered Questions on divers Statutes, all which mention two Accusers in case of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments; you have deceived your self, for the Laws of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. are repeal'd. It sufficeth now if there be Proofs made either under Hand, or by Testimony of Witnesses, or by Oaths; it needs not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Party, so there be Hands of credible Men to testifie the Examination.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be an Error in me, and if those Laws be repeal'd, yet I hope the Equity of them remains still; but if you affirm it, it must be a Law to Posterity. The Proof of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law is by Witness and Jury, let <hi>Cobham</hi> be here, let him speak it: Call my Accuser before my Face, and I have done.</p>

                  <p>It is not possible it was of Passion; for it was in talk before three Men being severally examined, who agreed in the Sum to be bestowed on discontented Persons. That <hi>Grey</hi> should have 12000 Crowns, and <hi>Raleigh</hi> should have 8000, or 10000 Crowns.</p>

For he told me, if I would agree to further the Peace, he would get me 8000 Crowns. I asked him, Who shall have the rest of the Money? He said, I will offer such a Noble-Man (who was not named) some of the Money. I said, he will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by you, and he will extreamly hate you for such a Motion. Let me be pinched to Death with hot Irons, if ever I knew there was any Intention to bestow the Money on discontented Persons. I had made a Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Peace, and would have printed it: If <hi>Cobham</hi> changed his mind; if the Priests, if <hi>Brook</hi> had any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, what is that to me?

If you grant me not this Favour, I am strangely used. <hi>Campian</hi> was not denied to have his Accusers face to face.</p>

                  <p>For the Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> I said she was never acquainted with the matter. Now that <hi>Raleigh</hi> had Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96690:73"/>
in all these Treasons, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; The Jury hath heard the matter.

                  <p>If <hi>Cobham</hi> did practice with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> how could it not but be known in <hi>Spain?</hi> Why did they name the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with <hi>Jack Straw</hi>'s Treason, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> with <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> but that it was to countenance his Treason?</p>
                  <p>Consider you Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is no Cause so doubtful, which the Kings Counsel cannot make good against the Law. Consider my Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and their Ability: They prove nothing against me, only they bring the Accusation of my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> which he hath lamented and repented as heartily, as if it had been for an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Murther: for he knew that all this Sorrow which should come to me, is by his means. Presumptions must proceed from precedent or subsequent
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96690:74"/>
Facts. I have spent 40000 Crowns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> I had not purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed 40 Pound a Year. If I had died in <hi>Guiana,</hi> I had not left 300 Marks a Year to my Wife and Son.

                  <p>I hope to make this so clear, as that the Wit of Man shall have no Colour to answer it. The Matter is Treason in the highest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the end to deprive the King of his Crown. The particular Treasons are these: First, To raise up Rebellion,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96690:75"/>
and, to effect that, to procure Money; to raise up Tumults in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging a Treasonable Book against the Kings Right to the Crown; the Purpose, to take away the Life of his Majesty and his Issue. My Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> confesseth Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to be guilty of all these Treasons. The Question is, Whether he be guilty as joyning with him, or instigating of him? The Course to prove this was by my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Accusation. If that be true, he is guilty; if not, he is clear. So whether <hi>Cobham</hi> say true, or <hi>Raleigh</hi>? That is the Question. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> hath no Answer, but the Shadow of as much Wit, as the Wit of Man can devise. He useth his bare Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; the Denial of a Defendant must not move the Jury. In the Star-Chamber, or in the Chancery, for matter of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if the Defendant be called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, his Denial on his Oath is no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96690:75"/>
to the Court to clear him, he doth it in <hi>propria causa</hi>; therefore much less in Matters of Treason. <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Testification against him before then, and since, hath been largely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>If Truth be constant, and Constancy be in Truth, why hath he forsworn that that he hath said? You have not proved any one thing against me by direct Proofs, but all by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>

                  <speaker>Attourney.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I will now make it appear to the World, that there never lived a viler Viper upon the face of the Earth than thou, and therewithal he drew a Letter out of his Pocket, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further, My Lords, you shall see, this is an Agent that hath writ a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and hath ever so detested him; this is he that hath spent so much Money against him in Service; and yet you shall all see whether his Heart be not wholly <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</hi> The Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who of his own nature was a good and honourable Gentleman, till overtaken by this Wretch, now finding his Conscience heavily burthened with some Courses which the Subtilty of this Traytor had drawn him into, my Lords, he could be at no rest with himself, nor quiet in his thoughts, until he was eased of that heavy weight; out of which Passion of his Mind, and Discharge of his Duty
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96690:77"/>
to his Prince, and his Conscience to God; taking it upon his Salvation that he wrote nothing but the Truth, with his own hands he wrote this Letter. Now Sir you shall see whether you had Intelligence with <hi>Cobham,</hi> within four days before he came to the Tower. If he be wholly <hi>Spanish,</hi> that desired a Pension of 1500 Pound a Year from <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Spain</hi> by him might have Intelligence, then <hi>Raleigh</hi> is a Traytor. He hath taken an Apple, and pinned a Letter unto it, and threw it into my Lord <hi>Cobham's</hi> Window; the Contents whereof were this, <hi>It is doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we shall be proceeded with or no, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you shall not be tried.</hi> This was to get a Retractation. Oh! it was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apple, whereby the Devil did deceive him. Further, he wrote thus, <hi>Do not as my Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>did; take heed of a Preacher; for by his Perswasion he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and made himself guilty.</hi> I doubt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96690:78"/>
not but this day God shall have as great a Conquest by this Traytor, and the Son of God shall be as much glorified, as when it was said, <hi>Vicisti Galilaee</hi>; you know my meaning. What though <hi>Cobham</hi> retracted, yet he could not rest nor sleep till he confirmed it again. If this be not enough to prove him a Traytor, the King my Master shall not live three years to an end.</p>
                  <p>Nota. <hi>Here Mr.</hi> Attourney <hi>produced the Lord</hi> Cobham's <hi>Letter, and as he read it, inserted some speeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I have thought fit to set down this to my Lords, wherein I protest on my Soul to write nothing but the truth. I am now come near the period of my time, therefore I confess the whole Truth before God, and his Angels. <hi>Raleigh,</hi> four days before I came from the <hi>Tower</hi> caused an Apple (<hi>Eves Apple</hi>) to be thrown in at my Chamber-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; the effect of it was to intreat
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96690:78"/>
me to right the wrong that I had done him, in saying, <hi>that I should have come home by Iersey</hi>; which under my hand to him I have retracted. His first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I answered not, which was thrown in the same manner, wherein he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to write him a Letter, which I did. He sent me word that the Judges met at Mr. <hi>Attourneys</hi> House, and that there was good hope the Proceedings against us should be stayed; He sent me another time a little <hi>Tobacco.</hi> At <hi>Aremberg</hi>'s coming <hi>Raleigh</hi> was to have procured a Pension of fifteen hundred Pounds a Year; for which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that no Action should be against <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> or the <hi>Indies,</hi> but he would give knowledg before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. He told me the States had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with the King. (<hi>Attourney. Ah! is not this a</hi> Spanish <hi>Heart in an</hi> English <hi>Body?</hi>) He hath been the Original Cause of my Ruine; for I had no
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96690:79"/>
dealing with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> but by his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. He hath also been the cause of my Discontentment; he advised me, not to be overtaken with Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as <hi>Essex</hi> was; and that the King would better allow of a constant Denial, than to accuse any.</q>

I was accused to be a Practiser with <hi>Spain.</hi> I never knew that my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> meant to go thither; I will ask no mercy at the Kings hands if he will affirm it. 2.

                  <p>In my Conscience I am perswaded that <hi>Cobham</hi> hath accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you truly.

                  <speaker>Raleigh.</speaker>
                  <p>I submit my self to the King's Mercy; I know his Mercy is

greater than my Offence. I recommend my Wife, and Son of tender years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brought up, to his Compassion.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Chief Iustice.</speaker>
                  <p>I had thought I should never have seen this Day, to have stood in this place to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death against you; because I thought it impossible, that one of so great Parts should have fallen so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously. God hath bestowed on you many Benefits. You had been a Man fit and able to have served the King in good Place. You had brought your self into a good State of Living, if you had entred into a good Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Estate, and not suffered your own Wit to have intrapped your self, you might have lived in good comfort. It is best for Man not to seek to climb too high, lest he fall; nor yet to creep too low, lest he be trodden on. It was the Posie of the wisest and greatest Counsellor of our time in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96690:82"/>
In medio spatio mediocria firma locantur.</hi> You might have lived well with 3000 Pound a Year, for so I have heard your Revenues to be. I know nothing might move you to be discontented; but if you had been down, you know Fortunes Wheel, when it is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, riseth again. I never heard that the King took away any thing from you, but the Captainship of the Guard, which he did with very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to have one of his own knowledg, whom he might trust, in that Place. You have been taken for a wise Man, and so have shewed Wit enough this Day. Again, for Monopolies for Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the King had said, it is a Matter that offends my People, should I burthen them for your private Good? I think you could not well take it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his Subjects were eased, though by your private hindrance. Two Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have lodged chiefly in you; one is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96690:83"/>
an eager Ambition, the other corrupt Covetousness. Ambition, in desiring to be advanced to equal Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as you have been before-time; that Grace you had then you got not in a Day or Year. For your Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I am sorry to hear that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of your Wealth should become a base Spie for the Enemy, which is the vilest of all other; wherein on my Conscience <hi>Cobham</hi> hath said true: by it you would have increased your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 1500 Pound a Year. This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness is like a Canker, that eats the Iron Place where it lives. Your Case being thus, let it not grieve you, if I speak a little out of zeal, and love to your good. You have been taxed by the World, with the Defence of the most Heathenish and Blasphemous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which I list not to repeat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christian Ears cannot endure to hear them, nor the Authors and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96690:83"/>
of them suffered to live in any Christian Common-wealth. You know what Men said of <hi>Harpool.</hi> You shall do well before you go out of the World to give satisfaction therein, and not to die with these Imputations on you. Let not any Devil perswade you to think there is no Eternity in Heaven: for if you think thus, you shall find Eternity in Hell-Fire. In the first Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his manner of speaking; I protest before the Living God, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he spoke nothing but the Truth. You wrote, that he should not in any case confess any thing to a Preacher, telling him an Example of my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> that noble Earl that is gone; who if he had not been carried away with others, had lived in Honour to this Day among us. He confessed his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and obtained Mercy of the Lord, for I am verily perswaded in my
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96690:84"/>
Heart, he died a worthy Servant of God. Your Conceit of not confessing any thing is very inhumane and wicked. In this World is the time of Confessing, that we may be absolved at the Day of Judgment. You have shewed a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sign of denying God, in advising a Man not to confess the Truth. It now comes in my mind, why you may not have your Accuser come face to face: for such an one is easily brought to retract, when he seeth there is no hope of his own Life. It is dangerous that any Traytors should have any Access to, or Conference with one another; when they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves must die, they will think it best to have their Fellow live, that he may commit the like Treason again, and so in some sort seek Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Now it resteth to pronounce the Judgment, which I wish you had not been this day to have received of me:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96690:84"/>
For if the Fear of God in you had been answerable to your other great Parts, you might have lived to have been a singular good Subject. I never saw the like Trial, and hope I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see the like again.</p>

            <head>Here follows the Continuation of the Life.</head>
            <p>IT was observed, that before the Lords (principally to my Lord <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>) at <hi>Winchester</hi> (for there he was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Sickness then reigning in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) he was humble, but not prostrate; dutiful, but not deject: For in some cases he would humbly thank them for gracious Speeches; in other acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that their Honours said true, as in relating some Circumstances. And in such points wherein he would not yield unto them, he would crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and with reverence urge them, and answer them as in points of Law, or essential matters of Fact. To the Jury he was affable, but not fawning; hoping, but not trusting in them;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96690:86"/>
carefully perswading them with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not distemperately importuning them with Conjuration; rather shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love of Life, than fear of Death. What made ill for Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was his Discovery of <hi>Lawrency</hi> and <hi>Cobham</hi>'s frequent private Conferences; which so incensed <hi>Cobham,</hi> that he positively accused him: though the single Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one already convicted of what Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was but yet impeached, could only make a Circumstance, and not convict him. The Judges and the King's Counsel did vvhat they could to bawl him out of his Life; and since they vvanted Proof, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to tire him out. If we may believe <hi>Osborn,</hi> several of the Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, after he was cast, vvere so far touch'd in Conscience as to ask of him pardon on their knees.</p>
            <p>A further Confirmation of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency may be a Passage of his ovvn in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96690:86"/>
a Letter to Secretary <hi>Winwood,</hi> wherein he tells him, <q>That the worthy Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was extream curious in searching out the nature of his Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Queens Majesty had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her self from the beginning. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> at both times of his being here, was throughly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of his Innocency; they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise never have moved his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on his behalf. The Wife, the Brother, and the Son of a King do not use to sue for Men suspect.</q>
Nay, further yet, the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves declar'd in favour of him, if we may believe him in another Letter of his to Sir <hi>Robert Car,</hi> after Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> wherein are these words: <q>I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been bound to your Nation, as well for many other Graces, as for the true Report of my Trial to the King's Majesty, against whom had I been malignant, the hearing of my
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96690:87"/>
Cause could not have changed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into Friends, Malice into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and the Minds of the greatest number then present into Commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mine Estate: It is not the nature of foul Treason to beget such fair Passions; neither could it agree with the duty and love of faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (especially of your Nation) to bewail his Overthrow that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against their most natural and liberal Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two days after <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Tryal, were sentenced <hi>Brook,</hi> who pretended his intention was only to try faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and said he had a Commission for so doing, but produc'd it not; <hi>Markham,</hi> who confest the Indictment, pleaded Discontent, and desired Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>Watson,</hi> who confest he drew them all in, holding the King to be no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign till he were crown'd, instancing in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam</hi>; And <hi>Clark,</hi> who
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96690:87"/>
said the like. <hi>Parham</hi> and <hi>Brooksby</hi> were acquitted by the Jury. <hi>Watson, Clark,</hi> and <hi>Brook</hi> were executed; <hi>Markham, Cobham,</hi> and <hi>Grey</hi> brought severally on the Scaffold to dye, and at the instant on the Block, had their particular Executions remitted, by a Letter to the Sheriff under the King's own Hand, without the knowledge of any, save Mr. <hi>Gibbs,</hi> Gentleman of the Bedchamber, that brought it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an evil Fate did attend these Men; <hi>Grey</hi> died in the Tower, the last of his Line; the rest were discharg'd but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miserably poor: <hi>Markham</hi> and some others abroad; but <hi>Cobham</hi> (as <hi>Osborn</hi> tells us) in a Room ascended by a Ladder, at a poor Womans house in in the <hi>Minories</hi> (formerly his Landress) died rather of hunger than a natural disease.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was left to his Majesties Mercy, who thought him too great a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96690:88"/>
Male-content to have his Freedom, and probably too Innocent to lose his Life. Therefore in the Tower he is confin'd, but permitted to enjoy <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Custodia</hi>; where he improv'd his Imprisonment to the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Learning and Inquisitive Men. Since his Majesty had civilly buried him, and as it were banish'd him this World, he thought it no Treason to disturb the Ashes of former times, and bring to view the Actions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Heroes. And certainly none was so fit to comment on their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, and so able to raise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maxims from them, as he who had been brought up in so wise a Court as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, and read so many wise Men. After some time past there, he was delivered of that great <hi>Minerva,</hi> the <hi>History of the World</hi>; a Book which for the Exactness of its Chronology, Curiousness of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96690:88"/>
and Learning of all Sorts, seems to be the Work of an Age. An Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which never yet met with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor, and was the Envy, if some Authors may be credited, of King <hi>James</hi> himself, who thought none could out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do him at the Pen. That a Man who had been the greatest part of his life ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in Action, should write so judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, so critically of Times and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is as great a Wonder as the Book it self. It still remains a Dispute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Age he lived in was more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to his Pen or his Sword, the one being busie in conquering the <hi>New,</hi> the other in so bravely describing the <hi>Old</hi> World. An History wherein the only fault, or defect rather, is, that it wanteth one half thereof; which was occasioned, as our Story tells us, thus: Some few days before he fuffered, he sent for Mr. <hi>Walter Burr,</hi> who formerly printed his first Volumn of the History
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96690:89"/>
of the World, whom taking by the Hand, after some other Discourse, he ask'd how it had sold? Mr. <hi>Burr</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this Answer, <hi>It sold so slowly that it had undone him.</hi> At which words of his Sir <hi>Walter</hi> stepping to his Desk, reaches his other unprinted Part of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he had brought down to the Times he lived in, and clapping his hand upon his breast, said with a sigh, <hi>Ah, my Friend, hath the first Part undone thee? the second Part shall undo no more; this ungrateful World is unworthy of it</hi>: and immediately going to the Fire-side, threw it in, and set his foot upon it till it was consumed. As great a loss to Learning as Christendom could have sustained; the greater, because it could be repaired by no hand but his. It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happening to Authors, as to great Masters in Painting, their Pieces are not valued till they are dead, and the succeeding Age find the Originals ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable.</p>

However Sir <hi>Walter</hi> outlived his Enemies designs and hatred, and for all his kindnesses bestowed upon him the following Epitaph, which I am upon very good grounds assured to be his. King <hi>James</hi> was so much taken with the smartness of it, that he hoped the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would die before him. The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are these:

For whereas for the first, all those that navigate between <hi>Cape de Verd,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> do pass between Fifteen or Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days at most, we found the Wind so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and (which are also contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) so many Storms and Rains, as we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96690:101"/>
spent six Weeks in the Passage; by reason whereof, and that in so great Heat, we wanted Water. For at the Isle <hi>Prano</hi> of <hi>Cape de Verd,</hi> we lost our Anchors and Cables, and our Water-Casks; and being driven from the Isle with a <hi>Hurricane,</hi> we were like all to have perished. Great sickness fell amongst us, and carried away great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our ablest Men, both for Sea and Land. The <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> we had sight of <hi>Guiana,</hi> and soon after came to Anchor in five Degrees of the River <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi>; here we staid till the fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> landed our Sick-men, set up our Barges and Shallops, which were brought out of <hi>England</hi> in Quarters, washed our Ships, and took in Fresh-water, being fed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by the <hi>Indians</hi> of my old Acquaintance, with a great deal of Love and Respect. My self being in the hands of Death this six Weeks, and not able otherwise to move, than as I was carried in a Chair, gave order to five small Ships to sail into <hi>Orinoque,</hi> having
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96690:102"/>
Captain <hi>Kemish</hi> for their Conductor towards the Mines: And in those five Ships, five Companies of fifty, under the Command of Captain <hi>Parker,</hi> Captain <hi>North,</hi> Brethren to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> and the Lord <hi>North,</hi> valiant Gentlemen, and of infinite Patience, for the Labour, Hunger, and Heat which they have endured: My Son had the third Company; Capt. <hi>Thornix</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> the fourth Company; Capt. <hi>Chidley,</hi> by his Lieutenant, the fifth. But as my Serjeant Major, Capt. <hi>Piggot,</hi> died in the former mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Passage; so my Lieutenant, Sir <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Saint Leiger,</hi> lay sick without hope of Life, and the Charge conferred on my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, <hi>George Raleigh,</hi> who had also served long with infinite Commendations; but by reason of my absence, and of Sir <hi>Warham's,</hi> was not so well obeyed as the Enterprise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. As they passed up the River, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> began the War, and shot at us, both with their Ordnance and Muskets; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Companies were forced to charge

them, and soon after beat them out of the Town. In the Assault my Son (more desirous of Honour than Safety) was slain; with whom, to say truth, all the respects of this World have taken end in me; and although these five Captains had as weak Companies as ever followed valiant Leaders, yet were there among them some twenty or thirty valiant adventurous Gentlemen, and of singular Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; as of my Sons Company, Mr. <hi>Knivet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Pleasington</hi>; his Officers, Sir <hi>John Hambden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Simon Leak,</hi> Corporal of the Field, Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the elder Brother, Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tresham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mollinax,</hi> Mr. <hi>Winter,</hi> and his Brother, Mr. <hi>Wray,</hi> Mr. <hi>Miles Herbert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Captain <hi>Hall,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I have set down the Names of these Gentlemen, to the end that if his Majesty shall have cause to use their Service, it may
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96690:103"/>
please you to take notice of them for very sufficient Gentlemen. The other five Ships staid at <hi>Trinidado,</hi> having no other Port capable of them near <hi>Guiana.</hi> The second Ship was commanded by my Vice-Admiral Capt. <hi>John Pennington,</hi> of whom (to do him right) he is one of the sufficientest Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the Sea that <hi>England</hi> hath. The third by Sir <hi>Warham Saint-Legier,</hi> an exceeding valiant and worthy Gentleman. The fourth by Sir <hi>John Fern.</hi> The fifth by <hi>Capt. Chidley</hi> of <hi>Devon.</hi> With these five Ships I daily attended their Armada of <hi>Spain,</hi> which had they set upon us, our Force divided, the one half in <hi>Orinoque 150</hi> miles from us, we had not only been torn in pieces, but all those in the River had also perished, being of no force at all for Sea-fight. But we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be burnt by their sides, had the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada arrived: But belike they staid for us at <hi>Margaret,</hi> by which they knew we must pass to the <hi>Indies.</hi> For it pleased his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to value us at so little, as to command
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96690:103"/>
me upon my Allegiance, to set down under my hand the Country, and River by which I was to enter it; to set down the Number of my Men, and Burthen of my Ships, and what Ordnance every Ship carried: which being known to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador, and by him unto the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a dispatch was made, and Letters sent from <hi>Madrid,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my departure out of the <hi>Thames.</hi> For his first Letter, sent by a Barque of Advice, was dated the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>March, 1617.</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which Letter I have here inclosed sent to your Honour; the rest I reserve, not knowing whether they may be intercepted or not. The second by the King, dated the second of <hi>May,</hi> sent also by a Colonel of <hi>Diego de Polonioque,</hi> Governour of <hi>Guiana, Elde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo,</hi> and <hi>Trinidado.</hi> The third by the Bishop of <hi>Perericho,</hi> and delivered to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonioque,</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> at <hi>Trinida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> And the fourth was sent from the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Secretary of his Customs in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> At the same time by that of the Kings
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96690:104"/>
Hand sent by the Bishop, there was also a Commission for the speedy Levying of <hi>300</hi> Souldiers, and ten Pieces of Ordnance, to be sent from <hi>Portriche,</hi> for the Defence of <hi>Guiana.</hi> One <hi>150</hi> from <hi>Nueno Remo de Grando,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>Anthony Musica</hi>; and the other <hi>150</hi> from <hi>Portricho,</hi> to be conducted by Captain <hi>Francis Landio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Sir, if all that have traded to the <hi>Indies</hi> since his Majesties time, knew that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have flayed alive all the poor Men which they have taken, being but Merchant Men, what Death and cruel Torment shall we expect, if they conquer us? Certainly, they have hitherto failed grosly, being set out thence as we were, both for Number, Time, and Place.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, To make an <hi>Apology</hi> for not working the Mine (though I know his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty expected it, whom I am to satisfie as much as my self) having lost my Son and my Estate in the Enterprize; yet it is true, that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96690:104"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took more care to defend the Passage leading unto it, than they did the Town, which by the King's Instructions they might easily do, the Countries being <hi>Aspera &amp; Nemorosa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is true, that when Capt. <hi>Kemish</hi> found the River low, and that he could not approach the Banks in most places near the Mine by a mile, and where he found a descent, a volley of Musquet shot came from the Woods upon the Boat, and slew two Rowers, hurt six others, and shot a valiant Gentleman of Capt. <hi>Thornix,</hi> of which Wound he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth to this day. He, to wit, Capt. <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,</hi> following his own Advice, thought it was in vain to discover the Mine; and he gave me this for an Excuse at his return, That the Companies of <hi>English</hi> in the Town of St. <hi>Thoma</hi> were not able to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the daily and nightly Assaults of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; That the Passages to the Mines were thick and unpassable Woods; and that the Mine being discovered, they had no Men to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96690:105"/>
work it, did not discover it at all. For it is true, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having two Gold Mines near the Town, the one possessed by <hi>Pedro Rodrigo de Paran,</hi> the second by <hi>Harmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Frotinio,</hi> the third of Silver by <hi>Capt. Francisco,</hi> are useless for want of Negroes to work them: For as the <hi>Indians</hi> cannot be constrained, by a Law of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> so the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not, nor can endure the labour of those Mines, whatsoever the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadocio</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador saith. I shall prove under the Proprietors hands, by the Custom-Book, and the King's <hi>Quinto,</hi> of which I recovered an Ingot or two: I shall also make it appear to any Prince, or State, that will undertake it, how easily those Mines, and five or six more of them, may be possessed, and the most of them in those Parts, which have never as yet been attempted by any, nor by any Passage to them, nor ever disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the <hi>English, French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch.</hi> But at <hi>Kemish's</hi> return from <hi>Orinoque,</hi> when I rejected his counsel and his course, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96690:105"/>
told him he had undone me, and wounded my Credit with the King past recovery, he slew himself: For I told him, seeing my Son was slain, I cared not if I had lost <hi>100</hi> more in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Mine, so my Credit had been saved. For I protest before God, had not Captain <hi>Whitney</hi> (to whom I gave more countenance than to all the Captains of my Fleet) run from me at the <hi>Granadoes,</hi> and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Ship with him of Captain <hi>Woola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stons,</hi> I would have left my Body at St. <hi>Thome,</hi> by my Sons, or have brought with me out of that or other Mines, so much Gold Oar as should have satisfied the King. I propounded no vain thing, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me I know not. I am unpardoned in <hi>England,</hi> and my poor Estate consumed, and whether any Prince will give me Bread or no, I know not. I would desire your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to hold me in your good Opinion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Service to my Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to take some pity on my poor Wife, to whom I dare not write for renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96690:106"/>
her sorrow for her Son. And I beseech you to give a Copy of this to my Lord <hi>Carew</hi>; for to a broken Mind, a sick Body, and weak Eyes, it is a torment to write many Letters. I have found many things of Importance for discovering the State and Weakness of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which if I live I shall hereafter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto your Honour, to whom I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a faithful Servant.</p>

            <p>Whilst this Action of <hi>St. Thome</hi> was performed, and the Repulse in the way to the Mine, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> staid at <hi>St. Point de Gallo</hi> the space of nine weeks, where the unwelcome news was brought him of the loss of his Son, and the Defeat they met with in their Design upon the Mine. However this ill News could not alter the Resolutions of Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> of Returning to <hi>England,</hi> though he knew he should meet with several Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies there, who had by their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96690:106"/>
rendred the Voyage nothing but a Design; and though several of his Men were for landing at <hi>New-found-Land.</hi> For if we may believe himself at the hour of his Death, the two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earls, <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> engaged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and Sir <hi>VValter</hi> was resolv'd, thô inevitable Danger threatned him, to keep his Promise.</p>
            <p>No sooner had they arrived upon the Coasts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but the Taking and Sacking of <hi>St. Thome,</hi> firing of the Town, and putting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there to the Sword (though in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) was noised abroad in all parts, and was by special Advertisment come unto the knowledg of Count <hi>de Gonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>: Who thereupon desiring Audience of his Majesty, said he had but one word to say: His Majesty much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring what might be delivered in one word; when he came before him, he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96690:107"/>
only bawl'd out, <hi>Pyrates, Pyrates, Pyrats.</hi> A very pretty short Speech for an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador. Whereupon his Majesty published his Royal Proclamation, for the discovery of the Truth of Sir <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh</hi>'s Proceedings, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Justice. But after all this Noise, Sir <hi>VValter</hi> is not question'd for his <hi>Guiana</hi> Action. For it is believed, not without very good Ground, that neither the transgression of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, nor any thing acted beyond the Line, where the Articles of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns did not extend, could have in a legal course of Tryal shortned his days.</p>
            <p>When Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was arrived at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> Sir <hi>Lewis Steukly,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> seiz'd him, being Commissioned by his Majesty to bring him to <hi>London</hi>; which could add no Terror to a Person who could expect nothing less; and was now forc'd to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96690:107"/>
make use of all the Arts imaginable to appease his Majesty, and defer his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. To which intent, <hi>Manowry,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Quack at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> gave him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Vomits, and an Artificial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which made him look gastly and dreadful, full of Pimples and Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and put the Cheat upon the very Physicians themselves, who could not tell what to make of his Urine (thô often inspected) being adulterated with a Drug in the Glass, that turn'd, it even in their very hands, into an earthy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a blackish colour, and of a very offensive savour.</p>
            <p>While he lay under this Politick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, he penn'd his <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie,</hi> which have sufficiently proved his honourable Designs in that Voyage, and answered the little Calumnies of his Enemies. When he was brought to <hi>London,</hi> he was permitted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of his own House: But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96690:108"/>
the Court wholly guided by <hi>Gonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> he could hope for little Mercy; therefore he wisely contriv'd the design of an Escape into <hi>France,</hi> which Sir <hi>Lewis Steuckley</hi> betrayed. But the fate of Traytors pursued him, and brought him to a Contemptible End, to dye a poor distracted Beggar in the Isle of <hi>Lindey,</hi> having for a Bag of Money falsified his Faith, confirmed by the tye of the holy Sacrament, (if we may give credit to Mr <hi>Howel,</hi> who hath given us this Story;) as also before the Year came about, to be found clipping the same very Coyn in the King's own House at <hi>VVhite-Hall,</hi> which he had received for a Reward of his Perfide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: for which, being condemn'd to be hang'd, he was forc'd to sell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Shirt, to purchase his Pardon of two Knights.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> was willing to sacrifice the Life of Sir <hi>Walter</hi> to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96690:108"/>
of Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> but not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such Grounds as the Ambassadour had design'd: for he desir'd a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the pretended Breach of Peace, that by this Occasion he might slily gain from the <hi>English</hi> an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Master's Right in those Places, and hereafter both stop their Mouthes, and quench their Heat and Valour. Hence upon his old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation (for having had experience upon a former Tryal, they cared not to run the hazard of a second) he was sentenced: The old Judgment being only Averred against him; and from <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> he was carried to the <hi>Gate-House</hi>; and from thence the next Morning to the Parliament-Yard, where he had the Favour of the Ax granted him. But all Persons have wondred how that old Sentence, that had lain dormant sixteen Years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards against Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> could have
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96690:109"/>
been made use of to take off his Head afterwards: Considering the then Lord Chancellor <hi>Verulam</hi> told him positively, (as Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was acquainting him with that Proffer of Sir <hi>William St. Geon</hi> for a Pecuniary Pardon, which might have been obtained for a less Sum, than his <hi>Guiana</hi> Preparations amounted to) in these words: <q>Sir, the Knee Timber of your Voyage is Money; spare your Purse in this particular, for upon my Life you have a sufficient Pardon for all that is passed already, the King having under his Broad Seal made you Admiral of your Fleet, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you Power of the Martial Law over the Officers and Souldiers.</q>
It was the Opinion of most Lawyers, that he, who by his Majesties Patent, had power of Life and Death over the Kings Leige People, should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed or judged <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> and free from all old Convictions. But
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96690:109"/>
Sir <hi>Walter</hi> hath made the best Defence for his <hi>Guiana</hi> Actions, in his Letter to his Majesty, which I have here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.</p>

            <p>His first appearance upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, was with a smiling Countenance saluting the Lords, Knights, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, with others of his Acquaintance there present; when after a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Silence by an Officer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he addressed himself to speak in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I desire to be born withal, because this is the third Day of my Feaver: And if I shew any weakness, I beseech you attribute it to my Malady, for this is the hour I look for it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Then pawsing a while, directing himself towards a Window, where the Lord of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> with some other Lords and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96690:112"/>
Knights sate, with a loud Voice he said as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I thank God of his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that he hath sent me to dye in the sight of so Honourable an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and not in Darkness.</q>
But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the place where they sat was some distance from the Scaffold, that they could not easily hear him, he said, <q>
                  <hi>I will strain my self, for I would willingly have your Honours hear me.</hi> The L. of <hi>Arundel</hi> answered, <hi>We will come upon the Scaffold</hi>; where after he had saluted every one of them severally, he began as follows:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As I said, I thank my God heartily that he hath brought me into the light to dye, and not suffered me to dye in the dark Prison of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where I have suffered a great deal of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and a long Sickness; and I thank God that my Feaver hath not taken me at this time, as I prayed God it might not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:96690:112"/>
               <q>There are two main Points of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition that his Majesty hath conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against me, wherein his Majesty cannot be satisfied, which I desire to clear and resolve you in:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One is, That his Majesty hath been informed that I have had some Plot with <hi>France,</hi> and his Majesty had some Reason to induce him thereunto. One Reason that his Majesty had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture so, was, that when I came back from <hi>Guiana,</hi> being come to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> I endeavoured to go to <hi>Rochel</hi>; which was because I would fain have made my Peace before I came to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Another Reason was, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Flight I did intend to fly to <hi>France</hi> for saving of my Life, having had some terror from above. A third Reason was, the <hi>French</hi> Agent's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me; and it was reported I had Commission from the King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But this I say, for a Man to call
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96690:113"/>
God to witness to a Falshood at any time is a grievous sin, and what shall he hope for at the Tribunal Day of Judgment? But to call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a falshood at the time of death, is far more grievous and impious, and there is no hope for such an one. And what should I expect that am now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render an Account of my Faith? I do therefore call the Lord to witness, as I hope to be saved, and as I hope to see him in his Kingdom, which will be within this quarter of this hour, I never had any Commission from the King of <hi>France,</hi> nor any Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> Agent, nor with any from the <hi>French</hi> King; neither knew I that there was an Agent, or what he was, till I met him in my Gallery at my Lodging unlook'd for. If I speak not true, O Lord, let me never come into thy Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The second Suspition was, That his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96690:113"/>
Majesty hath been informed; that I should speak dishonourably and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyally of him. But my Accuser was a base <hi>Frenchman,</hi> a kind of a Chymical Fellow, one whom I knew to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious; for being drawn into this Action at <hi>Winchester,</hi> in which my Hand was toucht, and he being sworn to secrecy over Night, reveal'd it in the Morning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But in this I speak now, What have have I to do with Kings? I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them, neither do I fear them: I have now to do with God, therefore to tell a Lye now to get the Favour of the King were in vain. Therefore, as I hope to be saved at the last Day, I never spake dishonourably, disloyally, nor dishonestly of the King; neither to this <hi>Frenchman,</hi> nor to any other; neither had I ever in all my Life a thought of ill of his Majesty. Therefore I cannot but think it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96690:114"/>
strange, that this <hi>Frenchman</hi> being so base, so mean a Fellow, should be so far credited; and so much for this Point. I have dealt truly, and I hope I shall be believed. I confess, I did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to escape, and I did dissemble and fain my self sick at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> but I hope it was no sin. The Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did make himself a Fool, and did suffer Spittle to fall upon his Beard, to escape the hands of his Enemies, and it was not imputed to him as sin; and I did it to prolong Time till his Majesty came, hoping for some Commiseration from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I forgive this <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and Sir <hi>Lewis Steuckly,</hi> and have received the Sacrament this Morning of Mr. Dean, and I do also forgive all the World. But thus much I am bound in Charity to speak of this Man, that all Men may take good heed of him: Sir <hi>Lewis Steuckley,</hi> my Kinsman and Keeper,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96690:114"/>
hath affirmed that I should tell him, that I did tell my Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Doncaster</hi> of my present Escape; but I protest before God, I never told <hi>Steuckly</hi> any such thing, neither did I tell my Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> or my Lord <hi>Doncaster,</hi> of my pretended Escape. It was not likely that I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint two Privy-Counsellors of my purpose; neither would I tell him, for he left me six, seven, eight, nine or ten days to go where I listed, while he rode about the Country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Again, he accused me, that I should tell him, that my Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Doncaster</hi> would meet me in <hi>France:</hi> which was never my speech or thought.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thirdly, He accused me, That I shew'd him a Letter, and that I should give him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> for my Escape: but cast my Soul into everlasting fire if ever I made him offer of 10000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:96690:115"/>
or 1000 <hi>l.</hi> but meerly I shew'd him a Letter, that if he would go with me, his Debts should be paid when he was gone; neither had I 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for if I had had so much, I could have done better with it, and made my Peace otherwise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Fourthly; When I came to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pelham,</hi> who had been sometimes a follower of mine, who gave me good Entertainment; he gave out that I had receiv'd some dram of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Sir <hi>Edward Pelham</hi>'s House: when I answered, that I feared no such thing; for I was well assured of them in the House. Now God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, for I do, and desire God to forgive him: I will not only say God is the God of Revenge, but I desire God to forgive him, as I hope to be forgiven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then he looked over his Note of Remembrance; <q>Well (saith he) thus
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96690:115"/>
far I have gone; now a little more, and I will have done by and by.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It was told the King I was brought <hi>per</hi> force into <hi>England,</hi> and that I did not intend to come again: Whereas Captain <hi>Charles Parker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tresham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leak,</hi> and divers others that knew how I was dealt withal, shall witness for me: for the Common Souldiers (which were 150) mutined, and sent for me to come into the Gun-Room to them, (for at that time they would not come to me) and there was I forc'd to take an Oath, that I would not come into <hi>England</hi> till they would have me, else they would cast me into the Sea and drown me; afterwards they entred my Cabin and set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against me. After I had taken this Oath, with Wine and other things I drew the chiefest of them to desist, and at length perswaded them to go into <hi>Ireland:</hi> Then would they have
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96690:116"/>
gone into the North parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but I told them they were <hi>Redshanks:</hi> yet at last with much ado I perswaded them to go into the South parts; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to get their Pardons: but was forc'd to give them 125 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Kinsale</hi> to bring them home, otherwise I had never got from them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There was a Report that I meant not to go to <hi>Guiana</hi> at all; and that I knew not of any Mine, nor intended any such matter, but only to get my Liberty, which I had not the wit to keep. But it was my full intent to go for Gold, for the benefit of his Majesty, and those that went with me, with the rest of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But he that knew the Head of the Mine, would not discover it when he saw my Son was slain, but made himself away. Then he turned to my Lord of <hi>Arundel</hi> and said, Being in the Gallery in my Ship at my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96690:116"/>
Your Honour took me by the hand, and said you would request me one thing, that was, <hi>That whether I made a good Voyage or bad, yet I should return again into</hi> England; when I made you a Promise, and gave you my Faith that I would: <hi>And so you did</hi> (answered my Lord) <hi>it is true, they were the last words I spake unto you.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Another Opinion was, that I carried to Sea with me 1600 Pieces, and that was all the Voyage I intended, only to get Money into my Hands, and that I had weighed my Voyage before: whereas I protest I had but 100 Pound in all the World, whereof I gave 25 Pounds to my Wife: the Reason of this Speech was this; there was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered 20000 Pound, and yet but 4000 Pound in the Surveyors Book; now I gave my Bill for the other 16000 Pound for divers Adventurers, but I protest I had not a Penny of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96690:117"/>
Money more than 100 Pound, as I hope to be saved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Another Slander was raised, that I would have gone away from them and left them at <hi>Guiana,</hi> but there were a great many of worthy Men that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me always, as my Serjeant Major <hi>George Raleigh,</hi> and divers others (which he then named) that knew my Intent was nothing so. And these be the Material Points I thought good to speak of; I am now at this instant to render my Account to God, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test as I shall appear before Him, this that I have spoken is true.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will speak but a word or two more, because I will not trouble Mr. Sheriff too long.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There was a Report spread, that I should rejoyce at the Death of my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> and that I should take Tobacco in his presence; when as I protest I shed Tears at his Death,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96690:117"/>
though I was one of the contrary Faction; and at the time of his Death I was all the while in the Armory at the further end, where I could but see him; I was sorry that I was not with him, for I heard he had a desire to see me, and be reconciled to me. So that I protest I lamented his Death, and good cause had I, for it was the worse for me as it proved, for after he was gone I was little beloved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And now I intreat you all to joyn with me in Prayer, that the great God of Heaven, whom I have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously offended, being a Man full of all Vanity, and have lived a sinful Life, in all sinful Callings, having been a Souldier, a Captain, a Sea-Captain, and a Courtier, which are all places of Wickedness and Vice; that God (I say) would forgive me, and cast away my Sins from me, and that he would receive me into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96690:118"/>
Life. So I take my leave of you all, making my Peace with God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then Proclamation being made that all Men should depart the Scaffold, he prepared himself for Death, giving away his Hat and wrought Night-Cap, and some Money to such as he knew that stood near him: Taking his leave of the Lords, Knights, and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and among the rest taking his leave of the Lord of <hi>Arundel,</hi> he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his Company, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to desire the King, that no scandalous Writing to defame him might be published after his Death; saying further unto him, <hi>I have a long Iourney to go, and therefore will take my leave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then putting off his Gown and Doublet, he called to the Headsman to shew him the Ax, which being not presently shewed him, he said, <hi>I pray thee let me see it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dost thou think that I am
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96690:118"/>
afraid of it?</hi> And having it in his hands, he felt along upon the Edge of it, and smiling spake to the Sheriff, saying, <hi>This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian for all Diseases.</hi> Then going to and fro upon the Scaffold, on every side he prayed the Company to pray to God to assist him and strengthen him.</p>
            <p>And so being asked which way he would lay himself, on which side the Block, as he stretched himself along and laid his Head on the Block, he said, <hi>So the Heart be right, it is no matter which way the Head lieth.</hi> And then praying, after he had forgiven the Headsman, having given him a Sign when he should do his Office, at two blows he lost both Head and Life, his Body never shrinking nor moving. His Head was shewed on each side of the Scaffold, and then put into a Red-Leather Bag, and his wrought Velvet
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96690:119"/>
Gown thrown over it, vvhich was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards conveyed away in a Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coach of his Ladies.</p>
            <p>The large effusion of Blood which proceeded from his Veins, amaz'd the Spectators, vvho conjectur'd he had stock enough left of Nature to have survived many years, thô now near fourscore years old.</p>
            <p>He behav'd himself at his Death vvith so High and so Religious a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, as if a <hi>Christian</hi> had acted a <hi>Roman,</hi> or rather a <hi>Roman</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi>: And by the Magnanimity vvhich vvas then conspicuous in him, he abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baffled their Calumnies who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd him of Atheism.</p>
            <p>Various were the Resentments of his Death, and several <hi>Pasquils</hi> (as it always happens on such Occasions) were scatter'd abroad.</p>
            <p>Of the Gallantry of his Behaviour on the Scaffold, these following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96690:119"/>
may give a Confirmation, and a Taste of the <hi>Poetry</hi> of those Times.</p>
