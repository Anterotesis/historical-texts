            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THAT the Holy Scriptures are one of the greateſt Bleſſings which God beſtows
upon the Sons of Men, is generally acknowledged by all who know any thing
of the value and worth of them. To ſhew their Uſe and Excellency, is beyond
the Author's preſent deſign or intendment; 'tis already done by one or other
to good purpoſe every day. In them the Lord hath dilucidly diſplayed that Counſel of his
Will, that is of infinite concernment to us to underſtand, in order to our preſent being
accepted of him here, and at laſt brought to the fulleſt enjoyment of himſelf in Glory.
Tis wonderful to behold, how full and perfect this Word is, with reſpect to this end;
What can Man deſire to know, which is neceſſary hereunto, that the light thereof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
not? What direction can he expect, by which he may be fortified againſt all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of his good, either within or without him, that is not there given? What Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
would he have which are not therein diſplayed before him? And what Cavils
can be brought againſt any part of Truth contained therein, to which they themſelves
yield not a full reſolve? (one place of Scripture ſo exactly clearing, expounding, and
illuſtrating another) Yet (to amazement) it's obſerved, That Man (who is ſo highly and
principally concerned in it) doth too too little value it; he can weary himſelf in any
ſecular Affair, but diligently to ſearch the Scriptures (according to our Lord's advice) is
to him tedious and burthenſom. Few covet to be mighty in the Scriptures; though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
their great concern is inveloped in them: A Spirit of Self-fulneſs, Pride, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sloth, Drowſineſs, and Deadneſs, lies at the bottom of this ſinful Neglect. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
awaken Perſons to a more diligent thorow ſearch of the mind of God herein, is a
ſervice no leſs profitable than ſeaſonable at this day. And what greater external Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
than to make that facile and eaſie, which ſeemed inconquerably arduous and
difficult?</p>
            <p>This is the deſign of the enſuing Treatiſe: Nor is the Author altogether without hopes
(wherein he hath the concurring Judgment of ſeveral eminently Learned and Judicious
Divines, who have peruſed it) but, by the Bleſſing of God, it may have a ſingular ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to the enlightning of ſome, and eſtabliſhing of others in Divine Truths (when <hi>uno
intuitu</hi> they ſee the Scriptures, upon which they are built) and enabling them with eaſe
to confute Gainſayers. For here the ſeveral Texts of Holy Scripture (which lie ſcattered
in the Book of God) are Collected together, Tranſcribed and placed (in the Order as they
lie in the Bible) under ſeveral and particular Heads. And where any Subject is fallen on,
and mentioned in the General Head (and ſometimes alſo in a particular Head) there (for
the moſt part) is to be found all that relate to that Matter, immediately following under
particular Heads, or Sub-Diviſions, to the end that the whole thereof may be met with
<pb facs="tcp:66453:3"/>
together: Or, at leaſt, there are references to ſome otherſ General or Particular Head,
where it is placed more properly.</p>
            <p>And here Note, Chriſtian Reader, That thou haſt not only the Places poſitive to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
there, but alſo ſuch which are any ways argumentative, or enforcing (whether by
Examples, the Equity of the Things, the Nature of God, his approbation of Promiſes to,
or threatnings againſt it) or any way illuſtrating or Expounding of it, by whatſoever
terms they are expreſſed: Whereof a little uſe of this Treatiſe will ſoon give thee a full
evidence.</p>
            <p>But, to prevent Prejudice and Miſtakes, and give thee ſome light in the way and
method the Author hath taken, He propoſeth to thy Obſervation theſe few things
following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> To prevent prejudice, do the Author and thy ſelf this right, Not to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by the reading of one or two Texts at the beginning of any Head: For poſſibly they
may not at the firſt bluſh ſeem to thee ſo pertinent to the matter, as others do which follow;
they may be only argumentative, and not poſitive: For the Author ſo placed them on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that they might run in order, as they lie in the Bible, that the Reader might go to
any Text of either Teſtament, without turning backward and forward, and for other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
and thence it happens ſometimes, That the Scriptures leſs to the purpoſe, firſt
occur to thy View.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, paſs not Sentence upon any Text thou ſhalt find under any Head, as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the Subject there, until thou haſt ſeriouſly weighed the ſame: For poſſibly in ſo
doing thou mayſt diſcern ſomething in that Scripture, which thou never didſt obſerve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
nor mighteſt have taken notice of, had not the Head or Subject there turned thy
thoughts upon it.</p>
            <p>And then, the Author doubteth not, but that the Compoſure it ſelf (when judiciouſly
conſidered) will prevent this Cenſure, That it's a needleſs Work, as having been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by others: This being a thing of another Nature than any yet extant, and will be
helpful at another rate. For (notwithſtanding any other helps) the finding out of apt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
for illuſtrating, confirming, and making uſe of any Truth which may be upon the
thoughts of any, have been, as it is, a difficult and laborious Work; and thence Men oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
uſe Scriptures, either not apt, according to the intent of the Holy Ghoſt there;
or ſuch, the genuine ſenſe of which is <hi>doubted.</hi> And for the uſe of Concordances herein,
each Man's memory muſt record the Scriptures: for they muſt firſt occur to his thoughts,
then his Judgment muſt fix upon ſome word therein, under which the Text is placed;
and 'tis poſſible not hit the right term under which it is; and oft-times look a long time
ere he come to it, becauſe of the multitude of words there uſed: and happily miſs at laſt
too, and be put upon ſearching under another term. But here thou mayſt only turn to
the Subject thou enquireſt after, and (without any ſuch ſteps) find Scriptures full and apt
thereto (by whatſoever Terms or Phraſes they are expreſſed) occur to your eye at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
and almoſt (if not altogether) all the Scripture affords to that Subject; and preſent
thee with matter of Enlargement, which poſſibly thou thoughteſt not of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To give thee ſome light in the Method, and to help thee in the uſe of
this.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> Take notice, that in <hi>Chap. 13. [Of Saints failings,</hi>] The firſt Texts are to prove each
Perſon his Saintſhip; then the next following, their Failings: and this is done on purpoſe,
that it might appear they are the Failings of Saints: and ſo proper to the Head.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> Note alſo, That the words within a Parentheſis beginning with [or] are the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Readings.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> Some General Heads have no Particulars following, but the whole placed under
that General Head. This is ſo done, either becauſe the Texts which the Scripture affords
to that Subject, are but few in the whole, and ſo eaſily run through; or that the Matters
are ſo various, that almoſt every Verſe carries a diſtinct thing in it, yet ſtill relating to the
<pb facs="tcp:66453:3"/>
General Head; as that [<hi>Of the Saints Privileges</hi>] each Text almoſt a diſtinct Privilege: So
that [<hi>Of the Character of Saints</hi>] and ſome other of like Nature. And here to have deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Particular Heads, would have been tedious and unneceſſary; for the words being
there tranſcribed, the Reader may preſently inform himſelf in the whole, and in every
particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A little pains in obſerving the Contents or Table in the Front of the Book,
which doth contain the General and Particular Heads therein, and alſo the References
thereto, and directs to Chapter and Page where each lieth, will enable thee to diſcern
more of the Method and uſefulneſs of the Work, than can be well expreſſed in a ſhort
Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Therefore this ſhall ſuffice, ſuppoſing the Work it ſelf will ſhew its own Uſefulneſs and
Advantage to the Meditation about Divine Matters; holding a Man to one Subject, and
yielding variety of Matter to enforce upon the mind, and leave impreſſion there: When
bare reading a Chapter or two (as ſome uſe to do as a task) proves not effectual for that
end; and ſearching proves laborious; and to many (by reaſon of the difficulty of finding)
diſcouraging alſo.</p>
            <p>In this Edition the <hi>Errata</hi> of the former Edition are Corrected; and the Work is enlarged
about a fourth Part.</p>

perfect: For then would they not have ceaſed to
be offered, becauſe that the worſhippers once

               <p>LET not them who wait on thee, O Lord God
of hoſts, be aſhamed for my ſake: Let not
thoſe who ſeek thee be confounded for my ſake, O
God of Iſrael. Becauſe for thy ſake I have born
reproach, ſhame hath covered my face: I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a ſtranger unto my brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the zeal
of shine houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the reproaches of them
who reproached thee, have fallen upon me, <hi>&amp;c.
Pſal.</hi> 69. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Lord ſhall all
the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory, <hi>Iſa</hi>

               <p>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie

53. 11.</p>
               <p>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye
ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs; and from
all your idols will I cleanſe you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will alſo
ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not
for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it
known unto you: Be aſhamed and confounded
for your own ways, O houſe of Iſrael. Thus ſaith
the Lord God, In the day that I ſhall have clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
you from all your iniquities, <hi>&amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 36. 22,
25, 29, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>The Lord whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he is like a refiner's fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
ſilver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then ſhall the offering of Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
be pleaſant unto the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1, 2,
3, 4.</p>
               <p>The Phariſee prayed thus; God, I thank thee
that I am not as other men are; extortioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I faſt twice a week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Publican ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes
unto heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying, God be merciful unto me
a ſinner. I tell you, This man went down unto
his houſe juſtified, rather than the other, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo
might be ſanctified, <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 17. 19.</p>
               <p>And by him all who believe are juſtified from all
things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the
law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 13. 39.</p>
               <p>Therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed,
from faith to faith; as it is written, The juſt ſhall
live by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>The righteouſneſs of God without the làw is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
being witneſſed by the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by
faith of Jeſus Chriſt, ùnto all, and upon all them
who believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being juſtified freely by his grace,
through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,
whom God hath ſet forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to declare his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to declare, I ſay, his righteouſneſs;
that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of them
who believe in Jeſus. Where is boaſting then? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Wherefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by
faith, without the deeds of the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Abraham believed God; and it was counted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him for righteouſneſs. Now to him who worketh,
is the reward; not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
But to him who worketh not, but believeth on
him who juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him for righteouſneſs; even as David de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom
God imputeth righteouſneſs without works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the
righteouſneſs of the faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he might be
the father of them who believe, though they be
not circumciſed, that righteouſneſs might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:66453:36"/>
not to Abraham, or to his feed, through the law;
but through the righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was
imputed to him for righteouſneſs: Now it was not
written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if we believe on him who raiſed up Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed
again for our juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6, 11,
13, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6.</p>
               <p>Being juſtified by faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The free gift of many offences unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As by one offence, judgment came
upon all to condemnation; even ſo by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of one, (<hi>or by one righteouſueſs</hi>) the free
gift came upon all men to juſtification of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
By the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>There is therefore now no condemnation to them
who are in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whom he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know,
them he alſo juſtified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who ſhall lay
any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God
who juſtifieth: Who is he who condemneth? It is
Chriſt who died; yea rather, that is riſen again,
<hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 29, 30, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>The Gentiles, who followed not after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
have attained unto righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
is of faith. But Iſrael, who followed after the law
of righteouſneſs, hath not attained unto the law
of righteouſneſs. Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought
it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the
law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>They being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, and
going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs,
have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his ſervants, to put a

            <p>When they were purſued by the Egyptians, they
cried unto the Lord: and they ſaid unto Moſes,
Becauſe there were no graves in Egypt, haſt thou
taken us away, to die in the wilderneſs? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haſt thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth
out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did

They could not drink of the waters of Marah,

againſt Moſes, ſaying, What ſhall we drink?
<hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>And the whole congregation of the children of
Iſrael murmured againſt Moſes and Aaron in the
wilderneſs, and, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaid unto them, Would to
God we had died by the hand of the Lord, in the
land of Egypt, when we ſate by the fleſh-pots,
when we did eat bread to the full: for ye have
brought us forth into the wilderneſs, to kill this
whole congregation with hunger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ye ſhall
ſee the glory of the Lord, for that he heareth your
murmurings againſt the Lord: And what are we,
that ye murmur againſt us? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Your murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are not againſt us, but againſt the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi>
16. 2, 3, 7, 8, 12.</p>
            <p>The people did chide with Moſes, and ſaid, Give
us water, that we may drink. And Moſes ſaid to
them, Why chide you with me? wherefore do you
tempt the Lord? And the people thirſted there
for water: and the people murmured againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and ſaid, Wherefore is this, that thou haſt
brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, and our
children, and our cattel with thirſt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
tempted the Lord, ſaying, Is the Lord among us,
or not? <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 2, 3, 7.</p>
            <p>When the people complained, it diſpleaſed the
Lord, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of
the Lord burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the mixed multitude
who was among them fell a luſting: And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael alſo wept again, (<hi>or, murmured, and
wept,</hi>) and ſaid. Who ſhall give us fleſh to eat?
We remember the fiſh which we did eat in Egypt
freely: the cucumbers, and the melons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
now our ſoul is dried away: there is nothing at
all, beſides this Manna, before our eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God
gave them fleſh: but while the fleſh was yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of
the Lord was kindled againſt the people; and the
Lord ſmote the people with a very great plague,

            <p>Upon the report of the Spies, of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of entring the Land, all the Congregation of
Iſrael liſted up their voice, and cried; and the
people wept that night. And all the children
of Iſrael murmured againſt Moſes, and againſt
Aaron: and the whole congregation ſaid unto
them, Would God we had died in the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
or, Would God we had died in this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And wherefore hath the Lord brought us
unto this land, to fall by the ſword, that our wives
and our children ſhould be a prey? Were it not
better for us to return into Egypt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us
make us a captain, and return into Egypt. Your

            <p>When <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company were ſwallowed

have killed the people of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 41.</p>
            <p>There was not water for the congregation: and
they gathered themſelves againſt Moſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Aaron: and the people chod with Moſes,
and ſpake, ſaying, Would God we had died when
our brethren died before the Lord. And why have
ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into
this wilderneſs? that we and our cattel ſhould die
there! And wherefore have ye made us to come up
out of Egypt, to bring us into this evil place? It
is no place of ſeed, or of figs or vines, <hi>&amp;c. Numb.</hi>
20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,</p>
            <p>The ſoul of the people was much diſcouraged,

God, and againſt Moſes: Wherefore have ye
brought us up out of Egypt, to die in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
for there is no bread, neither is there any
water: and our ſoul loatheth this light bread.
And the Lord ſent ſiery ſerpents among the people,

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Behold, he ſmote the rock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can
he give bread alſo? Can he provide fleſh for his

So a fire was kindled againſt Jacob, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe
they believed not in God, nor truſted in his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> They ſinned ſtill, and believed not his

the grace which was given unto me, they gave to
me and Barnaias, the right hand of fellowſhip,
that we ſhould to go the heathen, and they unto
the circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when Peter was come to
Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he
was to be blamed: for before that, certain came
from James; he did eat with the Gentiles. But
when they were come, he withdrew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fearing
them of circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when I ſaw that
they walked not uprightly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſaid unto Peter
