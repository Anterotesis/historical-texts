            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>In the first Regiment is expressed the antiquitie and force of the Lawe, the states of Common-wealths vnder diuers kindes of gouernments.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll creatures of God, as well in heauen as in earth, had lawes giuen them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were created, to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ruled by, the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres to keepe their perpetuall motions and course in their places and regiments, so the seas haue their limits and bounds, how farre they should rule and raigne, and though one starre differeth from an other in <note place="margin">Iob. 38.</note> glorie, in greatnesse, and in brightnesse, yet are they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by one perpetuall lawe; so the seas, though the waues thereof be so loftie and proud, yet are they shut vp within doores, and commaunded to keepe in, and not to goe further then the place to them by lawe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>By lawe also the elements are commaunded to staie within their owne regiments, without trespassing one of another, as <hi>Manilius</hi> faith; <hi>Certa stant omnia lege,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:9246:4"/>
For the stanes by lawe haue their leaders before them, they haue their watch giuen them, they haue their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and marching appointed them, and as all riuers and waters haue their course and recourse, to the seas, and from the seas, as from their chiefe commaunder, so all starres haue their brightnesse &amp; light from the Sun, as from their chiefe generall.</p>
            <p>Neither were the Angels in heauen, being the first and the chiefest creatures of God, nor man in Paradise beeing the last creature, <hi>Tanquam Epilogus operum dei,</hi> without lawe, the breach wherof made such a generall confusion, that it so obscured the first integritie of the lawe of nature, that the Angels that offended in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, lost heauen, and were iudged to perpetuall darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and man for his disobedience in Paradise, cast <note place="margin">Iob. 25.</note> out of Paradise to euerlasting punishment, so that the Angels were not pure, nor the heauens cleare before God.</p>
            <p>The earth likewise and the seas, and all the creatures in them, by breaking of the first lawe which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calleth <hi>Primordialem l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Vtrùm mirabilius homines iustos creare, quàm iniustos instificare,</hi> whether the mercy of God were more in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting iust men, or in iustifying wicked men, though with God it was of equall and like power; yet said <hi>Augustine,</hi> it was of greater mercy to iustifie vniust men, for that <hi>Iustificatio er at secunda hominis creatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the old Patriarches liued vnder the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">The old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes liued vnder the law of nature. 2. Cor 3. Iere. 31.</note> so <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth that the lawe was first written, not in tables of stones, but in fleshly tables of the heart, for I will put my lawe saith the Lorde in their inward parts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9246:4"/>
and in their hearts will I write it; so <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Audi linguam non in lapide sed in corde scribentem;</hi> for from the eternall lawe, which is <hi>Creatrix &amp; gubernatrix vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> was reuiued and lightned the lawe of nature, vnder the which the Patriarches liued, for the lawe of nature which the Patriarches had, being not corrupted, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the written lawe giuen to <hi>Moses,</hi> which is the whole summe of the morall lawe.</p>
            <p>What else is the lawe written giuen to <hi>Moses,</hi> but a short repetition, and compendious catalogue, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">The lawe of nature is a short repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lawe written.</note> vnto vs the lawe of nature, beeing obscured and corrupted by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> but by the second <hi>Adam</hi> renued, written, and giuen to <hi>Moses</hi> in tables of stones, <hi>Tanquam norma rectitudinis in Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth, that if the Gentiles which haue not the lawe, doo by nature those things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the lawe, they hauiug not the lawe, are a lawe to themselues, and therefore the Heathens are not excuseable, for conscience which is that <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus gladius,</hi> is a witnesse of theyr fault, and a signe of the anger and iudgement against them for theyr sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agnitio Peccatilex,</hi> and therefore the lawe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to shewe vs our infirmities, and that by the lawe grace might bee sought for, <hi>Fides enim impetrat, quod lex</hi>

               <hi>imperat:</hi> for when the lawe was first giuen in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> it was with such feare, lightning and thundering, with such cloudes, smoake, and fire, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of <hi>Sinai</hi> trembled and quaked, when the lawe was giuen, for the law is full of terror and ministreth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And therefore the first and auncient kings and law-makers of the world, <hi>Quibus omnes antiquae gentes quonda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paruerunt,</hi> both for the more credit of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues &amp; better authoritie of their lawes, made their subiects &amp; people <note place="margin">Cic. de leg. lib. 3.</note> beleeue, when their first lawes were made, that the gods were so carefull, that they gaue them seuerall lawes to gouerne the people.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Mena</hi> one of the first kings of <hi>Egipt,</hi> affirmed that he had instructions for making of his lawes and decrees to the Egiptians, from god <hi>Mercurius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like sort <hi>Licurgus</hi> made the Lacedemonians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, <note place="margin">Cic. de diuini. lib 1.</note> that the lawes which he gaue vnto them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto him from <hi>Appollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Creete</hi> were perswaded fully by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> their first lawe-maker, that the lawes which he gaue <note place="margin">Diod. sic. lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> vnto them, were deliuered vnto him from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that thereby the law might the more be feared, and the law-makers better obeyed.</p>
            <p>So did <hi>Numa Pomp.</hi> warrant his lawes which he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished among the Romanes concerning religion, from the Nimph <hi>Egeria,</hi> for the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which was vnder kings, is by <hi>Aristotle</hi> called <hi>Primus &amp; diuinissimus princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the first gouernment and state of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths fell by too much seueritie of kings, as among the Romaines who were wearie of kings, and had no lawe but <hi>Ius regis,</hi> the iudgement and sentence of the

            <p>For among the Romains &amp; the Grecians, the dumbe, deafe, blind, lame, or maimed otherwise by nature, were reiected from any office in the temples of their gods.</p>
            <p>So was it among the Persians in like sort, that no blinde or maimed man should minister vnto their gods. Whence had they all these originals, but (as it seemeth) from the lawe of <hi>Moses?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Moses</hi> was commaunded that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons should be first washt with water, before they should <note place="margin">Alex.

            </p>
            <p>So the Priests of <hi>Greece</hi> washt and annointed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues before they would sacrifice vnto <hi>Ceres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so among the Romanes &amp; in other places, they seemed (though they erred much) to imitate the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Iewes, who had their warrant from the Lord, and they from the diuell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> put on <hi>Aaron</hi> the coate, and girded him with a girdle, cloathed him with the robe, and put the <hi>Ephod</hi> on him, after he put the brest-plate thereon, and put in the brest-plate the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> he also put the <note place="margin">The consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Aaron.

            <p>Hence the Heathens and the Gentiles tooke their platforme, as an example to be followed in the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and crowning of their kings, by the Lord warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

and particularly set downe to <hi>Moses,</hi> whereby you shall find by comparison, that the prophane ceremonies of the Gentiles tooke their originall from <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, in the annointing of their kings.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And therefore positiue lawes in all countries were and are made from the beginning to maintaine ciuill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to determine of such orders and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are necessary and requisite for the keeping of the people in obedience of the same.</p>
            <p>Of these and such lawes <hi>Plato</hi> wrote his booke <hi>de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</hi> tending to the administration and gouernment of the people, according to the lawe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> the Emperour, therefore would make no lawes without the iudgement of 20. of the best learned Ciuilians, with the aduise and consent of 50. of the grauest and wifest councellors that were within his Empire, to examine whether the lawes were iust &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <note place="margin">Alex.

            <p>As among the Hebrewes in any citie of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that if they could not rightly iudge, nor discerne throughly <note place="margin">Ioseph. lib. 4. cap. 8.</note> the cause, according to iustice, by the Magistrates of the citie, they might appeale to the Iudges named <hi>Sinadrion</hi>

in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> from whence no appeale could be had.</p>
            <p>So among the Grecians, they might appeale from the Areopagites in <hi>Athens,</hi> from the Ephories in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and all other cities of <hi>Greece</hi> to the Amphictions at <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaena,</hi> which were appointed general Iudges for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall state of <hi>Greece,</hi> in martiall and military causes, and <note place="margin">The diuers orders of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales among the Heathens.</note> there to sit and determine twise a yeare of the whole state of <hi>Greece,</hi> and further to heare and to iudge of some other great causes and capitall crimes, from whose sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence no other appeale was to be had; for out of euery citie in <hi>Greece</hi> in the Spring and in the Autumne, to the Amphictions at <hi>Trozaena</hi> they sent Embassadors, whom the Greekes called <hi>Pytagorae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So among the Romanes a lawfull appeale might be had from the Consuls to the Senators, from the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Tribune of the people, and from the people to the Dictator, which continued vntill the time of the Iudges called <hi>Centum viri;</hi> for <hi>Sententia Dictatoris, &amp; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia</hi>

A lawe was made among the said Egiptians, that if any man had killed his sonne, the father should be lockt together with the sonne slaine by him in one chamber, without meate or drinke for three dayes, beholding still before his face the dead body of his sonne, by himselfe slaine, (with a watch that none should come to him) thinking that by looking theron, there could be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torture or punishment to the father, then to see his sonne so slaine by himselfe which was his father.</p>
            <p>Among the Persians a lawe was made, that he that killed his father was thought that he neuer had a father, for they thought it against the lawe of nature, a thing vnnaturall, yea and vnpossible that the sonne should kill his father, and therefore he should be euer after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a bastard (a greater reproach among the Persians could not be) and therefore <hi>Romulus</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> being demaunded why they made no lawes <note place="margin">No law made against Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, neither by Romulus nor Solon.</note> against Paracides, answered that they thought none so wicked or so cruell as to thinke on such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therefore they thought it fit, that no lawe should be mentioned for so wicked a fact, though by <hi>Dracoes</hi> lawe, <hi>Solons</hi> predecessor, the least fault in <hi>Athens</hi> was punished with death, and therefore called in ieast, <hi>Lex Draconis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Lusitania</hi> a Paracide should be stoned to death, not within their country, least the murtherers bloud should defile their countrie, but they should be banished to the next confines, and there to die.</p>

               <hi>Dauid</hi> was forbidden to build the Temple in <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> for that he was a man of bloud, so the Lord said, Thou art a man of bloud, and therefore thy sonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> shall build me a Temple.</p>

should bee forced by the lawe to eate the hearbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ophiusa,</hi> which being eaten, the murtherer should be so tormented with such terrible visions and dreames, that he could neuer take rest or sleepe before he had kild himselfe.</p>
            <p>The Macedonians in like sort stoned them not onely to death that committed any murther or treason against their Prince and their countrey, but also such as were consenting therevnto; and therfore <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> made <note place="margin">Platoeslaw for the man that kild himselfe.</note> a law that the hand that slew himselfe should not be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the body, but should either be throwne away to be eaten of dogges, or else to be nailed in some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like place, to be eaten of fowles of the ayre, as actor of the murther.</p>
            <p>In many places murther was lesse esteemed of men, then of birds or of beasts, as in <hi>Egipt</hi> to kill an Egiptian cat, was more dangerous then to kill a Romane captain. The history is written in <hi>Diod. sic.</hi> at large.</p>
            <p>So to kill the bird called <hi>Ibis</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> there was by the lawe capitall punishment for it. In <hi>Thessalia</hi> none might kill a stoike; neither in <hi>Athens</hi> by the lawe of <hi>Solon,</hi> none might sacrifice an oxe.</p>

               <hi>Charondas</hi> lawe was, that he that pulled a mans eye out, should loose an other of his owne for it, but if a man had but one eye, and that were pluckt out, <hi>Charon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>

his sight, and not for the eye, and claimed therefore iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the lawe against the offender.</p>
            <p>But the lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> is otherwise, that if a man strike his seruant in the eye, that his eye perish, hee shall let his seruant go free, for that he lost his eye, also if a man smite out his seruants tooth, the lawe is that he shall likewise <note place="margin">Exod. 21.</note> let his seruant goe free.</p>
            <p>Yet in matters of death, <hi>Moses</hi> lawe is, eye for eye, member for member, life for life, bloud for bloud, so is <note place="margin">The law of the 12. Tables like Moses lawe.</note> the lawe of the twelue Tables, <hi>Siquis membrum rupit in eum Talio esto.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> graue and wise Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they made means likewise to become chast, by thin fare, feeding on <hi>Gurgins</hi> and course bread, made of the <note place="margin">Gymnoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists.</note> huskes of corne, with Apples and Rice, this was their meanes to become temperate in their prophane religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>India, Sacedotes solis,</hi> the Priestes of the Sunne, thought the meanes to make themselues continent, not only by abstaining from flesh, wine and women, as the Priests of <hi>Athens,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Egipt</hi> did, but also by refraining their owne beds in their owne houses, and to liue <hi>sub dio,</hi> to lie in their cloathes vpon the earth.</p>
            <p>Among the Romanes and the Grecians the lawes of the 12. tables commaunded &amp; commended to them chastitie, in such sort that they might neither serue, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <note place="margin">The lawe of 12. tables for chastitie.</note> nor offer vnto their gods, vnlesse for a certaine time they had abstained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wine &amp; women, the words of the law were these, <hi>Ad diuos adeunto castè, Pietatem adhibento, opes admouento.</hi> How straightly the Gentiles obserued this, you read before, yet seeke they their warrant from <hi>Moses,</hi> for the high Priest <hi>Abimelech</hi> would know of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> whether he and his company were pure and cleane froo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> women before they should eat of the shewe bread, which was lawfull for no man to eate but the Priest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:9246:47"/>
The lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> was, that money gotten by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon women might not be accepted, neither in offring, nor in sacrifice vpon the Lords Aultar, for the law saith, thou shalt neither bring the hire of a whore, nor the price of a dogge into the house of the Lorde, for euen both these are abhominations vnto the Lord, for there <note place="margin">Deut. 23.</note> shall be no whore, nor whore keeper in <hi>Israel.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> at his death deliuered to the Hebrewes the booke of the lawe, and he commaunded them to lay vp those lawes in the Arke within the Tabernacle, where <note place="margin">The Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle hidden by Ieremy.</note> it was lawfull for none to come to them, but the high Priest, which continued from <hi>Moses</hi> time vntill <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed by <hi>Nabuchodonozer,</hi> at what time <hi>Ieremie</hi>

they dedicated to the goddesse Feare, and there in the porch of the temple, the Senators of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> which were 28. in number, did minister an oath both to the King and the Ephori before the people, to serue &amp; keep <hi>Licurgus</hi> lawes, in the which Temple their lawes were lockt vp, and kept with great care.</p>
            <p>The Romaines made so much of the lawes of their Sybils, that they were so kept and so strongly lockt with <note place="margin">The care and diligence of all nations in keeping their lawes.</note> such care and diligence in a stony Arke in the Capitoll vnder the ground, where none might come to them, see nor read them, but the officers called <hi>Duumuiri,</hi> who had the charge ouer them, neither they vntill the Consuls, and the Senate had occasions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with the lawes, which continued from <hi>Torqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Priscus</hi> time, vntill <hi>Lu.

            </p>

            <p>The lawe of the Turkes is, that the Priests after some ceremonies done, should haue a sword and a speare, which is set by him in the Pulpit, and to shewe the same to the people, saying; see that you haue these weapons in a readinesse to defend the lawes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the penaltie of the Turkes lawe

Thus were lawes in all countries reuerenced, and with great care and diligence obserued.</p>
            <p>After lawes, decrees and statutes were made in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Countrey, with such circumstances as agreed with the time, with the place, and with the people, for without law no Common-wealth nor Kingdome <note place="margin">Arist.

            </p>
            <p>Iudges were appointed to execute the same in all countries, and magistrates in euery citie, as among the Hebrewes the Elders called Synadrion Iudges, and yet in euery citie of <hi>Iudah</hi> was a seuerall Iudge.</p>
            <p>Among the Egiptians they had 30. Iudges which they elected, from <hi>Eliopolis, Memphis, Thaebes, Alexandria,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iudges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in all countries to execute lawes</note> and other citties of <hi>Egipt,</hi> of the which 30. they elected one to be chiefe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Among the Grecians, the generall Iudges called <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phictions,</hi> which sate twise in the yeare, once at <hi>Trozaena</hi> in the spring time, and in the Autumne, in the Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> in <hi>Isthmos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many countries women for their wisedome and knowledge, were admitted to sit in counsell, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Persians with King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who in any great cause of counsell, would sende for <hi>Artemisia,</hi>

Queene of <hi>Caria,</hi> whose counsell he found so wise, that chiefly among all the Princes of <hi>Persia</hi> in many causes he allowed and followed her counsell.</p>
            <p>So the Queenes in <hi>Egipt,</hi> altogether ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the whole estate of the kingdome, to whom greater honour and homage was giuen, rather then to the kings of <hi>Egipt,</hi> for that the whole state of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">Of counsell and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> was rather gouerned by the Queenes then by the Kings.</p>
            <p>Women among the Lacedemonians were not only admitted in publike counsell, to sit and determine in courts, but also sent for to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sult in secret matters of state with the Senators.</p>
            <p>The old Gaules in the time of <hi>Haniball,</hi> in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betweene them and the Carthagineans, if the breach of the lawes, or any league broken were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Gaules, the women should determine a satisfaction to the Carthagineans; if any offence grew by the Carthagineans, the Senators of <hi>Carthage</hi> should satisfie the Gaules.</p>
            <p>It is as well saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> if men gouerne like wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that women should gouerne. <hi>Quid inter est vtrùm faeminae, an qui gubernant, gubernentur à faeminis.</hi>

            <p>

            <p>And though the authoritie of the kings were taken away, and derogated in many countries, yet the force and power of the law stood in effect, though the change thereof were dangerous.</p>

            <p>The disobedience of <hi>Saul</hi> against the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord was such, that he lost both his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and his life.</p>

            <p>We might thinke that the gathering of stickes, and the eating of a peece of bread were but small faults, that thereby the one should be stoned, and the other killed of a Lyon, had it not bene forbidden by the lawe.</p>
            <p>So such men suppose <hi>Adams</hi> fault to be but little, that for earing of an Apple in Paradise, not onely he, but his posteritie after him should loose Paradise, but as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen, by their disobedience lost heauen, so <hi>Adam</hi> by his disobedience lost Paradise.</p>
            <p>The Lorde spared not Kings for breach of the law, as <hi>Oza,</hi> and <hi>Ozias</hi> both kings, the one for vnreuerent handling of the Arke, vsurping the Leuites Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">The law of the Lorde for breach of his lawes.</note> the lawe, was strooken with sudden death; and the other for burning incense against the lawe, which was the Priestes Office, was strooken with leprosie.</p>

for his incredulitie before the people, he died for it in mount <hi>Hor.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>So seuere the lawe of the Lord was, that 50000. <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samites</hi> died for looking into the Arke.</p>

               <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for offering strange <note place="margin">Nadab and Abihu.</note> fire before the Lord against the lawe, were destroyed by fire from heauen.</p>
            <p>Hence grew the ceremoniall lawes of the Gentiles, touching their religion and sacrifices to their Gods. So the women that attended the fire on the aultar of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> in <hi>Delphos,</hi> were seuerely punished, if by any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence it happened to be extinguished, neither might that fire being so extinguished, be kindled again by any other then by the said women, and by no other fire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the beames of the sunne.</p>
            <p>The Vestall virgins in <hi>Rome,</hi> if the sacred fire of <hi>Vesta</hi> weare out by any negligence, that Vestall virgine that then attended, should be brought <hi>Per Regem sacrorum</hi> to the Bishop to be whipt, neither might any fire be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled againe to the goddesse <hi>Vesta,</hi> but by the heate of the Sunne, neither might they sweare by any other then by the name of <hi>Vesta:</hi> the like ceremonies they vsed to <hi>Minerua</hi> in <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So among the Persians, Assyrians and Chaldeans, they worship their sacred fire, <hi>Vt Deorum maximum</hi> on their aultars, seeming to follow <hi>Moses</hi> lawe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zaleucus</hi> an auncient Lawe-maker among the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creans, <note place="margin">The lawe of Zaleucus for breach of the lawe.</note> brought vp with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Phylosopher, made a lawe against adulterers, that both the eyes of the adulterer should be pulled out, which being broken

by his eldest sonne, though all the Locreans ioyntly en treated for <hi>Zaleucus</hi> sonne, yet said he the lawe must no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be broken; and to satisfie the lawe, <hi>Zaleucus</hi> pulled one of his sonnes eyes out, and an other of his owne, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe a natural father to his sonne, &amp; a iust Iudge, to performe the lawes which hee made to the Locre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; so seuerely were they punished that brake the lawes, or sought to breake the lawes among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
            <p>Those people said <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> do better which keepe the lawes they haue (though they be worse) then often changed for better, <hi>Obseruatio legum &amp; morum tutissima,</hi>

            <p>Thus were they in auncient time instructed by the law of nature to loue one another, and to vse iustice and charitie.</p>
            <p>A Heathen man could say almost so much, <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia non vult falli nec fallere potest;</hi> that a wise man neither <note place="margin">Cic. de fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. 5.</note> can, nor will be deceiued.</p>

            <p>Among the Romaines for the space of 300. yearer, welnigh after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> they had no lawes

Tables, the maister of the seruant was <note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> free; for a theefe that cannot make restitution for his theft, must be solde, according to <hi>Moses</hi> lawe.</p>
            <p>The seuerest lawe among the Romanes, was <hi>Lex Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> which appointed iust punishment for treason, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and theft: by <hi>Lex Iulia</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> theft was as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely <note place="margin">Iulius lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst theft.</note> punished as adulterie, and adulterie punished as treason, for the lawe saith, a man must not robbe, for theeues are accursed, men must haue no conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with theeues.</p>
            <p>Also there was a lawe in <hi>Lycia,</hi> that if a free man should steale any thing, he should loose his freedome, and become a bond-seruant to him of whome hee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9246:57"/>
stole it, and by the lawe of <hi>Lycia</hi> neuer after to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his libertie, but to liue as a bondman all his life time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bocchoris</hi> lawe in <hi>Egipt</hi> was, that if any wayfaring man finde a man in daunger of his life, and so to be slain by theeues and robbers, and not helpe him, eyther by his sloathfulnesse or negligence, if he could, hee was by the lawe of <hi>Bocchoris</hi> guiltie of death, because hee did not ayde and helpe him with all meanes possible hee <note place="margin">Bocchoris lawes.</note> could.</p>
            <p>Againe if a man were robd by theeues on the way, though he were not killed, and not rescued of any that could, and neglecting to follow after the theeues, hee or they (by the lawe of <hi>Bocchoris)</hi> were punished and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a certaine number of stripes, and kept without victualls three daies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Licurgus</hi> made no lawes in <hi>Sparta</hi> against theft, for it was lawfull by <hi>Licurgus</hi> lawe, among the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to vse theft, vnlesse the partie were taken with the <note place="margin">Theft left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished by Licurgus lawe</note> theft; which if he were, he should be seuerely punished, following the maner and custome of the Egiptians, and the old Germanes, which had no lawe written against theft, but left vnpunished, and therfore there is no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, where there is no lawe.</p>
            <p>There was then, and is now a greater kinde of theft then stealing among diuers nations, which is vsurie, forbidden by the lawes of God, as well as theft, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bocchoris</hi> lawe, which banished vsurie, the lawe was <note place="margin">Bocchoris law against vsurie.</note> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> that the creditors might arrest the bodies of the dead for debts, and that they should be vnburied till the <note place="margin">Illiad. 1.</note> depts were paid, <hi>Pecunia est enim anima &amp; sanguis mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> which lawe was abrogated by <hi>Bocchoris,</hi> that debts onely should be paid of the goods of the debters, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9246:57"/>
not their bodies to be imprisoned, for that they should be alwaies readie for defence of their countrey, and not imprisoned either for debt, or vsurie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solon</hi> brought this lawe from <hi>Egipt</hi> vnto <hi>Athens,</hi> and called it <hi>Sysacthia,</hi> against vsurers. This lawe was after executed in the market place of <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Agis,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely <note place="margin">Solons lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vsurie called Sysac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia.</note> hated vsurie, where hee burnt all the vsurers writing tables, of which fire <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was wont to say, that he neuer lawe a better fire in <hi>Egipt, Persia,</hi> nor in <hi>Greece,</hi> then when <hi>Agis</hi> burnt all the writing tables of <note place="margin">Diod. sic. lib. 2 cap. 3.</note> the vsurers in the market place at <hi>Athens,</hi> for before <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> brought this law from <hi>Egipt</hi> vnto <hi>Athens,</hi> dead mens bodies might be arrested, and an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the magistrate called <hi>Zeteta,</hi> for satisfaction of debts <note place="margin">Zeteta.</note> in <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Solons</hi> lawe was, that no man should cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the sonne while the father liued, &amp; to auoyd further <note place="margin">Solons lawe.</note> daungers, least the sonne should practise against the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which children do vse against their parents) the law was, that he which would c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>dit the sonne, during the life of the father, should haue no action against the son, after the fathers death.</p>
            <p>So hatefull was vsurie among (welnigh) all nations, that where punishment of theft was but double, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vsurie was quadruple, and therfore <hi>Lu. Genutius,</hi> Tribune of the people in <hi>Rome,</hi> abrogated former lawes of vsurie in <hi>Rome. Lucullus</hi> in his victorie ouer <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lucullus and Caro banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vsurie.</note> among other Romanie lawes which hee gaue them, set all <hi>Asia</hi> free, and at libertie from vsurie. So <hi>Cato</hi> made a lawe, that no vsurer should dwell within the prouince <note place="margin">Alex. Neapol. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> of <hi>Cicilia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also <hi>Licurgus</hi> made a lawe to bannish vsurie so farre from <hi>Sparta,</hi> that it should neuer be named, <note place="margin">Licurgus.</note>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:9246:58"/>
nor spoken of within <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> among the Hebrewes was, Thou shalt not giue to vsurie to thy brother, as vsurie of <note place="margin">Moses lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vsurie.</note> money, vsurie of meate, or vsurie of any thing that is put to vsurie, thou shalt take no vsurie or aduantage of him, but thou shalt feare thy God, that thy brother may liue with thee; if thou take thy neighbours ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pledge, thou shalt restore it vnto him before the <note place="margin">Deut. 23.</note> sunne goe downe, ye shall not oppresse the poore with vsurie.</p>
            <p>An example therof in the Gospell, a seruant ought to his maister ten thousand talents, and vpon intreatie his maister loosed him, and forgaue him the debt, but that <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> seruant went out, and found one of his fellowes that ought him an hundred pence, laid hands on him, tooke him by the throate, and cast him into prison without compassion, vntill the debts were payd.</p>
            <p>There is an other kinde of theft which is not the least, to steale the good name and fame of any man by scandalous tongues, and therefore it was not lawfull in <note place="margin">Solons lawe against nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names.</note> 
               <hi>Athens,</hi> not so much as to reach the longest finger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any man, for it was a note of infamie, as though he should call him <hi>Catapygos,</hi> a dog or a beast. <note place="margin">Catapygos.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Likewise if any would call a man <hi>Hodidocos,</hi> or Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <note place="margin">Obscessor via<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>So to call a man in <hi>Egipt</hi> an asse, an action might bee had by the lawe of <hi>Bocchoris</hi> against the partie. <note place="margin">Bocchoris law</note>
            </p>
            <p>The like lawe was in <hi>Persia</hi> against those that would call a man a coward.</p>
            <p>The lawe of Christ set downe in the Gospell, is, that whosoeuer calleth his brother <hi>Racha,</hi> or a foole, is in danger of iudgement: so it is commaunded by the lawe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9246:58"/>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> that none shall goe vp and downe with slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous tongues, to tell tales among the people, for the <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.</note> punishment of this fault is stripes, or amerciaments by the same lawe.</p>
            <p>And therefore he that will see good dayes, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine his tongue from euil, and his lips that they speake <note place="margin">Psal. 33.</note> no guile, saith the Prophet, <hi>Liber a anima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meam à labijs ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis &amp; lingua dolosae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tongue is fire, yea a world of wickednesse, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth the whole body, it setteth on fire the curse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wee put bittes into the horses mouthes, that they should obey vs, and we turne them about as we list.</p>
            <p>And therfore saith <hi>Xenophon, Omnibus animalibus faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Xenoph. 1. Paed.</note> 
               <hi>est quàm hominibus imperitare,</hi> all creatures are more obedient to the lawe then man.</p>
            <p>Shippes which though they bee so great, yet are they turned about with a very small rudder; our of one mouth proceedeth blessings &amp; cursings, with the which <note place="margin">Iames cap. 3.</note> we blesse God, and curse men, which are made after the similitude of God; all things are tamed by man, but the tongue can no man tame, for it is an vnruly euill, full of deadly poison.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt not slaunder thy neighbour, neither shalt thou hate thy brother in thy heart. These and many such iudiciall lawes are set downe in the lawe of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore said <hi>Salomon,</hi> he that keepeth his mouth, <note place="margin">Pro. 13.</note> keepeth his life, but the wicked mans tongue is full of slaunder and shame; <hi>Futiles in vtiles,</hi> and therefore it is great wisedome not to beleeue any thing rashly, for it was euer good counsel, <hi>Caue cui credas neruus sapientiae est,</hi> and therefore the punishment of the tongue, was in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers countries diuersly punished.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> the great reading certaine
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9246:59"/>
secret Letters, suffered his onely friend <hi>Ephestion</hi> to read the same Letters, and after <hi>Ephestion</hi> had read them, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> tooke his signet &amp; laide it on <hi>Ephestions</hi> mouth, as a seale to keep silence, and said, <hi>Anima consilij secretum.</hi> And therefore the punishment of the tongue, was in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers countries, diuersly punished.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Persia</hi> the tongue should be cut off, and nailed to a post, or to a pillar, in the market place.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Egipt</hi> the tongue should be cut off, and sowed vpon the souldiers helmet; in offending the lawe of armes, or for offending the state, hangd vpon their hats or caps. In other places for their blasphemy, itshould be hangd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pinnacles of temples, or on walles of cities to be eaten of fowles of the aire. The like lawe made <hi>Plato</hi> for the <note place="margin">Platoes lawe.</note> hand that kild it selfe, that it should not be buried.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> being perswaded by his friends, that one <hi>Aelianus</hi> that spake hard of the Emperor should be punished for his ill tongue, answered, No more but <note place="margin">Suet. in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusto.</note> 
               <hi>Aelianus</hi> shal know that <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> hath also a toong.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Ramyrus</hi> king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> being so soft and so gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of nature, that many of his Nobles had him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for his softnesse, but he at length in the midst of their contempt and of his softnesse, caused eleuen of them to be beheaded in the citie of <hi>Osca;</hi> saying, <hi>Nescit vulpecula ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quo ludat;</hi> for it is an old saying, It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to plaie with Lyons; <hi>Leone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vellicare periculosum est.</hi>

            <p>We read of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> after hee had taken <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> after such slaughter of men, women, virgins, children, and Infants, that within three daies there was slain foure <note place="margin">The pride and ambition of Antiochus.</note> score thousand, and as many solde as were slaine, and 4000. taken prisoners, after he had taken a thousand and eight hundred talents out of the Temple, he went with such a haughtie proude minde from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> as <hi>Xerxes</hi> went from <hi>Persia</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> thinking in his pride to make men saile vpon drie lande, and to walke vpon the seas, but as they liued both, so they dyed, the one miserably murthered in his owne country, the other most miserably dyed out of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>These and such ambitious men, in seeking to build their great name and fame on earth, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> they become so odious and contemptible in their own country, as <hi>Ammon</hi> was in <hi>Persia</hi> among the Iewes, whose name when the Iewes heard of, they beate <note place="margin">Ammon.</note> and stampt on the ground with theyr feete, because they would not heare his name: for the like ambition the name of <hi>Hercules</hi> might not be mentioned among the Dardanians, nor the name of <hi>Achilles</hi> among the <note place="margin">Hercules.</note> Taenedians, for that they destroyed both these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. <note place="margin">Achilles.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To forget these great iniuries, <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> made a lawe in <hi>Athens</hi> called <hi>Amnestia,</hi> because the crueltie of the thirtie tyrants, which caused the children to <note place="margin">The lawe of Thrasibulus in Athens cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Amnestia.</note> daunce in their fathers bloud in <hi>Athens,</hi> might no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee remembred, least by reuenging of the same,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9246:69"/>
more bloud should be lost, much like the Dictators in <hi>Rome,</hi> who might put to death any free Cittizen at theyr pleasure. So did <hi>Opimius,</hi> vsurping the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Dictator, beeing but Consul, caused <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Fuluius,</hi> and diuers other Cittizens to bee slaine.</p>
            <p>But after <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> became the first Emperour, and <hi>Perpetuus</hi> Dictator, the other Emperours that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, claiming the like authoritie, made such lawes in <hi>Rome</hi> as pleased themselues, <hi>Sit fortitudo nostra lex iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiae,</hi> for when the honour of the Senators were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and past by <hi>Hortensius</hi> lawe vnder the Emperour <hi>Caesar</hi> and his successors, that they onely made such lawes as were called <hi>Placita Principum,</hi> without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Senators, or counsel of the people, which were accepted as lawes among the Romaines, during the time of the Emperors, as <hi>Iusregis</hi> was in <hi>Rome</hi> during the raigne of the Kings.</p>
            <p>The law called <hi>Plebiscita,</hi> made by the Tribune of the people, could not be allowed vnlesse it were confirmed by the Senators, neither could the law made by Senators <note place="margin">Alex Neapol. lib. 6. cap. 23.</note> called <hi>Senatus Consultus,</hi> be allowed without the voyce of the people.

            <p>None might in auntient time among the Romanes, be elected Dictator, Consul, Praetor, or Censor, vnlesse he were one of the Patritians, but in time it grew, that the Patricians and the Plebeians were ioyned together, that one Consul should be chosen by the Patritians, the other by the people.</p>

This lawe called <hi>Amnestia,</hi> was afterwards brought to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> and renewed by <hi>Cicero,</hi> that they should forget the murthering of <hi>Caesar,</hi> least a greater harme should come by reuenging of <hi>Caesars</hi> death by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres, <hi>Omni enim populo inest malignum quiddam &amp; querulum in imperautes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This lawe was put in practise by the Iewes in <hi>Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah,</hi> for the trecherous murthering of <hi>Godoliah</hi> by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious <hi>Ismael,</hi> for they thought it best to put vp iniuries by forgetting of iniuries.</p>
            <p>But the lawe of <hi>Draco</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> was, not to forget iniuries, as <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> lawe was, neither to please the people, as the lawe of <hi>Gracchus</hi> was in <hi>Rome,</hi> but seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to punish the people, and that with such seueritie, that it was called according to his name, <hi>Lex Draco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> the lawe of a Dragon; for the least fault in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> by the lawe of <hi>Draco,</hi> during the time of his raigne, was punished with death, who for his lawes was <note place="margin">Draco strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Egina.</note> strangled in <hi>Aegina</hi> vppon the Theaters, by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>So that in <hi>Rome,</hi> for the lawes which <hi>Gracchus</hi> made to please the people, he himselfe, and diuers others were slaine. So in <hi>Athens</hi> and in diuers other places, by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people too much by cruell lawes, they were strangled, killed, and slaine of the people for their lawes, as <hi>Draco</hi> was in <hi>Aegina,</hi> and <hi>Perillus</hi> in <hi>Agregutum,</hi> who <note place="margin">Perillus died by those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he inuented.</note> found out the brazen bull to please the tyrant <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who decreed by lawe a reward to those that would find out new kindes of torments and tortures to punish of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Xerxes</hi> promised great gifts and rewards to any that would finde out diuers straunge kinds of pleasures to feed his humour, as an Epicure.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But among the Lacedemonians the maner was, that they that should be made free, should be crowned, with greene branches made of boughes of trees, and should <note place="margin">Alex.

            <p>The ceremonies and manners of making free men among the auncient Romanes was, that the seruants or bondmen should come with their heads shaued before the Romane Praetor, and there the Serieant at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Praetor, should strike them on the head three times, with a little rodde or wande, called <hi>Virgula vindictae,</hi> and they that were so made free, were called <hi>Manumissi vindicta.</hi> But if they were souldiers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the enemie, and had lost the libertie of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

if afterwards they returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> they should againe receiue their freedome, <hi>Iure Postliminij.</hi> But both those which were made free, <hi>Cum virga vindictae,</hi> the rod of reuenge, and they which were taken by the enemies, should goe vnto the Temple of <hi>Feronea,</hi> and there they should receiue <hi>Libertorum munia.</hi> After that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines became Lords of <hi>Italy,</hi> they graunted <hi>Ius latij</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Italians, which was the lawe then vsed within the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after they had conquered the most part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affrike,</hi> both <hi>Affrike</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> had <hi>Ius la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinitatis,</hi> which was the auntient law among the old Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians to be ruled &amp; gouerned by, for the Romans would haue their Romaine lawes and Romaine magistrates to gouern those prouinces which they got with the sword.</p>
            <p>Among the Romains, during the time of their kings, they had no law but the sentence and iudgement of the king, in any great cause, and this lawe was called <hi>Lex cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riata</hi>
