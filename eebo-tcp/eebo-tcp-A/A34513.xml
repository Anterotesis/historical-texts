            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A COPY OF THE FOURE REASONS TO diſwade the King from his journey into <hi>Scotland</hi> for fourteene dayes longer.</head>
            <byline>Delivered by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hollis</hi> to the Lords at a Conference, <date>7. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1641.</date>
            </byline>
            <opener>M. Hollis <hi>went up to the Lords with this Conference from the Houſe of Commons.</hi>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am commanded to put you in mind what hath paſſed upon this occaſion before, concerning the Kings journey to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that both Houſes did Petition his Majeſty not to begin his journey till the tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and to acquaint the Scots Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners therewith, who afterwards deſired this Houſe to expreſſe their reſolutions in the affirmative, upon which the Houſe of Commons paſſed a reſolution, that then if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty pleaſed to goe, they would ſubmit unto it.</p>
            <p>I am commanded to declare unto your Lordſhips that the Houſe of Commons is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſubmit unto his Majeſties good pleaſure in all things: but ſuch is the preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this buſineſſe, as it now ſtandeth; that they are enforced to preſent ſome further conſiderations to your Lordſhips.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Firſt,</label> 
               <hi>That when they gave this aſſent, they were in hope both Armies would have been disbanded by that time; but though there hath been all poſsible meanes uſed to that end, yet it could not be effected: ſo the ſame inconvenience doth ſtill continue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Secondly,</label> 
               <hi>The treaty cannot in ſo ſhort a time be finiſhed, being returned from</hi> Scotland <hi>but three dayes ſince: but ſince it is ready to be finiſhed, and moneys are provided, the Armies will be disbanded by that time we deſire his Majeſty to take his journey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Thirdly,</label> 
               <hi>The diſtempers and jealouſies of the Kingdome are ſuch that they cannot be compoſed by paſsing ſome Act, unleſſe his Majeſty ſtay the deſired time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Fourthly,</label> 
               <hi>No courſe is yet taken for the government of the Kingdome in his Majeſties abſence, there being ſo many weighty things to be taken into conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe reaſons the Houſe of Commons have thought fit to move your Lordſhips to joyne with us in a Petition to his Majeſty to ſtay his journey for 14. dayes longer, and we make no doubt but our brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> will conſider the ſtreight we are in, and for our ſafety condeſcend to our deſires. And if his Majeſty yeeld thereunto, then we ſhall deſire your Lordſhips to joyne with us by ſome expreſſe meſſenger to the Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Kings ſtay for that time, which we hope will give them ſatisfaction.</p>
