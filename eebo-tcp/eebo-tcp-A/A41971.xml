            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Retnerus</hi> was here in <hi>England</hi> with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and preſented her with a faire manuſcript in Latine, deſcribing therein the whole future Hiſtory of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> here and there limning in water colours, ſome principall paſſages, for tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world of after ages. Doctor <hi>Nevell</hi> then Deane, or Clerke of the Cloſet, and very intimate with the Queen, got this Book of Her, and beſtowed it on the Library of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where that hath been publique to the eye of all perſons everſince, till about five years ſince it was much defaced.</p>
            <p>The Library keeper hath it almoſt all by heart, who reſorting (after his expulſion) to this City, and keeping company with ſome Sequeſtred Reverend Fellows of that Houſe, have refreſhed their memories ſo well concerning what they had ſeene and read before, that they as well as he, were confident of what followeth.</p>
            <p>1. In his predictions he deſcribeth the troubles of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and the Election of the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> King, <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> by name, to be King of <hi>Polonia;</hi> by which he ſhould irrecoverably looſe his owne Inheritance.</p>
            <p>2. That of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> uſurpers race, there ſhould be one <hi>Guſtavus Adolpus</hi> by name, that ſhould take an hint from the diſtractions in <hi>Germany,</hi> to enter the Empire with a ſmall Army, and there roule into a mighty force, and fight many Battels proſperouſly, but at the laſt in a pitched field he ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>3. That about that time ſhould raigne another <hi>Rex Septentrionalis nomine Carolus, qui ducet in uxorem Mariam Papiſticam ex qua evadet Regnum omnium infaeliciſſimus. Tunc Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus ipſius ditionis eliget alium ſibi Regem Comitem qui durabit in imperio tres annos aut eo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. X. F. A. X.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; poſtea idem populus eliget alium Regem Equitem non ejuſdem familiae nec honoris, qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudet omnia ſub pedibus ſuis aliquanto longiore tempore, &amp; poſt hunc nullum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulo poſt apparebit quidam Carolus ex Carolo deſcendens ab immenſa claſſe in litus ditionis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris ſui, &amp; cum auxiliariis Danencis, Swedicis, Holandicis, Francicis, &amp; Hiſpanicis proſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabit adverſarios ſuos, &amp; adminiſtrabit imperium ſuum perfaeliciſſime &amp; erit Carolo magno major.</hi>
