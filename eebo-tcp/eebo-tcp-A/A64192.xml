            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>A <hi>Poland Pedlar</hi> went upon a day,</l>
            <l>Vnto a Romish Priest to learne to pray;</l>
            <l>The Priest said Pedlar get thee to the cloister</l>
            <l>And learne the <hi>Ave</hi> and the <hi>Pater Noster.</hi>
            </l>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pedl.</speaker>
               <l>Now good sir <hi>Iohn</hi> (quoth he) what talk is that</l>
               <l>I heare you speak, but God in Heauen knowes what.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>It is that worthy holy Lattin letter</l>
               <l>Doth please the Lord wel and our lady better.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pedl.</speaker>
               <l>Now good Sir Iohn, I know not what they be</l>
               <l>The Lattin tongue is heathen Greeke to me.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>Pedlar if thou to me wilt but repaire</l>
               <l>Within one Month, I`le teach thee Lattin Prayer.</l>
               <l>And though thou understand not what thou sayst,</l>
               <l>Thou shalt speake pretty Lattin when thou prayest</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pedlar</speaker>
               <l>To pray so sir, is onely but in saying,</l>
               <l>In words, nor sence, a prating not a praying;</l>
               <l>Shall I that am a man of perfect age,</l>
               <l>Talke like a witlesse parret in a Cage.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>A parret can but prattle for her part,</l>
               <l>But towards God hath neither mind or heart.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94030:3"/>Then seeing I have head and heart to pray,</l>
               <l>Shall not my heart know what my tongue doth say</l>
               <l>For when my tongue talkes, if my heart mis-carry,</l>
               <l>How quickly I may marre your <hi>Ave Mary?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And I sit having many things to seeke,</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pedl.</speaker>
               <l>Then if I think one thing and speak another,</l>
               <l>I wrong my selfe, and Christ, and his blest Mother;</l>
               <l>For when I pray they would my pack repaire,</l>
               <l>Your <hi>Ave mary</hi> is a fruitlesse prayer.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>The Latin prayers are but generall heads,</l>
               <l>For our Reliefes in all our wants and needs:</l>
               <l>The Latin serves us as a Liturgie,</l>
               <l>As curious Arts directs Chirurgery,</l>
               <l>And in that language Masse is said and sung,</l>
               <l>For private things pray in thy Mother tongue.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ped.</speaker>
               <l>Then I must have a tongue, sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> for either,</l>
               <l>1 for the Mother and 1 for the Father.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prie.</speaker>
               <l>Thinkst thou the Mother doth not know such small things,</l>
               <l>Christ is her Son man, and he tells her all things.</l>
               <l>But where did that blest Virgin learne her Latin,</l>
               <l>For in her daies was neither Masse nor Martin,</l>
               <l>Nor yet one Priest that Latin then could speake,</l>
               <l>For holy words were <hi>Hebrew</hi> then or <hi>Greeke,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>She never was at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor kist Popes feet,</l>
               <l>How came she by the Masse faine would I weet.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>Pedlar, if thou beleeve the Legendary,</l>
               <l>The Masse is older farre then Christ or <hi>Mary,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For all the Patriarkes both more or lesse,</l>
               <l>And great <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> himselfe said Masse.</l>

               <speaker>Pedl.</speaker>
               <l>But good sir priest, spake al these Fathers Latin</l>
               <l>And said they Masse in golden Coapes or Satin;</l>
               <l>Could they speake Latin long e're Latin grew,</l>
               <l>(For without Latin no Masse can be true)</l>
               <l>And you that would inforce us to this taske,</l>
               <l>Me thinkes 'tis like a may-game or a masque.</l>

               <speaker>Priest.</speaker>
               <l>Well Pedlar thou art too too curious,</l>
               <l>Thy pur-blinde Zeal's fervent, but furious,</l>
               <l>I rather would a hundred monkes direct,</l>
               <l>Then such an ignorant of thy mad sect;</l>
               <l>This thou must know, this cannot be deni'd,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> govern'd all when Christ was crucifi'd.</l>

               <l>And grew so honest, and so holy-hearted,</l>
               <l>That now our Emperour is turn'd to a pope,</l>
               <l>Whose Holines (as you have heard I hope,</l>
               <l>Hath made a Law that all the world must pray</l>
               <l>In Latin language to the Lord each day;</l>
               <l>He's Christs full Vicar, and Ile boldly say,</l>
               <l>That what he doth command we must obey,</l>
               <l>He bids us pray in Latin, even so</l>
               <l>We must doe, where we understand or no,</l>
               <l>He hath full power to confound or save,</l>

               <l>He cannot make a man an Ape, I hope,</l>

               <l>As I have done to you (sir <hi>Iohn</hi>) to day;</l>
               <l>I pray you in what tongue bade he them pray,</l>

               <l>For when those 6. score were at first convened,</l>
               <l>There was another mysterie then meaned;</l>

               <l>Of their proceedings then before the Lord:</l>
               <l>The choosing of a pastour was in hand,</l>
               <l>Which without Churches knowledge cannot stand,</l>
               <l>And so <hi>Mathias,</hi> (by the power of Heaven)</l>
               <l>By lot was tooke as one with the Eleven.</l>
               <l>Then (saies the the Text) all these together were,</l>
               <l>What all these were doth very plaine appeare,</l>
               <l>To be the 12. in the last verse before,</l>
               <l>And not make Leape Yeare of eleven verse more.</l>
               <l>To draw all backe to that hundred and twentie,</l>
               <l>Indeed this way should have tongues in plentie,</l>
               <l>They differ in 12. verses, the Text saies,</l>
               <l>Besides the time is different full 10. dayes,</l>
               <l>The first upon the day the Lord ascended,</l>
               <l>The other when the holy Ghost descended.</l>
               <l>Such glaZen arguments will bide no hammer,</l>
               <l>For they are but bad Logick and worse Grammer;</l>
               <l>As for the Holy Ghost 'tis verifide,</l>
               <l>His comming downe, unto no Law is tide;</l>
               <l>Sometimes invisible, and sometimes seene,</l>

               <l>Women (at home) have hardly leave to speake,</l>

               <l>Their husbands must permit their tongues to walke,</l>

            <p>IN the 45. and 46. leafe of the aforesaid Booke, I have read, that in the Raigne of King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, the <hi>Danes</hi> had a purpose to warre against <hi>England</hi>; to prevent which, the King <hi>William</hi> sent <hi>Helliseus</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Ramsey</hi> Embassadour into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who having ended his Embassie, as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned homeward, he was on the Sea dangerously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strest with an impetuous and terrible Tempest, so that the Master of the Ship, and all the Martiners did yeeld themselves as lost men: In which extreamitie they all prayed devoutly to our Lady for helpe, and suddenly there appeared walking on the water a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend personage in the form or likenes of a Bishop, who called the Abbot <hi>Hellizeus</hi> to him, and told him that our Lady had heard their prayers, and that shee had sent him to deliver them from the storme, and that it was her pleasure to have the day of her Conception kept holy yearely for ever on the eight day of December, which the Abbot promised to do, and presently the <hi>Angel</hi> vanished away, the Tempest ceased, the Abbot arrived safely in England, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported what he had heard, seene, and suffered; and lastly the feast was commanded to be kept on the 8. day of December accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94030:9"/>ALso in the same Booke and leafe is related, that a Cousin german of a King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who raigned I know not when, whose names were I know not what, did marry with a Lady (I know not who) at a place I know not where, did I know not why, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his wife I know not wherefore, to serve our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die I know not how; for the story lies thus, that hee was a devout and daily invocator to the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and (being newly married) the same day of the marriage the Bridegroom staid alone in the Church, remembring that hee had not that day done his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed Orisons, wherefore he sent his new Bride home, and himselfe staid in the Church to performe his devotion, where presently our Lady appeared to him, and taxed him with unkindnesse, in that hee would leave her and betake himselfe to another, but if hee would forsake his wife, and follow her in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout life and conversation, then shee promised to give him the Kingdome of Heaven, whereupon it is said, hee presently forsooke his wife and ever after was a true servant to our Lady.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94030:9"/>IN the 88. leafe I did reade of another nameles La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that dreamed she was before the shrine of our Lady on a Candlemas day, she then (as she dreamed) had a burning Candle in her hand, which Candle she three times commanded to offer to the Image of the Virgin, which shee not doing, the <hi>Angel</hi> strove with her for it, and brake it in the midst, at which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy awaked, and found halfe a Candle in her hand, which she ever after kept as a holy Relique, and with the touch of it did many Miracles, and cured a great number of diseases onely with the very touch of the said Candle.</p>
            <p>THere was a Thiefe whom they call a Knight, that had long time used to rob on the High way, by which accursed Gentle-man-like Trade, hee was grown very rich, and kept tall fellowes to attend him, who were as arrant Thieves as himself, amongst whom one that performed or served the office of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine was a Devill in the shape of a man. It fell out so, that they rob'd a holy man, who defired hee might speake with the chiefe or Master Thiefe, which being granted, the Holy man requests that hee might see all the servants together, whereupon they were called, then said the Holy man, Here are not all, and then they missed the Chamberlaine, and called him, who was no sooner come into the said blessed mans presence, Hee cryed out, saying, I am a Devill in this humane forme, who have followed this Knight a long time to destroy him for his bad Life, but I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any power over him to hurt gim, because he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94030:10"/>
did daily, with great devotion, oftentimes salute the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> leaf. 105.</p>
            <p>IN the 217. leafe there is a tale of a Monke, that was a great Lecher, who by accident was drunke and drownd in a River which he fell into, and the Devils came busily about his Carkas to carry it to Hell, but because the said Monke had used constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray to our Ladie, shee then appeared her selfe and commanded the Devils to depart, and then shee gave the soule of the Monke into his dead bodie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ever after he had a care to live honestly.</p>
            <p>IN the same 217. leafe there is a Relation of a Knight that had spent all his substance wastfully in riot, and being desperate in his wants, he would have sold his wife to the Devill for a great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; but the bargaine being made, and the good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman to be delivered to the fiend, our Ladie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her, and laid her in a sleepe, taking upon her selfe the shape of the sleeping Gentlewoman, which when the Knight would have delivered, the Devill began to roare and howle, and trembling said, that the Knight had deceived him, in bringing the Mother of God to him instead of his wise; and with that the Devill fled away, and the Knight with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance tooke his wife againe, and in conclusion our Ladie give them wealth, so that ever after they lived together lovingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94030:10"/>IN the 220. leafe it is said, that as the body of the blessed Virgin was carried towards her grave or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, that a Jew in despightfull manner laid both his hands on the Beire, and violently would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne it, when presently his hands sundred from his armes, and clave fast to the Biere, at which the Jew roard, cryed out and repented, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> commanded him to kisse the Beire, whereby hee was presently recovered, and had his hands restored to his armes againe.</p>
            <p>Also it is said, that the house that the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin dwelt in at <hi>Bethelem</hi> was removed by heavenly Angels, and carried through the aire many thousand miles over Sea and Land, to the Countrie of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> where it did remaine for a certaine time, and then it was againe removed to <hi>Laretto</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it remaines to this day, being a Holy place, much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited by Pilgrims, and (by vertue of it) many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are wrought daily.</p>

               <l>But neither they or I knew what she said,</l>
               <l>One said she canted, others said she mumbled,</l>
               <l>And still strange language from her lips she fumbled,</l>
               <l>Round run her wheele, and round her tongue did run,</l>
               <l>She mumbled and she slaver'd, and she spun;</l>
               <l>What think you now sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of this old Hussie,</l>
               <l>Where was her heart when as she was so busie.</l>
               <l>At last (said one) Dame wot you what you say,</l>
               <l>No, not (quoth she) but well I wot I pray;</l>
               <l>You pray (quoth he) and know not what I grant,</l>
               <l>Alas how can you be so ignorant.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94030:12"/>The woman, musing little at the motion,</l>
               <l>Said, ignorance is Mother of Devotion.</l>
               <l>If Ignorance be mother then (said he)</l>
               <l>Sure darknesse must her onely daughter be;</l>
               <l>Pray'd you, (quoth I) when al the time you span,</l>
               <l>What matters that, quoth she God's a good man,</l>
               <l>And knowes what I speak in the Latin tongue,</l>
               <l>Either at Matins or at Even-song.</l>
               <l>Alas, good sir, I was not this wife abus'd,</l>
               <l>Whose soule and sences all were so confus'd,</l>
               <l>You know these unknown tongues can profit no man,</l>
               <l>And one tongue is enough for any woman;</l>
               <l>But when we pray in true sinceritie,</l>
               <l>As God commands in spirit and veritie,</l>
               <l>The heart sends up the tongue as Messenger</l>
               <l>Unto the Lord, a pleasant passenger.</l>

               <l>But Pedlar, here's a prettie little Booke,</l>
               <l>Wherein if thou wilt spare the time to looke,</l>
               <l>Set forth by a good Catholicke Divine,</l>
               <l>Which out of doubt will settle thy ingine</l>
               <l>With it, thy conscience will be better fram'd,</l>
               <l>The Gag of the new Gospel it is nam'd:</l>
               <l>He clearely proves by <hi>Zacharies</hi> example,</l>
               <l>When he did sacrifice vvithin the Temple,</l>
               <l>And all the people prayd and stood vvithout,</l>
               <l>They knevv not then what tongue he spake no doubt;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Masse may be both said and sung,</l>
               <l>In other language then our mother Tongue.</l>

               <l>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> I see your holy Catholicke,</l>
               <l>Upon the Text hath put a pretty tricke,</l>
               <l>Did <hi>Zachary</hi> speake in a Latin stile,</l>
               <l>When all the people staid without the while,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94030:13"/>He was a Jew sure, and knew Hebrew well,</l>
               <l>And spake no Latin for ought you can tell;</l>
               <l>For if the people heard not what he said,</l>
               <l>Could they or you know in what tongue he pray'd</l>
               <l>Since understanding commeth by the eare,</l>
               <l>He cannot understand that doth not heare.</l>
               <l>Prove it that <hi>Zachary</hi> spake Latin, then</l>
               <l>I'le say all Monkes and Fryers are honest men.</l>
               <l>Because a learned Priest may pray in Latin,</l>
               <l>And mumble o're his Even-song, Masse, and Matin,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> a Pedlar to the Lord may pray,</l>
               <l>And know no sillable that he doth say,</l>
               <l>So when you put me to your <hi>Pater noster,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I aske an Egge when I would have an Oister.</l>
               <l>And seeing thus our Faiths doe disagree,</l>
               <l>That neither I with you, nor you with mee</l>
               <l>Can be united, with one minde and heart,</l>
               <l>I thinke it best we take our leaves and part.</l>
               <l>I'le pray that God, in Grace and mercy, would</l>
               <l>Bring all his straying Flock into his Fold.</l>
