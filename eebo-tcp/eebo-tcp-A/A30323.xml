            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ANSWER To Mr. Henry Payne's LETTER, Concerning His Majesty's
DECLARATION of INDULGENCE, Writ to the Author of the Letter to A
Dissenter.</head>
            <opener> 
               <salute>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. PAYNE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot hold asking you, how much <hi>Money</hi> you had, from
the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Paper,</hi> which you pretend to
<hi>Answer:</hi> for as you have the character of a man that deales with both
hands, so this is writ in such a manner as to make one think you were hired to
it, by the Adverse Party: but it has been indeed so ordinary to your Friends,
to write in this manner of late, that the Censures upon it are divided, both
fall heavy: some sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Sincerity others accuse them for want of a
right Understanding: for tho all are not of the pitch of the <hi>Irish
Priests</hi> Reflections, on the Bp of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells's</hi>
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was indeed <hi>Irish</hi> double refined; yet both in your Books
of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, and Policy, and even in your <hi>Poems,</hi> you seem to have
entred into such an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture with the <hi>Irish,</hi> that the thread all
over is <hi>Linsey-woollsey.</hi> You acknowledge that the Gentleman whom you
answer has a <hi>Polite Pen,</hi> and that his <hi>Letter is an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
paper, and made up of well-Composed Sentences and Periods.</hi> Yet I believe
he will hardly return you your Complement. If <hi>it</hi> was well writ, your
Party wants either Men or Judgment extreamly, in allowing you this province of
answering it. If the <hi>Paper</hi> did you some hurt, you had better have let
the Town be a litle pleased with it for a while; and have hoped that a litle
time or some new paper (tho one of its force is scarce to be expected) should
have worn it out, then to give it a new luster by such an <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Time of the Dissenters Sufferings,</hi> which you lengthen
out to 27 <hi>years,</hi> will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amount to <hi>seven.</hi> For the long
Intervals it had, in the last <hi>Reign,</hi> are not forgot: and those who
animated the latest and severest of their sufferings are such, that in good
manners you ought not to reflect on <hi>their</hi> Conduct. <hi>Opium</hi> is
as certain a <hi>poison,</hi> tho not so <hi>violent,</hi> as
<hi>Sublimate;</hi> and if more <hi>corrosive Medicines</hi> did not work, the
<hi>Design</hi> is the same, when <hi>soporiferous</hi> ones are used: since
the Patient is to be killed both ways: and it seems that all that is in debate
is, which is the safer: the accepting a present ease when the ill intent with
which it is offered, is Visible, is just as wise an <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65283:2"/> action,
as to take <hi>Opium</hi> to lay a small Distemper when one may conclude from
the <hi>dose,</hi> that he will never come out of the Sleep. So that after all,
it is plain on which side the <hi>Madness</hi> lies. The <hi>Dissenters</hi>
for a little present ease, to be enjoyed at Mercy, must concur to break down
all our hedges, and to lay us open to that Devouring <hi>Power,</hi> before
which nothing can stand that will not <hi>worship</hi> it.</p>
            <p>All that for which you reproach the <hi>Church of England</hi>
amounts to this, that a few good words, could not persuade her to destroy her
self; and to Sacrifice her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and the Laws to a party that
never has done nor ever can do the <hi>King</hi> half the service that she has
rendred him. There are some sorts of propositions that a man does not know how
to answer: nor would he be thought Ingratefull who after he had received some
Civilities from a person to whom he had done great service, could not be
prevailed with by these so far as to spare him his Wife or his Daughter. It
must argue a peculiar degree of confidence to ask things, that are above the
being either askt or granted. Our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Government</hi>
are matters that are not to be parted with to shew our good breeding: and of
all men living you ought not to pretend to <hi>Good Manners,</hi> who talk as
you do, of the <hi>Oppression</hi> of the last <hi>Reign.</hi> When the
<hi>King's</hi> Obligations to his <hi>Brother,</hi> and the share that he had
in his <hi>Councils,</hi> are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; the reproaching his
<hi>Government,</hi> has so ill a grace, that you are as Indecent in your
Flatteries as Injurious in your Reflections. And by this gratitude of yours to
the Memory of the late <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> may easily
Infer, how long all her Services would be remembred, even if she had done all
that was desired of her.</p>
            <p>I would fain know which of the <hi>Brethren of the Dissenters in
forreigne Countries sought their Relief from Rebellion.</hi> The
<hi>Germans</hi> Reformed by the Authority of their <hi>Princes,</hi> so did
the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and like wise the <hi>Switsers.</hi>
In <hi>France</hi> they maintained the Princes of the <hi>Blood</hi> against
the <hi>League:</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> the Quarrell was for <hi>Civil
liberties;</hi> Protestant and Papist concurring equally in it. You mention
<hi>Holland</hi> as an Instance that <hi>Liberty</hi> and
<hi>Infallibility</hi> can dwell together: <hi>since Papists there shew that
they can be friendly neighbours, to those whom they think in the wrong:</hi> It
is very like they would be still so in <hi>England,</hi> if they were under the
lash of the law, and so were upon their good behaviour, the Goverment being
still against them: and this has so good an effect in <hi>Holland,</hi> that I
hope we shall never depart from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pattern: some can be very
Humble Servants that would prove Imperious Masters. You say that <hi>Force</hi>
is our only <hi>Supporter:</hi> but tho there is no force of our side at
present, it does not appear that we are in such a tottering condition, as if we
had no <hi>Supporter</hi> left us. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are of our
side: and the indiscreet use of <hi>Force,</hi> when set on by our Enemies, has
rather undermined than supported us. But you have taken pains to make us grow
wiser, and to let us see our Errors, which is perhaps the only obligation that
we owe you; and we are so sensible of it, that without examining what your
Intentions may have been in it, we heartily thank you for it.</p>
            <p>I do not comprehend what your quarrell is at the <hi>squinting
Term</hi> of the <hi>next heir,</hi> as you call it; tho I do not wonder that
<hi>squinting</hi> comes in your mind whensoever you think of HER; for all
people look <hi>asquint</hi> at that which troubles them: and <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65283:2"/> 
               <hi>her</hi> being the <hi>next heir</hi> is no less the
<hi>delight</hi> of all good men, than it is your <hi>affliction:</hi> all the
pains that you take to represent <hi>her</hi> dreadful to the
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> must needs find that credit with them, that is due to the
Insinuations of an Enemy. It is very true, that as <hi>she</hi> was bred up in
our <hi>Church,</hi> she adheres to it so Eminently, as to make <hi>her</hi> to
be now our <hi>chief Ornament</hi> as we hope she will be once our <hi>main
Defence.</hi> If by <hi>the strictest form of our Church</hi> you mean an
<hi>Exemplary Piety,</hi> and a <hi>shining Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> you have given
her true <hi>Character:</hi> But your designe lies another way to make the
<hi>Dissenters</hi> form strange Ideas of her, as if she thought <hi>all
Indulgence to them Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal:</hi> But as the Gentleness of her nature is such,
that none but those who are so guilty, that all mercy to them would be a Crime,
can apprehend any thing that is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, from <hi>her,</hi> so as for the
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> her going so constantly to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Churches shews, that she can very well endure their Assemblies,
at the same time that she prefers, ours. <hi>She</hi> has also too often
expressed her dislike at the heats that have been kept up among us concerning
such Inconsiderable Differences, to pass for a <hi>Bigot</hi> or a
<hi>persecutor</hi> in such matters: and <hi>She</hi> sees both the mischief
that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion</hi> has received from their subdivisions,
and the happiness of granting a <hi>due Liberty of Conscience,</hi> where she
has so long lived, that there is no reason to make any fancy that she will
either keep up our Differences, or bear down the <hi>Dissenters</hi> with
Rigor. But because you hope for nothing from her own Inclinations, you would
have her terrified with the <hi>strong Argument of Numbers,</hi> which you
fancy will <hi>certainly secure them from her recalling the favour.</hi> But of
what side soever that Argument may be <hi>strong,</hi> sure it is not of
<hi>theirs</hi> who make but <hi>one to Two hundred:</hi> and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you
scarce expect that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> will rebel, that you may have your
<hi>Masses,</hi> and how their numbers will <hi>secure them,</hi> unless it be
by enabling them to <hi>Rebell,</hi> I cannot Imagine: this is indeed a
<hi>squinting</hi> at the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> with a witness, when you would
already muster up the Troops that must rise against <hi>her.</hi> But let me
tell you, that you know both <hi>Her</hi> Character and the <hi>Prince's</hi>
very ill that fancy, they are only to be wrought on by <hi>Fear. They</hi> are
known to your great grief; to be above that: and it must be to their own
Mercifull Inclinations, that you must owe all that you can expect under them,
but neither to their <hi>fear</hi> nor to your own <hi>Numbers.</hi> As for the
<hi>hatred and Contempt, even to the degree of being more Ridiculous then the
Mass under which you say Her way of Worship is in Holland,</hi> this is one of
those figures of speech that shew how exactly you have Studied the <hi>Iesuites
Moralls.</hi> All that come from <hi>Holland,</hi> assure us, that she is so
Universally beloved and esteemed there, that every thing that she does, is the
better thought of even because <hi>she</hi> does it. Upon the whole matter, all
that you say of the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> proves too truly that you are that for
which you reproach the <hi>Church of England,</hi> a Disciple of the Crown only
<hi>for the</hi> loaves; for if you had that respect which you pretend for the
<hi>King,</hi> you would have shewed it more upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>Nor am I so much in love with your stile, as to imitate it,
therefore I will not do you so great a pleasure, as to say the least thing that
may reflect on that <hi>Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Church of England</hi>
has taught me to <hi>reverence</hi> even after all the <hi>Disgraces</hi> 
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65283:3"/> that she has received from it: and if she were not
Insuperably restrained by her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, instead of the <hi>Thin Muster</hi>
with which you reproach <hi>her, she</hi> could soon make so <hi>thick</hi> a
one as would make the <hi>Thinnes</hi> of yours, very visible upon so unequall
a division of the Nation: But she will neither be threatned nor laughed out of
her <hi>Religion</hi> and her <hi>loyalty:</hi> tho such insultings as she
meets with, that almost pass all humane Patience, would tempt men that had a
less fixed principle of submission, to make their Enemies feel to their cost,
that they owe all the Triumphs they make, more to <hi>our Principles,</hi> than
to their own <hi>Force.</hi> Their laughing at <hi>our</hi> Doctrine of <hi>non
resistance,</hi> lets us see, that it would be none of <hi>theirs</hi> under
the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> at whom you <hi>Squint,</hi> if the <hi>strong Argument
of Numbers</hi> made you not apprehend that <hi>Two Hundred to one</hi> would
prove an Unequal Match.</p>
            <p>As for your <hi>Memorandums,</hi> I shall answer them as short as
you give them</p>
            <p>1. It will be hard, to persuade people, that a Decision in favour
of the <hi>Dispencing Power,</hi> flowing from <hi>Iudges</hi> that are both
<hi>made,</hi> and <hi>payed,</hi> and that may be <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> at
<hi>pleasure,</hi> will amount to the <hi>recognising of that Right by
law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It will be hard to persuade the world, that the <hi>Kings</hi>
adhering to his <hi>Promises,</hi> and his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> and to the
known <hi>Lawes</hi> of the land, would make him <hi>Felo de se.</hi> The
following of different methods were the likelier way to it, if it were not for
the <hi>Loyalty of the Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It will be very easy to see the use of continuing the
<hi>Test</hi> by <hi>Law;</hi> since all those that break thro it, as well as
the <hi>Iudges,</hi> who have authorised their Crimes, are still liable for all
they do: and after all your <hi>huffing,</hi> with the <hi>Dispencing
Power,</hi> we do not doubt but the apprehension of an after reckoning sticks
<hi>deep</hi> somewhere, you say, <hi>it may be supposed, that the aversion of
a Protestant King to the Popish party, will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exclude them, even
without the Test.</hi> But it must be confessed, that you take all possible
care, to confirm that <hi>Aversion</hi> so far, as to put it beyond a <hi>it
may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi> And it seems you understand <hi>Christs</hi>
Prerogative, as wel as the <hi>Iudges</hi> did the <hi>Kings,</hi> that fancy
the <hi>Test</hi> is against it: it is so suteable to the nature of all
<hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to take Assurances of <hi>those</hi> who are admitted to
Places of Trust, that you do very ill to appeal to an <hi>Impartial
