            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Men that were going to their labours were compelled (ſeeing ſo dreadfull an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my approching) to flye backe to their houſes, yet before they could enter, death ſtood at the dores ready to receiue them. In a ſhort tyme did whole villages ſtand like Iſlands (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed rounde with Waters) and in a more ſhort time were thoſe Iſlands vndiſcouera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and no where to be found. The tops of trees and houſes onely appeared (eſpecially there where the Countrey lay lowe,) as if at the beginning of the world townes had been builte in the bottome of the Sea, and that people had plaide the huſbandmen vnder the Waters.</p>
               <p>Who would not haue thought this had bin a ſecond <hi>Deluge</hi>! for (at one time theſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places were ſunke cleane out of ſight. <hi>Hunsfielde</hi> (a Market Towne in the ſayde Shire) was quite drowned. <hi>Grantham</hi> a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage vtterly ouer-flowne. <hi>Kenhouſe</hi> another village couered all ouer. <hi>Kingſon</hi> a thyrd vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage likewiſe lies buried in ſalt Water. So (beſides other ſmall cottages ſtanding in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) is <hi>Brian Downe</hi> a Village quite conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Adde vnto theſe peopled places, the loſſe of Marſhes, Corne-fieldes, Paſtures, Meddowes, and ſo forth, more then can hee numbred: the miſery of it no man can Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11448:5"/>In this ciuill Warres betweene the Land and the Sea, many Men, women, and Children, loſt their liues: to ſaue which, ſome climbed vppe to the tops of the houſes, but the rage of the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les tide grew ſo ſtrong, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in many, yea moſt of the Villages aforenamed, the Foundations of the buildlngs being waſhed away, the whole frame fell down, and they dyed in the waters: Others got vp into trees, but the trees had their rootes vnfaſtened by the ſelfe-ſame deſtroyer, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynted barnes and houſes, and their laſt refuge was patiently to die.</p>
               <p>A lamentable ſpectacle was it, to beholde whole heards of Cattle, ſtruggling for life with the flouds, Oxen in great numbers were earyed away with the ſtreame, and looked like ſo many Whales in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea: their bellowing made a noiſe in the water as if it had bin a tempeſt, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea had roared. The flocks of Sheep that are vtterly deſtroied by this Land-wracke are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, none knowes the loſſe for the preſent but the owners of them: But the whole land wil I feare feele the ſmart.</p>
               <p>A number of moſt ſtrange ſhapes of daunger did this monſtrous byrth of waters bring forth: of which (for the rarenes) I will ſet downe ſome, and none but thoſe that are true. There was a poore Man (a Houſholder) dwelling in one of the Villages aforenamed, heaing ſeauen Children: who (in this generall perill) not knowing howe to beſtirre himſelfe, was deſirous to ſaue ſo much of his goods as poſſibly hee could: But the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtreame multiplying more and more

At laſt the danger that had rounde about (and within doores) ſet vpon him and his family, was ſo great, that hee could neither defend that his deereſt Childe, nor the reſt, but hauing much ado to get life for himſelfe, hee left them and hys whole houſhold periſhing in the torrent, he getting vp to the top of the houſe, and ſo eſcaping. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant likewiſe was found ſwimming in a Cradle, ſome mile or two fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where it was knowen to be kept, and ſo was preſerued, for the Cradle was not of wicker as ours are here, but of ſtrong thicke bordes, cloſely ioynted together, &amp; that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the infants life. The ricks of peaſe in diuers places being vndermined at the bottomes, were lifted vp mainely from the ground, and ſwum vp &amp; downe in the whole bulke, amongſt which a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Nay which is more ſtrange, conies in great numbers being driuen out of their borroughes by the tyde, were ſeene to ſit for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the backs of ſheepe, as they ſwom vp &amp; down and at laſt were drowned with them.</p>
               <p>A poore ſhepheard likewiſe being in the fielde, ſome of his ſheepe were ſtrayed from the reſt, when the waters began to come in vpon the Countrey, which he perceiuing, ran with all ſpeede to fetche
