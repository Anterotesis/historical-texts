         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DECLARATION
OF
M<hi rend="sup">R</hi> W. LENTHALL. Esq.
SPEAKER of the House of Commons, being the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and grounds that moved him to absent
himselfe from attending the service
on Friday, <date>July 30.
1647.</date>
            </head>
            <p>ALthough it may happily be contrary to the
Expectation of some, that J attend not
the service of the House of Commons at
this time, as J have constantly done for
almost seven yeares last past; yet can it
not be reasonably expected by any that
will consider the violence offered to both the Houses of
Parliament, and to my selfe in particular the last mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
July 26. Insomuch that J can safely take it upon
my conscience, and so J doubt not may all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houses also, that they sat in continuall
feare of their lives, and by terrour thereof were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to passe such Votes as it pleased an unruly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to inforce upon them; which as J did then openly
declare in the House, so J cannot but believe that they
are all void and Nul, being extorted by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and in that manner that they were: And J can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
any longer dispence with my selfe to be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in passing such Votes, and to give any colour or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63941:3"/>
shadow of Parliamentary authority unto them, which
were not the Votes of the representative body of the
Kingdome; but of a tumultuous multitude, as those must
needs be accounted that seemed to passe the House on
Monday July 26. and which shall passe hereafter untill
better provision be made for the safe and free sitting of
the Houses of Parliament; there being no effectuall
course taken by the City since the adiournment of the
House, to prevent the like tumults for the future no nor
so much as a Declaration from them, to shew their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
thereof: but on the contrary, it was generally voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Towne, that there would be a farre greater
confluence of Apprentizes, Reformado's, and others by
Friday at the Parliament dores; and particular notice
was given to me, that after they had made the House
Vote what they pleased, they would destroy me: J had
likewise information given me that there would be a
great number of Apprentizes of a contrary opinion and
affection to the other, about the Parliament dores on
Friday morning, which J foresaw must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of necessity cause
a great combustion, and in probability occasion much
bloud-shed.</p>
            <p>The prevention of which mischiefe (together with
the consideration aforesaid) have weighed more with
me, then any thing which may concerne my particular:
and especially having served the Parliament faithfully
and diligently for the space of almost seven yeares in a
free and Parliamentary way of proceeding: that J
might not now be made a servant to such a rude and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
multitude, to transferre upon them the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Parliamentary authority, therewith to abuse,
and deceive the minds, and to destroy the lives, liberties
and estates of the People of this Kingdome, and having
taken a solemn protestation and Covenant, in my place
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63941:3"/>
and calling, to maintaine the priviledges of Parliament,
and the rights and liberties of the Subiect, J could not
now satisfie my selfe how J should discharge my duty
therein, but by absenting my selfe at this time, rather
then by my presence, to give any shadow or countenance
of the authority of Parliament, to such apparent viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, neither can the omission of a circumstance
or some formality in the adiournment of the House,
when through force and violence it cannot meet quiet
in any sort as a Parliament, be any preiudice to the
future sitting and proceeding thereof, when it may meet
and sit againe as a free Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being well known
that nothing can dissolve this Parliament, but an Act
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>When a company of Apprentices, Reformadoes and
others, shall call the Ordinances of both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
pretended Ordinances, shall locke the doores of
the Houses upon them, shall sweare not to let them out
till they have passed what they pleased concerning the
Militia of London and other things (though the House
had immediatly before voted otherwise) shall threaten
the Houses in case they doe not instantly satisfie thier
demands; shall knock, hoote, and hollow at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doores, that the Members could not be heard to
speake or debate, and after the House of Commons had
passed a Vote concerning the Militia of London, and
that the Speaker by the Vote had iudged the maior part
to be for the negative, shall not suffer the House to be
devided, but in a threatning way require those that gave
their Votes against them to come out to them if they
would, when after the House was adiourned, they shall
by maine force thrust back the Speaker againe into the
House, and force the Members in their presence and sight,
(direct thrusting themselves into the House) to Vote
what they demanded, when they shall iustle, pull, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63941:4"/>
hale the Speaker, all the way he went downe to his
Caroch, and force him (to avoid the violence) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himselfe to the next Caroch he could get into, for
refuge: When they shall breath forth bloody threats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Members, as they come out of the House; and
since against me in particular, at the next sitting of the
House, as J am credibly informed, and when there is no
appearance but that they will continue to doe as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they have done, or far worse on Fryday: J could
not in discharge of my trust, Protestation, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
sit in the Chaire of the House of Commons,
whilest it shall be in such a condition; but so soone as it
may sit againe, in freedome and safety, J shall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to returne to the service of the House, but till then
as J have upon the fore-mentioned grounds fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my owne conscience, so J doubt not but J shall give
the whole Kingdome (whose interest is most concerned
in it) ample satisfaction in the necessity of my action.</p>
