         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gallants, and many lookers on, and
many will be there again, but some
of our old friends will scarce come
by reason of the late Act, and the County Generals;
but however if you please we will take the ayre, and

the silver Coach carried it the last year, however, we
will be as plain as may be, and as private too: but
do you hear the news about the late Triall, and the
Lords and Ladies that are likely to be damned, with
other great Sinners; the Trial was at Hell all it is to
be feared, there was at the Trial, twelve Apostles,
four Patriarchs, four Prophets and Evangelists, in
all twenty and four, these were of the Jury; Mercy and
Justice sate that day: and it is well for some that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
sits every day, he waits and pleads too for the worst
of Sinners, however take heed of abusing it: the
Persons called to the Barre, were, Mr. Wilfull, and
Mr. Careless, Monsieur Aulymoade de France, and
Mr. New-come-over, Mr. Kill-devil that sweares
the new oaths, there was the Lady Hoyden, and Mrs.
Looseness, Mrs. Tittle-tattle, and Mrs. Never-give-over,
the Lord Never-be-good, and his Lady were
both damned; Mr. Duell, the Lord Heathen, and
the Lady Christless are in great danger, Money-bag
the Usurer, Hard-heart the Sinner, and Shine-shooes
the Citizen, are all turn'd over; Mr. Inside, and
Mr. Counter, and many rich Roundheads whose
God is their Gain, their Shop, and their Belly; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
Chinck, and Deputy Tell-money, old Mr.
Hugster, and old Mr. Starve-many, Mr. Swear and
Lye, and Mr. Cheat-many, Parson Flatter, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Bitter, Doctor Nothing the Orthodox Divine,
and many Common Prayer Men, are all upon their
Triall; Captain Cut-throat, and Collonel Get-all,
late Mr. Wagstick, and Now-we-will-be-quiet;
These and many Gallants are upon their Trial, and
if they miss damning, they will be at Park the next
<hi>May day.</hi> Mrs. Never-repent, will go as long as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97592:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
she lives, Mrs. Silver-stuff, Mrs. Jewell will be there,
Mrs. Rant-about, sweares, stares, and spends all, and
the poor Man sells all for a Whore, the Lord Belly-god,
the Lord Lye-a-bed, Mr. Sack-pot, and Mrs.
Lemmon, and Mr. Butterfly, Mr. Camester, and
Mr. Gallop will be there, to the delight of many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but the Lord abhorres them all in their present
courses; but the Jury being called, and the Malefactors
at the Barre, <hi>Solomon</hi> made a great speech, the sum
and substance was, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity:</hi>
old Father <hi>Abraham</hi> that was called out of <hi>Ur, Gen.</hi>
11. 31. pleaded much for some of these, saying they
might be his Seed notwithstanding all their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that the promise was not to him as a single
person, but even to <hi>as many as the Lord our God should
call,</hi> and said he, <hi>I have called my son out of Egypt, and
my servants from among the Heathens, Hosea</hi> 11. 1.
But <hi>Elias</hi> cryed out <hi>Fire, Fire, Fire, Luke</hi> 10. 54.
Stay, stay, said <hi>Abraham,</hi> I waited long for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and God waits longer for the Sinner, <hi>Forty
years he was grieved with one Generation, Psalms 95.
10.</hi> and many years he waits still, and if any of these
will yet <hi>repent</hi> they may <hi>enter into his rest, Heb.</hi> 3. 19.
True, his works were finished from the foundation of
the World, but our Salvation is but then begun, when
we once begin to look unto him, who cries, <hi>Look untome
O all ye ends of the Earth, and be saved, for I God and not
man, Isa. 45. 22. I cryed out of the belly of Hell,</hi> sayes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
&amp; <hi>I</hi> sayes <hi>Ionas out of the belly of the Whale, Io. 1.

may be spared;</hi> and there may be a seed among this
Generation of Vipers, yea who knowes but some of
these at the Bar, God will have mercy upon, and give
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97592:4"/>
them repentance never to be repented of, who are yet
far from any thing of that nature: A Lord or Lady
may as well be saved as another Man, it is true, <hi>the
poor receive the Gospell,</hi> and <hi>not many rich, not many
mighty, not many noble, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 26. but who will
say that none do, that are mighty, rich, and noble;
and if so, let us hope the best, O but sayes <hi>Saint Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,
they that live in pleasure are dead while they live,
1 Tim.</hi> 5. 6. yea said <hi>St. Iohn, but the dead shall
hear the voice of the Son of God and live, Iohn</hi> 5. 25.
There were other speeches, <hi>Isaiah</hi> made a long one,
saying, God had laid on Christ the iniquity of us all,
and received from Christ satisfaction for us all, but
that will never do you any good sayes <hi>Peter,</hi> unless
with me you do repent that ever ye crucified, or with
me denied the Lord of life and glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19.
<hi>Paul</hi> cryed refreshing comes from repenting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
from beleeving, and if you do not beleeve in
the Son of God, and the Lamb of God that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the sins of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 29. ye shall be all
damned, saith <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36. And said <hi>David</hi> I made
hast to turn my feet unto thy Statutes; in some things
there is more hast than good speed, but in beleeving
and repenting there is great danger to delay a day: I
delayed said <hi>Lot</hi> and I had like to have been burnt; it
happens in an hour, what it doth not in seven years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
yea the Floud came, and Christ will come in
an hour when they look not for him, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 50.
If Christ should come on a <hi>May day,</hi> there would be
a brave show indeed, and a great scuffle, for all his
holy Angels comes when he comes, and some Saints,
<hi>Iude</hi> saith thousands, and I beleeve thousands of
thousands, yea ten thousand times ten thousand, vers.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97592:4"/>
14. What do you talk of that day saith the old
Worldling, and the young Gallant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God take me
this is not a time to preach when we are in our sports,
said a Spark the last year, and swore a great oath; be
gone with your godly Book: but it is good preaching
every day, and to be looking for his coming, long
looked for will come, long lookt for comes at last,
and is nearer now than ever, <hi>Behold the Iudge stands
at the door, Iames</hi> 5. 9. yea he comes <hi>as a thief in the
night, blessed is he that watcheth, Revel.</hi> 16. 15. The
Lords Son hath been long in <hi>France,</hi> and the Lord
Christ comes as a man from a far Country, so he saith
himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 12. But these Princes of the world
that hath power in their hands, and these Gallants that
have pleasure in their eyes, wills that he would never
come; but poor men look hard, and poor Saints
pray hard, <hi>Come Lord Iesus, Revel. 22. 21. Make

And saith <hi>David If I had the wings of a Dove, I would

Psalms</hi> 55. 6. But yet I am constrained to dwell in

whence they go down to Hell in a moment, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.
19. These are they that fill the World and defile the

day: after some is good manners, and after your
Crispin pins, Hoods, Scarfes, Vales, fine Linnen,
Jewels, Chains and Bracelets, are all pull'd off, as
<hi>Isaiah</hi> speaketh, Chap. 3. 17. O Ladies read this
Prophesie, and see if it may not reach some of you;
ye point at that very condition, which ye shall then
be in, when God shall come to undress you by death
and sickness, which certainly he will erre long do,
yea he will strip you to your skins, and leave no<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing
but sin, guilt, shame, misery, and baldness on you,
whilest he cloaths his servants as it were with Suns and
Starres, this will be a brave change, and saith <hi>Iohn</hi>
this change we all look for, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. and it is good
to look forwards and backwards too sometimes. Do
not tell me what I was but what I am, saies some, but
it is good to consider what we were, what we are, and
what we shall be; I was conceived in sin saith <hi>David
Psal.</hi> 51. And I a little spawn or lust in the loynes of
Mr. Such an one, saith another, still I am a shaddow
and an empty one; and so are most of you Gallants
at the Park, you know not what you would have, or
should have, you know not what to do, yea, you know
not how to spend one day as you should, but are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and fain to send one to another, what shall we do?
where shall we go? pray present my service to Mrs.
such an one, and Mrs. such an one, and tell her that
I am even sick untill I go abroad; but my Lady takes
Physick, and the Devils go a Cat baiting when they
get one of them: if a poor man be damned, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is very glad; but if a Dives be, the Devils they cry
one to another, make hast, make hast, great Orlando is
coming, great Orlando is coming; and truly when
your great ungodly Lords and Ladies come near to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97592:5"/>
their confines, the Devils run and tumble, yea they
scramble for a wanton, young and silken bit. But
I remember about twenty years agoe, I saw a Puppit
play, called the <hi>Chaios</hi> or <hi>Creation</hi> of the world, but
the ugly Devils made such hayling and hissing about
the Lord Dives with their stub feet, and their short
tales, that I was affrighted at the heart, however there
was two or three peales, and the ringers they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
merry, and if a man were to be hanged, some
would be so, but to see them that are likely to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
go singing up and down the stairs with their
silk and silver Clappers, pit pat, yea in the streets
and Coaches sometimes and never think nothing, is
a very sad thing; but few of these can play at have
at all, and yet teey'le leap from all in a moment, can
you sing? leap soul, farewell world, have at all, O
Christ I come, I come; I come to thee, for I know
that my Redeemer lives, and I shall see him with these
eyes, <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 25. But this posting for the Doctors
argues fear, and this continual heighting up and
down, guilt, yea fear, guilt, sin, and you alwaies
lye together, and whil'st the Lord lies in the Ladies
bed, the Devil lies in both their souls many times;
but tis a thousand pitties any sweet, young, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good conditioned Lady, should be ever bedded
with the Devill, yet many times some sell as sweet
conditioned Children to him for a little Money and
Honour as any are in the World: I know the Lord
Such an one, hath a Daughter that he will give ten,
twenty, thirty, forty thousand pounds with, truly
one is to much with such a man, though he be of great

man is better than a heathen that knowes not God nor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97592:6"/>
the Devil; a good man with a bad woman, is in a
bad case, but a good woman with a bad man, is in
the Devils Pound: but how came you there? my
Father (cries the poor Lady) and my old Aunt would
have it so, yea and it may be you your self were too
forward; some mad Scabbs run away with a mad
Rogue, and that is like to like, somesing, and see ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a merry day, othets cry, and know not what to
say when they are to be married, but they that are put
into such a Pound, or into the Devils Pallace, are
very miserable, slaves to other mens lusts, though
they have much money at command, yet some have
scarce enough to pay a poor debt when once married;
and others spends so much, that the poor husband
fells all, while she playes all, and scarce payes in six
moneths, or seven years sometimes, when poor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men pay according to their words, and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in three, six, or nine moneths time. But Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
pay for all when they come to dye, and that
is soon enough to pay for the sweetest pleasures in the
World, if our lives be but a vapour, as they are <hi>Iam.</hi>
1. 11. But their misery is, they are ever paying, and
yet can never pay all, though they lye in fiery burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flames for millions, millions, and millions of
years; as that young man an Apothecary once said:
O consider this all yee that forget God, and what if
some of you should come to pay so dear for your <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and your gaying up and down, would it not be
very sad, a man may better pay some debts in a week,
than he can for some sins in an hundred thousand
years, but of all sins of a kind, great mens sins are the
greatest, a great Tree gives a great swap when he falls,
and a great man makes a great spudder at his Funeral,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97592:6"/>
but Lord whither doth that man fall? that falls from
room to room, from the Coach to the Chamber, from
the Chamber to the Bed, from the Bed to the Floore,
from the Foore to the Coffin, from the Coffin to
Worms, and from the Wormes to the Devils at the
last day, in the mean time the soul is there, while the
body is lugging down the staires: when a General
leaves a field, there is so many at his heeles, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left behind, the slain, or the dead, the trampling
of the grasse, and the carcasse of the beasts; but
when the Lord leaves his house, there is triming up
again for the new commer: the old mourning and the
old master being laid a side, nothing remains but the
name, the lusts, and the sins of the family, yea they
run from Father to Son, and Son to Son, and the
curse of God after them all: some men leave great
possessions for all their Children, and great houses in
good order, but if they go to the Devill and leave a
thousand houses to every Child, and a name to that
which may last to Dooms day, yet for all this, I
would be loath to go along with them: some men
take Gold in their boots when they go to <hi>France,</hi> and
others money in their pockets when they go along
journey, but I had rather take Christ with me for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
than all the Lords and Ladies in the world to
my grave. If you stir an old Horse head, sometimes
you shall see many flyes; and if you stir an old Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in his sick bed, you shall hear many oaths. An old
gouty and ungodly sinner, makes a great noyse when
he is punished for his sins, and a pocky Surgeon tells
a great lye when he sayes he will cure that in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights
time with his cursed Pills; but some would
do well to hang them that put forth such Bills, they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97592:7"/>
encourage many men to sin where the grace of God is
wanting: if a man want a member it is a sad thing,
but if a man be noysome or unwholesome it is worse;
but Lord bring me to any shame or misery rather than
to perpetual condemnation. When Ladies dye of
the Cancer or Ulcer in the belly, the best side is put
outwards, but when Lords dye of the Pox, it is an
ugly business; the consumption of the Purse, is the
want of take heed, and the consumption of the Lungs,
is the want of good dyet; but the consumption of
the blood and bones, is brutish and immoderate love
too, and foolish fondness of the wife many times: bnt
if a man kill himself this way, or his wife with too
many Children, he is near kin to a murderer, blood
will be required if a man shed blood; but if the soul
be lost this way, who shall make amends: tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that he may repent when he is old, and they
that kill themselves this way when they are young,
shorten the dayes of grace and of nature, when as he
that never truly repents nor beleeves, shall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
damned, as sure as the Lord lives. When Mr.
Kill-devil was called to his Tryal, he was taxed for
Swearing, Lying, and Whoring; some men are
guilty of these sins, and almost three thousand more,
and yet all may be pardoned; but Lord have mercy
upon me, if a man shall answer for every idle word,
as Christ speaks in the day of Judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.
26. yea, and what shall then become of most of our
<hi>Mayers,</hi> and others too, whose words and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are altogether so. But most men are wise when
tis too late; O that God were mine, O that Christ
were mine, O that Heaven were mine, O that I might
live a little longer, I would never do as I have done,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97592:7"/>
yea I would give for Heaven so much, when they are
going to be damned; but if the Sun be going down or
setting, it is in vain to cry hold Sun hold, good Sun
hold; yet mercy, mercy may be found at the last
minute, but to cry then Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, and
not to think of God before, is a very sad thing; what
a Gentleman and never think on God, and yet a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
for shame consider what you do and say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the open Sun; tis good to display your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to display your lusts and sins night and day,
as <hi>Sodom,</hi> crying come, come, come Sir, let us go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
again and again to the Maske, to the Ball, to the
Tavern, to the Park, to the Fields, and delights of the
World, never minding going out of the World, or
how vain these bewitching things of the World are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it be too late, is to imitate a fool: all men know they
must dye, and most men say they must be called to an
account, but pray Mr. Graceless what can you say for
your self? to begin with one: O Sir you were at
Church once, and it may be but once in a month, and
yet scarce in many months did you mind what was said
unto you, but to hear once of a Christ, and of Gods
love giving Christ for the worst of sinners is enough to
stop thy mouth for an hundred thousand millions of
years, take him Devill cries St. <hi>Paul,</hi> if you receive
the Grace of God in vain: Hard-heart cried he could
not repent, but <hi>Peter</hi> asked him why so, because he
sought it when it was too late, but whose fault was that,
when God gives repentance never to be repented of,
and mercies that should never be fotgotten; do not
you remember Sir when you were sick? do not you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when you were like to dye, and what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
then? when the Doctors gave you off, and the
Lord took you up from the grave again, when the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97592:8"/>
next newes was; O Sir it was in my sickness that I said
so and so, but if sinners, Lords or Ladies will promise
unto God when they are sick, and forget him when
they are well, they may be damned when they die, and
that is time enough: If a man hath been twice or thrice
at the Barre, and is once burnt in the hand, tis ten to
one but he hangs when he comes there again;
yet a man may go many times to the throne of Grace
for one and the same corruption; some go to <hi>Cheapside</hi>
to fetch Flowers, and others hard by to get stuff, but
few go to God when they are young, for grace to serve
him in their generation; yea I think in my conscience
some fine fools even think God is beholding to them, if
they should say their prayers, go to Church as other
ordinary people do. And because we cry to some, you
are too fine forsooth to do this or that, they even think
so too in relation unto God; when as I tell you God
and Christ is more worthy of your service an hundred
thousand times, than the best of you all, or the best
of all the Princes of the world, are worthy of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
namely to be an unworthy servant of God, what
do you condescend to serve a God? a God that can
damne you, and yet a God that will not damne you,
if you serve him in sincerity. Amongst many things,
there are three great cares that lies on every wise mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
man; first to serve God in his generation, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to provide for his family, thirdly to get his wife
well down without sinning, when she is on the top of
the house, tis not good to be both in a passion at once;
yea when either be, you are not fit (especially) to
pray, or to do any thing else: if a Parent correct a
Child in his anger, tis ten to one but he will do it
foolishly or sinfully; half an hour after is best, and
then with good words, and good counsell in a friendly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97592:8"/>
way: but if any of you Gallants (though never so vain
and prophane) will yet serve God, he will save you
and yours too, that so do, with an eternal Salvation:
but for any mortals to think, it is a little below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to walk humbly with God, stooping down to
the lowest things and Ordinances of Christ: yea to
kisse the feet of Christ, is an honour too great for the
greatest Potentate in the World. <hi>Mary</hi> washed them
with her teares, and wiped them with her hair, but
what was <hi>Maries</hi> love to Christ, who loved her first
and washed her soul in his blood. Some say washing
in a Hart or Dears blood, will make the white hands
whiter; I am sure washing in the dearest blood of all
bloods, will make the fowlest soul of any sinner in the
World, whiter than the driven snow; yea there is
none of you fair Ladies, that have commonly the worst
souls, but it will do so. About a fortnight since I
was going into the fields, to meditate about seven or
eight of the clock, and that is the best hour, and the
best time in the day, is the dusk of the even; but as
I was going by yonder great house, I was thinking
much upon the Lord that lives in it, and whether he or
no must answer for all the sins in the Family, and
though there be not half so many sinners there, as there
us'd to be in the late Kings daies, yet I did conclude
there were too many of one poor creature to answer
for, who hath too many of his own, when as his
whole estate will not make an amends for one: Lord
thought I then, it is better a thousand times to be a
poor Nit, Gnat, Worm, Nothing, than a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
man or woman; but as I was thinking so, I
heard the passing Bell cry, tong tong three times,
yet some do not mind it once in twenty times when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97592:9"/>
they hear it: if you hear a man swear, if you hear a
man lye, if you hear a man rant too much, or a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
complement, crying Sir your humble servant,
and your very humble servant sweet Madam, fetching
curches upon curches down to the ground, tis no great
hurt, but when they cry faith and troth, and as they
live, and as they hope to live, as they are vertuous,
and as they are vicious, Lord, Christ, God take me,
and as I hope to be saved, nay God damne me, as I
heard once a Lady should say, who was a great Lords
Daughter, which was a word from the Devil, and
the Devils tale was in her mough when she said so, but
the curse of God hangs over swearers heads and
families, read this text, <hi>Zak.</hi> 5. 3. In the mean time
some pay to the poor two or three pounds at a clap
upon this account, yea I know a she Rant that lately
paid more; but tis well for some body and the Devils
Kingdome that such Sparks be, for one of these do him
more grace, than a thousand poor sneaks: tis the
Lords and Ladies, and the brave Sparks, that
brings up all the fashions, and the new oaths; but new
Devils, new Lusts, new oaths and new fashions, come
all almost from one and the same place, and the Devils
Children are as much in fashion almost as ever I saw.
I heard three men swear, and I saw three men sit in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Garden</hi> Church, more like Puppits than Saints or
civil men; I wonder how they dare come so near
<hi>White-hall,</hi> or that any should venture to read there or
elsewhere, a whole Sermon at a clap, as they do near
<hi>St Giles</hi> and <hi>Covent Garden;</hi> I would go a hundred mile
barefoot, that the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> would make one strict
Act against this lazy kind of pocket preaching, there
is no business in the World troubles me like this, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97592:9"/>
some should so much set by these Doctors, Parsons,
Deanes, Tryers and others, and so little by gifted
Saints and Christians; when I think in my conscience
some of them do more hurt than good in the Church
of Christ, they are such bitter enemies to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
appearances of Christ, especially the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
in the poor servants of Christ: I know a rich
man in the <hi>new Exchange,</hi> that might do more good
than twenty of your Parsons that have nothing in
them, but civility, morallity, and a few legall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
exhortations; but the man wants an heart, though
his gifts and parts be great, and a clear intellect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but tis a poor business to be a poor Preacher until
the thing be more set by; and yet 'twas once more
set by among the Souldiers than now it is by farre, it
may be they cannot so well tend it; some think there
is too much light, and yet there is too little and too
little practice; but more light, more love, and more
living up to what we know would do well together.
If a man should be a professor, or Saint as you call
him, ten or twenty years together, and make it all
his business to get money, money, money, the curse
of money light upon him I cry, and all such professors
that never have enough. I knew a <hi>Welch woman,</hi> that
was a very good and godly woman, worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds at least, and never a Child in all the
World, and she cryed what should she do with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pound if she were a Widdow: truly a thousand
pound will go a great way well husbanded; and a
thousand Saints may do more than they do a thousand
times for Christ, and the World than they do; they
that do nothing are but Ciphers at the best, they that
do little are but Droans, they that do much are most
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97592:10"/>
their own friends; he that sins least, wrongs his ow<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

soul, but they that sin much are the Devils slaves: if
a man drudge in the durt for a little Cheese, or if a
man plead much for a little Gold, or sin much for a
little while, what will it avayle, if he must lye in Hell
an hundred thousand years: if a man go fine all the
day long, and want a bed at night, or if a man go
poor and have a bed at night, which is best; if a man
play at Cards all Christmas, and loose all by Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
he may chance to go beg all the year after: if a
man play with a strange Ladies bosome or a Lords
locks, it is a ready way to go down to Hell saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Prov.</hi> 2. 16. and 6. 26. And the onely way
to want in the Winter is to play in the Summer, but if
a man play away, sleep away, or sin away one ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
one Sabbath, and one season after another (as
a man may do) until it be too late to get grace, <hi>Matt.</hi>
23. 38. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26. he may go like a wretch to Hell,
and in Hell say would to God I were out; I see the
Embleme of a surety; a fool leaping with his head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the great end of an Horn, but being got to the little
end, he could not get it back; how many such foolish
ones are there now at <hi>Hide Park,</hi> that leap into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
lap of sinful pleasure, then into the pan of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
sometimes in their bodies, and sometimes in
their consciences, and lastly into the fire of Hell: I
saw a brave Coach go up <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> with a golden
Arse; and I saw them stand still at <hi>Saint Peters
Pauls Wharfe,</hi> but <hi>Saint Peter</hi> and <hi>Saint Paul</hi>
were never troubled with such kind of
hearers as go thereabouts. Three things spoyle young
Ladies, marrying too soon, ill edication, and such
kind of Parsons that preach little or nothing to any
purpose: let a heart be broken betimes for sin, and
it will be saved in time from sin, death, hell, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97592:10"/>
burnings; yea Christ will love that Lady with
an everlasting love, that will love him when she is
young and he poor; and poor Christ is as poor now
as ever, and it is as poor a business to be a servant unto
Christ as ever I knew it; if a man should pluck a
Bible from his pocket among some, they would be
ready to laugh, but if a man should look into a Bible
and seriously consider what will become of them, it

Hell; but can you think your selves back: a man or
woman never act so beneath themselves, as when they
cry they did not think of it, or consider of it: non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration
is the cause of most mens damnation;
what should the Devil mind you of Hell as he does

Christ speaks <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 3. And therefore for all this
great boasting and vyeing for the honour and glory
of the day, I say for all this, you must come to die
and to Iudgement, and upon pain of damnation I tell
you this, yea the Lord tells you, that if you still goe
on to neglect so great Salvation as is freely tendered
to you, despising his Grace, his Love, and his Son
and the delight of his soul, our onely most and ever

evermore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. who hath a thousand Crowns
to give unto you, and a thousand pardons more than
you need, or ten thousand sinners greater than you,
were they in the world, yet I say Christ stands with
these Crowns and Pardons for you: if a man should
stand with a Rainbow round about you, yea if a God
should stand with a Rainbow round about you, yea
if a thousand Gods (although there be but one) should
stand with a thousand Rainbows round about you all,
it were not half so much as a God and Christ, and a

although Christ would as fain have you as any in the

any in the world, yet I say, that notwithstanding all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97592:11"/>
this, if you shall despise him, and think to do below as
Angels once did above, namely to be above God;
he will fling you down to Hell, and the darksome holes

may seek pleasures here and find, ease in Hell but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find, sinners may find sinners, and old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may find each other, yea some of you may do so,
but the Devils will find you all torments, while God
finds wrath and you guilt; yea the Devil will find
power, though you cannot death; yea an exquisite
torture to torment sinners for evermore: if an ugly
Collier should but breath upon you, it would make
you sick; but if the Devil come to sit and blow upon
you, this will make great change, for some of you
young Gentlewomen, that the Sun must now scarce
shine on; and what a Hell will this be, to go from
golden Coaches and beds of Downe, to fiery Litters
and beds in Hell, to fry and roare with ugly Devils
in burning flames for evermore; O for Gods sake
consider this all ye that neglect God, or despise God
and Heaven for a moments lust. And if there be not
a Heaven and an Hell, a reall place where Angels sing
and Saints rejoyce, Devils roare and sinners fly, yea
something that is equivolent unto this in the other
world, burn your Bibles for a cheating Book for they
have deceived me and many thousand more: but if
the Scriptures be a Truth, and the very words of
God, as certainly they be, they are so searching into
the consciences of every man that seriously looks into
them, that he must needs confess this truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.

thinks upon the old fool that goes there, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which he so profusely spends, or the portion of
his daughter, yea few of these upstarts think upon the
old folks that go to the Devil; if a man should be
hang'd for anothers mans stealing, it would be sad;
but if a man be damn'd for another mans vain glory,
pride, gaming, carding, ranting, or whoring, it is
much more: truly some make no better use of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
than this, or to piss again the wall that for which
many are damn'd; I will not say how many, but I
beleeve above an hundred every year within the walls
of <hi>London.</hi> If a man steal for another, suffer and be
hang'd, it is sad as I said before, but to be eternally
damn'd is much more; and it may be onely to make
him a fine Gentleman, a fine Fool, a swearing Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and a brave Spark, but the old fool hath no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in him, and the old mother must scarce be known
where she lives by the fine daughter: if the Ministers
of <hi>London</hi> could preach themselves, and many of their
hearers, out of this cursed damning sin of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it were a gallant thing; some talk was of the
Jewes, and the coming in of the Jewes, but if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
be more covetous than many Gentiles,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97592:13"/>
Priests, and Citizens I am mistaken; for a Belly god
to mind his gut, and a filthy swearer his ungodly lust,
is a common thing; but no Swearers, Drunkards,
Whores or Harlots in the World, have their hearts
so much going after any sin in the World, than some
noted Ministers, and professors that are called Saints,
have after this cursed sin of Covetousness; they talk
of Faith, and preach you must live by Faith; others
write Sermons all the year about, frequent meetings,
and enter into fellowships many of them, but Money,
Money is their God, and for Money they will chop
and change, cheat and lye, and make any man a Saint.
I knew two great men that were about last year near
<hi>St. Martins</hi> canonized for Saints; one was worth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Pounds, and the other an hundred, but
the Devil is Money, and in Money if that will make a
Saint; I will never beleeve he goes to Heaven that
does no good, gets a great estate and makes no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
at all of Christ, the waies, Saints, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Christ, say you what you will to please fools,
friends, and kindred, yet a little money and it may
be mourning. If a man should look into the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
of a man newly buryed it would be a loathsome
business, but if a man look into the lives of many rich
men which Ministers make Saints in their funeral Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it might be said the man was more a fool, a beast,
a muck worme, or at best a civil Gentleman, or an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Christian, rather than a Saint: truly I know
nothing so much as three things that make a Saint, faith
in the blood of Christ, union with the person of Christ,
and receaved measure of sanctification from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, and these three things with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
thankfulness, fruitfulness or holiness, make a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97592:14"/>
brave Saint indeed: if my Lord or my Lady had
such an onely daughter, and a lovely Lady also, she
were a match for the greatest Prince in the world, and
were Angelical Spirits capable of marrying or giving
in marriage, as they are not, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 25. they would
come to such vertues, but when blossomes, birth, and
beauty have nothing to ado<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne them, but spangles, gold
and outward glory, they are farre short of the Church
of Christ, the Kings daughter who is all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 13. Inward glory is true glory, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
glory is false, inward glory is pure, light, life,
and heart purifying, but of outward honour, glory,
beauty and esteem, a man may have a great deal, and
a great deal of Gold, with capps, knees, and bowings
to him for his portion, and go to the Devil when
all is done, but the Lord is my portion saies the Church,
<hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 25. And truly it were a Lamentation
well worth the taking up, to think how many brave
Sparks and Ladyes that are now in midst of all their
gold and glory, displaying of themselves, and glories
as it were for the glory of the day in <hi>Hide-Park</hi> with
leaping, lightsome hearts and souls through the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of it; yet that the night should and suddenly will
come, that all these must undress and go away hence
to the darksome cold earth; yea to the darksome dens,
or darkest dungeons of Hell, if they have nothing
but outward glory for their portion; and then they
will be more miserable than they that are acquainted
with a kind of Hell beforehand, Some say when they
make a Nun in another Country, first they make a
feast as rich and noble as may be, then they invite their
greatest friends, yea they entertaine all of qualitie with
the greatest delights that this earth can afford, and she
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97592:14"/>
her self to espouse her self to Christ as she thinks, is
dressed with all that youthful, virgin, rich and princely
attire that is possible to be thought on or adorned with,
but the feast and the mask, the musick and the singing
being over, the poor Lady is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to the skin, yea
she burns in the presence of them all, (her greatest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and glory) her hair, and all for the Kingdome
of Heavens sake, sequestring her self from all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this life for another, which she ignorantly hopes
to find in a wrong way: but sure I am you wilfully
loose that which you may easily find in a way of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
though not in a way of working; and this is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
and a thing to be taken up for a lamentation,
that you the Lords and Ladies of <hi>England,</hi> the Gentry
and the greater part of the Gentry, and glory of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a common sense, forgoe for a present Heaven,
which yet is but a Hell to a heavenly man and an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind,
the true Heaven, and the God of Heaven whose
loving kindness is better than life, so saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi>
63. O Madam home is home (as we use to say) though
never so homely, and Heaven is Heaven when all is done,
but there is no home like to Heaven, and the God in
Heaven, which you forgot for a moments lust; were
your pleasures as his are for evermore, it were something,
but for moments joyes to loose a Heaven, the joyes of
Heaven and Heavenly glories for evermore, is a loss in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
And now I am speaking of Heaven, let me
give you one touch of that and I have done; onely I
shall make your Funeral Sermon in conclusion, for I
think verily you will be damned, and never come there,
yea most of you will be so, and though I am but a poor
man, yet I would not be in some of your conditions
for an hundred thousand Worlds: heretofore when I
have been going to bed, I have thought when I saw my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97592:15"/>
sins, before I came to see them all freely done away and
pardoned by the blood of Christ, if I should have been
sick in my bed and dye, what a miserable creature should
I be, sure I am in danger to be damned thought I; and
yet there is no man living but he may be easily saved, if
he looks to God, and beleeves in God in time, yea if a
man beleeves in God and lives to God really, he shall
as certainly be saved, as ever any sinner in the World
was damned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36. But now if some of you
should go home and consider a little in the night, what
you have been doing all the day; yea what you have been
undoing all your lives along, it would make you sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
some men live long enough to get Heaven for their
souls, aud an estate for their Children, but if they get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an estate for their relations, let them have this
for an Epitaph upon their graves, here lies PENNY
WISE, but POUND FOOLISH: and
let them have a little thatch in their hands also, for that
will do them as much good as the welfare of their wives
and children, if their souls doe miscarry in the other
World; but for a man to live ten, twenty, forty years or
upwards, to undo his relations, and his own soul as some
do, yea most of you fine folks do litte else, but sin a
great deal, and live a little while to undoe and damne
your selves for ever and ever; some fill the bag or bushel
in a little time and are carried away into the Land of
<hi>Shinar, Zaph.</hi> 5. 5. and we remember them no more,
when they are once gone to the Devil: I beleeve you
your selves have almost forgot forty brave Sparks as
heretofore used <hi>Hide-Park:</hi> Christ was thirty three
years old before he thoroughly saved one soul, and then
he dyed and saved all the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 29. but it is
that World that beleeves in him, repents and lives to
him: But of the world of Gallants that I saw the last
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97592:15"/>
year in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> I did not see above half a dozen of my
acquaintance that looked any thing Saint-like, or Sion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
some look as if they would never pray, others as
if they would never swear or sin they are so handsome;
and yet they do nothing else but sin and swear, or tittle
tattle all the day long; for my part I did not hear one
word of Christ, and yet I was in the Park all the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
but it was upon a good account, and for my part
I am resolved (for ought I know) never to go again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this bout: I have witnessed twice against them, and
once against the Tryr<gap reason="illegible: broken type" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and I beleeve they
will make but a blind business with the Keyes of <hi>David</hi>
now in their hands, which should be in the hands of
Christ alone, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 22. Nor will they ever put the
power of Preaching, for fear of spoyling their trade,
into the hands of any in the world, but they that will make
an absolute trade of it; when as I am confident an ugly
knotty stick, being hewed and plained a little, will make
a better piece of timber, than some of them that they set
up, will ever be builders in the Church of Christ: But
Mr. such an one, and Mr. such an ones Letter must pass
him, especially if he comes with a little of the old Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
Catechisme in his mouth, and some of them will
so kon it upon the stairs when they are going to be tryed:
but there is a young Gentleman that makes a sweet trade
in getting money for Passes and I know not what, yea
one told me of a Parson Solicitor that gets more than
I can by my trade, by rerommending, helping, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
young Priests in a right way to obtain their business,
and ye know he must be a good man, such a Tryer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
him, and twenty more, and you know he is a
great Tryers friend, Country man, or Coosin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must pass; and there was old passing when the
great scuffle was (as a door keeper told me) but let them try,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97592:16"/>
and try, and do what they will, for my part I profess
in the presence of God, I had rather preach, or be in the
publick speaking a word to Christ for sinners, or a word
for sinners to Christ in a way of prayer, than eat my
meat though never so hungry, and yet I would work for
my living: yea thousands in this Nation thirst after this
liberty; who are holy, humble, knowing, godly, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
self denying, gifted Christians; yea equally
gifted with most Ministers: things might be done in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and order, and yet the Minister never the worse,
Christian liberty well used doth not abuse or justle out
the Ministerial calling in the least, tis strange there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a medium found out by those that hold the helme,
but for my part I am resolved not willingly to pay one
penny, untill I have liberty to pray or some body else,
who is godly, in the room of most Clarks and Readers
that are stark nought; a good Minister and a good
Christian, two or three would do more good in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
than he and an old sleepy Reader can or will do in
many years. We have a good Benefice, and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
will come there whether we will or no I think, and
yet he is beloved where he is, and we had pitched
upon another that is godly and blameless. But I
fear I shall do little here this day, the Lords and Ladies
are resolved to go home, and so will I, yea I resolve to
go home, and mind home, death, grave, and eternity
more than ever I have done, and yet I have vowed much
&amp; writ vowes, but a thousand vowes will do no good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
God give a man strength to live to him; and for you
great persons, you can as well come out of you skins as
out of your sins and snares; yea if God Almighty do
not pluck you out of your present conditions all the Men
on earth cannot help you, no nor all the Saints on earth;
O pray, pray, yea at night go home and say, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97592:16"/>
help me, Lord Jesus look upon me, and make me
now to apply my heart to wisdome after all my former
folly. A man may easily pull a man down hill, or
down to Hell, but he can hardly pluck him up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or Heaven-ward: yea I find it very hard to come
to the certainty of Heaven, and to be looking off from
working for Heaven, notwithstanding the promise is not
to him that worketh, but to him that beleeves in him that
justifies the ungodly; a golden text: O read, read <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 5. and upon this account the ungodliest man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
may be justified, and to be justified, you know is
to have all a mans sins pordoned, hid and done away;
O the blessedness of that man whose sins are so done away,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1. And now if one of you Gentiles, or genteel
sinners, would go home at night and really beleeve them
pardoned, they would be so; tis but beleeving or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
that makes a man to be saved or damned, yea
really it is no more, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36. yea tis beleeving, and
beleeving more than any thing that makes a man live to
God and love God. I will warrant if one of you Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
could now but really beleeve God would love you
and save you, notwithstanding all your former sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
you would be gallant Christians indeed, and God
loving Christians instead of the Devils slave: well there
is a new way to Heaven, or a nearer way I am sure than
most men have hinted at, and that is by beleeving before
repenting, yea by fetching repentance and reformation
from beleeving Gods love in Christ to poor sinners, as
sinners, that is, while yet they are in their sins; when
a Leapors Leaprosie is washed off, he is as lovely as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, when a sinner is reformed, he is as lovely as a
Saint in his conversation, but before God reformes, he
loves, yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love,
saith God; He is nothing but Love saith <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. 4. 10.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97592:17"/>
yea he is ever living, loving, and giving good things to
you the worst of sinners; else why are you out of Hell
and here this day, out of sickness, out of misery, out of
want, though all these things come in love to his Children;
O for Gods sake love God, &amp; if indeed you do but mind
him a little in his Son, you cannot but love him; He is
the Fountain of Love, and a loving Fountain, that hath
a thousand Seas of sweetness and divine delights, for all
those that come unto him, with the is the well of life
saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 36. 9. and at thy right hand are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for evermore: but tis Christ that is this pleasure,
and that right hand that God stretcheth out to you the
worst of sinners, and if you will take hold of his strength
upon his word, you shall make peace with him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.
5. and he will make peace with you and your souls, yea
Christ will make peace between you both, yea to them
that are afarre off he maketh peace, and preacheth peace
by the blood of his Crosse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Peace be unto
you in this room saith Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 19. And
peace be to you in <hi>Hide-Park</hi> say I, and if you will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to it there is peace in the blood of Christ for you
all, for that speaketh better things than the blood of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell;</hi>
and I beseech you to mind this night what it speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
I know what your ranting, and vaunting in a
thing of nought speaks, namely Hell all tis to be feared;
but the blood of Christ speaks yet peace to the worst of
you all: take heed again, and again take heed, ye refuse
not him that speaks from Heaven, that which few of the
Princes of this World which come to nought, do know,
or have known for many hundred of yeers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
18. But to you is it spoken, not in a voyce of thunder
like God in <hi>Mount Synai,</hi> where no man durst come
near for fear of death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 15. but in a love and
dovelike spirit, the spirit of love, and the Dove that is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97592:17"/>
speckled with the blood of Christ, is yet at some of your
windowes hearts and souls with an Olive brance an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
of peace, from the God of peace and our Lord
Jesus Christ to some of your souls; O tast and see that
the Lord is gracious: blessed is the man that puts his
trust in him, and if you will trust in him now and at all
times, yea trust you in the Lord Jehovah for ever, for
in his arms there is everlasting strength to save you and
your souls for evermore, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 4. but if you make
(as the manner of you Gallants is) a push of God, he
will make a mock and a laugh at you when you come to
die and be damned; so saith this Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1 26.
Most men say, O that God were mine, O that Christ
were mine when they are dying, and O that I might live
a little longer, I would never do as I have done; truly
some of you have lived too long already, and it were to
be considered, whether it had not been better for some
of you to have been damned ten or twenty years-ago,
then to be heighting up and down in Coaches still, for
if you will to Hell, the sooner the better, the greatest
surfet begets the greatest feaver, and the longest sinner
the greatest Hell, for I am of this opinion, that God is to
most men as they apprehend him to be, and a mans Hell,
shall lie most in his bowels, and come most from his own
sins: so that the more light the more sin, and the more
sins against light, the more Hell still sayes Christ, if I
had not come unto them my self, they had not known
sin, that is they had not known or committed so much
sin, or been guilty so farre as now they are, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 19.
Some ranting sinners will swear so lustily when they are
well, and speak so whiningly when they are sick, spent
and even dead in a Consumption and likely to go to the
Devil; and some Saints look so chearfully through the
sense of Gods love, when they are even loaded with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97592:18"/>
that it would do a man good to see them. I
saw an old beggar with a dish on his back, and a Lord
with a bunch on his, and two great Saints with the world
in their mouths; one was talking of this estate, and
the other of that mans estate, and both of them had too
much, and care enough with what they had: there is
none so merry as fools, nor any so foolish as wise men
that can never tell when they have enough, nor how to
do good with what they have: my Lord Needy and my
Lord Greedy, will never be good, nor satisfied though
they have the Devil and all: and it is a strange thing
that a poor man and a Saint, can hardly satisfie himself
in the love of God, so as to look a little chearful and
walk very thankful in all changes: let a man sneak through
the world with a patcht arse, or flutter thorough with a
golden traine, it is much a like, provided they be both
damn'd; for to be hang'd in halters, or to be hang'd in
golden chains, is much alike, if he must be hang'd: and
if you will be damn'd and go to the Devil, go how
you will it is all one, and to one purpose: but I know
how poor Saints should go to Heaven, and that is by
singing and dancing, and ever having the high praises of
God in their mouths, and a two edged sword of zeal in
their hands, to cut down all ungodly lusts and Kings in
their souls, <hi>Psal.</hi> 149. 8. yea to hew them in pieces,
for the spirit of God and the word will spare none, as
<hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Agag, 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 33. nor be at peace
with the least traytor, when <hi>Iesabell</hi> look'd out of the
window, she cryed what peace, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 30. and when
you look out of your Coaches with your ugly faces, I
cannot tell what to make of you, you are so patch'd and
peec'd with old taffaty and taffaty patches, yet some of
you young Ladies, would look like little Angels almost
if it were not for these sins, and some ugly things that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97592:18"/>
you are guilty of. But to be guilty of nothing is a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
thing, and if any of you will be guilty of no sin when
you come to die, look to Christ while you live, and
live to God till you die, and you shall have a better hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
than any Lord of them all. Strange Lords and
strange lusts have ruled you hitherto, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 13. but
Christ is alwaies young and lovely; yea to look to, to
lean on, to hope in, and to follow after he is altogether
so; and he dyed for you when he was thirty three years
of age, and yet lives and ever lives to make
intercession for you; for God sake court or think on
him a little: here is old courting ill condition Mrs. such
an one, and Mrs. such an one, and she hath so many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and so many servants, and all it may be for the
money, and nothing but the money: but Christ hath
few enough, and yet he is as rich as ever, and will give
more than ever any of you yet enjoyed, for a dram of
his grace is more worth than thousands of your estates,
who have nothing but a little dirt, and a little Gold, with
a little lace, and a little thing called Honour; but Christ
hath the dew of his youth, and the youth of his age, <hi>Psal.</hi>
110. 3. yea eternities is in his hands as well as the keyes
of death and Hell, or the power over Hell, sin, death,
men, and Devils, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 18. and in his hand he
holds a ring, a golden ring or a reconciled God; yea
and God holds him to the worst of you all, but you
have no mind to marry and be the sons of God, but to
be the Children of the Devil still, and his you are sure
enough, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. When God was on the earth
<hi>Moses</hi> had a great mind to see his face, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18.
would you had so to see his Son; when the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
came from <hi>Worcester,</hi> there went many thousands to
see him, and when Christ shall come to <hi>England,</hi> I hope
to see him and more done for him than yet there is; but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97592:19"/>
will you love him or will you not, he is altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his names, in his natures, in his person, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
yea and in his Kingdom which I hope is nearer
then some men imagine: <hi>Mr. Tillinghurst</hi> told us strange
things in his Book, called the Key to misticall Numbers,
the man may be right in some things, and I beleeve he
is; twenty Shops in <hi>London</hi> have these Books of his,
would as many of you had Christ in your hearts and in
your lives; but will you marry or will you not, will you
marry or will you burn, will you burn in Hell an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand years, or will you take Christ for better
or worse, nay tis worse to refuse Christ, than to take all
the shame in the world with Christ; and what a shame
is this, that you should be too fine for poor Christ, when
poor Christ makes you rich and gives the best of riches
to you, yea durable riches. See page 11. of the yellow
Book, or the last <hi>May dayes</hi> Letter. But take my word
if you do not take Christ; the Devil will take you and
tear you worse than poor Cocks are torn or Bears bated,
yea you shall tear your selves in a thousand pieces if it
were possible, and yet not destroy your selves; great
Malefactors are hang'd alive in Hell, and their misery
is they cannot die, nor get the fire out, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41.
This shall be done to the man whom God will honour;
he shall live with God and reigne (as it were) with
Christ in the eternity of God, but all you that hate the
Lord shall be consumed as the fat of Lambs, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.
20. yea let them all be consumed and confounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that will not marry Christ, or ever hear of being
the servants of Christ; there is such a deal of service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, but pray what have you done for Christ
any of you genteel heathenish sinners, yea or any of you
professing Saints; truly you that have done most, have
done nothing to any purpose, and you that have done
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97592:19"/>
nothing, have done enough to have damn'd you in your
best action that ever you did, if you were to be tryed by
the Law or the purity of Gods Justice out of Christ; but
the business is, who almost doth any thing, or doth not
at all mind every thing, and no man minds the things of
Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. Truly Christ hath a great many
enemies and a great many friends, and a great many
lookers on, some men look which way the tide runs, and
some which way the gain comes; but godliness with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is great gain, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. and still I say the great
stain of godliness is, they are so greedy after it; but
greedy lovers of profits, and greedy lovers of pleasures,
are little better than greedy doggs both, and will be shut
out of the new Jerusalem that cometh down from God,
or is above with God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 2. And now if some
of you Ladies after all this brave dressing of your selves,
should be shut out of <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> and made to stand in
the ditch whil'st all the Nobles and rest of the Gallants
were admitted in to take their fill of pleasures and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the day, it would be a great vexation; but if thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of you should be shut out of Heaven and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven, as Christ speaks <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 27. for
minding nothing but pleasure, the pleasures of the day
and the pastimes of the night; how will you then weep,
when you your selves shall see <hi>Abraham, Isaack,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob,</hi> with thousands more sitting down there, but you
your selves shut out, ver. 28. Christ wept bitterly for
Jerusalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 34. and if he were on earth, I
think he would weep for you, for you are the most to be
pittied, for all your laughing and your singing one unto
another of any people; yea of any creatures in the world:
yea I in my conscience do verily think so, for a man to
sing to a bird and catch him in a net, or hearken to a Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryan
as they say, and be catched by a song, is a misery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97592:20"/>
and a cheaty misery; none gets so much by gaming, as
the Devill does by playing his cards in some of your laps,
and truly you frequently commit adultery when you
look so lustfully as you do <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 25. on one anothers
faces, yea you make your selves Whores and Harlots
by your talk many times: Christian talk and Christian
name, with Christian life and conversation would do
well together, and if Christ be your Master let him be
your Copy, for I will not give a farthing for that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that is little better than an old common Protestant:
an old Protestant and an old Papish will agree better,
than either can with an honest Roundhead; and yet the
old Religion is the true; ask for the good old way and
follow that saies the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 16. and not these
new lights and fangles, and now I am resolved to be
half a Quaker to a hair, but not a whole one for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
worlds; I resolve to be less complementall, less a
flatterer, more an inward and an outward Christian;
yea a circumspect Christian in all things: but to deny
Jerusalems Christ, Gods exalted, dear and onely Son
who is God over all blessed for evermore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5.
that hath washed me in his own blood, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my soul from Hell, and reconciled me unto God;
for a whimsey, I never will; nor shall they ever pick my
comforts by a many new words, forced humility or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that ariseth out of self, and leads man to rest
on self, a broken Reed a muddy Cestern, and all that do
so will lie down in sorrow; yea this is all you shall have
at my hands saith the Lord: yea all you that compass
your selves about by your own sparks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 11. for
other foundations can no man lay than what is laid
Christ Jesus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. O foundation, foundation,
time and age outlasting foundation, Heaven, Earth,
Saint and Angell burying foundation, how art thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97592:20"/>
by Generations of self righteous men on the one
side, doggs, careless sinners, loose Christians, and despisers
on the other, and yet thou art all in all in life, death, and
eternity, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. yea thou art Gods all in all, and
our all in all, who have all our hopes, helps, and mercies
in and from thee, yea in thee and in thee alone is all our
justification, sanctification, and hopes of glorification;
and yet how little do we live unto thee, do or speak for
thee, our dearest dear before the Sons of men: but O
Christs time will come, and certainly come that we shall
wish a thousand times, that the best of us all had said
more, and done more a thousand times for thee than the
best of us all have done: And therefore to you the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of this Nation, I humbly give this advice, (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good men in prosperity may easily forget the vowes
in adversity) that you remember as long as you live the
cause for which so many tuns of blood were spilt, and
millions of souls sent to Hell sooner than ordinary; yea
the cause of our ever blessed, dear, and glorious Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and what ever men say he certainly once had, and
still has a cause and controversie to plead with the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
however he will erre long certainly come and call
all men to account: and then you the dry skuls, heads
and bones of the Caviliers shall rise together; yea with
their dead bodies shall you arise, or they with yours as
the Prophet speaks in another case, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19. In the mean
time know the night is at hand wherein no man can work,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 3. And as <hi>Owner</hi> said of <hi>Ireton,</hi> so I say to all
you; go your way and take your lot, and at the end
of your dayes you shall stand up again, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. last.
And to all under you I give this advice, study to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and at peace in your own spirits; Gods waies are in
the deep, and his designes take place in all ages, yea they
never slack nor stay. Children obey your Parents, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97592:21"/>
your Masters, not with eye service, but in singleness
of heart as serving the Lord. To all good married men
I give this, first to love your wives as Christ loved his
Church, if it were possible, and in loving, love their
souls as much above their bodies, as you do their bodies
above their cloathes; it will do the wife the husband
good to think the soul is in Heaven smiling, when absent
here on earth or present in a coffin; tis the condition of
friends, that is more than any thing, the true cause of joy
or grief; if a friend be in prosperity, you onely mourn
for his absence, but if in adversity you mourn double:
and truly there is a vast difference between a wife gone to
Hell, and a husband gone to Heaven, or a wife gone to
Heaven and an husband gone to Hell, and so for any
other friends, now when we do what we can to go our
selves and draw others we have done our duty; but for
you great ungodly Gentry, you draw all almost to Hell
that come near you; and yet I think it is a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to bury two good wives than one bad: who would
have a side of his house or body burnt, yea his bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
go to Hell; and yet most of you and your Children
will go thither by reason of your examples. Whither
do you think the Lord such an one is gone that dyed late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nay in your conscience speak as judging by the rule
of Gods Word, and Mr. such an one that kept his brave
Coach and six Horses, and never went without: but to
your Children I give this advice, first to read over the
families they came of, what sins they have been guilty,
and what judgements have fallen upon Father, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
and great Grandfather; one broke his neck, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his heart, a third lost his head, a fourth made a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
end in his bed, yea dyed suddenly and never said
Lord have mercy on me: it is good to observe these
things, and it is easier to love, repent, or begin to live
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97592:21"/>
to God before twelve or twenty years of age be past than after,
and so again before thirty than forty; but if a man mis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years before he begins to look to Christ, it is an hundred to
one but he goes to the Devill; yet hundreds turn civill and
morally honest, and so go civilly to the pit: there is four or
five turnings before a man turns into the right way for Heaven,
and yet some hit on it at the first, and that is by throwing
themselves upon Gods love in Christ in a way of reall beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that barely upon the account of the promise, which is
yea and amen without any qualification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. but some
turn from wildness to sobriety, and so from bravery to plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
from Papistry to Protestantism, and yet are little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so back again without being much the worse; and
some turn from the ordinary protestants to be Professors, and
yet are ten fold more the child of the Devil than before. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
turn is a turn from God, if the heart be unturn'd to God;
and the white Devil is the worst, and will carry a man to Hell
when he thinks he is going to Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; persecute another on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a Gospel spirit, and a Gospel light, without a Gospel life,
will certainly rise in judgement against any man in the world;
and so will all your Ladyships sins if you do not take heed in
time: Mouls see and Swans sing a little before they dye, and
it may be then most of you will be wise, and till then few are so:
do you think Christ made you so fine and so handsome, so rich
and so noble for nothing; yea do you think he made you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as you say, and brought you forth in <hi>England</hi> the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the world, and in some sense you the Flowers of this
Garden, for nothing but to sing and dance, make a French
Courchy, complement for a husband, and height about with a
Servant, truly Christ will have little reason to damn heathens
and save you; tis true you are called by his name, but that
should teach you good manners and good lives; I beleeve some
would be ashamed if we should tell of a <hi>Cromwell</hi> that would not
fight, or a <hi>Fayrfax,</hi> whose name I hope will never be forgotten;
and truly Christ will be ashamed of you, that will not live to
him as well as be baptized; and if you were not baptized, there
is no man living but would take some of you to be the Devils
children you are so wicked. <hi>But the end of all things is at hand,</hi>
and that is your funeral text with which I shall conclude, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97592:22"/>
4. 7. But you will ask me what end, not the end of Gods
Mercy, for there is no end thereof, that is from everlasting to
everlasting, to them that fear him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 17. Nor is there
any end of his love, or the promises of his love, for they are
numbe<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>less from one end of the Bible to the other, and so is
his providence to his Children, even from the womb to the
grave; yea that never leaves them till they come to <hi>Abrahams</hi>
bosome, and then God is all in all to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. But
there is an end of your sinning, and Saints sorrowing, of your
living, and the Kingdomes of the world raigning; yea there
is an end of this suns shining, the rains fulling, the winds blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the spirits breathing: yea that breaths where, when,
and as long as it listeth, take heed of grieving and resisting that,
for if ever that finally leave you, and come no more to your
consciences, beds, and elbowes, saying go to Pelham, go to
Pelham, go to God, go to Christ, look to God, look to
Heaven, Hell, mind both, for all these bewitching things and
fooling up and down, or else thon art undone for ever: Soul
hast thou ever another if thou loosest this; have a care of
loosing all for a moments lust, but there is an end of all this
kind of breathings, and your singing, yea there will be no
more <hi>May dayes</hi> after a few dayes more; I think you had best
take your solemne leave, and weep over one anothers backs,
necks, &amp; shoulders, and say farewell Ladies, farewel Lords, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
Coaches, farewel bravery and brave delights, birds, fields,
hedges, bed, Sun, Moon, Saints and sinners, farewel all for
ever, and farewel all for evermore, for I must now be damn'd
for ever, or I go I know not whither, as that great man said to
his soul, when he cryed soul, soul, whither art thou now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and then the fine fare, and the good chear, and the fine
linnen, with the Lemmon sauce, must have an end, and the
sweet singing; but the howling, that must be for evermore.
But take a touch of Heaven or ahout Heaven, though you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intend to come there, and I have done: And for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
first it is a place for divine discoveries, secondly of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
rest, thirdly of divine joyes, fourthly of divine glories;
and in it God discovers four things; the secrets of his heart,
the fulness of his glory, the nearness of relation, and greatness
of his love: we shall know as we are known, Gods decrees,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97592:22"/>
purposes, and secrets, his glory, the fulness of his glory, and
nearness of relation; yea we shall come from the East and from
the West, the North and the South, and sit down with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Kingdome of our God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and know him to be our Father even from everlasting, <hi>Isa.</hi>
63. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 29. God shall so abundantly discover his
love unto us, calling of us by his own name; O Ephraim, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,
my dear child thou art mine: yea Lord God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I am, and so is all that glory that thou hast given me, as
Christ speaks in another case. God gives to Christ, Christ
gives to Saints, and Saints gives to God all again: and so
God is all in all and ever shall be, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. But secondly,
Heaven is a place of divine rest, from sorrow, sin and labour,
tumults, noyses, feares, and troubles: in this world you shall
have trouble, but in me ye shall have peace saith Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi>
16. 33. internal, external, and eternal. A mans enemies shall
be at peace with him sometimes, and yet his friends warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him if his waies please God. And so the soul is like the
needle on the point, the Ark or Dove upon the waters, she
wants footing for the sole of the foot, and God is often want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the soul of a Saint, thou didst hide thy face saith <hi>David</hi>
and I was troubled; and the greatest trouble in the world is
Gods hiding of his face; but time shall pass and time will
come, that Israels God will be no more a hiding God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.
I5. nor they a wandring people in the barren wilderness of this
world, for in their Country which is Heaven, there is rest
without weariness, for the wavering Man and the wearied
Saint; and the bed and pillow is not half so sweet to the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, as is this rest. And the Saints rest is God, yea God
is their sweetest, true, and lasting rest and home, and so is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
yea this is the Land of Canaan indeed, and that Canaan
which every one would land in when they come to dye. I knew
one of you the other day, that alwaies wore a feather in his
cap, but being sick, he sent a Bill to beg that he might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
and go thither: yea there is none of you all but would
fain lay your bones, and lodge your sinning souls in Canaan
when you come to dye; Oh but you must live in Canaan, or go
the way to Canaan if ever you mean to come thither: tis not
an old fashion'd priests benediction or absolution, with a little
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97592:23"/>
Common Prayer, a sup of Wine with a bit of Bread, will lodge
you there, this may seal your damnation, but it will never bring
you to salvation, no, no, these low things shore none upon the
Land of Canaan; it is Gods love, Christs merit, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the spirit, a thing ye never knew what belongs to,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. that sets the soul there. But to go on, Heaven is a
place of divine joyes, and they that live in Heaven live in joyes,
and yet the joyes of Heaven can never live in them, they are so
great: Enter into thy Masters joy saith Christ. Light may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the eye, but not the body of light, joy may enter into
the heart, but not the body of joy: Men and Angels are but
finite creatures, but the joyes of Heaven are infinite, unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
unconceivable; earthly joyes are but shadowes of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
the joy of the Harvest is nothing to the joy of the Elect,
and the sweetest joyes of the spirit is nothing in comparison to
the joyes of Heaven: ye shall rejoyce saith Christ, and no man
shall take your joy from you, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 22. aud this is that joy
which Christ speaks of: some Fountains have their mouths or
pipes by which they continually send their Christal streams into
the artificial Wells with pleasant noyses; God hath his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
joyes and glories, which he alwaies sends forth by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
from himself into the souls of his, which they being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
withal, sends forth (as it were) from other golden pipes
his continual praises; and herein lies the joyes of Heaven, and
the Heaven above which you scarce beleeve: Angels and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Angels are not the joyes of Heaven, Saints and
communion with Saints are not the joyes of Heaven, these may
sing, and joy, and play together, yet are they not the joy
of Heaven, tis the musick rather than the string, that is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody
of musick, and it is God rather than the creature, that is
the joy of Heaven, and hence it is that their joy is alwaies fresh
and green, musick dulls, beauty fades, yea the Sun appears
sometimes darker than at other, at leastwise unto apprehension,
but this joy is alwaies rising, more and more delighting, now
where there is a continual rising of divine joyes &amp; glories, there
can be no ebbing of divine delights, the eccho rises with the
voice; the musick with the string, joyes by discoveries do the
like, yea they rise unanimously in all the Saints, and being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
in them, Heaven is made a double Heaven, shout O ye
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97592:23"/>
Inhabitants of Jerusalem, for great is the Holy One in the

pleasant pictures; yea let the ungodly and rich howle together,
<hi>Isa. 2. 16. Iam.</hi> 5. 1. But shout O Inhabitants of Jerusalem,
above, the City of the great King; this shouting denotes the
highest pitch of joy that Saints shall be filled with, when they
shall come to sup with God and Christ, by feeding on divine
delights, Rayes, joyes, and glories, which are the dishes of that
wedding Supper, where every Saint shall feed his full, <hi>Revell.</hi>
19. 8. 3 26. his full of joy, his full of praise, and sing his
part, yea every Angell his, and all shall try their skill and strain
their voices to make one melodious song of praises unto God,
and the Lamb for evermore, <hi>Revell.</hi> 7. 10. 15. 3. Some say
that a Syrrian or the song thereof, will so inchaunt a man, that
irresistibly it shall draw him to his fatall ruine; confident I am
were one Saint or Angell to sing from Heaven this day to you
in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> but one quarter of an hour, it would kill all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delights, and make you mind the God of Heaven, and the
joyes of Heaven for evermore; and all your former sinful swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
pleasures, would be but as the Asses braying, to the most
melodious musick in comparison of that. But Heaven is a
place of divine glories, and glorious things are spoken of thee
O Citie of God: all manner of precious stones are fetch'd to
set up thy glory, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, <hi>Revell.</hi> 21. 19. and
in the lies a Sun for every eye, a Crown for every head; yea a
Crown that fadeth not away: Crowns are the highest pitch of
glory that the aspiring soul of man can work unto, but the
lowest shadow of divine glory. Crowns and Kingdomes are
but fading things, yea they are now fading, while the glory
of Christ is rising in our Land: yea in <hi>Ireland</hi> which the Devil
and the Pope thought once to have had for their share; but
blessed shall they be, who have been most instrumental to plant
the Gospel there, and some body here have been very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
that way, and many to pull down you and the
Crowns of some of your families; yea the Crown of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all which lie in the dirt: and yet you go on to sin as much
as ever, and never think how many was sent to the Devil in the
late warre standing up for the Crown, yea how many great ones
were sent in a day in some great fights, (to wit) <hi>Naseby, York,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97592:24"/>
Newberry,</hi> or <hi>Spinham land:</hi> and yet these kind of Crownes are not worth
contending for, they are such light, foolish, fading things; But Saints Crowns
are exceeding weighty, heavy, and massy; yea there is an eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that attends every Saint, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. An eternal weight of glory can never
be poys'd or fade away, but a present earthly glory every age can discover to be
light and vain; yea within these few daies I have discovered much my self, and
many vain men (as <hi>David</hi> sayes) which now are not: and where is Mr. such

what shall Christ divine and the Father in the Spirit do, that is the question out
of question, and beyond all answer: the eye that made the eye, the ear that
made the ear, the Snn that made the Sun, the Heaven that made that Heaven
which is called Heaven, cannot be spoken to: Men may look into the beam<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but not into the Sun it is so glorious; the rayes of glory, on the backs of the
glorified may be looked into and spoken of, but not to one thousand part, as once
<hi>Queen Sheba</hi> said to <hi>Solomon,</hi> eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, that which thou
O God hast prepared for them that waite for thee, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 4. Nay it never
entred into the heart of any man to conceive saith <hi>St. Paul,</hi> what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

<hi>David.</hi> But something is revealed by the Spirit, yea so much that many wiser
than any of you, have despised with disdain and detestation all yours and this
worlds glory for it, and others have desired to die that they might be at it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
as all as you desire to live for, is onely to sin, or be a little longer out of Hell;
but I beleeve many of you are Sadduces, which scarce beleeve there is a Heaven,
a Hell or Resurrection: but fain would <hi>Paul</hi> die upon this account, and who
would not do so and be uncloathed, that he might be cloathed upon with this
house from Heaven and glory of Heaven, yea crowd thorough and thorough the
gates of death, for the Crown of Crowns, this wreath of life and glory: O <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where is the Christian that can say so now, and unstrip his dublet and affections
to the creature, freely laying down all that is near and dear at the feet of Christ,
for love to Christ, the joyes of Christ, and glories of Heaven; the Saints
cannot see now as in <hi>Stevens</hi> time, the glory of God, and Christ at the right
hand, nor the immortall things that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, <hi>

hence it is they cannot desire to unstrip and be dissolved: O but were the least
glimpses of immortal Crowns and glory clearly in their eyes, they would leap
into the grave and call for death, as a man for a friend in a great distress: we have
heard of some that have thrown themselves into the Ocean for to catch the shadow,
I am sure the God of Heaven and the joyes of Heaven are the substance which all
men should catch at, but the shadow most do; yea the Saints themselves are l<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and dungy, sishing for the creature rather than immortal glories: But were
they minded as in former times, I make no question but the Saints of this age
would (Imperious like) as much scorn the dungy chaff, stubble, straw, and
vanity of this world, as the lofty Eagle doth the poorest prey when she is flying
towards Heaven, yea were our thoughts upon our Fathers house, our Fathers
home, our Fathers glory; yea and our glory which is laid up for us where all
our faithfull friends are gone, and longs for our communion, me thinks the
pavement and curtains of Heaven, the place where Sun, Moon, and Staries
are pitched, tells us tis a glorious place: yea if the outside of this Ark above the

become a new Heaven to the Saints; yea when God and the Lamb shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

up his everlasting praises, <hi>Revell.</hi> 3. 12. Then shall the glory of the Lord and

shall personally lead them to the fountains of living waters; not to sup a little

of glory, and the glorified Seas wherein their souls shall alwayes tumble, never
sounding any bottome in those boundless glorious bancks, carrying them by
gales of divine joyes further and further, from all bounds and bottoms, rocks,
and dangers. And now I conclude with this advice, if you indeed think there
is a Heaven, look for that, or if indeed this be a fancy, And all that you call Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
be a meer piece of knavish Policy, to make fools and asses of honest men, then
take your pleasure stil, and let the daies of darkness never come near you nor your
thoughts, or families, which do but spoil your pleasures, for if you affright a child
with a Bugbeare, you may make hm fearful all his life, and if you your selves will
fancy that which is not, It will be great losse and trouble to the minds of such as
you, who yet want more pleasures, or time to pursue after more; nay do you not: O
but if after all there should be a God, O but if there should be a Heaven, and
a God better than Heaven a thousand times, or a thousand Heavens, which
should at last be lost for want of thinking or beleeving; what a sad case will you
then be in; yea I say what a sad case will you then all be in, when God is lost,
Christ, Heaven, Soul, Body, and all is lost for a moments lust: O Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
consider this in time; yea this night, least the night of nights overtake you,
which that it may not, it is and ever shall be, the hearts desire and prayer of
