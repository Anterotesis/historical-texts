         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Objects</hi> of it, as it includes the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Objects of Sence, of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60702:6"/>
and Spiritual Substances, of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and Infinite, and of Revealed
Truths.</p>
            <p>And, first, I can freely grant
(what has cost our Adversary some
Pages to prove,) <hi>viz.</hi> [<q>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Nature can come to our
Knowledge, but by some of these
four Means, <hi>viz.</hi> the Experience of
the <hi>Senses,</hi> the Experience of the
<hi>Mind, Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Sect. 1. Cap. 3.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>But yet I think it very absurd, to
advance one Rule or Standard for
every Part or Branch of <hi>Humane
Knowledge,</hi> and thereupon form Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and charge <hi>Contradictions</hi>
and <hi>Absurdities,</hi> without making the
least allowance or distinction, <hi>with
respect to the nature of the Object, or
the methods of knowing it.</hi> Here is
the Source of all our Adversary's
Mistakes and Miscarriages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(as will anon more fully appear)
he has cast a Cloud upon <hi>Reason,</hi>
rather than improv'd its Native
Lustre and Glory.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> as for the Knowledge
of <hi>Objects of Sense;</hi> it's certain the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60702:6"/>
Mind of Man, the proper Seat as
well as Principle of <hi>Humane Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
is here entertain'd by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Material World; for,
<hi>Nothing but Matter in the ordinary
course of Natural Knowledge make an
Impression upon the outward Senses, so
as to transmit, and fix an Idea in the
Mind, suitable to the nature of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
And certainly here is the great
original Stock of <hi>Humane Knowledge;</hi>
for the Senses are not only the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vehicles to all those Ideas, that
are lodg'd in the Mind, (since even
Faith and Revelation come by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
but these very Ideas, if posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and formed on Things and
Substances, are little else but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
of material Sensations, or
the Ideas of some <hi>Object of Sense.</hi>
However, exalted and refined may
be the Ideas of Angels and glorified
Spirits, that have things presented to
the view of the Mind by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Intuition, it's manifest <hi>we</hi> that
are cloath'd with Senses and Matter,
and those of a very coarse allay, must
have all our Ideas tinged with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Adumbrations: These are that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60702:7"/>
Glass upon the Mind through which
we see darkly, and that wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incrassates and disguises the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Things. It's true, in <hi>Objects
of Sense</hi> our Ideas must be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
clear and exact, because we
are seated in the very heart or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the material World, where
its Objects perpetually crowd in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Senses, and are continually
presented to our view and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But yet, in <hi>Objects of Sense,</hi>
which we daily see and converse
with, we can by no means pretend
an adequate Knowledge; for, we
cannot comprehend or penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their proper Essences, or radical
Substances; no, we can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Properties, Powers, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
that discover themselves in
their Effects, strike the Senses, and
leave an Impression, whence a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Idea is form'd. Again, We
cannot pretend to discover the true
Modes of these Properties, Powers,
or Faculties, so as to discern where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the precise Nature of 'em con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists;
for, at least, we can only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
it by some Ideas that are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60702:7"/>
form'd by the noblest of Senses,
that of <hi>Seeing;</hi> thus of <hi>Smells,</hi> and
<hi>Tasts,</hi> and the like: So that we see
the highest Philosophical Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
even in matters of Sense, are
at last wrap'd up in that we can
justly call a MYSTERY. Its true, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sense,</hi> tho' form'd from Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and Properties, create a very
certain and indisputable Knowledge,
because confirm'd by daily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Observation, and because the
proper Objects of that part, which
(as before concluded) is not only
the Vehicle, but first <hi>Elaboratory</hi> of
<hi>all Ideas;</hi> I mean the outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<hi>And therefore, in Objects of
Sense, we must receive and embrace
a Thing as it presents itself to the
view of our Senses, since we are
assur'd, that GOD has appointed no
other way of communicating matters
of this nature to Mankind.</hi> And to
receive an <hi>Object of Sense</hi> contrary
to the Testimony of all our Senses,
(tho' upon the pretended Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Revelation</hi>) must overturn all
the Measures and Principles of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Knowledge,</hi> obliterate the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60702:8"/>
and Distinctions of <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Error,</hi> raze the prime Faculties and
Motrements of <hi>Reason,</hi> and reduce
Man, the Glory of the Creation,
and GOD's Image and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
infinitely below the level of
<hi>Brutes</hi> that perish. <hi>For this reason
we may reject the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
notwithstanding the
highest Pretences to Miracle or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
since it implies a Contradiction
of the Testimony of all our Senses in
matters of Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> let us consider <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Knowledge</hi> as engag'd about
the Objects of the Spiritual World,
or Spiritual or Immaterial Beings;
for this must very much alter the
Scene of <hi>Knowledges,</hi> and fix it upon
new Measures and Principles.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>1st,</hi> It's indisputably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that our Knowledge of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
is of a mix'd nature, since it
takes its rise partly from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Natural Reason,</hi> and partly
from <hi>Revelation.</hi> The Knowledge
of God and our own Souls, may in
some measure be traced from the
Powers of <hi>Natural Reason.</hi> The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60702:8"/>
Frame of our own Beings, as well
as that of the Universe, will instruct
us, That there must be an Eternal,
All-wise, and All-powerful Mover,
agreeable to the Sacred Language:
The invisible things of Him from
the Creation of the World, are
clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made, even His
Eternal Power and Godhead, <hi>Rom.
i. 20.</hi> but as for the Existence of
other Beings, we call Spirits, or
their Orders and Societies, we must
wholly receive it from <hi>Revelation.</hi>
Again; As for the Nature and
Ideas of a Spirit, this must certainly
rest on the Instructions of <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Revelation;</hi> and after the best
that can be given, God knows, our
Attainments are very lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
the excellency of our own
Faculties and Operations tell us,
That we are acted by a Principle
within, that must be highly distinct
from Matter, or least, that we see
and handle much more from that
Great GOD, whose Workmanship
is this very <hi>Reason</hi> that thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates.
This very Argument suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60702:9"/>
instructs us, We ought not
to think that the Godhead is like
unto Gold or Silver, or Stone gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Art and Man's Device,
<hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 29.</p>
            <p>But now, tho' from good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we may conclude, That a
<hi>Spirit</hi> is a Being somewhat distinct
from <hi>Matter,</hi> yet <hi>our most exalted
Idea will be but a meer Negative, or
if Positive, a Resemblance of a refined
Aerial kind of Matter;</hi> so that our
Ideas of a Spirit is much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,
imperfect, and conjectural
than that of a Body, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the utmost assistances of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I'm oblig'd to make
some Returns to what this <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reasoner,</hi> with the Authority of
a Great Man on his side (as he
calls him), has deliver'd on the
Subject; it amounts to this: We
have as clear an Idea of <hi>Spirits</hi> as
<hi>Bodies,</hi> since both are only to be
known by their Properties, and the
Properties of a <hi>Spirit</hi> are as clear as
those of a <hi>Body.</hi> See <hi>Sect. 3. Cap. 2.
N. 16, 17, 19.</hi> But, with Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60702:9"/>
to the Infallible Chair, though
some Properties which belong to
those Beings we call <hi>Spirits,</hi> are
clearly known and agreed upon,
yet they are not so many, nor yet
so distinguishing as those of <hi>Bodies;</hi>
for, besides the Properties of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Bodies,</hi> that distinguish each
other, there are Properties certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, that belong to a <hi>Body</hi>
as a <hi>Body,</hi> and distinguish it from
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and every Being that can
be imagined; such are extension of
Parts, and a Faculty of possessing
a Place in proportion to 'em. These
are for the most part Objects of
Sense, and Self-evident; <hi>but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
decipher or determine any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Properties that belong to a Spirit
as a Spirit, and distinguish it from
Body or Matter, and every thing else.</hi>
We may indeed conceive <hi>Spirits</hi>
as Finite Beings, by the resemblance
of <hi>Bodies,</hi> and consequently make
'em exist in a place, and possess
sometimes one place, and sometimes
another; but we can form no Idea
how they exist in places, as we do
of <hi>Bodies.</hi> As for <hi>Thinking, Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60702:10"/>
and <hi>Willing,</hi> these seem to be
too remote, to be the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Properties of a <hi>Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
as such, being Faculties that
seem to slow after its Radical or
Original Properties are given. I
am sure they cannot be so in the
Opinion of my Author's Great Man,
since in one place he tells us, [It's
impossible without Revelation to
discover (whether Omnipotency has
not given to some Systems of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fitly dispos'd) a Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or think.—And again, I see
no Contradiction in it, That the
first Eternal Thinking, Being, or
Omnipotent Spirit, should, if he
pleas'd, give to certain Systems of
created sensless Matter, put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as he thinks fit, some degrees
of Sense, Perception, and Thought.]
Lock's <hi>Human Vnderstanding,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lock<hi>'s Human Vnderst.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Lib. 4.
Cap. 3. N. 6.</hi> And therefore I think
it appears, there's a vast Difference
between the Knowledge of <hi>Spirits</hi>
and <hi>Bodies;</hi> insomuch that we may
justly pronounce, <hi>That no positive
Ideas can be formed of Spirits, as
Spiritual Substances, but what carry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60702:10"/>
the resemblances of Matter in 'em;</hi>
other Ideas must be form'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
'em with Matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
what they <hi>are not,</hi> rather
than what they are.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let us examin the
Measures and Extent of <hi>Humane
Knowledge,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
as it is Finite or Infinite. As
for the Knowledge of Finite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
an Estimate may be taken
from what has been deliver'd on
the two preceeding Arguments, the
Subject of which being chiefly Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Objects: The present Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then is, after the Knowledge of
Infinite Objects; and here certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Nature of the Being that
<hi>thinks</hi> and <hi>knows,</hi> will determine
the Case, I mean, demonstrate the
<hi>Imperfection of Humane Knowledge;</hi>
for <hi>it's an Absurdity in Terms, as
well as in the Nature of the Thing,
to imagine that a Finite Mind should
gain a perfect Comprehension of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Being;</hi> insomuch, that it seems
no Presumption to affirm, That
GOD, by vertue of His Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
after He hath instated us in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60702:11"/>
the Beatifick Vision, and discover'd
things that <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor
Ear heard, nor Heart conceiv'd;</hi> or,
in a word, after we have seen Him
as He is, cannot possess us with an
adequate Idea of His Immense and
Infinite Being: So that with respect
to the Godhead we must affirm,
That our Ideas are made up of
Negatives, and consequently with
<hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> affirm, That we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know God by concealing what
He <hi>is not,</hi> than what He <hi>is:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <bibl>
                     <hi>Strom.</hi> lib. 5.</bibl>
               </note> Or, at
least, if we attempt any positive
Conceptions, we are forced to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
'em forth by some Finite
Ideas which we have taken up, and
are already implanted in us. Thus
the Divine Attribute of Wisdom we
are forc'd to resemble by a Faculty
of <hi>Discerning</hi> and <hi>Comprehending,</hi>
infinitely surpassing the Sphere of
<hi>Humane Knowledge.</hi> Thus the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity
of God, by a vast space, or
an Idea that is without Bounds or
Limits, or is not to be circumscrib'd.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60702:11"/>
Thus Eternity, by an endless Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Time. Thus we see, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our nicest Conceptions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the most accurate Characters
and Descriptions from <hi>Revelation</hi> it
self, we are forced to call in <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Objects,</hi> and measure the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Attributes of our Creator by
<hi>Finite Ideas;</hi> an Undertaking so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of him, that it seems to be
a piece of petty <hi>Larceny,</hi> or rather
a lesser sort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as 'tis a
kind of Representation of the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
GOD, by things that are seen,
by a kind of <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Wood,</hi> or
<hi>Stone,</hi> graved in the shallow Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
of Impotent Men.
Here our Weakness, our Blindness,
plainly discovers it self;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for tho'
Knowledge in <hi>Finite Objects</hi> may
appear bright and shining, here it
must suffer an Eclipse, and lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in depth of <hi>Mystery;</hi> and,
in a word, humbly make St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Recognition: <hi>O the depth of the
Riches of the Wisdom, and Power, and
Immenseness of God! how unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60702:12"/>
But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let us descend to
the last Stage of <hi>Humane Knowledge,</hi>
I mean that about matters of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
And, first, it's certain that
pure Matters of <hi>Revelation</hi> are
things of which the Mind, by its
own intrinsick Light, can form no
Ideas; and consequently we cannot
pretend to know any thing more
of them, than GOD in a reveal'd
way is pleas'd to communicate. It's
true, He seems to be obliged to
communicate Himself in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that His Revelations, at least,
may bear a resemblance to some of
those Ideas we have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
or by the Power of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason can attain to. Thus
does He reveal a Saviour that is
GOD-Man, he's oblig'd to ascribe such
Characters of Divinity to him, as are
agreeable to the reveal'd Characters
of the Godhead, and those Ideas we
can form of it; and in like manner
as to his Humanity; for otherwise
I cannot conceive how any reveal'd
Truth can be imprinted on the
Mind, without Special Inspiration.
But then, on the other hand, <hi>when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60702:12"/>
God publisheth a reveal'd Truth in
such Characters as suffice to inform us
what he intends by it,</hi> viz. <hi>a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
that is GOD-Man, or the like, he
is not oblig'd (neither is it any way
requisite to the reception of a reveal'd
Truth) to demonstrate the</hi> modus <hi>of
the Vnion of the two Natures:</hi> First,
Because the Subject of Revelation
being Matters not attainable by
Reason, and GOD the Author of
them, as long as we have an Idea
of the thing, or an Idea of what
GOD proposes to be believ'd, the
<hi>modus</hi> of it is to be placed on the
Infinite Power and Veracity of God.
Secondly, Because a leading Design
of Revelation being to establish a
Confidence in God's Power and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,
in order to an absolute Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Worship, He did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make us Philosophers, but
reveal'd what was useful and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and directs us to adore, when
we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>From what has been deliver'd
we may form two or three Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;
<hi>1st,</hi> With respect to this last
Argument, Whatever our Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60702:13"/>
may be in Matters of Sense
and Natural Reason, it appears, that
pure Matters of Revelation lye at
a great distance from us; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Knowledge cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
much beyond the Surface,
since they are not only things in
their own nature profound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
but all our Discoveries rest
on the good Will and Pleasure of
GOD, that communicates 'em. And
therefore, if Revelation itself tells
us, we know but in part, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly,
we may safely affirm it,
and place all Difficulties on the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
of Humane Knowledge,
or the Depths and Mysteriousness
of Reveal'd Truths. <hi>2dly,</hi> It's a
notorious Absurdity to argue from
Ideas of Objects of Sense, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Objects against Immaterial
ones; or Finite against Infinite,
much more against Reveal'd ones.
For it manifestly appears, that the
Measures of Humane Knowledge
are to be taken from each respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Object; for, as every Object
hath a distinct Essence or Nature,
so it hath distinct Properties and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60702:13"/>
Modes peculiar to its Nature; and
the Ideas we conceive of the one,
may not reach or measure the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This is even so clear, that
even in Properties that are common
to several Objects, such as <hi>Spirits</hi>
and <hi>Bodies,</hi> when apply'd to their
respective Objects, carry no manner
of Resemblance to each other.</p>
            <p>Thus it's an inseparable Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> to occupy
a Place, and yet the manner of
existing in a Place is, no doubt,
vastly different; insomuch, that I
cannot find how any Ideas of the
<hi>Vbi</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> can conclude any
thing against that of <hi>Spirits,</hi> much
less measure or define it. And, by
a Parity of Reason, we may say
as much of the Unity of a Body,
and the Unity of an Infinite Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
for the Unity of the Godhead
or the Divine Essence may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
and yet communicate it self
to Three Personal Subsistences: and
it must be absurd to deny this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it will not comport with our
common Ideas of the Unity of a
Body. <hi>3dly, In Matters of</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60702:14"/>
               <hi>it's as absurd to Argue against
Reveal'd Truths, when the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
is describ'd in such a manner,
that we may know what is intended by
it, because we cannot comprehend the</hi>
Modus <hi>of it; since this would oblige
us to reject several things, even in
Objects of Sence, that are hitherto
Vnquestionable.</hi> What I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
deliver'd, is by way of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and I shall stand by it as
such, in defiance of the utmost At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of our <hi>assuming Reasoner;</hi>
and having laid this Foundation, I
promise my self Success, in unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Positions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, to take him in the order
we find him, before he gives you a
State of the Question, he begins with
the main <hi>Burden of his Song,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
you with some Sarcastical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
upon the Managements,
and Maxims of <hi>Divines,</hi> about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
As if the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had no Notion of Religion, but
Mystery; and Divines unanimously
owned their Ignorance about it,
[<hi>Whilst they gravely tell us, we must
adore what we cannot comprehend;</hi>] and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60702:14"/>
yet majesteriously obtrude contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
Comments, as infallible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of an unfathomable
Mystery.</p>
            <p>It's visible this whole Paragraph
is spent upon the Clergy; for, who
are to account for Mens Ignorance
or absurd Notions in Religion, but
those whose Business it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
and remove 'em? Again;
Who are to answer for Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but the Clergy, that resolve
all into unfathomable Mystery, and
yet by their peremptory Comments
pretend to unravel all to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration?
This is a Strain of
impregnated Malice, that runs thro'
the whole Book; where the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
by Insinuation, Consequence, or
downright Assertions, are charg'd
with Imposture, as if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
combin'd to resolve all
<hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Mystery,</hi> even to the
carrying on of Contradictions: For
in one place he makes it an <hi>Asylum</hi>
or Shelter to their Ignorance; in
another, an Artifice of Usurpation,
to oblige the Laity to admit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as a <hi>Branch of their Creed,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60702:15"/>
till it hath been ratified from their
<hi>Confessor's Chair.</hi> In a word, he
represents 'em as Introducers of
<hi>Deism;</hi> he might have added, <hi>as
Subverters of all Religion too,</hi> since
he makes 'em labour in nothing
but Absurdities and Contradictions.
And now you have the Character
or Temper of the Man, and see
where his poyson'd Arrows are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
I shall with Patience, or
rather Contempt, pass by all Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of this kind, and content my
self with the Confidence of wiping
off his Calumnies by confuting his
Positions. To return then,</p>
            <p>As for the Comments of some
Divines, neither the Church, nor
Body of the Clergy are to account
for the Indiscretions which Heat or
Passion has surpriz'd some of them
into; but, I'm perswaded, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of others will stand the Test
of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> to establish
those Truths we call MYSTERIES,
better than those of <hi>his</hi> Faction or
Perswasion, to shake or overturn
'em.</p>
            <p>As for the Maxim that instructs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60702:15"/>
us to <hi>Adore what we cannot Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,</hi>
I think it's extreamly proper
where we can prove a <hi>Mystery;</hi> for
if God recommends an Article of
Faith that exceeds the Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Finite Mind, we may rest
satisfied with an imperfect Idea,
(even tho' it be no more than what
is needful to point out to us what
God intends by it) and then sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
our Judgments to His Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Veracity for the rest: A consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Instance of Obedience (even
the Obedience of <hi>Faith</hi>) as well as
Adoration.</p>
            <p>After this, he presents us with
the Opinions of some particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or, at least, the Fictions of his
own Brain, concerning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Fathers, Councels,</hi> and <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
and the Rules of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: But I'm concern'd to assign
what Deference is to be paid to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
or <hi>Councels,</hi> or what Rules to
be observ'd in interpreting <hi>Scripture,</hi>
till he thinks fit to charge our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
with Error in these matters.</hi>
This is foreign to the Argument
we are now engag'd in. The next
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60702:16"/>
thing he presents us with, is, Two
Opinions of nameless Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Use of <hi>Reason</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the <hi>Sence of Scripture;</hi>
and, at last, makes all sides (that
differ from his Notions) joyn in this
Position, (for I can put no other
gloss on his words, when he affirms)
That both from different Principles
agree, [<hi>That several Doctrines of the
New Testament belong no further to
the Enquiries of Reason, than to prove
them Divinely reveal'd; and, that
they are properly Mysteries still,</hi> Ib.
N. 6.] That there are Doctrines
in the New Testament that may
be properly call'd <hi>Mysteries</hi> still, I
do not question; but I can evince
in the Sequel of this Tract. But I
cannot find where the Church of
<hi>England</hi> has declar'd herself, That
Reason hath nothing to do with
some Reveal'd Doctrines, but only
to prove them divinely reveal'd;
for, certainly, <hi>Faith it self is a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Assent to a Divine Truth; and
Reason will not only be concern'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and prove, whether God hath
deliver'd it, but to form some Idea
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60702:16"/>
(tho' an imperfect one) of the Nature
of this Truth; at least, such an Idea
as will convince us what it is God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to our Belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Else we assent to we know not
what. But after the utmost Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches
of Reason, our very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may inform us, that there may
be a great deal in this Truth or
Doctrine, with respect to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Modes of the thing, which
She can by no means comprehend,
and consequently may still be justly
accounted a <hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we come to his own Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
[<hi>On the contrary we hold,—
That nothing reveal'd, whether as to
its manner or existence, is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from its Disquisitions, than the
ordinary Phoenomena of Nature; and
that there is nothing in the Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reason, nor above it, and that
no Christian Doctrine can be properly
called a</hi> MYSTERY.<note place="margin">N. 7.</note> This he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
as the State of the Question,
agreeable to the Title of his Book,
and consequently all that follows is
only a confirmation or making good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60702:17"/>
of this Position. I must confess, I
should be so fair to him, as to wait
his Arguments; but because nothing
shall stick upon the Reader, I shall
make something of a return to such
Decretory Assertions, in the order we
find them:</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> this great Reasoner
seems to play the Sophister, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
himself in a very ambiguous
manner: He tells us, That no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
Truth is exempted from the
Disquisitions of Reason. And truly,
if he intends no more, than that the
sublimest Reveal'd Truths may be
examin'd by Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as far as she is
able to comprehend them, we shall
entirely joyn with him; for Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is thus far an Address to the
Reason of Mankind, and she may
lawfully endeavour to discover and
conceive as much of their manner
and existence as possible; <hi>Provided
she does not reject what she cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and that too upon this very
Argument, Because she cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the whole Manner and Existence
of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>Reason</hi> may be concern'd,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60702:17"/>
and yet Reveal'd Truths may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said to be above Reason, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious,
and consequently his Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do by no means answer his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
which is to prove, That No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is mysterious, or above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>But if he intends, that Matters of
Revelation, both with respect to
their Manner and Existence, may be
scann'd and comprehended by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as easily as the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of
Nature; this we utterly deny, and
with very good reason too: <hi>1st,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there's no connexion in the
Consequence, the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are often Objects of Sence, and
of a finite nature: But there are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
matters that are in their very
frame spiritual and infinite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not to be comprehended
by a finite Mind or Reason, <hi>much
less with that ease and clearness that
Objects of Sence are convey'd to the
Mind.</hi> Again, Matters of Sence are
knowable and comprehensible by
the Powers of Natural Reason; but
there are Matters of <hi>Revelation</hi> that
are not only incomprehensible in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60702:18"/>
their own nature, but knowable no
further than God is pleas'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
or impart to us. This is
clear from what has been already
laid down and concluded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this can be no Consequence; the
<hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Nature are easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,
therefore all matters of
<hi>Revelation</hi> are so. This is so absurd,
that I do not question but I shall
make it appear in the Sequel of this
Discourse, <q>That there are some
Matters of Revelation, which if
scann'd by Ideas of Objects of
Sence, carry the appearance of
Contradictions; and yet this can
be no Argument against the Truth
of 'em, or that we are mistaken in
the purport of the Holy Ghost, (as
the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it) when
what we contend for is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the clearest Characters and
Descriptions.</q> And yet, this is the
top of our Adversary's Reasonings.
But, <hi>2dly,</hi> as for Reveal'd Matters
being <hi>mysterious,</hi> or <hi>above Reason,</hi> it's
already concluded, That the radical
Essence of Objects of Sence, and much
more the Modes of their Properties,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60702:18"/>
or their Existence, are above the
Comprehension of Reason: If so,
what hath been deliver'd upon Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Revelation,</hi> will oblige us to
conclude, against our Adversary,
<q>That they cannot be fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in their Nature or Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
much less in the <hi>Modus</hi> of
it; and consequently, that they
are in the highest sence <hi>mysterious,</hi>
and <hi>above Reason.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, in the next place
he entertains you, pursuant to the
Notions of his great Man, with a
large account what Reason is, and
what she is not; the Means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and Ground-Perswasion:
And I must freely own, that I can for
the most part agree with him, and
his great Man; at least it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to enter upon a nice Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of every Paragraph, because
I find he makes no particular Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of what he has so elaborately
delivered in several Chapters, to
prove his main Design. He tells us,
Chap. 4. Sect. 1. [<hi>That the Ground of
Perswasion is Evidence, and Evidence
he defines, an exact Conformity of our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60702:19"/>
Ideas, or Thoughts, with their Objects,
or Things we think upon.</hi>] The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
I think, is well enough;
but all this concludes nothing to
prove what he contends for, <hi>viz.</hi>
That nothing is above Reason; for
the imperfect Ideas of Infinite and
Incomprehensible Beings, must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Resemblance, or Conformity to
the Object, or the Characters of an
Incomprehensible Being; and yet it
does not follow, but our Ideas are
imperfect, and that there is a great
deal in the Object, of which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
form any clear Idea. Indeed, if
this were not so, he might justly
infer, That there's nothing above
Reason in Revelation. In a word,
since he hath so industriously stated
the Nature of Reason and Humane
Knowledge, he should have proved,
<hi>That there are no degrees of Evidence,
or Knowledge, with respect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Object, or Means of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
That we have as clear and
compleat an Idea of Infinite Beings as
Finite, of an Infinite Spirit as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Sence: That reveal'd Objects
occurr by the same way as Objects of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60702:19"/>
Sence do; or, That the Extent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
Knowledge, does not depend on
the Good Will and Pleasure of God, in
communicating what he pleaseth on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Object.</hi> This would have clear'd
off all Dispute, and proved what he
thinks he's able to evince, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Evidence of all the Ideas of the
Operations of the Mind, is as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as our own Being, <hi>Cap. 4. N. 14.</hi>
That what is reveal'd in Religion,
may be as easily comprehended, and
found as consistent with our common
Notions, as what we know of Wood
or Stone, of Air, Water, or the like,
<hi>Sect. 3. Cap. 2. N. 12.</hi>] Or, in a word,
that there's nothing in Religion, or
Revelation mysterious, or above
Reason. The two latter of these
Parodoxes will receive such Replies
as are proper in the Sequel of this
Discourse; but I cannot pass the first
without a few Remarks: And, to
put the most favourable Construction
on an Ambiguous Assertion, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
he affirms, That <hi>the Evidence
of our Ideas which we form of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acts or Operations of the Mind,</hi>
(viz. <hi>Thinking, Contemplating, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60702:20"/>
or Comprehending) are as infallible
as that of our Beings.</hi> This is a
Maxim advanc'd to prove, That we
are to have the same Evidence in all
speculative Ideas, and consequently
in all Ideas of pure Matters of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
for this is his Application of
it: [<hi>Let us now but strictly require this
Evidence in all the Agreements and
Disagreements of our Ideas in Things
meerly speculative,</hi> &amp;c. Ib.]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To shew
the Weakness or Inconclusiveness of
his Arguments, and the Falseness of
his Positions, I shall instance in the
general Act or Operation of the Mind,
that of <hi>Thinking.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>First, If he intends no more than
that we have an Evidence (that we
<hi>think,</hi> when we actually <hi>think,</hi> or that
we have a Faculty to <hi>think</hi>) as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
as that of our <hi>Being,</hi> I will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyn with him: But, can this be
an Argument, that all our Ideas of
Speculative Objects, particularly of
all Matters of Revelation, (that are
form'd by <hi>Thinking</hi>) rest upon an
Evidence as clear as that of our <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
Again, If he contends for an
Idea of the <hi>Nature of Thinking,</hi> that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60702:20"/>
carries an Evidence in it, as clear and
infallible as that of our <hi>Being;</hi> I say,
we cannot form an Idea of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Thought,</hi> but by retreating to
some particular Instance or Object of
<hi>Thought,</hi> and reflecting how the <hi>Mind</hi>
exercises itself upon it; and before
we can form a perfect Idea of the
<hi>Nature of Thought,</hi> we must compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
or discern the <hi>manner</hi> of the
performance, and this will carry us
into a great many Difficulties and
Conjectures. We may indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that <hi>Thought</hi> requires the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Object to the Mind,
or rather the application of the Mind
to the Object, which may justly be
called <hi>Attention.</hi> Thus far the Idea
of <hi>Thinking</hi> is clear and evident: But
then, if we enquire into the <hi>manner</hi>
how this or that Object is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
or apply'd to the Mind, this
seems to be inconceivable, even in
Objects of Sence; for, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to describe how Material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are imprinted on an Immaterial
Soul? Therefore we may conclude,
that the Ideas we can form of the
<hi>Nature of Thinking,</hi> and consequently
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60702:21"/>
of the Operations of the Mind, do
not carry an Evidence in 'em as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
as that of our Being.</p>
            <p>But further; Admit we, that we
could describe the precise <hi>Modus</hi> of
the <hi>Nature of Thinking,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
had an Idea that carries as
much Evidence in it as that of our
Existence, it's absurd to conclude,
that the Mind can form Ideas of the
highest Speculations equally evident
and infallible. The Consequence, in
plain terms, is no other than this,
Because the Evidence of the Ideas of
one particular Object is infallible,
therefore the Evidence of the Ideas
of every Object is so. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is a Position that must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all our Ideas equally clear
and perfect, and the Means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
infallible, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there can be no Objects falsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to the Mind, nor no Ideas
false or imperfect. This is <hi>Mystery</hi>
with a witness, or rather Positions
that in his own Language are, [<hi>The
Primary and Vniterical Origin of all
his Errors,</hi> Ib.] But, I think, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
confutes himself in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60702:21"/>
Paragraphs, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
some things dubious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
and allows false Ideas may be
contracted by Precipitancy or Inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
by Affection and Preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>N. 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for the Second,<note place="margin">Sect. II.</note> where
he introduces us with a Description
of what is contrary to Reason, [viz.
<hi>What is evidently repugnant to clear
and distinct Ideas, or to our common
Notions, is contrary to Reason.</hi>] Now
truly this I think is a very lame, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
or at least fallacious Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unless it be ballanced with some
Limitations and Restrictions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As first, It can only hold in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the same Species, or Nature;
Thus we can only argue from Objects of
Sence, against Objects of Sence, from
Finite against finite, and from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Revelation against pretended
Matters of Revelation: For its the
greatest Absurdity in Nature, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any thing against any revealed
Truth, or Doctrine, whose Object is
purely Spiritual, and absolutely Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
because it doth not accord with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60702:22"/>
our Ideas in Objects of Sence; I'm sure
the Holy Ghost instructs us better, in
obliging us to compare Spiritual Things
with Spiritual.</hi> A sufficient Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
truly against discarding reveal'd
Truths by any other Ideas, then
what are formed from antecedent
Notices of Revelation.</p>
            <p>Thus for our Saviour's Divinity,
before we yield an Assent to it, it's
requisite the Characters and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Godhead, which are in
the Books of Revelation ascrib'd to
the Father, with respect to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
shou'd be ascrib'd to the Son
But then when this is done, it's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to reject this great Truth, as
contrary to Reason, upon the force
of an unreasonable Consequence
formed by comparing the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
Godhead with Objects of
Sence.</p>
            <p>Thus the Son cannot be God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it must destroy the Unity of the
Godhead; for the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
must be destroy'd: Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such Unity and Plurality can
never be admitted in Objects of
Sence, and consequently not in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60702:22"/>
sublimest Matters of Revelation.
But what is this but to prostitute the
Glory and Majesty of the Invisible
and Incomprehensible Godhead, by
the vilest Representations? What is
it but a making him like Gold, Wood
or Stone, or Things graven by Man's
Art. Certain I am, such Maxims
as these are the highest Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Reason; for if they might
take place, it must shake the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Revelation, even those
lively Characters which the Word
of God hath given of the Godhead:
<hi>If they must be scann'd, or measured
by common Notions, or Ideas that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
from Objects of Sence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Before we pronounce any
thing contrary to Reason, we must be
sure that we have a clear and perfect
Comprehension of the Thing;</hi> for tho'
our Ideas that are seemingly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to it, be never so clear, how
shall we judge of the Repugnancy,
as long as we cannot pretend to a
perfect Idea on both sides? This I'm
sure is a very reasonable Injunction,
between Objects of Sence, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Revelation; so that if God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60702:23"/>
hath delivered any revealed Truth,
and by comparing it with the Ideas
and Characters of other reveal'd
Truths, we must conclude, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
such a particular thing, and
at the same time discern the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibleness
of it; insomuch that
we cannot form an adequate Idea;
it's absurd to reject it, because this
imperfect Idea will not comport
with certain clear Ideas in Objects of
Sence. <q>
                  <hi>Here if any Difficulties, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities,
or Contradictions arise, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will direct us to place 'em upon the
Weakness of our Vnderstandings, or
our imperfect way of comprehending
such unfathomable Objects; and with
St.</hi> Paul, <hi>engage us to cry out, Who is
sufficient for these things?</hi>
               </q> And now
if my Adversary will add these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
to his Definition (as I'm
perswaded he'll be forced to do) I
do not question, but I can wipe off
all the Absurdities produced in the
following Chapter, at least by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Impertinence to the Case
before us. And on this account, I
pass by 'em, as well as because there's
nothing in 'em, that affects any thing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60702:23"/>
already delivered, but either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
or may be fairly solved by it.
I therefore proceed to his Argument,
<hi>Sect. 2. Cap. 1. N. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing I shall insist upon
is, [<hi>That if any Doctrine of the New
Testament be contrary to Reason, we
have no manner of Idea of it: To
say for instance, that a Ball is White
and Black at once.</hi>] Here he suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
discovers himself; he tells us
before, That whatever is repugnant
to common Notions, is contrary to
Reason; and what his common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are, the Instance before us, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
informs; that is, in plain
<hi>English,</hi> whatever does not comport
with the most trite Ideas of Objects
of Sence is contrary to Reason; and
therefore the most sublime revealed
Truths (whose Objects are Spirits,
and Infinite Spirits, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Ideas we can pretend to, must
be highly imperfect) because we
cannot adjust them with the most
common Ideas of Sence, are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Reason. But the Absurdity of
this Assertion, I hope, I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
exploded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60702:24"/>
But, to deliver my own Sentiments
of matters of this nature once for all,
I do believe there's an eternal and
universal Harmony in Reason, as
well as things both created and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created.
The Reason of Mankind
is certainly an immediate Transcript
of Infinite Reason, and all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
Decrees, and Declarations of
Heaven are the Dictates of Infinite
Reason, and the Reason of Mankind
must be establish'd upon the unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Rules or Measures of Infinite
Reason; and therefore there can be
no Ideas of Infinite Truths or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(provided they are compleat
and perfect, such as GOD can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of Himself) which really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Rules and Measures of
<hi>Humane Reason,</hi> if she were enabl'd
to comprehend 'em as clearly as her
Maker.</p>
            <p>But yet, I think, I have made it
appear, that after all the Researches
of Reason, there are reveal'd Objects
of which we can form but very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Ideas, both with respect to
their <hi>Nature, Existence,</hi> and <hi>Modus,</hi>
and yet we may form such an Idea as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60702:24"/>
instructs us what GOD intends we
should believe.</p>
            <p>From hence we may conclude,
<q>That as their nature is peculiarly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht
from all other Beings, so is
the <hi>Modus</hi> of their Existence:</q> So
that it's highly absurd to deny our
Assent to the Truth of it, because
we can form no Idea that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with those we have form'd on
<hi>Objects of Sence,</hi> and consequently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
it to be contrary to <hi>Reason.</hi>
               <q>This is a Contradiction to the
Eternal Laws of right <hi>Reason,</hi>
which, in Cases of this nature, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us to fix the Absurdity or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
on the Imperfections of
our Understanding, or the False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Rule, in judging <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Revelation</hi> by <hi>Objects of
Sence.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, from what hath been
said, we may, in express terms, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That we can form imperfect
Ideas of <hi>Matters of Revelation,</hi> so
far as to know what GOD proposes
to our Belief: And yet, when we
proceed to examine the <hi>Modus</hi> of
their Existence, we cannot reconcile
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60702:25"/>
it with the Ideas of <hi>Objects of Sence;</hi>
and, for all this, we must not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any thing of this nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Reason;</hi> or esteem those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Ideas, no Ideas at all.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to illustrate this
matter in an Instance which the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
chuses to advance his own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
by exploding it; I mean,
the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>our Saviour:</hi> We
affirm him to be possess'd with the
<hi>Fulness of the Godhead,</hi> because his
<hi>Divinity</hi> is describ'd in Characters
that are peculiar to the Godhead, and
such as correspond with those Ideas
of the Godhead as are form'd by the
Assistance of <hi>Revelation.</hi> He rejects
his <hi>Divinity,</hi> because he proceeds
further, and examins the <hi>Modus</hi> of
its Existence, with respect to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Godhead, and its Union
with Humane Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
forms a <hi>Modus</hi> by some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ideas or Notions, and then
compares it with other Ideas of the
same rank and quality, and rejects
those Ideas which Scripture has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us of his Divinity, by pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
such a <hi>Revelation</hi> absurd and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60702:25"/>
contrary to Reason, because the
<hi>Modus</hi> of its Existence with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Godhead and Humanity,
(a thing form'd and hammer'd out
of his own shallow Understanding,)
does not comport with common I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
of <hi>Objects of Sence.</hi> Here, I
think, is a Complication of Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
or things that run counter to
the eternal Measures of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the Godhead of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is rejected and deny'd, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Reason, not because we
want Revelation for it, since we may
read it in the clearest Characters;
but we must expound these away,
<hi>1st,</hi> Because we cannot comprehend
the <hi>Modus</hi> of its Existence (a thing
that often exceeds our Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
even in Philosophical Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>2dly,</hi> Because we cannot form
a <hi>Modus</hi> that comports with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi> in <hi>Objects of
Sence.</hi> 
               <q>But, if Consequences of this
nature are suffer'd to take place,
against such legible Characters of
Divinity, it must overturn those
Ideas of a GOD, which Revelation
and Natural Reason hath furnish'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60702:26"/>
us with, since the Characters of
both are equally clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have dwelt too long on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
but not without Design, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I would not be oblig'd to make
a formal Return to every little Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
that runs against us, or dispels
every Speck of a Cloud that's rais'd
upon Sophistry or False Arguing:
I am sure I have offer'd enough to
take off the Force of what he hath
suggested in the following Paragraph,
<hi>N. 5.</hi> for, he's a compleat Conjurer,
raises his own Devil, and then lays it,
frames an Objection, and gives his
own Answer to it; it's this: [<hi>If any
will think to evade the Difficulty, by
saying, That the Ideas of certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
may be contrary indeed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions, yet consistent with 'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
—he's but just where he was.</hi>]
Now, I have already deliver'd the
Measures of forming <hi>reveal'd Ideas,</hi>
not by comparing 'em with <hi>Objects
of Sence,</hi> but <hi>Spiritual Things</hi> with
<hi>Spiritual:</hi> I will admit, indeed, it
may be done by common Notions;
if he'll restrain his common Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60702:26"/>
as he does in the close of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,
or, at least, with some Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
added to 'em; for I can
freely subscribe: [<hi>That we cannot
otherwise discern His Revelations, but
by their conformity with our Natural
Notices of Him,</hi>] GOD he means;
or, at least, those Improvements we
receive of Him from Revelation.
And in this sence our Saviour's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is not contrary to common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for we can form an Idea of it
agreeable to those Characters which
Revelation and Natural Reason gives
us of the Godhead; but, then the
Difficulty lies in comprehending the
Union and Existence of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
together, which we call the
<hi>Modus</hi> of the thing; and this, we
say, is not to be measur'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notices, for, to a Finite Mind,
it's Incomprehensible: <q>But then it
is not a Doctrine of Christianity,
that we should comprehend it;
much less is it a Doctrine of Reason
or Christianity that we should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
or cashier the clearest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of our Saviour's Divinity or
Incarnation from being a Doctrine
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60702:27"/>
of Christianity, because we cannot
comprehend the manner of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the two Natures, nor form
any clear Idea of it, at least, such
as will comport with common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
It's true, we may resemble
it, as it is done in one of our Creeds.
As the reasonable Soul and Flesh is
<hi>One Man,</hi> so GOD and Man is <hi>One</hi>
CHRIST; but we do not advance a
Similitude into a compleat Idea, or
an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>But, to offer a word or two more,
if this method of Arguing may be
admitted, I cannot conceive but it
must explode the Belief of the Soul,
or any Principle distinct from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because we cannot fix the <hi>Modus</hi>
of its Union, or conceive an Idea of
the manner of its incessant Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
with the Body.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Argument, from
what is said, I think here's enough
to defeat our Adversary's Triumphs,
even over his own Objection; for,
we may safely affirm, That as the
Nature of the Godhead is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
by Properties peculiar to it
self, so we may justly conclude, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60702:27"/>
it has a manner of Existence with
Humanity so peculiar to itself, that
we must not pretend to comprehend
it, by comparing it with Objects of
Sence; and yet we can freely own,
that there's neither Necessity nor
Possibility of its being comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us, or of determining what is
the precise <hi>Modus</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And thus much of his Notion of
<hi>Self-consistence.</hi> And as for his Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castical
prophane way of Arguing,
when he tells us, That <hi>Four may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Five in Heaven;</hi> he might know,
<q>That <hi>Numbers</hi> are only <hi>empty Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi>
and <hi>no Arguments</hi> to be
form'd from 'em, but as apply'd to
<hi>Things;</hi> and then, if we consider
Heavenly Objects with respect to
the manner of their Existence, a
<hi>Vnity</hi> and a <hi>Trinity</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
for any thing he knows to
the contrary.</q> And this is sufficient
to prevent any modest Man from
pronouncing Contradictions upon
such unfathomable Truths, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
their <hi>Modus</hi> by Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
things that exceed our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
as much as they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60702:28"/>
the Business of our Curiosity or
Faith. Here we may discern the
Origin of his ill Reasonings <hi>to be want
of distinguishing Things,</hi> I mean the
<hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Thing,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of
its <hi>Existence,</hi> with respect to itself, or
as 'tis united to something else.</p>
            <p>From hence I pass to <hi>N. 9.</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
intervenes that directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the present Controversie, or, at
least, has not had a Reply to it. And
here I cannot joyn with him, when
he affirms, That <hi>a seeming Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
(even in Matters of Revelation)
is to us as much as a real one;</hi> for, I
think, the Difference is palpable in all
cases, but especially in Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the <hi>Nature of Things;</hi> for
<q>We call that a <hi>seeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
when there's a Repugnancy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
itself, but we have not a clear
and perfect Conviction of it:</q> And,
I suppose, this must arise for want
of a clear and perfect Idea of each
Term, or rather Object, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
and, till this is gain'd,
Reason must suspend, and neither
determine that she is in the right or
wrong, till fresh Evidence offers to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60702:28"/>
turn the Scale. But now, a <hi>real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi>
or rather a <hi>clear Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
(for it should pass under this
Name with respect to our knowledg
of it) is, <q>When we have a clear
and unquestionable Idea of both
parts of it, or both Objects, and
thence conceive an irreconcilable
Repugnancy.</q> But now, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of pure Revelation, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is spiritual and infinite, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see how Reason can direct us to
pronounce or determine <hi>real</hi> or <hi>clear
Contradictions</hi> between them and
Common Notions, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to an <hi>adequate</hi> or <hi>clear
Idea;</hi> I mean, that which is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
so, with respect to those of
<hi>Objects of Sence,</hi> and consequently
cannot decree what <hi>real Repugnancy</hi>
lies between them: And therefore,
if seeming Contradictions or Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
arise, by comparing <hi>reveal'd Truths</hi>
with common <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot (as this Author would
have it) pronounce a <hi>real Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and suspect there can be no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
Truth,</hi> especially when there
are the clearest Characters of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60702:29"/>
thing corresponding with <hi>Ideas</hi> of the
same nature. <q>Here Reason must
oblige us to place the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on our Inabilities in compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Matters of this nature, and
yield an Assent upon the Authority
of Infinite Power and Veracity:</q>
For when Revelation has set forth
the thing in the clearest Characters,
and the very same in which the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article of all Revelation is
represented to us, I mean that of the
Godhead, if seeming Contradictions
must be suffer'd to discard it, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
we can yield any Assent to
the Being of a GOD; for, where the
Characters are as clear for one as the
other, and both rest on the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that of <hi>Revelations</hi> to <hi>dispute</hi>
the one, must <hi>call in question</hi> the
other.</p>
            <p>Proceed we, in the next place, to
consider what is deliver'd on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Revelation,</hi> he means that
which is Divine, <hi>Cap. 2. N. 11.</hi> And
here I cannot be reconcil'd to the
Distinction he gives us: [<hi>Revelation
is not a necessitating Motive of Assent;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60702:29"/>
but a Mean of Information.</hi>] Now,
truly I can see no Absurdity in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the same thing may be a
Mean of Information, and a Motive
of an Assent too, for an Information
carries an Assent along with it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the Credit or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Informer. Now <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is certainly a Mean of <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
since it presents us with new
Objects, which <hi>Natural Reason</hi> could
never discover: But, besides this, it
is an <hi>Information</hi> that proceeds from
<hi>Infinite Veracity,</hi> attended with <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness:</hi>
Herein it's distinguish'd from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Revelation; <hi>And therefore, when
once we are assur'd (so as to yield a firm
Assent) that such a particular Article is
reveal'd, it becomes the most necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Motive of Assent; I mean, to the
Truth of it;</hi> because, this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
here's <hi>Infinite Veracity, Wisdom,
Power</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> against our <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Conceptions,</hi> and the seeming
Difficulties founded in 'em. When
once we assent or yield it to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, I think, we may
safely affirm, against this <hi>Reasoner,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60702:30"/>
[We may believe purely upon his Word,
without Evidence, (at least such as he
requires) in the things 'emselves]. Here
the Authority of him that speaks, not my
Conception of the thing, or what he says,
is the Ground of my Perswasion].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to proceed, as for what this
Reasoner says of GOD's Omnipotence
and Contradictions, <hi>N. 13.</hi> no one is
so silly to imagine, that real Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
are an Object of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
but there may be Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which we apprehend as real<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that in truth are but seeming ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and particularly when we cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehend the nature of both the
Terms or Objects; and it's already
concluded, that in matters of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<hi>Reason</hi> will often direct us to
suspect our Judgments, and esteem
'em as such: And then, I hope, there's
<q>no Absurdity in Pronouncing, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Contradictions and Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
a proper Subject of God's
Omnipotence: Thus far our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
will bear us out, for <hi>all things
are possible with God,</hi> Matt. xix. 26.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, to pursue him a little further,
he tells us, <hi>N. 16.</hi> speaking of GOD's
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60702:30"/>
               <hi>Revelations,</hi> [His Words must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
and the Matter possible. And
as for unintelligible Relations, we can
no more believe them from the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of GOD, than from that of Man,
for the conceiv'd Ideas of Things are
the only Subjects of believing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Matters reveal'd by GOD or
Man, must be equally intelligible and
possible: We are then to expect the same
degree of Perspicuity (<hi>he means, with
respect to the knowledge of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>)
from GOD as from Man, tho'
more of Certitude from the first than
the last: <hi>he means with respect to
the Veracity of the Publisher.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What has already been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
upon Matters of Revelation,
I hope, will satisfie any reasonable
Man, how far a reveal'd Truth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to be intelligible. It's conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
GOD has discover'd so much of
the Nature of reveal'd Truths as is
useful or necessary; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
He has, at least, discover'd so much
as is sufficient to inform us, upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Revelation, what He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to our Belief, but He did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make us Philosophers, so as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60702:31"/>
to enable us to comprehend the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
of reveal'd Truths, or form an
Idea of the Manner of Existence, in
order to believe the Truth of 'em.
This we cannot pretend even in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Disquisitions; nay, I think, it's
justly concluded, that in Matters of
Revelation, which are for the most
part Spiritual and Infinite, we are not
to dispute the Possibility of their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
by measuring 'em by <hi>Objects
of Sence;</hi> for, in reality, this is the
same with comprehending the <hi>Modus</hi>
of their Existence, <q>since we cannot
absolutely declare against the Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Existence, without a
Faculty of comprehending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the <hi>Modus</hi> of it, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
an Estimate upon it as absurd
and impossible: And therefore we
say, That Matters of Revelation are
to be understood so far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what GOD proposes to our
Belief, but not to comprehend the
<hi>Modus</hi> of their Existence; such <hi>Ideas</hi>
are not the necessary <hi>Subjects of
Faith.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, In Humane Revelation the
Object is <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> and thing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60702:31"/>
we attain to by the Testimony of our
Senses, and consequently are things
that lye within the proper Verge of
Humane Understanding.</p>
            <p>Again, They are Discoveries made
by Persons upon the same level with
ourselves, and, consequently, such as
are not only liable to be mistaken,
but may sometimes industriously lead
others into Mistakes. And both these
are Arguments that will engage us to
demand an absolute Comprehension
of the Nature of the Thing, and all
its Circumstances; so that before we
can come to a final Datermination, or
yield an Assent to the Truth of any
such Relation, <q>We must compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Nature of it so exactly,
as to be able to judge, not only of
the Possibility, but Probability of
it.</q> And, I hope, no one can have the
Face to <hi>demand</hi> all this Evidence from
GOD. Therefore we may conclude,
against our Majesterial Reasoner,
That the same degree of Perspicuity
is not requir'd from GOD, as from
Man. In a word, if we cannot form
a perfect Idea of reveal'd Truths,
much less of the <hi>Modus</hi> of their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60702:32"/>
we cannot judge of the Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of 'em: If indeed we were
able to form an Idea of the <hi>Modus</hi> of
their Existence, that will comport
with common Notions, tho' this be
not the true <hi>Modus,</hi> we may safely
pronounce them possible; <q>but we
cannot pretend to reject the Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of 'em, unless we could judge
of the real <hi>Modus,</hi> and shew, that
it's absurd and impossible:</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may conclude, that all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
reveal'd by GOD or Man, are
not requir'd to be equally intelligible
and possible.</p>
            <p>But, to proceed, as for those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Scripture, that follow in
this or the next Chapter, to prove
Christianity a rational intelligible
Religion; they only prove, That
Reason is a concurring Instrument in
embracing all religious Truths, not
by teaching us to comprehend the
Nature of 'em, but to engage our
Assent, where we cannot fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
upon rational Motives and
Convictions: <q>And we think we
act upon rational Motives and
Convictions in Matters of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60702:32"/>
when we know as much of
the thing as satisfies us, what it is
GOD proposes to our belief, and
yet find some things contain'd in
'em incomprehensible in their own
nature, and rely upon God's Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
Power, Wisdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
rather than reject the whole,
because we know but in part.</q> Nay
further, in the case of Miracles, we
grant, that Reason may judge of the
reality of 'em, because they are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sence, and are to be examin'd
by the Testimony of the Senses, by
Ideas of Objects of Sence, and the
Exercitations of Reason upon 'em,
and because Miracles are the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Demonstrations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or Means of Conviction, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Divine Original of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<q>And we can freely grant, that
<hi>Reason</hi> must act by common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to prove <hi>Revelation</hi> to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Divine:</q> But when this is done,
there's no Consequence that Reason
must still measure reveal'd Truths by
common Notions, and reject 'em if
she cannot fully comprehend 'em, or
if she cannot make 'em comport with
common Notions; which is the thing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60702:33"/>
our Adversary labours to prove.</p>
            <p>The remaining Instances, which
only declare the Perspicuity of the
<hi>Moral Law</hi> or <hi>Christian Precepts,</hi> an
Ingenious Reader will presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
how foreign and impertinent
they are to his Design.</p>
            <p>At the same rate he trifles, when
he raises an Objection from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of <hi>Humane Reason;</hi> as if, by
making his own Answers and Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
he had vanquish'd all our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
gain'd the Field, and might
triumphantly maintain, <hi>That there's
nothing in the Christian Religion my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious,
or above Reason;</hi> for, I do
not anywhere find the Ch. of <hi>England</hi>
fixes the Controversie on this Bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore this is Reply enough
to two of his Chapters, <hi>viz. 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we come to the Third
Section,<note place="margin">Sect. III.</note> where we are introduc'd
with an Account of what's <hi>mysterious</hi>
and <hi>above Reason.</hi> I shall for the most
part take his own Accounts of it, and
therefore shall not much dispute any
thing in the first Chapt. only I cannot
forbear to remark, how lame or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
or, at least, industriously
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60702:33"/>
equivocal, all his Descriptions are:
He gives us two Significations of a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> the first I shall not examin;
his second is, (I suppose he speaks
his own Opinion, else he should have
declar'd the contrary) [<hi>It is made to
signifie a thing of its own nature incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
and not to be judg'd of by our
ordinary Faculties and Ideas, tho' it
be never so much reveal'd.</hi>] Indeed,
I think the first part of this Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
is a Mystery; tho', I suppose,
he means, in the nature of the thing,
or by reason of its Immensity, it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
to us, or with respect to
Humane Comprehension; but then,
who knows how far he intends to
carry this, I mean, represent a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
inconceivable? If he intends it so
as that we can form no <hi>manner of Idea</hi>
of it, then he imposes a manifest Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
upon the World; for no one ever
called that a MYSTERY that we could
have no Notion of; for, <hi>such a thing
may be as well Nothing, as Mystery, for
any thing we can tell.</hi> And therefore
<hi>Mystery,</hi> at least, supposes <hi>an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or Inadequate Idea,</hi> (as appears
from all those Instances I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60702:34"/>
produc'd) otherwise we could not
know what God proposes to our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
But then, if we enquire further
into the thing, and endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
the <hi>Modus</hi> of its Existence, we
can either form no distinct Idea, or,
at least, none that will comport with
common Notions. And thus far we
affirm, That <hi>Mysteries</hi> are not to be
judg'd of by our <hi>ordinary Faculties</hi>
and <hi>Ideas,</hi> tho' never so clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd.
<hi>N. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> where, after
having promis'd a wonderful Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
in the Case before him, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
[<hi>That nothing can be said to be
a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mystery, because we have not an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Idea of it, or a distinct View of
all its Properties at once; for then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing would be a</hi> Mystery.<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note>] Now
truly I'm much of his Mind, for I'm
perswaded that no Finite Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
can conceive all the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of any one Being, at once in a
distinct view: This is the Peculiar
of an All-wise GOD; and if an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Idea must imply a distinct view
of every Property at once, and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
opposed to it, every thing must
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60702:34"/>
be a Mystery to every intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but GOD: So that here's a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
rais'd, that proves nothing, and
no one requires it. We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pass this as an Unphilosophical
Blunder, and describe an adequate
Idea to be what he aims at, <hi>viz. A
clear and distinct Idea of the Nature
and Properties of an Object.</hi> This (he
contends) cannot be fairly <hi>opposed to</hi>
MYSTERY, because, in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Humane Bodies, GOD has
sufficiently answer'd the Ends and
Designs of it, by enabling us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the principal Properties of
Bodies, and the Uses of 'em: And
therefore what remains cannot be
MYSTERY, <hi>N. 19, 20.</hi> This is truly
a Reason which is more cogent on
the other hand, as well in Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
as Reveal'd Disquisitions: GOD
has discover'd, or enabl'd us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
as much as is useful or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in both these Cases; but, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, we can pretend no further
than some principal Properties: And
since <hi>Reason</hi> tells us, there's a great
deal undiscover'd and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
we may justly affirm, That
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60702:35"/>
there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> as well
as <hi>Revelation;</hi> so that we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to him for his <hi>Argument,</hi> tho' he
had no Friendly Design in it. Indeed,
if he would be content to carry us no
further than the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
naturally tends, we should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
joyn in an amicable Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
which is in other terms no
more than this: <q>There can be no
<hi>Mystery</hi> in <hi>Revelation,</hi> (he might
have added, nor in <hi>rerum natura</hi>)
I mean, in this Notion of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we know as much as our Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Understandings are capable of,
or as much as is necessary or useful.</q>
If this may be admitted, it's a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Reason to conclude against
the Possibility of a <hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we may say there are <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
not because we know not as
much as is necessary and useful, but
<hi>because after we know the principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of Things, or as much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
or useful, we can discern a great
deal which we cannot comprehend.</hi> And
this holds good not only in Matters
of <hi>Revelation,</hi> but <hi>Nature</hi> too. Our
<hi>Adversary</hi> confesses as much; for tho'
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60702:35"/>
we have a competent Idea of the
<hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> that is, as far as
they are useful to us, yet we are not
able to comprehend the <hi>Modus</hi> of
their Operations, nor indeed the true
Causes of a great many obvious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>Again, In <hi>reveal'd Truths</hi> we can
form, at least, an imperfect Idea of
what GOD proposes to our belief.
Thus we form an Idea of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Divinity,</hi> from those Characters
which <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
gives us of the <hi>Godhead.</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him to be possess'd with the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Godhead,</hi> because the same
Characters are ascrib'd to him that
are ascrib'd to the <hi>Father</hi> in respect
of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> but we cannot form
an Idea of the Manner of the Union
of this <hi>Divinity</hi> with <hi>Humane Nature,</hi>
nor its Consistence with the <hi>Vnity</hi> of
the <hi>Godhead,</hi> at least so as to make it
comport with common Notions: So
that in respect of the <hi>Modus</hi> of
things, whether as to their Existence
or Operations, even in those of <hi>Natural
Bodies,</hi> as well as <hi>Matters of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60702:36"/>
(and that properly) as well as in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Adversary</hi> indeed would call
this an <hi>Inadequate Knowledge,</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Mysterious or above Reason;
but I hope to prove it a <hi>Mystery</hi> even
in the received sence of the Word, as
well as the reason of the Thing, and
that too on his own <hi>Concessions</hi> and
<hi>Principles.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> It's certain his Evasions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Inadequate Ideas</hi> will do him
no service, to take off the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Mystery,</hi> or <hi>above Reason;</hi> for
we affirm, That Things are <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi>
and <hi>above Reason,</hi> because we
can form but very imperfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate
Ideas of 'em. <q>It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
absurd to imagine that any
thing can be <hi>mysterious,</hi> or <hi>above
Reason,</hi> which we are able fully to
comprehend; and it's equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to say, that things are <hi>mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
when we can form no Idea at
all, since we can <hi>pronounce nothing</hi>
when we <hi>know nothing:</hi> But, to
confess, that of most things we can
form but imperfect and inadequate
<hi>Ideas,</hi> is to prove a thing to be <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious;</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60702:36"/>
for, if we know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that our most improv'd
Ideas are inadequate, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
there's something behind, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to the <hi>Modus</hi> or <hi>Rationale</hi> of
Things, which Reason cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</q>
And I know no better
denomination, than to say, That
Things are in this respect <hi>mysterious,</hi>
or <hi>above Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make up the strict Notion of
<hi>Mystery,</hi> we are not to consider the
Necessity or Usefulness of what we
cannot comprehend; but the grand
Question is, <hi>Whether there are not
Modes and Properties of Things, that
by reason of the Imperfection of Human
Vnderstanding, or the Immensity or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy
of the Things 'emselves, cannot
be comprehended by us?</hi> 
               <q>For it is the
Abstruseness or Inaccessibility of
Things that make the <hi>Mysteries,</hi>
not the Necessity or Usefulness of
what is incomprehensible.</q> And
therefore if there be Things in this
material World which we cannot
comprehend, we may truly affirm,
That there's a <hi>Mystery</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> or
that <hi>Natural Causes</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> are thus
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60702:37"/>
far <hi>above Reason,</hi> or <hi>mysterious;</hi> much
more may we affirm it of Matters of
<hi>Revelation:</hi> And therefore, to use the
Instance of a vain insulting Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Tho' we live upon Water, and see
and handle it daily, there may and is
something in it</hi> mysterious, <hi>and</hi> above
Reason, <hi>inasmuch as we cannot form
an</hi> Idea <hi>of every thing that truly belongs
to it.</hi> And yet no wise Man will be
tempted to make such a practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
as this Reasoner hath sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
that is, <hi>resolve</hi> never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into its Nature, nor imploy it
in his House or Grounds<note n="*" place="margin">See Sect. 3. N. 10.</note>. But, in
Matters of Revelation, we know how
inadequate our Ideas are, <q>as much
as <hi>Finite</hi> differs from <hi>Infinite, Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
from <hi>Positive,</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi> from
<hi>Spirit:</hi> Must they not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things <hi>above Reason,</hi> because
they are only thus inadequate?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But further, As for the original
Import of the word MYSTERY, I am
not concern'd to trace it in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Uses of it, it's sufficient if by
Custom it hath obtain'd another Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
(it may be) every jot as proper
as the former. Our Author owns,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60702:37"/>
that in approved Classicks it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
taken for obscure and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Matters, such as cannot well be
comprehended or seen into<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> N. 5. Sect. 3.</note>. And
this, I think, is equally proper with
that other describ'd by him, which
implies something beyond a Veil, not
discernable till that is remov'd: And
in this sence the Types under the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Law he accounts <hi>Mysteries;</hi>
for those which thro' the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Weakness of Reason, or the
Immensity, Distance, or Intricacy of
the Object, may be as little discern'd
as those that have a Veil over 'em;
and then they seem to be equally <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious,</hi>
and <hi>above Reason.</hi> In a word,
<hi>Mystery</hi> is something shut up from our
View or Cognizance, and it is not
material whether this be done by a
Veil or other Impediments or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions;
and consequently <hi>Mystery</hi>
and an <hi>Inadequate Idea</hi> may be very
consistent; I do not mean, that which
arises from affected Ignorance, but
the Intricacy of the Object, and the
Weakness of Humane Reason under
its highest Improvements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60702:38"/>
But, to clear up his Understanding
in this matter, by a few Arguments
drawn from his own Positions, the
Riches of his own inexhausted Brain,
he tells us, <hi>Cap. 3. N. 27.</hi> That <hi>certain
Gospel-Doctrines are call'd</hi> Mysteries,
<hi>with respect to the</hi> Jews, [<hi>not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they
knew nothing of 'em, but they were
not clearly and fully reveal'd till the
New Testament-times, being veil'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by various Typical Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
&amp;c.] Well, you see he allows
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Types to be <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and
gives the reason, Because they saw
'em thro a Veil; or, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
with respect to further Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
<hi>thro a Glass darkly:</hi> And what
is this, but that they knew them in
part, or by inadequate Ideas? I'm
sure our Knowledge is as much
cramp'd in several of those Instances
produc'd by our Author, from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy
and Immensity of the Things
'emselves, as those <hi>Gospel-truths</hi> shut
up from the <hi>Iews</hi> by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Veil
of Types and Figures: <q>And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
why is not the one as much
a <hi>Mystery</hi> to us, as the other to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and for this very reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60702:38"/>
we know them inadequately.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, to go a little further with him,
I remember, in the State of his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
as well as in other places, he
gives us to understand, That <hi>all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
Matters may be judg'd of even by
common Notions, both as to their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Existence, as easily as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
Phoenomena <hi>of Nature;</hi> and
therefore concludes, That <hi>there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Gospel contrary to Reason,
or above it;</hi> and, That <hi>no Christian
Doctrine can be properly call'd a</hi> MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERY.
This is the State of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
and what he asserts must be a
Criterion, in judging what is <hi>mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
or <hi>above Reason:</hi> So that we may
hence conclude, and that upon his <hi>own</hi>
Principles too, That that <hi>Thing</hi> whose
Manner or Existence cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
even with as much ease and
clearness as the ordinary <hi>Phoenomena</hi>
of Nature, is a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and <hi>above
Reason.</hi> Certainly here is a fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
and such as will make things
<hi>mysterious,</hi> because we can but form
inadequate, Ideas; for, as this Author
confesses, we can form Ideas of the
Beings of Things, and know as much
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60702:39"/>
as is useful from their Properties and
Effects, whilst we are ignorant of the
manner of their Existence or Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
See <hi>N. 8, 11.</hi>—(the one of
Plants, and the other of Rain). Here
he manifestly fixes our inadequate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
upon the <hi>Modus</hi> of Things, with
respect to their Operations and Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence;
that is, our Ideas are inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate,
because we cannot decipher
wherein their <hi>Modus</hi> consists, tho' we
know their principal Properties by
their Effects and Uses.</p>
            <p>And now we may call in his own
Principles to conclude against him,
and affirm, That inadequate Ideas
must necessarily imply a <hi>Mystery,</hi> for
inadequate Ideas imply our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as to the <hi>Modus</hi> of Things, and
that thing whose <hi>Modus</hi> cannot be
comprehended, according to his own
Principles, is <hi>mysterious,</hi> and <hi>above
Reason.</hi> Here, I think, he pretends
to <hi>Out-do</hi> the most improv'd Arts of
<hi>Priestcraft,</hi> whilst he declares for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Reason,</hi> and banishes <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
out of the World, and yet imposes
things that surpass the highest <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
since he labours to make the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60702:39"/>
World embrace his <hi>Contradictions for
the undoubted Decrees of Reason: [This
is,</hi> in his own language, <hi>trifling with a
witness, or pitiful shifting or fooling,
or what not, and such as discovers a
mighty Scarcity of good Arguments,</hi>
N. 13.] But he hath not done with
us yet, and therefore concludes with
an obliging Proposal, [<hi>If they will still
be fooling, and call these things</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
<hi>I'm willing to admit as many as
they please in Religion, if they will allow
me likewise to make mine as intelligible
to others as these are to me,</hi> Ib.]</p>
            <p>I hope I have made good the first
part, <hi>That there are true and proper
Mysteries, even in the Schools of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
And, if so, it's manifest, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his vain Triumphs, we
have an Argument <hi>à majori,</hi> That
there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in <hi>Revelation:</hi> I
say, it's <hi>a majori</hi> to every one but
him, that has the Face to assert, That
<hi>an infinite incomprehensible Spirit is an
Object equally intelligible with Objects
of Sence, or with Wood or Stone.</hi> As
for the last part of his Proposals, I
believe every one will consent, <q>That
he shall make all those <hi>reveal'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60702:40"/>
Truths</hi> we call <hi>Mysteries,</hi> as intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
as he's able, provided he'll
promise not to reject 'em, because
he fails in his Undertaking; or, in a
word, because he cannot make them
compare with common Ideas or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now, I hope, I have said
enough to invalidate all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this Chapter. But lest he
should think me rude, or that I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
him too much, I shall make some
short Returns to a few Passages that
are yet behind. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> He instructs us what it is to
comprehend a Thing, <hi>viz. [When
its chief Properties, and their several
Vses, are known to us; for to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
in all correct Authors, is nothing
else but to know; and as of what is not
knowable we can have no Idea, so is it
nothing to us.</hi> I shall, for once, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that in the common Notion of
Humane Perception or Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
we think we know or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
a Thing sufficiently, when its
chief Properties, and their several
Uses, are known to us; but may we
not at the same time discern, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60702:40"/>
there are others we cannot conceive,
and that the <hi>Modus</hi> or precise Nature
of those we know are inconceivable:
And so we may, without Offence, or
in a strict and proper way of Speech,
affirm, That there's a great deal <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious</hi>
in the thing, and <hi>above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
and yet we do not pronounce it
<hi>above Reason,</hi> (as he suggests, <hi>ib.</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we know no more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us; but because there's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inconceivable, tho' to conceive
it does not so directly concern us.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>2dly,</hi> as for that which is <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious</hi>
even in Matters of Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we do not pretend that it is any
thing to us; I mean, as if we were
oblig'd to comprehend or define the
precise <hi>Modus</hi> of the thing; <hi>This is to
be a Mystery and no Mystery.</hi> However,
since we discern in certain <hi>reveal'd
Truths</hi> something which we cannot
comprehend, we may believe those
<hi>reveal'd Truths</hi> to be so far <hi>mysterious,</hi>
               <q>and they so far concern us, as to pay
the Obedience of Faith to 'em, and
not reject the Whole, because we
cannot comprehend Every-thing
that belongs to 'em.</q> This ought
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60702:41"/>
to be an Eternal Rule to our Author
in matters of Revelation, because it's
founded upon his own Words and
Principles: We believe the Divinity
of our Saviour, because we have not
only its Uses set forth, but we have
it represented in the principal Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Godhead, even such as are
ascrib'd to GOD the Father; and
consequently, in the Sence of this
Author, we may be said to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
or know this Divine Truth.
Therefore if any thing arises as to the
<hi>Modus</hi> of its Existence, or otherwise,
that is <hi>mysterious,</hi> (not knowable, or
of which we can have no Idea) his
own Rule directs him, that this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him, and consequently is by
no means to be an Argument against
this Divine Truth: I'm sure, if 'tis
not ridiculous not to supersede our
Disquisitions in matters that do not
directly concern us, (another <hi>Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of his, <hi>ib.) it's undoubtedly ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to make Disquisitions in such Cases,
and make them an Argument for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the clearest reveal'd Truths;</hi> which
is the constant Practice of the <hi>Modern
Reasoners</hi> or <hi>Disputers</hi> of this World,
the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60702:41"/>
But, to proceed, the next thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
is, a compendious Rule to
acquire Useful Knowledge, <hi>N. 11.
viz. Not to trouble ourselves nor others
with what is Vseless were it known, or
what is impossible to be known at all.</hi>
Whereas in the Paragraph imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
preceeding, he seems to charge
us with saying, That <hi>Things are
above Reason, because we know no more
than concerns us, or is useful.</hi> And yet
allowing this Notion, he tells us, that
<hi>it is ridiculous to supersede our Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
about it upon that Score;</hi> that
is, according to his own Notion, tho'
we know as much of it as concerns
us, or is useful. A bless'd Law-giver
truly, to institute Contradictions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
with the same Breath; for, I
think, he cannot avoid the Charge,
without flying to that which is as
abominable in his very Thoughts as
this reproachful to his Reason; I
mean, by Pleading he intended a
<hi>Mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, having given you
enough of the Doctrinal part, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
us to Application; but truly, I
hope I have disabled him so visibly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60702:42"/>
in the former, as supersedes the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a formal Reply to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I shall only recite the Application
he has made, and rather refer than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
[<hi>1st, That no Christian Doctrin,
no more than any ordinary piece of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
can be reputed a</hi> Mystery, <hi>because
we have not an adequate or compleat Idea
of whatever belongs to it.</hi>] As for what
may be attributed to inadequate
Ideas, I have said enough in this
Chapter; and tho' we may not say,
<q>That the want of an adequate Idea
is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> that constitutes
a <hi>Mystery,</hi> yet our Inabilities in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
some things that are
really lodg'd in it, or really belong to
it, makes it a <hi>Mystery;</hi>
               </q> and as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prov'd with as good reason as
those things he counts <hi>mysterious, viz.</hi>
Intelligible Truths beyond the Veil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly, [What is reveal'd in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it is most useful and necessary, so
it must and may be as easily comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and found as consistent with our
common Notions, as what we know of
Wood or Stone, or the like.</hi>] We cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
agree, That GOD hath only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
as much as is necessary or use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60702:42"/>
and, in matters of pure Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no more than will give us an
Idea of the Thing, or what it is
GOD proposes to our Belief; and
therefore make this an Argument,
that there are Things that belong to
it, of which we cannot form a distinct
Idea, and, consequently, from hence
give it the Denomination of being
<hi>Mysterious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as for the <hi>mysterious</hi> part of
any <hi>reveal'd Truth,</hi> we affirm, That
it exceeds our Comprehension, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the <hi>Mystery</hi> must cease: But, as
it exceeds our Comprehension, so we
say, it is not necessary to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
much less do we allow, that
it may be comprehended by common
Ideas or Notions, or scann'd by those
Ideas: So as that, in case it doth not
correspond with 'em, we cannot call
in question the Truth of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
and comprehended.</p>
            <p>No, here, in case Curiosity tempts
us to dive into the mysterious part of
any reveal'd Truth, and upon the
closest Researches, we find ourselves
unable to comprehend; <q>We are to
adhere to the Substance of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60702:43"/>
Truth, where we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the <hi>Modus</hi> of it; or, in other
Terms, adore, where we cannot
comprehend.</q> But as to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
by common Notions, or,
as easily as we can comprehend,
Wood, or Stone, or the like, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <p>1st, This Gentleman makes all
Objects of Humane Knowledge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
comprehensible. And,</p>
            <p>2dly, That we may take our Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for comprehending any one, by
those Idea's we have formed of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but I have elsewhere suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
discovered the Falseness of
both these Assertions; and there I
shall not enlarge, but rest upon the
Conclusiveness of what hath been
offered.</p>
            <p>3dly, <hi>When we do as familiarly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
such Doctrines as what is known
of Natural Things (which I pretend we
can) we may then be as</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> N. 12. Sect. 3.</note> 
               <hi>properly said
to comprehend the one as the other.</hi>
This is a very bold Undertaking, and
not to be believed 'till he gives us
good Reason, and nothing less than
Matter of Fact for Demonstration,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60702:43"/>
especially if he intends that part of
those Doctrines we justly call <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
But then, in using this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,
<q>We must engage him not
to explain away the Substance of
any Doctrine, nor to reject the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
if he fails in his Explication.</q>
And now we come to attack him in
his Strong-hold, that is, his Appeal
to the Voice of Scripture:<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Cap. 3. Sect. 3.</note> And
truly Scripture is an unquestionable
Tribunal for the Decision of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in Matters of Revelation;
and as to their present Controversies,
as far as Scripture can determine,
every one may desire to put the Case
on this Issue, and Appeal to this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
(as well as he) provided he is
satisfied Scripture is on his side; and
he may with greater satisfaction be
reputed Orthodox with this on his
side, than to pass for Orthodox with
the whole World, and have it against
him. But then in case he either mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
the Sence of Scripture, or has
recourse to it, to make it come up to
the State of his Case, and prove
more than what can be inferr'd from
it; it's very bold to say, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60702:44"/>
has engaged him in this <hi>Error,</hi>
if it be one: Here I'm sure Scripture
will be no Protection to him, against
a just <hi>Charge of Error,</hi> because he
makes an Appeal to her, and retreats
under her Wing for Shelter; when
in reality he charges his own false
Reasonings, or the Arguments of
some particular Passions, not to say
unjust Propositions on Scripture, as
if all were the unerring Counsels and
Dictates of <hi>Divine Truth.</hi> And truly
this Reasoner does little less, when
he attempts to prove, that there are
no <hi>Mysteries in Christianity,</hi> because
he endeavours to shew, that the
word <hi>Mystery</hi> in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
is no where applied to the
<hi>Thing</hi> we contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Thing</hi>
that with respect to <hi>Humane Reason,</hi>
contains something in it altogether
<hi>incomprehensible:</hi> For is it not absurd
to argue against a <hi>Thing</hi> from the
signification of a Word, which might
never have been used in Scripture,
and yet the <hi>Thing</hi> found there? and
tho' it is used, yet our Author, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant
to the <hi>Mind of Scripture,</hi> fixes
Three several <hi>Significations</hi> on it,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60702:44"/>
and consequently it can be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that it hath not a Fourth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it does not appear in Scripture;
unless he could prove that the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> thought it necessary to reveal
all the Notions or Acceptations of the
word <hi>Mystery;</hi> therefore if this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
for Reason allows the whole
Case, as he pretends, to be put upon
this Issue, it will presently be given
against him, for want of a good
Consequence. So that in truth, if
the Controversie is to be determined
by Scripture, (as no doubt it ought)
it must unavoidably turn upon this
issue, <q>Whether there are not Truths
set forth in Scripture, in which, if
we enquire into the Nature of 'em,
a great deal is contain'd in 'em,
which we cannot comprehend, and
consequently are <hi>mysterious,</hi> and
<hi>above Reason;</hi> whether Scripture
deliver 'em under these Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or no.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This may be true, tho' the Word
<hi>Mystery</hi> were no where to be found
in Scripture, or tho' Scripture had
not so much as hinted, that there
were any thing <hi>mysterious</hi> or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60702:45"/>
If this can be proved,
our Adversary must acknowledge,
that there are Mysteries in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
still. The Instances of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Incarnation already produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
move upon this Supposition;
and I shall be ready to prove it,
whenever he shall think fit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
the Truth of it. But besides
this, I shall in some measure conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to his own Method, and tho' I
shall not Examine every Passage of
Scripture, to see whether he has
rightly stated the Signification of the
Word, yet I do not question, but we
may offer as strong Arguments to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it sometimes to the Sence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for, as he hath done for another;
and besides this, I hope to produce
some Passages of Scripture, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us there are still those things in
Christianity, we properly call <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
and if this be performed, I hope
it may without Affectation be said,
that his Appeal to the Tribunal of
Scripture is defeated.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>1st,</hi> because I do not design
Opposition, or Disputes, for Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
sake; I shall own that the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60702:45"/>
Word MYSTERY is used in the
several Sences he hath put upon it.</p>
            <p>I. For the Gospel in general.</p>
            <p>II. For some unfolded Secrets.
And,</p>
            <p>III. For things veil'd by Parables:
but this is by no means an Argument
that there is no other signification to
be found in Scripture: for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
I can prove the contrary
with as much Authority and Force
of Reason as he can produce against
it; I mean, that it's sometimes used
to express the Incomprehensibleness
of certain Truths, tho' reveal'd. And,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Mystery</hi> must imply some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is in the Nature of it to us
incomprehensible, St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to
have assured us, <hi>But we speak the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God in a Mystery, even the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7. All
sides agree, that the Apostle points
at the Fundamental Articles of the
Christian Faith, and particularly the
Redemption of the World by Jesus
Christ, and more primarily the most
abstruse part of it, his Incarnation.</p>
            <p>2. It's visible the Apostle speaks
of it as <hi>a Mystery, even when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60702:46"/>
it;</hi> for he reveals the Wisdom
of God in a <hi>Mystery.</hi> He now speaks
to the Perfect, that had own'd the
Gospel, and the Divine Authority of
his Preaching, as appears from the
preceding Verse; and it's their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to have the Meat of the Word,
or the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Kingdom of
GOD, communicated to 'em; and
therefore, tho' this Wisdom of GOD
be a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and consequently he
delivers it as such, yet the Perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
when they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
because it is the Wisdom of
GOD: I am sure this Notion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the Judgment of <hi>Clemens
Alexandrinus;</hi> for he uses the very
Word of the Apostle, and calls it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; nay, he makes this an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
why the Fundamental Truths
of the Gospel should only be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Pure and Perfect,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>ut supra,
Strom. Lib. 1.</hi> And therefore since
the Apostle reveals it in a <hi>Mystery, it
must be so, because it contains some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it that is incomprehensible.</hi>
Hence we may justly Vindicate our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60702:46"/>
               <hi>English Translation,</hi> which does not
joyn, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as
our <hi>Adversary</hi> would have it; but
makes it a Repetition, or Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> viz.
even the <hi>Hidden Wisdom.</hi> It's true,
our <hi>Adversary</hi> endeavours to evade
this Exposition, because we are told
in the 10th Verse, <hi>But God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
them to us by his Spirit:</hi> But
the Words manifestly referr to those
Things, which, in the preceding
Verse, God is said to have prepared
for them that love him, which are
chiefly the Benefits of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and the Consequent of this
fundamental Revelation; or at least,
if it must be this fundamental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Divine Wisdom, it is only
reveal'd so as to let us know, what
God intends by it, and assures us of
the Truth of it, but not to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the whole Nature of it; or in
a word, it is so reveal'd, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing is reveal'd in a <hi>Mystery;</hi>
that is, when something remains in
it, that is not to be comprehended;
so that, in Truth, here's <hi>Mystery</hi> in
two Sences:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60702:47"/>
1st, With respect to the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibleness
of the Thing. And,</p>
            <p>2dly, With respect to the Thing
before it was communicated to us.</p>
            <p>And thus far not only the Natural
Construction of the Words, but the
Authority of a Learned Expositor
carries us, <hi>Vid. Theophilact. in locum,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, I shall insist on that
noble Passage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,
Ep. 1. Cap. 3. Ver. 10.</hi> 
               <q>And without
Controversie, great is the Mystery
of Godliness; God was manifested
in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit,
seen of Angels, preached unto the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> believed on in the World,
received up into Glory.</q> It's obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
our Adversary expounds as
accurately, as he reasons; for he
produces this for his eighth Passage,
where <hi>Mystery</hi> is put for the Gospel
in general, whereas it's manifest the
Words cannot, without the greatest
Violence, be applyed to any thing
but a <hi>Divine Person, represented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60702:47"/>
certain Divine Characters,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to none but our Saviour, the
Corner-Stone of the Gospel, but not
the Gospel; for truly the Apostle
seems, in this place, to have given
a description of his whole Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I am sure the Current of the
Fathers, as well as of after Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators,
apply it to none but our
Saviour. But now since our Saviour's
Incarnation is this <hi>Mystery</hi> of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
it's evident the Apostle does
not speak <hi>of what it was before it was
reveal'd, but what it is after it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and believed on in the World,</hi> and
therefore he calls it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> not
because it was so before it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
but because it still remains so;
and thereupon he endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
it as such, by inlarging upon
the Nature and Incomprehensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it; God was manifest in
Flesh, the Foundation of this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
the following Characters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only their Appendages that take
their rise and concenter in it. This
is an Exposition that discovers itself
so clearly, that we find our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
industriously huddling up this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60702:48"/>
Passage, as it were, in a <hi>Mystery,</hi>
without giving any tolerable account
of it; and at last is forced to confess,
That the gracious Manifestation of
Christ and his Gospel, is to us won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
stupendous and surprizing,
<hi>N. 30.</hi> So that we plainly read <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
in the very Sence we contend
for: I am sure we have the Opinion
of some Ancient Church-Writers to
ratifie it. Of this Opinion we find
<hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Tract against <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Samosatenus de Incarnatione Verbi,</hi>
where he gives his Judgment, <hi>è Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,</hi>
as Archbishop of <hi>Alexandria;</hi>
for first he lays open the Attempts of
this Heretick, in endeavouring to
Subvert the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Incarnation, and stiles it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
and to prove it such, cites this very
place of our Apostle. Secondly, He
represents the danger in attempting
to unfold such profound Difficulties,
that are only with safety to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and in a word, enjoyns us to
adhere to the <hi>Apostolick Faith,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
admitting new <hi>Terms</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and above all,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60702:48"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to dread the Disquisition of such a
<hi>Mystery.</hi> But besides the Opinion
of this great Man, we have the
Comment of <hi>Isiodore</hi> the <hi>Pelusiote,</hi>
and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> fixing the <hi>Mystery</hi>
of <hi>Godliness</hi> in the <hi>Incomprehensibleness</hi>
of it. Thus the former, <hi>Lib. 2. Ep. 192.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and pursuant to this, expostulates,
Who can comprehend the Miracle
of his Conception, transacted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Coition, or imagine how the
Divine Nature can be circumscrib'd,
that is Immense, and not to be
circumscrib'd? And <hi>Theophilact</hi>
proceeds in the same Strain thus,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>in Locum.</hi> And now this is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more certainly than calling it
a <hi>Mystery,</hi> with respect to the Ages
preceding the Gospel; for I think
this Passage in itself admits of the
Exposition before us more naturally,
than that our Adversary contends
for; besides we have the Authority
of the Learned in past Ages. And
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60702:49"/>
since I have made it appear he has
no advantage over us in his whole
Hypothesis, I know not why we
may not in his own Language pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
against him, that <hi>Mystery</hi> in
the New Testament, is sometimes
put for a thing inconceivable in itself,
and not to be judg'd of by our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Notions, however reveal'd.
This likewise calls to mind the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of our Adversary upon a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
which as we allow, stiles the
Gospel a <hi>Mystery,</hi> under this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it's <hi>Rom. 16. 25.—But is now
made manifest,</hi> whereupon he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulates,
In what sence could this
Secret be made manifest, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
still Incomprehensible? A
mighty Favour indeed, to bless the
World with a parcel of Unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Notions. I confess, I incline to
the former sence, I mean a <hi>Mystery,</hi>
with respect to the Ages preceding
the Gospel, but can see no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Absurdities, no more than for
his vain Triumphs, if we take it in
the Sence he pretends to explode;
for this Reasoner, had he not been
too much used to confound things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60702:49"/>
might have learn'd, that the
highest <hi>Mystery</hi> is not wholly unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible;
and it may be properly
said, to be manifested in as much as
God has communicated by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
preaching what's useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and as much as will inform
us what God proposes to our Belief:
<q>Again it's <hi>manifested,</hi> and that too
to our unspeakable Comfort, since
the vast Designs of Divine Love,
and the unexpressible Benefits to
us-ward in it, are abundantly laid
open; and I think these are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
or Blessings too rich to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in Ridicule or Burlesque.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But further, If the use of the
Word in Scripture will not prove the
thing we contend for, there are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
hints in Scripture to prove it:
I shall first insist on St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
the preaching of Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Greeks foolishness; but unto them
which are called, the Power of God and
the Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23,
24.</p>
            <p>Now this place is generally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
of the Incarnation of Christ,
or the Union of the two Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60702:50"/>
to one Divine Person: And those
that embrace and believe it, must
resolve it into the Infinite Power and
Wisdom of God, not as a common,
but special Act, and consequently a
thing incomprehensible as they are;
and on this account, it's to the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
the great Masters of Reason, Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness;
because, as it is represented
to us, it contains in it, Things that
can never be reconciled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions, or Ideas. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ideas can satisfie us, that the
Son of God should speak by a Man,
or as the Sacred Canon hath it, in the
form of a Man; that God should
have a Son, and that he should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
as the Son of God? What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ideas can represent to us, that
Christ could have a Being before the
Worlds, as God; that he should be
born a Man, and exist as such, and
yet not as a Man, begotten of a Man?
These things, the most improved
Notices of Natural Reason cannot
confirm, or warrant, no not our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
with all his Reason. If any
thing, it's the <hi>Arian,</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi>
Hypothesis (tho' advanced contrary
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60702:50"/>
to the Current of Scripture) that
may pretend most to be a Rationale
in this matter. And yet our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
seems to explode this as much as
that of the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> because they
are forced to allow Divine Worship
to be paid him, [<hi>Cap. 1. Sect. 2. N. 2.
I am mistaken if either they, or the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<hi>can make their Notions of a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
and Creature-God, capable of
Divine Worship, appear more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than the Extravagancies of other
Sects, touching the Article of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>]
But to return, It's manifest
here we learn how the Doctrines of
Christianity came to be branded
with the Imputation of Foolishness,
viz. <hi>Because they will not comport with
common Notices, or the received Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Natural Philosophy:</hi> for I
have evinced it, upon the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Trypho</hi> against <hi>Iustin,</hi> and
St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Comment on the place,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Dial. cum Trypho,</hi> p. 269.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60702:51"/>
And St. <hi>Clement, in locum,</hi> thus,
<hi>Lib. 1. Stromat.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Here we see this great
Man does not charge the <hi>Greeks</hi> with
false Principles of Philosophy, as the
Ground of their Error, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the Thing as much inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with such <hi>principles</hi> as they could,
and makes this the Foundation of
their unjust Charge, I mean in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Doctrines of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
Foolishness; and indeed he calls
'em <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but it can be on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account, than because they
would admit of nothing but <hi>Natural
Reason,</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
would try all revealed Truths
by common Notions, or Principles of
Philosophy, and reject 'em as absurd
and foolish, because they could not
make these deep Things of God to
comport with common Ideas of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sence. Indeed <hi>Celsus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
much the same things against
<hi>Origen;</hi> for upon every turn, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to ridicule the <hi>Divinity of
our Saviour,</hi> by representing it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60702:51"/>
with the Principles of <hi>Natural
Reason:</hi> And now give me leave to
make one single Remark, since it
occurs so naturally: Are not these
the very Principles which our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
for <hi>Reason</hi> moves upon? So that
an unprejudiced Person might su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that I'm dealing with a <hi>Celsus,</hi>
or a <hi>Trypho;</hi> or that they were risen
from the Dead. But to conclude
this Argument, it's manifest St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
must believe, That the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Doctrine of the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
still contains in it something
that cannot be comprehended by
<hi>Natural Reason,</hi> that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to common Ideas, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Natural Philosophy, and
consequently something that's <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
and above Reason:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if this Reverend Father is not
mistaken in the purport of the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> (as we have good Reason to
conclude, he is not) the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
does contain the Thing (if not
the Word) we contend for, I mean,
proposes to our Belief, Things that
are Incomprehensible, or above the
Comprehension of Human Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:60702:52"/>
The last Argument I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
is two or three Passages of
Scripture, which (because they bear
an Affinity to one another) I shall
examine and conclude them under
one Argument.</p>
            <p>I begin with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s account of
Humane Knowledge, even under
this last State of Revelation; for he
includes himself, and the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of <hi>Apostles,</hi> who undoubtedly
enjoyed the <hi>Special Assistance of the
Spirit of God;</hi> nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had
been <hi>caught up into the Third Heaven,</hi>
where he was almost <hi>overwhelm'd
with abundance of Revelations,</hi> 2 Cor.
12. And yet he tells us, <hi>We know but
in part, and we Prophesie in part,</hi>
1 Cor. Cap. 13. ver. 9. and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
assigned is, <hi>We see through a Glass
darkly,</hi> ver. 12. so that the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seems to lie upon the Mind, or
the Immenseness of the Object, not
in God that denies us a competent
Revelation; for this is the last Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of himself; and therefore this
Glass argues an Imperfection, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
in comprehending some of
those Truths that are revealed; but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60702:52"/>
if this Glass be a Veil which God
casts before our Eyes, like that upon
the <hi>Iews,</hi> in as much as he does not
impart in this Life a clear Discovery
of certain <hi>Gospel-Truths,</hi> then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Mind of our Author,
there are still <hi>Mysteries</hi> in the Gospel,
in the highest Sence; but truly St.
<hi>Clemens</hi> fixes it upon the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Humane Knowledge, since he
represents the Mind in this Earthly
Tabernacle, as viewing Things
through Sences after a gross corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
manner, whereas in another
World our Knowledge will be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enlarged, for then it will be Face
to Face; or, as he expresses it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: That is, by a pure
and naked Application of the Mind,
or Intuition.</p>
            <p>Again, it's manifest the Object of
this Imperfect Knowledge, is the deep
things of GOD, or, in plain terms, the
fundamental Revelations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
for, the Apostle must at least
comprehend, if not principally intend
them, when he tells us, <hi>And we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
but in part;</hi> that is, those <hi>Truths</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60702:53"/>
we publish to the World are only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
in part, since we can only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know or comprehend them
in part. And truly St. <hi>Clement</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
as much of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his abundance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
for thus, on his words
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 4. (where, no doubt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the chiefest Instructions of his
Apostolick Office) <hi>He was caught up
into Paradise, and heard unspeakable
words, which it is not lawful for Man to
utter;</hi> he observes, that there was
no Law nor Precept given that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to stifle any of those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Truths GOD had committed to
him; so that in saying, <hi>it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
he intended to represent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effability
of the Divine Nature, or
the things of GOD; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And, to confirm this
Notion, he cites three Passages that
represent the Incomprehensibleness
of the Divine Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 33.
<hi>Oh! the depth of the Riches both of the
Wisdom and Knowledge of God!</hi> And
again, <hi>But we speak the Wisdom of God
in a Mystery: [That is, even when we
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60702:53"/>
speak it, else it proves nothing in this
place,</hi>] 1 Cor. ii. 7. And lastly,
<hi>Colos.</hi> ii. <hi>Ver.</hi> 23. To the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in
<hi>Christ, [as you have it in the Ancient
Readings</hi>] in whom are hidden all
the Treasures of Wisdom, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
This is a very remarkable
Passage, and therefore I must beg
leave to enlarge upon it.</p>
            <p>As for the Sence of St. <hi>Clement,</hi>
it's visible he looks upon it to be a
<hi>Mystery,</hi> tho' reveal'd and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
and to be a <hi>Mystery</hi> because it
contains something in it which is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it can be no Argument to prove
what he had just before asserted.
Indeed, our Adversary thinks he has
evaded the Force of this Exposition,
by telling us, (without any tolerable
Proof) That <hi>the Words are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the Gospel of</hi> CHRIST; but
if it be the Gospel of CHRIST, it may
be stiled a MYSTERY, in respect of
its Fundamental Truths, inasmuch as
they contain in 'em something that's
hidden or mysterious; for thus much
the following Verse apparently hints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60702:54"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, [<hi>i. e.</hi> in which, if this Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
obtains] <hi>are hidden</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: It's
manifest the Apostle speaks of it as
<hi>reveal'd,</hi> nay, as it is when acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
and embrac'd, and yet there is
something <hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>mysterious.</hi> Thus
we may conclude, against our Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that <hi>Mystery</hi> may be put for the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> and yet call'd so, because it
contains certain Truths, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot be fully comprehended,
or certain Truths, that contain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in 'em that to us is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.
But yet, for all his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
decisive way of expounding
Scripture, I think the words more
naturally point at the <hi>Mystery</hi> of our
Redemption, in the Incarnation of
the Son of GOD, especially if we add
hereto the ancient Reading used by
these Fathers, St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
to the Acknowledgment of the
<hi>Mystery</hi> [not Knowledge of <hi>Mystery,</hi>
as this vain Disputer of this World
would have it] of GOD in CHRIST,
for, <hi>1st,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which immediately
follows, must more naturally be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to <hi>Christ,</hi> not to <hi>Mystery,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to our Translation, <hi>In whom all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60702:54"/>
the Treasures,</hi> &amp;c. This is agreeable
to the Sentiments of <hi>Origen,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
In <hi>Hierom.
Hom. 8. pag. 99. 2dly,</hi> If the Gospel
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and not <hi>Christ</hi> himself, was
intended, it would be improper to
say, that the Treasures of Wisdom
are hid in it, being a reveal'd Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
Therefore we may justly
conclude, pursuant to the Mind of
St. <hi>Clement,</hi> That the Incarnation of
our Redeemer (the Foundation of
our <hi>Redemption,</hi> and Fountain whence
all the Treasures of Wisdom and
Knowledge derive) is the <hi>Mystery</hi> of
GOD in <hi>Christ,</hi> which is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
not unravel'd or fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended;
for, since it is expresly
propos'd as a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and remains
one when embrac'd or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
it must be so, because it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in it something that is hidden or
incomprehensible.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Origen</hi> manifestly joyns in
this Notion; for, in his Comment
on <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 44. he makes the <hi>Field</hi>
to be the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> that set
forth all the Means of Salvation with
the greatest clearness; but the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:60702:55"/>
to be CHRIST, because in Him
all the Depths of Wisdom are hid,
in <hi>Him,</hi> in a <hi>Mystery,</hi> citing this very
Passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of Proof,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
[<hi>dissertis verbis</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to make
an Appeal, as he does, [to all Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Persons, <hi>N. 35.</hi>] Whether, by
as good Reason and Authority, it
does not appear, That not only the
Sence of the Word, but the Things
we contend for, are recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as any he has produc'd to the
contrary? So that, in truth, we are
ready to [render up ourselves] to the
Voice of Scripture, as well as submit
the Merits of the Cause to it, without
being influenc'd and carried away by
such weak Practisings as he has set
forth, in a Dialogue that would me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
some Stripes, if perform'd by a
School-boy, rather than Applause, as
'tis the Product of a pretending <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Reason.</hi> See <hi>Sect. 36.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I have done with his
Scripture-authorities, but cannot pass
by one Remark of his, which I find
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60702:55"/>
to be the chief Improvement that
graces his Second Edition: [<hi>Nor is it
undeserving our particular Notice, that</hi>
Mystery <hi>is here made the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mark of the False and Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church;</hi> (See <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 5.) <hi>And
no doubt but as far as any Church allows
of</hi> Mysteries, <hi>so far it is Antichristian,
and may, with a great deal of Iustice,
tho' little Honour, claim Kindred with
the Scarlet Whore.</hi>] Here is a very
bold Stricture, and yet a Man with
half an Eye may discern, that his
Observation is as irrational and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
as his Inference; for <hi>Mystery,</hi>
in this place, I suppose, would not
have pass'd for a distinguishing
Mark, had not her Doctrines and
Practices merited the other part of
the Title, <hi>viz. The Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
and Abomination of the Earth;</hi>
had she not held <hi>a golden Cup in her
Hand, full of Abominations and Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Fornication,</hi> Ver. 4. and
been <hi>drunken with the Blood of the
Saints, and with the Blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
of Iesus.</hi> But as for his Inference,
had he consulted St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Second
Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> a little
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60702:56"/>
better, he might have learn'd, that
there's a <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> as well
as <hi>Godliness;</hi> but perhaps he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be disappointed of a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
tho' illogical, Suggestion; he
might there have inform'd himself,
That it was always the Devil's Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to imitate the <hi>True Religion</hi> by
mighty Signs and lying Wonders, if
it were possible, to deceive the very
Elect; nay, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> sitteth in
the Temple of GOD, shewing himself
that he is GOD, and consequently he
must pretend to <hi>Mystery</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
So that, upon the whole, this
Gentleman may as well assign the
Devil's Miracles for a distinguishing
Mark of Antichrist, and prove the
true Religion to be nearly related to
Antichrist, the Scarlet Whore, and
the Devil, because she proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Authority of Miracles: Nay,
rather we may upon his Argument
affirm, That Miracles are a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Mark of the true Religion:
And since <hi>Antichrist</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi>
pretend to <hi>Miracles,</hi> the Religion
they pretend to must be true too.
Whereas we know <hi>these</hi> to be Divine
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60702:56"/>
and Authoritative, <hi>those</hi> Diabolical
and Usurped, so we pronounce <hi>this</hi>
the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity, that</hi> the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Godliness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that offers itself, is,
the Suffrage of the Primitive Church.
It's true, there are a great many
things intervene, wherein he labours
more to give us a Specimen of his
Wit, that Reason: But truly, I
think, they are both of a piece, for I
can discover nothing that deserves a
single Reflection, much less a formal
Reply. I proceed therefore to the
Suffrage of the Fathers, to whom he
makes an Appeal. He tells us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
[<hi>It is not out of any deference to
their Iudgments,</hi> N. 40.] and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must conclude he submits to
it, because he's perswaded they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
declare for his Opinion;
but I hope to prove the contrary:
For tho' he confesses he has bestow'd
a great deal of Pains upon 'em, yet
this is so far from discouraging us
from entering the List, that I hope
to make it appear, that his Pains are
either an Effect of his Ignorance in
these Authors, or of his Dishonesty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60702:57"/>
in suppressing their Opinions. And,
first, all that he proves out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
is, That they have asserted
other Notions of <hi>Mystery</hi> than what
we contend for; whereas he himself
assigns four or five different Notions;
and if Classick Authors were consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we could produce some more:
and therefore he might as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
one of his own Notions, because
the Fathers have not mention'd it.
But I find this Author, upon every
turn, shamefully betrays his Reason,
for he knows not what is incumbent
upon him to prove, and therefore we
need not wonder if he proves not his
main Design: I'm sure he's now to
prove a Negative, (or that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to it) if he proves any thing,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Fathers, he cites, no
where apply the word MYSTERY to
things beyond Humane Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
or, that those Notions of the
word <hi>Mystery,</hi> which he finds record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are deliver'd exclusively of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
for, if he has neither cited all
their Notions or Acceptations of the
word, nor prov'd, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
of all others, he proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60702:57"/>
against the acceptation of the
word we now contend for; and if so,
the most cursory Reader will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
pronounce, That he must give
up the Cause, in case he fixes it on
this Issue, I mean the Authority of
Fathers. But because I will take no
advantage of his weakness, I will go
along with him in his own Instances.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st,</hi> What he cites from <hi>Clemens
Alexand.</hi> concludes nothing; for, I
know no Christian that denys the
Christian Religion to be [<hi>an Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
because it brought hidden things
to light, and that with respect to the
Mosaick Veil.</hi>] But this only proves
one of his own Notions, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
allow'd by us. But to be short
with him; Whereas he has the Face
to tell us, That <hi>several of those Texts
of Scripture alledg'd by him, are by this
Father expounded on his side, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
against our Notion:</hi> I shall
appeal to what has been already ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from him, to prove the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> p. 46, 48.</note>. Indeed I could add a great
deal more to discover his Judgment
of the Inconceivableness of certain
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60702:58"/>
Objects of Faith, or Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
and, because I'm engag'd,
I shall produce a few Instances: And,
first, where he stiles Christianity an
<hi>Illumination,</hi> he speaks of the <hi>Fulness
of Christ,</hi> as a <hi>Mystery</hi> reveal'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but the Nature of it known to
a very few; and he proves it from
the Incomprehensible Nature of
GOD, <hi>Strom.</hi> lib. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and
yet more fully on <hi>Moses</hi>'s words,
<hi>Exod. 33. ver. 18. Shew me thy Glory;</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
2. p. 365. <hi>Strom. lib.</hi> That is, by
the <hi>Effects of his Power.</hi> Again, on
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>1 Cor. 5. Christ our
Passover is sacrificed for us;</hi> Strom.
<hi>lib. 5.</hi> he observes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Here
it's evident he argues from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibleness
of the Divine
Nature, and consequently must fix
the <hi>Mystery</hi> on this Bottom, as well
as the want of <hi>Revelation.</hi> Indeed,
we may justly argue <hi>à majori,</hi> from
the Sence of this Father, if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60702:58"/>
of the Godhead be, in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this great Man, so highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
how much more
must the Fundamental Article of the
Christian Religion be so, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of the Union of the Divine with
Human Nature, and consequently, in
a proper sence, <hi>mysterious.</hi> See <hi>N. 42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for St. <hi>Clement;</hi> the
next Authority is <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi>
which concludes nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
For, First, he only uses the
Word in a loose Sence, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
of any other signification; and
if this may be an Argument against
that Sence which this Reasoner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
against, it will be so against
others, which he has expresly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.
This may serve for a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Return to the next Paragraph,
where <hi>Tertullian</hi> stiles all <hi>Religious
Rites,</hi> or <hi>Acts of Worship, Mysteries;</hi>
which among the Heathens were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
kept secret: yet, tho' this be
an allowed Sence of the Word, it
can be no Argument, but that <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
even in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, was
apply'd to Things in 'emselves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struce
or incomprehensible. Of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60702:59"/>
same stamp are his Arguments from
<hi>Origen,</hi> which prove no more than
what all sides own, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
in a vulgar, or more loose Sence,
is put for <hi>Symbols, Types,</hi> or any <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse</hi>
or <hi>sacred Matter.</hi> N. 44.</p>
            <p>Certainly, had this <hi>Gentleman</hi>
consulted any other <hi>Pieces</hi> of this
<hi>Learned Father,</hi> he might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
himself, that he uses <hi>Mystery</hi>
even in <hi>Divine Matters,</hi> for Things
that are to us incomprehensible.
Thus, in the forecited Passage, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Thing as it now is, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
himself, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
[<hi>Vt Supra.</hi> See <hi>pag. 56.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Again, on the Words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Mat.</hi> xix. 24, 26. he observes,
That GOD was able to make a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>
pass thro' an <hi>Eye of a Needle;</hi>
and yet no one but God or Christ,
or he to whom he shall reveal it, is
able to comprehend it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Afterwards he challenges any Man
to Illustrate or Explain such <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
being Things only compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60702:59"/>
as well as performed, by

<hi>Pag. 382.</hi> 1 Vol.</p>
            <p>But now in the close of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
he thinks he sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes
our Notion of <hi>Mystery,</hi> when
he tells us <hi>Origen [was far from
thinking any Doctrine of our Religion
a</hi> Mystery, <hi>in the present Sence of the
Word, that he expresly affirms them to
agree all with common Notions, and to
commend themselves to the Assent of
every well-dispos'd Hearer.</hi>] This
truly looks very plausible; but I'm
perswaded, <hi>Origen,</hi> in making good
this Assertion, will run counter to the
Notions of this <hi>Indefatigable Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi>
For First, It's well known,
who the Holy Father was engaged
with, a Learned Heathen, who had
formed an Objection, That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were to believe Things, tho'
in themselves never so absurd or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous;
and therefore it was his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to take off the Objection, by
shadowing forth the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of every Doctrine: He begins
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60702:60"/>
with the Doctrines of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Being of a God, and
our Love towards him; but when
he comes to the <hi>Mystery</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Incarnation,</hi> he makes a stand,
and repeats <hi>Celsus</hi>'s Objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
The Answer is
remarkable; for it evinces the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Incarnation of our blessed
Saviour, as a standing Doctrine of
the Christian Church, to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Confusion of all <hi>Socinian</hi> Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Antiquity. Let our <hi>Accusers</hi>
know, that we (as it were speaking
the Sence of the Christian Church)
do not only think, but are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that he is Originally, or in
the Beginning GOD, and the Son of
GOD; nay, he is the Substantial
Word, Wisdom, and Truth; and
as for his Mortal Body, and Human
Soul, we attribute the greatest Things
to it; in as much as a most exact
and compleat Union with his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
it obtains a kind of Divinity;
so that we may still treat our Blessed
Saviour, GOD and Man, (as GOD)
with the highest Acts of Divine
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60702:60"/>
Worship. His words are these:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>You see the great Design of the
Apologist is to represent how such
Honour and Dignity is derived upon
the Humanity of our Saviour, and
consequently the Reasonableness of
paying Divine Worship to him even
as GOD-Man, or GOD Incarnate; and
pursuant to this, to justifie those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
that accrew to the Body of our
Saviour, he appeals to the Natural
Transmutations of Matter, whereby
Bodies are often highly refin'd and
improv'd, and then ingeniously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>Why should not the Infinite
Power of GOD therefore be able to
change the Mortal Body of Iesus?</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how, out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or a worse Principle, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputer
of this World (for the Title
belongs to him, tho' not so deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60702:61"/>
as those on whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> bestows
it) has Misrepresented the Sence of
this great Man, whose main Design
was, to shew the Reasonableness of
paying Divine Worship to the Blessed
Jesus; and this he sufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
by asserting his Divinity, but
he did not attempt to demonstrate
the <hi>Modus</hi> of the Union of the two
Natures by common Notions. He
has indeed expresly asserted our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Divinity, as well as Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the highest Notion of it; and
I defie this profound Reasoner to
state the Union of both Natures by
common Ideas or Notions, much less
to give us as familiar an Idea of it as
we have of Wood or Stone. Till he
has done this, he trifles, and we shall
still believe that our Saviour's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is thus far a <hi>Mystery.</hi> Thus we
have turn'd those very Fathers he
most relies on against him; and tho'
he has the Confidence to fix a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
Challenge upon the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the three first Centuries, I
could produce as much more, had I
not a regard to my own Time, and
that of the Reader's, which ought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60702:61"/>
to be a sufficient Consideration with
every Man, to prevent him from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in Impertinences, or dwelling
too long where Necessity does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it: I shall therefore only beg
Leave to add the Judgment of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,—Si

47. Ed. Eras. I have cited this at
large, because I find every thing
agreeable to the Hypothesis I have
hitherto advanc'd. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st, Mystery</hi> is indisputably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to <hi>reveal'd Truths,</hi> beyond the
reach of Humane Comprehension.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Such <hi>reveal'd Truths,</hi> appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
deliver'd in Scripture, are not
to be rejected; because we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Difficulties that seem to
accompany the Belief of 'em, but to
embrace 'em as the Word of GOD,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60702:62"/>
and consequently as founded in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wisdom and Veracity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> Our Unskilfulness, not to say
Inabilities, in comprehending Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Sence, or Physical Matters, is
made an Argument, that there are
<hi>Mysteries</hi> in Matters of Revelation.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto confin'd my self to
his Rule, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Fathers of the
Three First Centuries; but truly I
can see no just reason why the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of after-Ages may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the present Controversie,
at least as Witnesses, if not Judges.
I'm sure there can nothing abstract,
but his groundless Fiction of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Combination, to resolve all <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
into <hi>Mystery:</hi> For, as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Use or Signification of the
Word, certainly after-Ages may be
as competent Judges as those of the
First Century: And, as for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
itself, Whether there's any
Doctrine in Christianity <hi>mysterious,</hi>
certainly that Age ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd
to, that had a more special oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to bring the Controversie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, and this the <hi>Arrian</hi>
Age, and those that follow'd it; for,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60702:63"/>
in this Age it's well known, those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
we contend, are <hi>mysterious,</hi>
were more nicely controverted. I
shall therefore add to those Passages
already cited, a few more, which
prove the Use of the word to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to things incomprehensible;
and that there are Doctrines in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
pronounc'd <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and
that too for the Incomprehensibleness
of 'em. The first I shall instance in
is <hi>Dionys. Areop.</hi> where in one place
he describes our Saviour's Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
Cap. 4. <hi>de Coelest. Hierarch.</hi> In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>Sect. 9. Cap. 2. de Divinis Nomin.</hi>
The second Instance is from a Tract
entitl'd, <hi>Expositio Fidei,</hi> rejected
indeed as a Piece of <hi>Iustin Martyr;</hi>
yet from <hi>Leontin</hi>'s, and other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Arguments, justly esteem'd to
be the Product of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Age:
He stiles the Unity and Trinity,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and confesses it cannot be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60702:63"/>
unfolded by Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and upon the Incarnation
of Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
And in such deep Research, at last,
concludes with this Rule: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And now we may conclude this
Chapter much in the same strain that
he does <hi>N. 45.</hi> I do not find but
[<hi>the Fathers of the three first Centuries
have exactly the same Notions of</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
<hi>as well as those that follow them,</hi>]
and for an Allay to his Jealousies, I
think they are pretty consistent as
well as unanimous; but then this
Consistency and Unanimity happens
to be against a trifling Reasoner, and
therefore I must take the Reverse to
his concluding Period, [<hi>and justly
hope, by this time, the Cause of Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
and Inconceivable, or</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
<hi>in Religion, will be more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
maintain'd by all that sincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
Fathers, Scripture, <hi>or</hi> Reason.]</p>
            <p>I come now to the Fourth Chapt.
Sect. 3. which is an Answer to some
Scripture-Objections, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60702:64"/>
from the Nature of Faith. I now
find this Discourse swells upon me
beyond Expectations; and therefore,
as for the Scripture-passages cited by
him, tho' there is more in 'em than
he has suggested, yet I shall pass 'em,
especially because I think the Merits
of the Cause does by no means turn
upon 'em: I shall therefore take up
his Friend's Arguments concerning
the Nature of Faith, and try if he
may not be compel'd by dint of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
since he would not embrace
the Advice of his Friend, <hi>N. 51.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, As for what he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<hi>N. 52, 53.</hi> I find nothing
but what has already received an
Answer, [<hi>particularly what is cited,</hi>
Sect. 2. c. 2, &amp; 7.] or at least, but what
amounts to no more than will be
concluded by what I'm going to
offer; and therefore he may take
it for a full, or competent Answer,
<hi>viz. Reason</hi> is a necessary Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
or Instrument of Faith; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that we must believe upon
Rational Motives and Convictions:
And thus far, I know no Son of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that will dissent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60702:64"/>
from him. As for what is delivered,
<hi>N. 54. [That Faith consists of two
parts, Knowledge and Assent.</hi>] I think
no one will be so absurd to deny it;
for I'am perswaded there can be no
Assent without Knowledge: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in a word, had I known his
Design, I should have excused the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of citing so many Texts to
prove it, and in a few words grant,
<hi>That in those things we call the pure</hi>
Credenda <hi>of Religion, we are at least
to know so much, as will enable us to
form an Imperfect Idea of what it is
God proposes to our Belief; but it does
not imply such a Knowledge, as enables
to unravel and comprehend the whole
Nature of the Object, or the very
Modes of its Existence, or Properties;
or much less, give a</hi> Rationale <hi>of every
thing that belongs to it,</hi> No, if we
know as much as instructs us what
it is God proposes to our Belief, we
submit all the Difficulties that may
arise from the Belief of it, to God's
Power and Wisdom, and yield an
Assent (notwithstanding some seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Absurdities) upon the Infinite
Veracity of God. This distinguisheth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60702:65"/>
Faith from a bare rational Assent in
common Matters; and all this is
consistent with what he has deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>N. 55, 56.</hi> and therefore I shall
not ingage in a particular Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what is there offered. To
proceed then in order to a clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of this Notion of Faith,
I shall not consider the Case of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
Faith (being the next thing
that offers it self) but shall instance
in the Belief of the Creation: Thro'
Faith we understand, that the
Worlds were framed by the Word
of God; so that Things which are
seen, were made of Things which
do not appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. <hi>v. 3.</hi> Here
I think is a vast difference between
God's creative Power, in raising the
World out of nothing, and restoring
a dead Person to Life again, before
the corruptible part was any wise
dissolved. Indeed I cannot conceive
how we can form an Idea of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of such a Production; that
God should raise so vast a stock of
Matter, even all created Nature, and
every thing that we can form any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Ideas of, and yet without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60702:65"/>
Materials to work upon, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be comprehended. The <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi>
supposed a Soul to the World,
and the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> a first Mover, but
could never give any tolerable
account of the Rise of Mundane
Matter, without making it eternal.
In short, they always taught, That
an Agent necessarily supposes a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
really distinct from the Patient,
especially in external Actions: And
we know in Numbers it's universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil est.</hi> And we
can conceive no otherwise in Nature,
at least the Reasoner cannot on his
Principles pretend to it; for he tells
us, we can form no manner of Idea
of nothing; and therefore how it is
possible to form an Idea of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
by common Ideas, when all
our Ideas take their rise from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Beings, even that of the Infinite
and Eternal Being, are resembled by
Objects of his own production. It's
true, we say this is an effect of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power, but we have no notion
of the Thing, unless we apply Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power to that which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it, which is nothing into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60702:66"/>
thing; and when all is done, we
form an Idea of this Infinite Power,
purely by the Effects of it in Finite
Beings: So that upon the whole, it's
evident, the Belief of the Creation,
(that implys a Production of all
things out of nothing) is an Object
that exceeds Humane Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and consequently we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that Faith (which yields an
Assent to the Doctrine of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
often implys an Assent to a
Thing that contains something in it,
that is Incomprehensible. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that Objects of Faith contain
Things that exceed Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
is a Truth so indisputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that Faith in the Judgment of
the Primitive Church-Writers, was
on this account distinguished from
Knowledge or Science. <q>It's true;
In all Objects of Faith, we are to
know so much of 'em, as to direct
us what it is God proposes to our
Belief. And Secondly, We are to
believe, That it is God that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
'em. Thirdly, In all Acts of
Faith we are to yield an Assent to
the Truth, or Being of Things; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60702:66"/>
this supposes, that we have formed
at least an imperfect Idea of their
Nature; but for the <hi>Quomodo sint,</hi>
that is, for the Manner of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Existence, that may be an
act of Knowledge, or Science, but
not of Faith; so that if seeming
Contradictions or Absurdities arise
on this account, and consequently
are thus far justly Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Faith throws us upon the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Veracity of God.</q> All this I
shall endeavour to confirm by the
Authorities of the Primitive Church.
And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Passage already cited
from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> manifestly instructs us,
That there are Difficulties and MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERIES
in <hi>Revealed Truths,</hi> which
<hi>Humane Reason</hi> cannot comprehend,
and obliges us to commit all such
Matters to GOD, because they were
delivered by his Word and Spirit;
and what is this, but to embrace and
believe upon his Infinite Veracity?
And at last concludes, That if we
observe the Method, <hi>Fidem nostram
servabimus, &amp; omnis Scriptura à Deo
nobis data, consonans nobis invenietur:</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60702:67"/>
Does not this imply, that there are
things contained in Matters of Faith,
that are Incomprehensible? Yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that all seeming Difficulties, or
Absurdities that arise from 'em, when
scann'd by common Notions, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,
are to be committed to God as
the best Expedient to preserve a right
<hi>Faith,</hi> see <hi>Pag. 64.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Clemens Alexand.</hi> seems
to state the Notion of <hi>Faith</hi> more
clearly, in opposition to Science:
And first he fixes the <hi>Foundation of
Faith</hi> in the Word of GOD, or the
<hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and represents it as
an Irrefragible Foundation, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the highest Demonstration in it;
and that we are to enquire no further
than <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> upon which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
this Maxim, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And to let us see how far he extends
it, he instances in the fore-cited Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the <hi>Heb. Cap.</hi> xii. <hi>v. 12.</hi> and
thence proceeds to state the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> thus,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Vid. Stro. Lib. 2.
P. 362, 3, 4.</hi> and in his 5th Book he's
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60702:67"/>
more full, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Here we see, <hi>Faith</hi> is
resolved into the Infinite Power and
Veracity of GOD; insomuch, that
we are obliged to believe, as soon as
we know it to be the Word of GOD,
or as soon as we know GOD propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
any thing to our Belief: Here we
find Science and Faith opposed, the
one requiring Demonstration or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
drawn from the Nature of
the Thing; the other, not so: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must conclude, That if GOD
proposes any thing to our Belief, that
contains Matters incomprehensible,
or not reconcileable with common
Notions; <hi>Faith,</hi> in the <hi>Opinion</hi> of this
Father, will command an <hi>Assent;</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that his Infinite Power and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
must over-ballance all seeming
Absurdities and Contradictions.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Argument, I
shall produce the Judgment of St.
<hi>Chrysostom:</hi> Thus he assigns the
Reason, why the Natural Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive the Things that be of
GOD, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. <hi>v. 14. viz.</hi> For the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60702:68"/>
Immensity of the Things 'emselves, far
exceeding the Comprehension of the
most Improved Reason; and for the
want of Faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Hom. 7.</hi>
And upon the Article of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Heb.</hi> xi. <hi>v. 3.</hi> he tells us, The Mind
that is prepared for the Reception
of Faith, must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
she must be elevated
above Sence, and all sensible Objects,
and pass over the Weakness of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reasonings; and afterwards;
Whereas, says he, Faith is vilified as
a Thing that is void of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; or rather, a
Thing full of Folly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the <hi>Apostle</hi> shews us in <hi>this one Instance,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
for the very Article, says he;
is not established by Reason, but
rather the contrary, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Hom. 22.</hi>
In <hi>Epist. Heb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again we find him describing
Faith under the very same Notion,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60702:68"/>
               <hi>Hom. 23.</hi> in <hi>Ter. Iohan.</hi> where, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Nichodemus</hi>'s Words, <hi>How can a
Man be born when he is old?</hi> v. 4.
he observes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Upon which he enlarges, and tells
us, It is the Question of Hereticks
upon the Incarnation of our Blessed
Saviour, (demanding, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
that by the weakness of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions, or Reasonings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
his Immense Nature, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
and at last concludes,
That such Practices, or Questions,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And on the
Second Part of the Question, about
entring the Womb a Second time,
he observes, When a Man proceeds
upon common Notions, or Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in Spiritual Matters, and does
not receive the Dictates of Faith,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
He talks like a Drunken or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
uttering the most absurd and
ridiculous things.</p>
            <p>And now, certainly, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
what St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Notion
of Faith was, without drawing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60702:69"/>
and that it every way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with that of <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus:</hi>
It's therefore manifest, Faith
is distinguished from Knowledge, or
Science, not only as the Objects of it
are Matters of Revelation, but as
they contain Things that are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible;
and yet it yields an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
upon the Infinite Veracity of the
Word of GOD: I'm sure this Great
Man has dropt such unlucky Words
against our <hi>Adversary</hi>'s Principles, or
his Methods of Examining Divine
Truths, as if he were risen from the
Dead, and were preparing to accuse
him of Heresie, or some sly Maxims
that look that way. I should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advise him to weigh the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of so Great a Person, before he
advances too far: and yet, when I
consider what severe Censures he has
past upon the Writers of this Age, I
despair of Success in giving Advice in
this kind; for I cannot think he'll
ever be perswaded to take his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Faith, from an Age, or any
Writer in it, when he makes 'em, as
it were, to have entred into a League
to turn all Religion into <hi>Mystery,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60702:69"/>
and this another to be Name for <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,</hi>
or <hi>Priestcraft:</hi> If this be true,
to be instructed by such a Race of
Men, is, in plain <hi>English,</hi> to take
up one's Faith from those that have
fallen away from the Faith; but
of this I shall say more in the last
Chapter.</p>
            <p>To return then: It's now abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
evident, that the Notion of
Faith which we now contend for, is
not a Thing contrived to advance a
particular Hypothesis, or serve a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Design, but by no means such
a one as he suggests, <hi>viz. [To stop
the Mouths of such as demand a Reason
where none can be given, and to keep as
many in Ignorance, as Interest shall
think convenient.</hi> See N. 48.] But I
hope an Impartial Reader will find
it establish'd upon a good Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or in a word, upon such Reasons
as he is not able to subvert or remove;
beside, if it be a Contrivance, we
have this Apology, that it is not a
late Forgery, since we have traced
it almost as far as any Ecclesiastical
Records, (besides those of Scripture)
admit of; and this is a considerable
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60702:70"/>
Presumption of the Injustice of such
foul-mouthed Aspersions, 'till he gives
us a better Set of Arguments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it; which is the next Thing
that should be examined: but truly
there appears so little in 'em, that I
think they scarce deserve a distinct
Examination:</p>
            <p>The First is, [<hi>If Faith were not a
Perswasion resulting from the previous
Knowledge and Comprehension of the
Thing believed, there could be no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
nor Differences of it.</hi>] Now
First, It's manifest, the Argument is
advanced on a false Supposition, (and
that which runs thro' all his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations)
<hi>viz.</hi> That we deny all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of a previous Knowledge of the
Object; whereas we say, there must
be at least such a previous knowledge
of the Object, as instructs us what it
is GOD proposes to our Belief; but
there's no necessity of Comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Absolute Nature of the
Thing, so as to be able to give a
<hi>Rationale</hi> of every Thing that really
belongs to it; and that too, by trying
it by common Notions. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
we say, the different Degrees
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60702:70"/>
of Faith, do by no means rise from
such a Comprehensive Knowledge:
No, when once we know what GOD
proposes to our Belief, the Degrees
of Faith arise from the Application
of GOD's Veracity to our Minds
and Consciences; if the Mind is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a deep Sence of it, as to
engage us to place an absolute Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in it, tho' we cannot form a
<hi>Rationale</hi> of the Thing, yet we may
embrace it with the highest Degrees
of Faith: I'm sure, this is the Doctrine
which [<hi>this Man of Reason</hi>] might
have learn'd from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Case
of <hi>Abraham, Who against Hope, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in Hope,—and being not weak in
Faith, he considered not his own Body
now dead, nor yet the Deadness of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's
Womb: he staggered not at the
Promise thro' Vnbelief, but was strong
in Faith, giving Glory to GOD, and
being fully perswaded, that what he had
promised he was also able to perform;
and therefore it was imputed to him
for Righteousness,</hi> Rom. iv. 18, 19,
20, 21.</p>
            <p>2d Arg. [<hi>The Subject of Faith
must be intelligible to all, since the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60702:71"/>
thereof is commanded under no less
a Penalty than Damnation.</hi>] As for
the Intelligibleness of Objects of
Faith, I have already stated how far
that is necessary; but, with Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I think the Sin and Damnation of
Unbelief, arises, not because GOD
has furnish'd us with a perfect <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale</hi>
of the Nature of every Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Faith, and we reject it; but
because he hath furnish'd us with
Means sufficient to know what he
hath proposed to our Belief, and to
know that he hath proposed them,
and we will fully reject 'em; and
consequently what he proposes: but
more especially, because he hath
asserted the Truth of 'em, by
the highest Demonstrations of the
Spirit, in mighty Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
This was the Case of the
<hi>Iews;</hi> but now ye say, Ye see, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Sin remaineth.</p>
            <p>4th Arg. [<hi>Except Faith signifies an
Intelligible Perswasion, we cannot give
others a Reason of the Hope that is in
us.</hi>] The Inference is apparently
false; for we certainly give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(and that too, according to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60702:71"/>
Mind of St. <hi>Peter</hi>) of any Article of
Faith, when we prove that it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by GOD, and that we yield
an Assent to the Truth of it (tho' we
cannot remove every Difficulty that
may arise from it) upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Infinite Veracity.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Third,</hi> and <hi>Fifth Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi>
I shall Appeal to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
Reader, whether there's
any thing in 'em, that deserves a
particular Reply, more than in those
Objections he first framed, and then
answered: For as the former prove
nothing against the Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Matters of Faith, so the
latter were never advanced, to prove
the Necessity of admitting such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Faith. Upon the whole
then, I think it appears, there are
Matters of Faith that contain Things
in 'em, which are Incomprehensible,
and yet Faith yields an Assent upon
the Authority of Infinite Veracity,
and consequently it's an uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Argument, there are <hi>Mysteries</hi> in
the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing to be considered,
is, his Reply to the Argument of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60702:72"/>
               <hi>Cap. 5. Sect. 3.</hi> And, First,
he entertains you with the Nature of
a Miracle. And as for the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he gives us, I find, in the Main,
no Reason to except against it; after
this, he guards it with some Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
The First of which is, That a
Miracle is not to be admitted contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Reason; I suppose, he means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to common Notions, or those
Idea's which Reason has formed
from Sence, Experience, or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And, no doubt, this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
just Limitation: <q>For a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
is performed upon Objects of
Sense; and 'tis an Address to our
Senses, or a Demonstration accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the outward Senses,
by some sensible Effects, or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and consequently, nothing
is to be admitted as a Miracle, that
contradicts the Testimony of the
Senses:</q> and we are, at least, so far
Judges of its possibility, that in Case
it manifestly contradicts the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our Sence, we may justly
rank it among Impossibilities, and
reject it as such. But further than
this, I cannot discern, that we are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60702:72"/>
competent Judges of the Possibility of
any Miracle; for to judge of its Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
supposes a knowledge of its <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi>
But this our <hi>Adversary</hi> will not
allow; [<hi>For the manner of Miracles,</hi>
(says he) <hi>is not explicable.</hi> N. 77.</p>
            <p>Thus far we are agreed; but I
know not how this Limitation,
much less those that follow, affect
the present Controversie. Indeed,
he at last comes to the Point, and
tells us, [<hi>Miracles are not above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
tho' we know nothing of the</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.]
But I would fain know, why
a Thing that contains somewhat in
the Nature of it, which exceeds Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Comprehension, is not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>above Reason,</hi> or <hi>Mysterious,</hi> as
a Thing (in itself intelligible) only
it lies dormant, because shadowed
thro'a Veil, I'm sure, <hi>Origen</hi> tells
the contrary, <hi>Comment. in Mat. 19.
24, 26. ut supra.</hi> See <hi>pag. 61.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have exposed the Folly of
this Assertion in another place. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
I should have turned his own
Arguments upon him, had he not
prevented me, by reviving 'em in
such a manner, as gives me a better
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60702:73"/>
advantage over him. We have it
thus, [<hi>As the beginning of my Book, I
maintained, the Manner, as well as the
Thing was explicable. But of what?
Of Miracles. No, surely; but of
those Doctrines, in Confirmation of
which the Miracles are wrought.</hi> See <hi>N.
77.</hi>] This is truly an unaccountable
Paradox. Miracles are certainly the
Demonstrations of Sence, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
are to be scann'd and judg'd
of by common Ideas, even the most
clear and indisputable, such as result
from <hi>Objects of Sence;</hi> but it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that Matters of <hi>Revelation</hi>
are founded on Objects that are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Infinite, and consequently
are to us more abstruse and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.</p>
            <p>Again, Miracles are a direct and
immediate Address to the Sence and
Reason of Mankind, and are design'd
to give an unquestionable Credit to
every <hi>reveal'd Truth,</hi> since they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Testimony of Infinite Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the behalf of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
all the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> in
Nature will direct, that they should
pass the severest Scrutiny. But in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60702:73"/>
Matters of Revelation it's concluded,
that a great deal rests upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Infinite Veracity, and this
depends upon the Evidence of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
and therefore it's absurd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a clearer and more precise Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the Nature of <hi>reveal'd
Truths</hi> than of <hi>Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gentleman owns, that <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
are a Confirmation of <hi>reveal'd
Truths;</hi> that is, at least, as they are an
absolute Attestation of their Divine
Original: And this is an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Demonstration of the Truth of
them. Indeed I'm perswaded the
meerest Novice in Logick will tell
him, That we are to have, at least, as
adequate a Knowledge of that which
is to confirm, as that which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by it; or that the Premises are
to carry as great Evidence in 'em as
we expect in the Conclusion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's absurd to say, that the <hi>Modus</hi>
of <hi>Miracles</hi> is inexplicable, and the
<hi>Modus</hi> of all <hi>reveal'd Truths</hi> not so.
Indeed this Gentleman seems to have
furnish'd us with Weapons to fence
against him with the greatest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
for if such Positions as these
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60702:74"/>
must pass for Truth, it must be Truth
in a <hi>Mystery.</hi> And truly, we could
not have desir'd a better Argument
against him; for, if the <hi>Modus</hi> of
<hi>Objects of Sence</hi> be inexplicable, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the <hi>Modus</hi> of <hi>reveal'd Truths</hi>
are much more inexplicable; the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menseness
of whose Nature to a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Mind, renders them incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Modus</hi> of <hi>Objects of
Sence</hi> is not to be explain'd by Ideas
of the same kind; much less, is the
<hi>Modus</hi> of Infinite and Spiritual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to be explain'd by the Ideas of
<hi>Objects of Sence:</hi> 
               <q>So that, in a word,
since <hi>Miracles</hi> (as <hi>Objects of Sence,</hi>
with respect to the <hi>Modus</hi> of 'em)
are inexplicable, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
justly to be esteem'd <hi>above
Reason,</hi> much more are Matters of
Revelation, with respect to their
<hi>Modus,</hi> to be esteem'd inexplicable,
<hi>above Reason,</hi> and consequently <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to examine, in the last
place, his pretended Historical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Rise of <hi>Mystery,</hi> and the
Causes of it, under this Title, [<hi>When,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60702:74"/>
why, and by whom were</hi> Mysteries
<hi>brought into Christianity,</hi> Cap. 6.
Sect. 3.] And truly I am perswaded
what has already been deliver'd will
be esteem'd (by an impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
a sufficient Confutation to this
whole Chapter, (at least if it answers
the Title) without examining any
Paragraph: However, I think it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
no Answer, but a short Reply
to the Title, and that is capable of no
other, but such as we give to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Question of the <hi>Romanists,
Where was your Religion before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<q>As to the time when <hi>Mystery</hi>
was introduc'd, I hope it's suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
prov'd to be of the same Date
with Christianity itself, being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not in <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Words</hi> only,
but in <hi>Certain Truths,</hi> that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as <hi>Objects of Faith.</hi> But, 2dly,
for the Person by whom, or that
introduc'd it, I'm perswaded there's
enough offer'd to charge it upon the
Blessed Author of the Institution.
Lastly, For the Reason why <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
were introduc'd, I shall leave
'em to this notable Reasoner to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
it out with the Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60702:75"/>
of GOD, in not creating Man
with larger and more comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Faculties, or not contriving
some more familiar Method of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</q>
And now, if what has
already been deliver'd stands good
against this Author, (there being as
yet no reason to suspect it) I'll appeal
to all the World, whether it does not
destroy the malicious Suggestions of
this Chapter, which make <hi>Mystery</hi> to
be a Trick of <hi>Priestcraft,</hi> contriv'd
for the support of Secular Grandeur
and Dominion.</p>
            <p>But, to descend to a few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
He observes, (and that too with
a great deal of Contempt and Scorn)
That the Christian Church initiated
their Converts in a Way and Method
not much unlike that of the Heathen
World; which is the most he can
make of all his <hi>Allegations.</hi> Now we
own, the Christian Converts were
gradually initiated, that they were
rank'd in several Classes, and had a
Discipline, and Instructions, peculiar
to each Class, and thereupon prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the publication of the sublimest
Parts of Religion, to any but those
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60702:75"/>
that had gone through the inferiour
Classes; and truly, such Injunctions
have not only the unquestionable
Dictates of Prudence for their Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but Apostolick Practice and
Approbation; for 'tis the establish'd
Method with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Converts,
as well as those at <hi>Corinth;</hi> they
were brought on gradually to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
first by Milk, then by strong
Meats, the one accommodated to
Babes in Christ, the other to those of
full age; see <hi>Heb.</hi> v. <hi>ver. 12, 13, 14.</hi>
and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 2. where it's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Converts were first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in those Scriptures that set
forth the easiest parts of our Saviour's
Offices, as <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi> and <hi>King;</hi>
but afterwards, those that asserted
his Divinity. I'm sure St. <hi>Clement</hi>
makes these Babes to be the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi>
or those that were instructed
in the Catechistick Parts of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
but the Perfect, those that
were instructed in the sublimest parts
of <hi>Religion;</hi> to wit, the <hi>Essence</hi> of the
<hi>Divine Nature.</hi> But now the great
Crime is, that all these Measures of
Initiation were taken from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60702:76"/>
And this is prov'd, because
they are much the same.</p>
            <p>It is not now my business to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Parallel; tho' I must confess
there are, in a great many things, very
lively Resemblances: But as for the
Crime, I cannot discern where that
lies, since the Christians did not sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize
with any Design to form a
Comprehension between <hi>Heathenism</hi>
and <hi>Christianity;</hi> nor (as this Author
suggests) out of an Opinion of any
Religion contain'd in such Rites, see
<hi>N. 97.</hi> but out of a Zeal for GOD,
and the Souls of Men, they, in St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Language, <hi>became all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, that if possible they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the Territories of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and save some;</hi> for, as long as
they acted on these Principles, I think
there was no more Guilt in 'em, than
in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s occasional Compliances
with <hi>Iewish</hi> Rites. Indeed our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
elsewhere [<hi>Num. 78, 79.</hi>]
gives this very account of these Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations
or Compliances; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I cannot conceive how he can
justifie so base an Aspersion, <hi>viz.
N. 90. [Here is enough to shew how
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60702:76"/>
Christianity became mysterious, and how
so Divine an Institution did, thro' the
Craft and Ambition of Priests and
Philosophers, degenerate into meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism.</hi>]
It's well known there are
other Accounts given of those Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Rites that were introduc'd in
the Primitive Church, than those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
assign'd; and those too, that are
abundantly sufficient to vindicate the
Lawfulness of 'em: I shall refer him
to St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> the Author he has cited,
who is very particular on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>But, in a word, it's manifest they
were in 'emselves the best Expedients
to maintain the Discipline of the
Church, and establish a regular and
uniform Piety, as well as orthodox,
clear, and well-digested Faith; so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
is the Charge, that makes 'em
Artifices to introduce <hi>Mystery, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
and <hi>Blind Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> As for those Emblematical
Rites introduc'd in the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Christian Sacraments, they
might possibly contribute to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
<hi>Mysteries</hi> in a <hi>Iewish</hi> Sence,
as it is used for Typical Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60702:77"/>
but they seem to have no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to establish Mystery in the
sence we contend for; I mean, as it is
put for Incomprehensible Truths.</p>
            <p>But let us <hi>reflect</hi> a little on the <hi>Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of this <hi>Accusation:</hi> Here's a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Combination in the Pastors of
the Catholick Church, and a great
many Hellish Designs form'd in the
Womb of it; <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is the original Spring, <hi>Ceremony</hi>
and a great many <hi>superfluous Rites</hi>
the Instrument, and the grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
were to turn <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi>
even to that degree, that in the
Opinion of this Author, it has made
a Divine Institution degenerate into
Paganism; <hi>N. 90.</hi> But, for what
Reason? Purely because some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Rules of Discipline resemble the
Religious Rites of Heathens; for,
there can no other be fix'd on those
that are truly Primitive. If this be
so, I'm sure the Censure is extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
absurd. What if a sober Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
acts upon the strict Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and abhors Slander and Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
more than this Calumniator;
must not a good Christian practice
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60702:77"/>
the same Virtue, for fear of being
charg'd with Paganism? I'm sure
the Case is the same where the Thing
is innocent or lawful.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this Gentleman declaims
against <hi>Mystery</hi> very heartily, but I
am afraid he has too much dealing
with one sort of it; for, such <hi>Illogical,</hi>
such <hi>Groundless,</hi> such <hi>Vile Aspersions,</hi>
must take their Rise from the <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Iniquity,</hi> that reigns in the high
places; for 'tis nothing else but the
Language of him that is justly stiled,
<hi>the Accuser of his Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to proceed a little further, I
find he has an immortal Abhorrence
of the <hi>Cross in Baptism,</hi> of <hi>Altars,</hi> of
the <hi>Dedication</hi> or <hi>Consecration of
Charches, Musick,</hi> the <hi>Rites of Burial;</hi>
and, in a word, of the <hi>Institution of
National Churches,</hi> which he seems to
call <hi>Human Faction,</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> in one
place; [See <hi>pag. 172. Ed. 2.</hi> and <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations
upon Mankind</hi> in another,
<hi>N. 93.</hi>] Now these are Rites and
Sanctions enjoyn'd and practis'd in
the Establish'd Church of <hi>England;</hi>
and when he thinks fit to discover
wherein the Evil of them consists, or
that the People of this National
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60702:78"/>
Church are not obliged to yield an
Obedience to 'em, I promise an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
and such as will set him off in
his own Colours and Language too;
that is, prove him an impertinent
Trifler. It's true, he seems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode
'em, because [<hi>nothing like these
are in the Writings of the Apostles, but
they are all plainly contain'd in the Books
of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and was the Substance
of their Worship:</hi>] when we make
such things the Substance of our
Worship, then let him accuse us:
<q>But as for the Necessity of finding
the particular Ceremonies in the
Writings of the Apostles, we say
there's none; it's sufficient we find
'em by a fair Consequence, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as we find an Ecclesiastical
Power commissioned to enact pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Laws for the Peace and Unity
of the Church, for the maintenance
of Decency, Order, and Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Publick Worship of God;
and as long as Ceremonies are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
with respect to the Number,
so as not to bring a Burden, and
create Distraction in the Publick
Worship of God, and with respect
to the Nature of 'em, inasmuch as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60702:78"/>
they carry a manifest Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Advancement of the
Ends of Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we say Apostolick Practice
or Tradition, and an uninterrupted
Custom of the Primitive Church, is
certainly a considerable Argument
not only of the Lawfulness, but Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of 'em, especially so as that
<hi>none shall dispute an Obedience, when
once they are enjoyn'd by our proper Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Superiours.</hi> I'm sure <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
makes this an express Rule of
Obedience in these matters, tho' this
Author, by the help of a false Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seems to insinuate the contrary:
<hi>Harum &amp; aliarum ejusmodi disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
si legem expostules Scripturarum
nullam invenies: Traditio tibi praeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur
[by way of Rule,</hi> whereas he
reads it, <hi>praetenditur] Auctrix, consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo
confirmatrix, &amp; fides observatrix,</hi>
Lib. de Coron. c. 4.</p>
            <p>But to draw towards a Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I do not now intend a formal
Vindication of Ceremonies; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I think I have offered enough to
publish the Ignorance or Impudence
of the Man; when he asserts, That
[<hi>nothing is so naturally opposite as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60702:79"/>
and Christianity,</hi> N. 95.]
What, even those that are appointed
to determine (for Decency, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity's
sake) the Natural Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Publick Worship,
such as Time, Place, and Manner?
<q>Let him make this out by dint of
Argument, and I'll engage (as was
offered before) he shall have a fair
Answer.</q> And now I have gone
thro' a tedious Harrangue, which
whether it be more made up of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
Malice, or Illogical Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
is disputable; and therefore, I
think myself happy to arrive at his
Conclusion, and more happy that I
find little in it, that either deserves,
or can justly provoke a Reply: for I
find him either bantering the World
with his own Objections, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
which if placed in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
will not weigh a Grain to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Merits of the Cause either
way, or giving 'em an account of his
next Undertakings, tho' in his last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he's so prudent to add a <hi>Reserve,</hi>
that I'm much afraid will baulk the
Expectation of the Thing; for he let's
us know, he'll take his own time for
it, as a thing not in the Command of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60702:79"/>
any Mortal; and I'm perswaded he'll
prove the Maxim by experimental
Demonstration; for, I believe, want
of Health, or Business, or something
else, will make it a good while before
he puts his finishing hand to his new
intended System of Divinity. One
or two things, however, I cannot
but remark, before I take a final leave.
And,</p>
            <p>First; After all this Argument, the
Reader may imagine that the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between us is not considerable;
for he allows, That we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to an Adequate Knowledge of
Things; and we say, That <hi>Divine
Truths</hi> are chiefly <hi>Mysterious,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>Modus</hi> of 'em; and as
it's impossible to comprehend the
<hi>Mysterious</hi> part of 'em, so we grant
it's not necessary to be known, or
comprehended: But yet for all
this, the <hi>Difference</hi> is very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for this Gentleman perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
affirms, That the <hi>Modus</hi> of all
<hi>Revealed Truths,</hi> is explicable; see
<hi>Num. 77. Sect. 3.</hi> And in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
he tells us, If his Hypothesis
stands good, [<hi>Whatever Instance can
be alledged</hi> (he means in contradiction
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60702:80"/>
to it) <hi>must either be found not</hi> Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<hi>or if it prove a</hi> Mystery, <hi>not
Divinely revealed;</hi>] so that he has
formed a most Compendious Rule
for discarding the fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Christianity, if any be
proposed, whose <hi>Modus</hi> he cannot
comprehend, and that too by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ideas, or Notions, his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
directs, That they are to be
rejected as not Divinely revealed:
Indeed, whosoever surveys his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
may at the first glance discern
this to be the Design, though he had
not blabed out the Secret in the close
of it; and certainly the Design is so
pernicious, and (tho' formed on a
weak Hypothesis) liable to influence
an unwary Reader, and cheat him
out of the main of his Creed, that I
wonder this Gentleman has escaped
so long without being chastised by
some Pen more accurate than I can
pretend to.</p>
            <p>The Second thing I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of is, The Provisions he has made
against an Answer; for he tells us,
That [<hi>no particular Instances, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of any sort, can serve for a
proper Answer to this Discourse.</hi>] This
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60702:80"/>
is pretty well truly! He has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Majesterial in advancing his own
Positions, and will he be as absolute in
prescribing to his Answerers? As if
nothing must pass for an Answer, that
is not formed by his Model, or has
not received his <hi>Imprimatur.</hi> As for
the force of Instances, it's very well
known, that an opposite Instance is
perfect Demonstration against a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory,
and universal Position in
an Adversary; and the force of Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Arguments, or Notions that
exist in Theory, or Universals, are
best illustrated and imprinted by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
I'm sure he proceeds by
these Measures in all his Reasonings,
and will he debar others of those
Priviledges he allows himself? This
is to make himself the absolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
of Reason and Argument;
as if the rest of Mankind had no
Right to use any more of either, but
what he cantons out by his own
Weights, and Measures. But he
tells us, Instances can be no Answer
to his Discourse, [<hi>As long as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of it hold good:</hi>] Very true, for
if the Reasons hold good, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60702:81"/>
alledg'd against 'em must be
impertinent, or incompetent: But
the Instances I have produced are
levell'd against his <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
too, and, I hope, they sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroy both, and then the Method
of Answering will justifie itself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his License or Approbation.</p>
            <p>In a word, as for this Answer, I
offer it to every candid impartial
Reader with Deference and Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
who, I question not, will pass
over some little Slips or Blots that
may arise thro' heat of Argument, if
the main Lines are correct and clear.
And as for this Gentleman, or his
Zealous Admirers, I tender the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
or principal Parts of it, to be
treated as he has peremptorily resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the foot of his Discourse; I
mean, <hi>give it no more Quarter than he
will to Error;</hi> but, according to his
utmost Abilities and Opportunities,
expose it in its true Colours, that he
may not be charg'd as an Accessary
against himself, in rendring his own
Labours ineffectual, by weakly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
or softening of any thing.</p>
