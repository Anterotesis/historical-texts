         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The unfound peace with <hi>Scotland</hi> being broken quickly, the next Summer produced new preparation to warre on both ſides, and upon the newes of the <hi>Scots</hi> armie advancing into <hi>England,</hi> Maſter <hi>Robert Bewick</hi> the Maior, ſent his officer into the countrey out of his juriſdiction and brought in my wife, where ſhe was ſearched, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and divers papers taken away, and a guard of about a doozen Muſquetiers ſet upon her; well, the <hi>Scots</hi> approach with their armie, and her aboad in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was ſo troubleſome on both ſides to her and our adverſaries, as 'tis hard to ſay, whethers feares were greateſt, her ſex may excuſe her flight with her children, unfit to be left amongſt ſuch monſters of men and women, as <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> now was full of all ſorts, from all quarters to fight with the <hi>Scots:</hi> Reade more of this in a little Tract I publiſhed two yeeres agoe, entituled, <hi>The Downfall of the Hierarchy.</hi> Well, being got away by water into the countrey, ſhe found cold entertainment, all being afraid of trouble by her, untill the <hi>Scots</hi> armie came neer to <hi>Newburn,</hi> and then there was flying indeed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the ſwifteſt flight was the greateſt honour to the <hi>Newcaſtilian</hi> new dubd knights, a good Boat, a paire of Oares, a good Horſe, (eſpecially that would carrie two men) was more worth then the valour or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of new knighthood.

            <p>One day as I was riding over a ſolitarie heath, in <hi>Tividale,</hi> my mind much exerciſed with muſings and meditations on the word and works of God, to ſee two neighbour nations ſo neere conjoyned in many bonds, both divine and humane, readie to claſh together, ſo neere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruing their hands in each others blood, about ſo poore a quarrell as for Biſhops and Service-book, (as was at firſt pretended; yet a deeper deſigne of <hi>Rome</hi> and all her conſederates was in it) theſe things ſtrongly poſſeſſing my troubled ſpirit, occaſioned ſome ejaculations as I fate on horſebacke, and not with drie eyes, thinking on theſe unnaturall ware between my countrie-men and the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> nation. I often prayed: Oh that we might joyne in one againſt our common enemies; Oh that we were one, I had anſwer and aſſurance from God that we ſhould be one; yee ſhall be one, yee ſhall be one, was as ſtrongly inculcated vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54018:13"/>
my ſpirit, as if it had beene ſpoken from heaven.</p>
            <p>Another time, when I was travelling from the purſuite of the Lord <hi>Traquire,</hi> towards the evening there fell a ſhowre of ſmall rame and after the raine, broke out a Rainbow, cleare and bright before me as I rode, and at laſt ſo low upon the ground about me, that I rode in the cirle of it a prettie ſpace, which occaſioned ſome thoughts within me of this as a ſigne of Gods covenant of peace and mercie towards me now in midſt of mine enemies plots and malice:</p>
            <p>And often in the company of men of ſeverall rancks and qualities, I converſed with upon ſeverall occaſions, my ſpirit being exalted above all the troubles of the world, in many high thoughts of the workes of Chriſt he is about to doe in the world in there later dayes from thoſe ſmall beginnings in <hi>Scotland;</hi> I ſpoke often to their encouragement, that it was the morning of the day of Chriſts power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110 though darke and cloudie, and full of troubles, wherein he would doe great things for his diſtreſſed Churches; and when ſome more readie to appropriate that worke of Chriſt to <hi>Scotland</hi> upon ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I uſed as frequently to interpoſe theſe anſwers that <hi>Chriſt the bright morning Star</hi> is not riſen for <hi>Scotland's</hi> cauſe alone but for his Churches full deliverance one after another; adding withall, Chriſt is firſt come to viſit you in <hi>Scotland:</hi> firſt to deliver you of all his Churches in the world, <hi>O ſtrive to give him kinde entertainment,</hi> this was my humble requeſt often to them to welcome <hi>Chriſt</hi> with a full reformation, that he might delight to dwell amongſt them.</p>
            <p>And at ſome other times, when their ſpirits were oppreſſed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties at home, and the great forces and preparations from the King, and menacings from abroad; I uſed theſe incouragements I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God; that this is the beginning of that earth-quake wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tenth part of the great Citie that is, <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland (Rome)</hi> ſhall fall, though ſhe call up her Aſtrologers and Wiſe men to take craftie counſell, as <hi>Herod</hi> did againſt the Lord Jeſus and his workings, and to trouble him in this his comming to deliver his Churches, it ſhould not be able to hinder his worke who is <hi>wonderfull in counſell, and excellent in working.</hi> And at ſome other times I ſaid. This worke in <hi>Scotland</hi> makes <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhake in Aguiſh fits fearing great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations from Chriſts working here.</p>
            <p>And when the pacification was concluded at <hi>Tweed</hi> neere <hi>Barwicke,</hi> I being then at <hi>Dunſe Law</hi> in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> army a godly Miniſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom I was familiar having often heard me ſpeake confidently of the large extent of that worke begun in <hi>Scotland,</hi> asked me in this manner, what thinke you now of this worke.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54018:13"/>
it about ſome way or other, it muſt go over your borders; Chriſt has a great people in <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of the world hee has a tender reſpect to and he will not ariſe and ſit downe againe, untill hee have delivered them as hee did his people in <hi>Egypt;</hi> their cry has helped to bring him downe from the habitation of his holineſſe, and he will hear their cry, and help them for he is mercifull.</p>

               </hi> wee ſee how often we have been upon Pacifications with the King, and none will hold; Chriſt has ſome deſigne in this worke, that every one ſees not, it would ſeeme to mee that it muſt not end in theſe three Kingdomes, if we would never ſo ſaine make a peace for our ſelves; no art of man can ſement it, if God lay no peace for <hi>England,</hi> till the power of <hi>Rome</hi> bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed.

            <p>Now having related ſome paſſages along to the Pacification, <hi>Scotland</hi> being ſeemingly ſecured a Parliament and a Nationall Aſſembly granted to ſettle and confirm all both in Religion and Liberties I have yet ſomewhat to impart both of my further troubles and of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: for in their peace my troubles broke out into a new flame and fire.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I was excluded out of that pacification, when never a man in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> but my ſelfe was exempted; and here by the way, I cannot without ingratitude (which my very nature abhorres) but give no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Saying my Lord my onely deſire is that I may be included in your peace, and be free'd from all moleſtations about your cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I may goe home in peace, as you doe. My Lord anſwered, it ſhall bee done <hi>Iohn?</hi> (making no

doubt of it) but to bee ſhort, when the Treaty was ended, this Noble Lord told me, he was ſorry for mee, hee could not procure my liberty, for that the Earl of <hi>drundale,</hi> who treated with them on the Kings part, had excepted me out of that peace, and that not only by my name, but to make ſure worke, (becauſe my eldeſt brother was then in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alſo) by this deſignation of that <hi>Fenwicke</hi> whoſe wife was with him in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and for my brother and ſome other <hi>Engliſh</hi> men that were there they might returne for <hi>England,</hi> bringing but a Certificate under my Lord <hi>Rothes</hi> hand, that they had not ſworne and ſubſcribed the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Covenant. So as I was glad to be content to wait for clearer weather for my returne.</p>
            <p>Both the Armies being now drawne out of the field, all the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a firme peace were ſuddenly blowne away, in the Kings refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall to come into <hi>Scotland</hi> to his Parliament (as in the Treaty it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if not promiſed) and ſending the Earl of <hi>Traquire</hi> as his Commſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner to ſit, both in the Church Aſſembly, and in the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Well all the time of the Aſſembly which about a month and more, I went almoſt daily to the Aſſembly, with divers Gentlemen of our. Nation that came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſee the Aſſembly and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and I ſate in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (by the favour I had) very neere the ſaid Lord <hi>Traquire,</hi> who often gave mee great lookes but never a word, he knew me well by face for I had not long before my trouble, rid poſt in his company to <hi>London</hi> (as I remember) two ſeverall times: But the Aſſembly being ended (where he ſate onely as a Church-man it ſeemes) and the Parliament begun: upon the ſecond or third day of the Parliament, he ſent for me, in the Kings name, by a Meſſenger of the Privie Counſell, in the open mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place; which meſſenger carryed me to the Kings Houſe, called <hi>Holy Roſe</hi> Houſe; accompanied with Mr. <hi>Robert Hamilton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Forthwicke,</hi> ſent by noble friends from the Parliament Houſe to ſee what ſhould become of mee; where I was welcome, and well-baited by <hi>Traquire</hi> and his Aſſociates, divers Scottiſh Earles and Lords, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court: with all revilings and reproaches of Treaſon and treachery, (the then Court language) Nay, ſaid Traquire thy Life cannot ſatisfie the wrongs thou haſt done his Majeſtie, by poſſeſſing his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with an ill opinion of his Government; and ſomenting the late diviſions and doing many ill Offices; yea that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not but he further charged me, that I had got many of his Majeſties honeſt Subjects moneyes into my hands and had bought Land in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> purpoſing to dwell there: but ſwore that <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould not ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me. To which I replyed, his Lordſhip was miſ-informed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was well knowne to divers of the beſt quality in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and ſo <hi>Traquire</hi> fell into diſcourſe with the Lord <hi>Roxborow,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dalyell,</hi> and th'other Lords: then one of the Gentlemen ſent from the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54018:14"/>
               <hi>Parliament</hi> along with mee, tells mee in the eare, that hee thought I would be ſent to priſon, which I thanke God did not daunt mee: then begun <hi>Traquire</hi> againe to aske me, what made me leave my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he was ſure I might enjoy my Religion in <hi>England,</hi> with as much libertie as in <hi>Scotland.</hi> To which I boldly anſwred, (expecting nothing but extremitie, I reſolved not to goe to priſon for nothing) that if I ſhould loſe my life for it. I muſt affirme that I could never enjoy my Religion with peace under King <hi>Charles</hi> his government. When thus the Earle of <hi>Traquire</hi> ſaw my reſolution, and conſidered how the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament tooke notice of me by ſending two Gentlemen along with me, and the people of <hi>Edenborough</hi> readie to riſe to riſcue me, he called one of the Gentlemen (Maſter <hi>Borthwick)</hi> aſide, and talked with him a prettie ſpace, after which, Maſter <hi>Borthwick</hi> returned to mee, ſaying, I have brought your releaſe for this time, but my Lord <hi>Traquire</hi> ſweares he will have about with you ere two dayes be ended, and that he would ſend poſt to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to get more matter againſt me. Now I found out the drift of this his ſending for mee by a meſſenger of the counſell, to get me out of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> downe to the Kings houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the liberties of the Citie, was to horſe mee away to <hi>Barwicke,</hi> where there were more men attending to receive me, and carry me to the King; for within three or foure daies theſe men came from <hi>Barwicke</hi> to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and to my chamber three or foure times to looke for me, and ſpoke with my wife, who perceived by their wyles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe what they were, and knew one of them to have been a ſervant to Sir <hi>Iohn Marley,</hi> my chiefe adverſarie, which men were obſerved to lurke in <hi>Edenborough</hi> about the Caſtle, then ſurrendered to the King, and Generall <hi>Ruthven</hi> and his men poſſeſſing it, but miſſing of me, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adviſed to abſent my ſelfe out of <hi>Edenborugh,</hi> from under <hi>Traquires</hi> power) they grew weary of attending, and returned for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a few dayes I returned to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> privately, where my wife <note place="margin">

When thus they found their wyles would not worke their ends, the Lord <hi>Traquire</hi> made a publike Declaration in Parliament againſt me, declaring that he had a deſigne upon me by Commiſſion from his Majeſtie; expecting, it ſeemes the Parliament ſhould deliver mee up into his hands, but that failed him too; for a noble Lord ſent me preſently notice of it, and wiſhed me to keepe out of his way, ſo I was glad to keepe more cloſe then before; yet after ſupper, being then darke, I went out to my noble friend, the Earle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> who told mee what had paſſed from <hi>Traquire</hi> that day, and that my noble friends, the Lords in Parliament, were reſolved to protect me, if I ſhould be in danger, yet rather adviſed mee to keepe me out of <hi>Traquires</hi> way, and to abſent my ſelfe out of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> inviting mee

moſt courteouſly to his houſe in <hi>Fife</hi> for my ſhelter; and withall, if any danger ſhould befall me before I could remove out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> (my wife being there, and about to returne for <hi>England,</hi> by Vertue of the late peace, and being alſo great with childe, was in a ſort neceſſitated to undergoe ſome hazard, to preſerve the priviledges that one forraigne born cannot enjoy by our laws) My noble Lord <hi>Rothes</hi> bid me cry out in his name for helpe, and he would warrant me enough to reſcue me, which was a noble courteſie in my extremitie, deſerves of mee and mine never to beforgotten.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I diſpatched my wife and eldeſt ſonne away for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> accompanying them a part of the way into <hi>Tividale,</hi> where I heard there was no ſafetie for me from <hi>Traquires</hi> ſconts; ſo I betooke mee over the cold ſnowie mountaines towards the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſea, and comming to <hi>Lanerick,</hi> a dayes journey on the weſt of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> a Gentleman of my acquaintance before in the armie, came to viſit me, aſſuring mee, that place was ſcarce ſafe for me to lodge in, becauſe of a neer dwelling enemie, Sir <hi>Iohn Deyell,</hi> who being lately come from <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> from <hi>Traquire,</hi> the Kings Commiſſioner had threatened to watch thoſe parts for me, and that hee would be glad to drive a cart to teare me in pieces, and alſo had in his hearing, declared that the Lord <hi>Traquire</hi> (thinking that hee had frighted mee out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> did ſweare that no countrey ſhould hold me long, and that there were watches for mee both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> Theſe were that Gentlemans owne words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe advice I followed, and removed thence the next morning, himſelfe accompanying me that dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſo I rode to <hi>Dwyne</hi> and <hi>Ayre</hi> upon the weſt ſea, in which parts I ſpent that Winter, untill the Lord <hi>Traquire</hi> was gone to Court, after which I ſaw him no more, for then the ill bottomed peace quickly fell to pieces, and new preparations on the Kings part and on the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> both appeared, and then againe I appeared in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where I found the Citie in great feares of being fired from the Caſtle, and many other diſtractions.</p>
            <p>Thus I continued in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> moſt part untill the time of the <hi>Scots</hi> armie comming into <hi>England,</hi> under whoſe wings and conduct I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my countrey, and to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where wee entred upon the Sabbath day (after God had ſcattered our enemies in the skirmiſh at <hi>Newburne,)</hi> whereof I have by me a briefe relation I keepe amongſt other monuments of Chriſts victories, and may have a time, if God continue life, to record them to poſteritie.

            <p>But here was not an end of my troubles, for the time I ſtayed in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> which was about three moneths and more, though under the

ſhelter of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army; my wife and ſelfe continually reviled and abuſed by the malignant people of the Town, of whom I could not get proviſions and neceſſaries for my family, for my money, without the Authority and command of the <hi>Scots,</hi> or ſeldome goe abroad without the company of ſome of the Scots Gentlemen divers of whom gave me notice, that they over-heard divers Malignant people of the Towne threaten to waſh their hands in my heart blood, and others ſaying whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peace or warre, I ſhould be ſure to be knockt on the head; ſuch was the madneſſe of the Malignants againſt me in that place; neither would any there or in the Country pay me any thing they were owing me: So about beginning of <hi>December,</hi> when I could be no longer uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the publike good, or yet to my ſelfe in my owne affaires, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his Excellence Generall <hi>Leſley,</hi> and ſuch of the Lords as were then in <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> my urgent neceſſity to repaire to <hi>London</hi> to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, for remedy of my many grievances; and there being no paſſage by land for me, but through the Kings ſouldiers, I came to <hi>London</hi> by Sea about the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> and repaired to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where I had walked but a little in the Hall, untill I was carried away by ſome friends, aſſuring me that there was no ſafety for mee to appeare ſo publike as yet, and that my adverſaries who walked in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall; as Sir <hi>Iohn Marloe,</hi> and others of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> fugitives from the <hi>Scots,</hi> would be ſure to lay hold of me, and that as yet I was not cleere of the <hi>Scots</hi> buſineſſe, for all the treaty then in agitation, ſome of my friends adviſing me to remove into <hi>Holland,</hi> untill the <hi>Scots</hi> Treaty were fully finiſhed, and an act of oblivion paſſed, till when I could not be ſecure from the danger of our Lawes, ſo that I continued privately in <hi>London</hi> about eight moneths, in ſome hazard, before the act of oblivion was paſſed; being reſolved not to goe out of the Kingdome, untill I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of my heavy loſſes and grievances, which as yet I have found no time for, though I have ſought to purchaſe it with my blood in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice of the ſtate, and ſtill am ready to wade through difficulties and hazards to procure peace and truth.

            <p>Divers other paſſages in my troubles, I doe willingly reſerve to a calmer Seaſon, becauſe as yet the times will not beare them.</p>
            <p>By theſe already mentioned it may appeare, that I have ſuffred ſomthing for God and my Country, and have borne a large ſhare in the heat of the day, even to many extremities to my ſelfe and family, without any publike ſupport in a ſincking condition to the hazard of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loſſe of my eſtate (of which I have not had the benefit of one hundred pound theſe five yeeres, compleat in <hi>December<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

itme cleare me, and make mine innocency breake out as the light, and my Judgement as the noone day.</p>
            <p>I appeale to this ungratefull and appoſtate age whether it be reaſon, that one who has borne the heate of the day for the common good of both Kingdomes, ſhould be left to ſincke under the burthens of their good. it being not for the honour of my Countrey to leave mee and mine under inſupportable burthens of worldy neceſſities and diſtreſſes, wherein I have ſpent my ſelfe, and without timely aſſiſtance, I and mine muſt neceſſarily periſh.</p>
