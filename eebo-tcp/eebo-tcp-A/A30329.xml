            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I thank you for the <hi>two Royal Papers,</hi> that you have sent me: I had heard of them before, but now we have them so well attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there is no hazard of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a false Copy: you expect that in return, I should let you know, what Impression they have made upon me. I pay all the reverence that is due to a <hi>Crown'd Head,</hi> even in Ashes; to which I will never be wanting: far less am I capable of suspecting the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Attestation that accompanies them</hi>; of the truth of which I take it for granted no man doubts; but I must crave leave to tell you, that I am confident, the <hi>late King</hi> only <hi>copied them,</hi> and that they are not of <hi>his</hi> composing: for as they have nothing of that <hi>free Air,</hi> with which he expressed himself; so there is a Contexture in them, that does not look like a <hi>Prince</hi>; and the beginning of the <hi>first</hi> shewes it was the effect of a <hi>Conversation,</hi> and was to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to another: so that I am apt to think they were composed by another, and were so well relished by the <hi>late King,</hi> that he thought fit to keep them, in order to his examining them more particularly: and that he was prevailed with <hi>to Copy them,</hi> lest a Paper of that nature might have been made a crime, if it had been found about him writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by another hand: and I could name <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Persons,</hi> who as they were able enough to compose such <hi>Papers,</hi> so had power enough over his Spirit to engage him to Copy them, and to put themselves out of danger by restoring <hi>the Original.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ought to address your self to the <hi>learned Divines</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> for an <hi>answer</hi> to such things in them as pussle you, and not to <hi>one</hi> that has not the honour to be of that <hi>Body</hi>; and that has now carried a Sword for some time, and imploys the leasure that at any time he enjoyes, rather in <hi>Philosophical</hi> and <hi>Mathematical Enquiries,</hi> than in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Controversy.</hi> There is indeed one Consideration that determined me more easily to comply with your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which is, my having had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>discourse</hi> copiously of those matters with the <hi>late King</hi> himself: and he having proposed to me some of the <hi>particulars</hi> that I find in those <hi>Papers,</hi> &amp; I having said several things to him, in answer to those <hi>Heads,</hi> which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to me only as <hi>Objections,</hi> with which he seemed fully satisfied, I am the more willing to communicate to you, <hi>that</hi> which I took the liberty to lay before his <hi>late Majesty</hi> on several occasions: the particulars on which he insisted in discourse with me, were the <hi>uselesness of a Law without a Judge, and the neecssity of an infallible Tribunal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Controversies</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which he added, <hi>the many Sects that were in</hi> England, <hi>which seemed to be a necessary consequence of the Liberty that every one took to interpret the Scriptures: and he often repeated that of the</hi> Church of Englands <hi>arguing, from the obligation to obey the Church, against the Sectaries, which he thought was of no force, unless they allowed more Authority to the Church than they seemed willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in their Disputes with the Church of</hi> Rome. But upon this whole Matter I will offer you some <hi>Reflections,</hi> that will, I hope, be of as great weight with you, as they are with my self.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. All <hi>Arguments</hi> that prove upon such general Considerations, that there ought to be an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi>


                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66365:3"/>
named by <hi>Christ,</hi> and clothed with his <hi>Authority,</hi> signify nothing, unless it can be shewed us, in what <hi>Texts of Scripture</hi> that nomination is to be found; and till that is shewed, they are only <hi>Arguments</hi> brought to prove that <hi>Christ ought to have done somewhat that he has not done.</hi> So these are in effect so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Arguments</hi> against <hi>Christ,</hi> unless it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he has authorised such a <hi>Iudge:</hi> therefore the right way to end this dispute, is, to shew where such a <hi>Constitution</hi> is authorised: So that the most that can be made of this is, that it amounts to a <hi>favorable presumption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is a very unreasonable thing for us to form <hi>Presumptions,</hi> of what <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>ought to be,</hi> from Inconveniences that do arise, in case that such things are not: for we may carry this so far, that it will not be easie to stop it. It seems more sutable to the infinite Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> to communicate the knowledge of himself to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to furnish every Man with such assistances as will certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over him. It seems also reasonable to think, that so perfect a Saviour as <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was, should have shewed us a <hi>certain Way,</hi> and yet consistent with the <hi>free Use of our Faculties,</hi> of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>sin:</hi> nor is it very easy to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that it should be a reproach on his <hi>Gospel,</hi> if there is not an <hi>Infallible Preservative</hi> against <hi>Errour,</hi> when it is acknowledged, that there is <hi>no infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preservative against Sin</hi>: for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the one Damns us more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,</hi> than the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Since <hi>Presumptions</hi> are so much insisted on, to prove what things must be appointed by <hi>Christ</hi>; it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that it is also a reasonable <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> that if such a <hi>Court</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, it must be done in such plain terms that there can be no room to question the meaning of them: and since this is the hinge upon which all other matters turn, it ought to be expressed so particularly, in <hi>whom</hi> it is vested, that there should be no occasion given to dispute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is in <hi>One Man</hi> or in <hi>A Body</hi>; and if in a Body, whether in the Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in the two thirds, or in the whole Body unanimously agreeing: in short, the Chief thing in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments being the Nature and Power of the Judges, those are always distinctly specified; and therefore if these things are not specified in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; it is at least a strong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, <hi>that</hi> Christ <hi>did not intend to authorise such</hi> Judges.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. There were several Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies raised among the <hi>Churches</hi> to which the <hi>Apostles</hi> writ, as appears by the Epistles to the <hi>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians</hi> and <hi>Colossians,</hi> yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> never make use of those passages that are pretended for this Authority to put an end to those Controversies; which is a shrewd Presumption, that they did not understand them in that sense in which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> does now take them. Nor does St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the directions that he gives to <hi>Church-men</hi> in his Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> reckon this of <hi>submitting to the directions of the Church</hi> for one, which he could not have omitted, if this be the true meaning of those disputed passages: and yet he has not one word sounding that way, which is very different from the directions which one possessed with the present, view that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has of this matter must needs have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. There are some things very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly taught in the <hi>N. Testament,</hi> such as the <hi>rules of a Good Life,</hi> the <hi>Use of the Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>addressing our selves to God for Mercy and Grace,</hi> thro the Sacrifice that Christ offered for us on the Cross, and the Worshipping him as <hi>God,</hi> the Death, Resurrection and Ascension of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Bodies and Life Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting: by which it is apparent, that


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66365:3"/>
we are set beyond doubt in those matters; if then there are other passages more obscure concerning other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we must Conclude, that these are not of that Consequence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would have been as plainly revealed as the others are; but above all, if the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi> is delivered to us in <hi>disputable terms,</hi> that is a just prejudice against it, since it is a thing of such Consequence, that it ought to have been revealed in a way so very clear and past all dispute.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. If it is a presumption for <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons</hi> to judge concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> which must be still referred to the <hi>Priests</hi> &amp; other Guides in sacred matters; this is a good Argument to oblige all <hi>Nations</hi> to continue in the <hi>Established Religion,</hi> whatever it may happen to be; and above all others, it was a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Argument in the mouths of the <hi>Jewes</hi> against our <hi>Saviour.</hi> He pretended to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and proved it both by the <hi>prophesies</hi> that were accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in him, and by the <hi>Miracles</hi> that he wrought: as for the <hi>Prophesies,</hi> the Reasons urged by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will conclude much stronger, that such dark Passages as those of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were, ought not to be interpreted by <hi>Particular persons,</hi> but that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these must be referred to the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly provided in their law (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8.) <hi>That when controversies arose, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any cause that was too intricate, they were to go to the place which God should choose, and to the Priests of the tribe of Levi, &amp; to the judge in those daies, &amp; that they were to declare what was right, &amp; to their decision all were obliged to submit, under pain of death</hi>: so that by this it appears, that the <hi>Priests</hi> in the <hi>Jewish Religion</hi> were authorised in so extraordinary a manner, that I dare say the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not wish for a more formal testimony on her behalf: As for our <hi>Saviours Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> these were not sufficient neither, unless his <hi>doctrine</hi> was first found to be good: since <hi>Moses</hi> had expresly warned the people (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.) <hi>That if a Prophet came and taught them to follow after other Gods, they were not to obey him, tho he wrought miracles to prove his Mission, but were to put him to death:</hi> So a <hi>Jew</hi> saying, that <hi>Christ,</hi> by making himself one with his father, brought in the wors<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

A <hi>Second</hi> view of <hi>Religion,</hi> is as it is a <hi>Body</hi> united together, &amp; by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence brought under some regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and as in all <hi>States,</hi> there are subalterne <hi>Iudges,</hi> in whose decisions all must at least acquiesce, tho they are not <hi>infallible,</hi> there being still a sort of an appeal to be made to the <hi>soveraigne</hi> or the supream legsliative Body; so the <hi>Church</hi> has a Subalterne <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>: but as the Authority of Inferiour Judges is still regulated, and none but the Legislators themselves have an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority equal to the Law; So it is not necessary for the preservation of Peace and Order, that the <hi>Decisions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> should be <hi>infallible,</hi> or of equal <hi>Authority</hi> with the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> If Judges do so manifestly abuse their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they fall into Rebellion and Treason, the subjects are no more bound to consider them; but are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to resist them, and to maintain their obedience to their Soveraign; tho' in other matters their Judgment must take place, till they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed by the Soveraign. The case of <hi>Religion</hi> being then this, <hi>That Jesus Christ is the Soveraign of the Church</hi>; the Assembly of the <hi>Pastors</hi> is only a subalterne <hi>Iudge</hi>: if they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly oppose themselves to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which is the <hi>Law of Christians,</hi> particular persons may be supposed as competent <hi>Iudges</hi> of that, as in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Matters they may be of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and in that case they are bound still to mantain their Obedience to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> In matters <hi>Indifferent,</hi> Christians are bound, for the Preservation of Peace and Unity, to acquiesce in the Decisions of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in matters justly doubtful,

If the <hi>Church</hi> did use this Authority with due Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the People followed the rules that I have named with humility and modesty, there would be no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of many Divisions; but this is the great Secret of the Providence of God, that men are still men, and both <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> mix their Passions and Interests so with matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> that as there is a great deal of Sin and Vice still in the World, so that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Matters of <hi>Religion</hi> as well as in other things: but the ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this, tho they are bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet are not equal to the Effects that Ignorant Superstition, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient zeal have produced in the World, Witness the Rebellions and <hi>Wars</hi> for establishing the <hi>Worship of Images</hi>; the <hi>Croissades</hi> against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> in which many Millions were lost; those against <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> deposed by <hi>Popes,</hi> which lasted for some Ages; and the <hi>Massacre</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Butcheries of the <hi>Duke of Alva</hi> in the last Age, and that of <hi>Ireland</hi> in this: which are, I suppose, far greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs than any that can be imagined to arise out of a <hi>Small Diversity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:</hi> and the present State of this <hi>Church,</hi> notwithstanding all those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Rents</hi> that are in it, is a much more desirable thing, than the <hi>gross Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>blind Superstition</hi> that reigns in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at this day.</p>

A <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning the <hi>Use of the Sacraments</hi> being a visible thing, is more likely to be exact, than a Speculation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their nature; and yet we find a <hi>Tradition</hi> of giving <hi>Infants</hi> the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> grounded on the indispensible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Sacrament, continued a thousand <hi>Years</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> A <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on which the <hi>Christians</hi> founded their <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> is less like to be changed, than a more remote Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and yet the first Writers of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> had a <hi>Tradition</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to them by those who saw the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of the <hi>Reign of Christ for a thousand Years upon Earth</hi>; and if those who had Matters at second hand from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> could be thus mistaken, it is more reasonable to apprehend grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter errours at such a distance. A <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> concerning the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> is more like to be exact, than the Exposition of some passages in it; and yet we find the <hi>Church</hi> did unanimously believe the <hi>Translation</hi> of the 70. <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> to have been the effect of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Inspiration, till St. <hi>Ierome</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this Matter better, and made a <hi>New Translation</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. But which is more then all the rest, It seems plain, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the <hi>Council of Nice</hi> believed the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> to be in some sort <hi>Inferiour</hi> to that of the <hi>Father,</hi> and for some Ages after the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> they believed them indeed both equal, but they considered these as two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Beings, and only one in <hi>Essence,</hi> as, three men have the same humane Nature in common among them; and that as one Candle lights another, so the one flowed from another; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>fifth Century</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>one Individual Essence</hi> was received. If you will be farther informed concerning this, <hi>Father Petau</hi> will satisfy you as to the first Period before the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> and the learned Dr. <hi>Cudmorth</hi> as to the second. In all which particulars it appears, how variable a thing <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is.

If then the <hi>Authority</hi> that must decide <hi>Controversies,</hi> lies in the Body of the <hi>Pastors</hi> scattered over the World, which is the last retrenchment, here as many and as great Scruples will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, as we found in any of the former Heads. Two difficulties appear at first view, the one is, <hi>How can we be assured that the present</hi> Pastors <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>are derived in a just Succession from the</hi> Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: there are no <hi>Registers</hi> extant that prove this: So that we have nothing for it but some <hi>Histories,</hi> that are so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly writ, that we find many mistakes in them in other Matters; and they are so different in the very first links of that Chain, that immediatly succeeded the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that the utmost can be made of this is, that here is a Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Relation</hi> somewhat doubtful; but here is nothing to found our Faith on: so that if a Succession from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, is necessary to the Constitution of that <hi>Church,</hi> to which we must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves, we know not where to find it: besides that, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the necessity of the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> to the <hi>Validity</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> throws us into inextricable difficulties. I know they generally say, that by the <hi>Intention</hi> they do not mean the <hi>inward</hi> Acts of the Minister of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but only that it must appear by his <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> deportment, that he is in earnest going about a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and not doing a thing in jest; and this appeared so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to me, that I was sorry to find our <hi>Divines</hi> urge it too much: till turning over the <hi>Rubricks</hi> that are at the beginning of the <hi>Missal,</hi> I found upon the head of the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that if a <hi>Priest</hi> has a Number of <hi>Hoslies</hi> before him to be consecrated, and intends to consecrate them all, except one, in that case that Vagrant exception falls upon them all: it not being affixed to any one, and it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined that he consecrates none at all. Here it is plain, that the secret <hi>Acts</hi> of a <hi>Priest</hi> can defeat the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that this overthrows all certainty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Succession</hi>: But besides all this, we are sure, that the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> have a much more uncontested <hi>Succession</hi> than the <hi>Latines</hi>: So that a <hi>Succession</hi> cannot direct us. And if it is necessary to seek out the Doctrines that are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received, this is not possible for a private Man to know. So that in Ignorant Countries, where there is little Study, the People have no other certainty concerning their <hi>Religion,</hi> but what they take from their <hi>Curate</hi> and <hi>Confessor</hi>: since they cannot examine what is generally received. So that it must be confessed that all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are brought for the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a constant <hi>infallible Iudge,</hi> turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all those of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that do not acknowledge the <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi>: for if he is not <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> they have no other <hi>Iudge,</hi> that can pretend to it. It were also easy to shew, that some <hi>Doctrines</hi> have been as Universally received in some <hi>Ages,</hi> as they have been rejected in others <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> which shews, that the Doctrine of the present <hi>Church</hi> is not alwayes a sure measure. For five <hi>Ages</hi> together, the Doctrine of the <hi>Popes</hi> Power to <hi>depose Heretical Princes</hi> was received without the least Opposition: and this cannot be doubted by any that knows what has been the State of the <hi>Church</hi> since the End of the eleventh <hi>Century:</hi> &amp; yet I believe, few <hi>Princes</hi> would allow this, notwithstanding all the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Authority of so many Ages to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it. I could carry this into a great many other Instances, but I single out this, because it is a point in which <hi>Princes</hi> are naturally extream sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole Matter, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into my mind, that God, who has made Man a Creature, that naturally enquires and reasons, and that feels as sensible a pleasure when

he can give himself a good account of his actions, as one that sees, does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in comparison to a blind man that is led about; and that this God, that has also made <hi>Religion</hi> on design to perfect this humane Nature, and to raise it to the utmost height to which it can arrive, has contrived it to be dark, and to be so much beyond the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faculties, that we cannot find out his mind in those things that are necessary for our Salvation: and that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that were writ by plain men, in a very familiar stile, and addrest without any discrimination to the Vulgar, should become such an unintelligible Book in these Ages, that we must have an <hi>Infallible Iudge</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it: and when I see not only <hi>Popes,</hi> but even some Bodies that pass for <hi>General Councils,</hi> have so expounded many passages of it, and have wrested them so visibly, that none of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> pretend to excuse it, I say I must freely own to you, that when I find I need a <hi>Commentary</hi> on dark passages, these will be the last persons to whom I will address my self for it. Thus you see how fully I have opened my mind to you in this matter; I have gone over a great deal of ground in as few Words as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because hints I know are enough for you; I thank God, these Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations do fully satisfy me, and I will be infinitely joyed, if they have the same effect on you.</p>

                  <head>REASONS against the Repealing the <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> concerning the TEST. Humbly offered to the consideration of the <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>both Houses,</hi> at their next Meeting on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1687.</head>
                  <p n="1">I <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the just apprehensions of the <hi>Danger of Popery</hi> gave the Birth to the <hi>two Laws</hi> for the <hi>two Tests,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> with relation to all <hi>publick Emploiments</hi> in 73. and the <hi>other</hi> with relation to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of our <hi>Parliaments</hi> for the future in 78. the present time and conjuncture does not seem so proper for repealing them; unless it can be imagined, that the <hi>danger of Popery</hi> is now so much less than it was formerly, that we need be no more on our guard against it. We had a <hi>King,</hi> when these <hi>Laws</hi> were enacted, who as he declared himself to be of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> by receiving the <hi>Sacrament</hi> four times a <hi>year</hi> in it, so in all his <hi>Speeches</hi> to his <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and in all his <hi>Declarations</hi> to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> he repeated the assurances of his firmness to the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> so solemnly and frequently, that if the saying a thing often gives just reason to believe it, we had as much reason as ever People had to depend upon him: and yet for all that, it was thought necessary to fortify those assurances with <hi>Laws:</hi> and it is not easy to imagin, why we should throw away those, when we have a <hi>Prince</hi> that is not only of another <hi>Religion</hi> himself, but that has expressed so much <hi>steadiness</hi> in it, and so much <hi>zeal</hi> for it, that one would think we should rather now seek a further <hi>security,</hi> than throw away that which we already have.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Our King</hi> has given such Testimonies of his <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Religion,</hi> that we see among all his other Royal Qualities, there is none for which he desires and deserves to be so much admired. Since even the passion of <hi>Glory,</hi> of making himself the terrour of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> (which as it is natural to all <hi>Princes,</hi> so must it be most particularly so to one of his Martial and Noble Temper) yields to his <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Church</hi>; and that he, in whom we might have hoped to see our <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> or our <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th revived, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses rather to merit the heightning his degree of <hi>Glory</hi> in another World, than to acquire all the Lawrels and Conquests that this low and vile World can give him: and that, instead of making himself a terrour to all his Neighbours, he is contented with the <hi>humble Glory</hi> of being a terrour to his own <hi>People</hi>; so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the great <hi>Figure,</hi> which this <hi>Reign</hi> might make in the <hi>World,</hi> all the <hi>news</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is now only concerning the practises on some fearful <hi>Mercenaries.</hi>


                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66365:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
These things shew, that His Majesty is so possessed with his <hi>Religion,</hi> that this cannot suffer us to think, that there is at present no danger from <hi>Popery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. It does not appear, by what we see, either <hi>abroad</hi> or at <hi>home,</hi> that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> has so changed its nature, that we have less reason to be afraid of it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, than we had in former times. It might be thought ill nature to go so far back, as to the <hi>Councils of the Lateran,</hi> that decreed <hi>the extirpation of Hereticks,</hi> with severe Sanctions on those <hi>Princes</hi> that failed in their Duty, of being the <hi>Hangmen of the Inquisitors</hi>; or to the <hi>Council of Constance,</hi> that decreed, that <hi>Princes were not bound to keep their faith to Hereticks</hi>; thô it must be acknowledged, that we have extraordinary <hi>Memories</hi> if we can forget such things, and more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Understandings</hi> if we do not make some inferences from them. I will not stand upon such inconsiderable Trifles as the <hi>Gunpowder Plot,</hi> or the <hi>Massacre of Ireland</hi>; but I will take the liberty to reflect a little on what <hi>that Church</hi> has done since those <hi>Laws</hi> were made, to give us kinder and softer thoughts of them, and to make us the less apprehensive of them. VVe see before our eyes what they have done, and are still doing in <hi>France</hi>; and what feeble things <hi>Edicts, Coronation Oaths, Laws</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> repeated over and over again, prove to be, where that <hi>Religion</hi> prevails; and <hi>Louis le Grand</hi> makes not so contemptible a Figure in that <hi>Church,</hi> or in <hi>our Court,</hi> as to make us think, that <hi>his example</hi> may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as a <hi>Pattern,</hi> as well as his <hi>aid</hi> may be offered for an encouragement, to act the same things in <hi>England,</hi> that he is now doing with so much applause in <hi>France</hi>: and it may be perhaps the rather desired from hence to put him a little in countenance, when so great a <hi>King</hi> as ours is willing to forget himself so far as to copy after him, and to depend upon him: so that as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> must be still the same in all Ages and Places, since its chief pretension is, that it is <hi>infallible,</hi> it is no unreasonable thing for us to be afraid of those, who will be easily induced to <hi>burn</hi> us a little here, when they are told, that such fervent <hi>zeal</hi> will save them a more lasting <hi>burning</hi> hereafter, and will perhaps quit all scores so entirely, that they may hope scarce to endure a <hi>Singing in Purgatory</hi> for all their other Sins.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If the severest <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that has breathed out nothing but <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> since its first formation, and that is even decryed at <hi>Rome</hi> it self for its Violence, is in such credit here; I do not see any enducement from thence to persuade us to look on the <hi>Councils</hi> that are directed by that <hi>Society,</hi> as such harmless and inoffensive things, that we need be no more on our guard against them. I know not why we may not apprehend as much from <hi>Father Petre,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> have felt from <hi>Pere de la Chaise,</hi> since all the difference that is observed to be between them, <hi>is,</hi> that the <hi>English Jesuite</hi> has much more <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> and much less <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> has. And when <hi>Rome</hi> has expressed so great a Jealousy of the <hi>Interest</hi> that that <hi>Order</hi> had in our <hi>Councils,</hi> that <hi>F. Morgan,</hi> who was thought to influence our <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> I do not see why <hi>England</hi> should look so tamely on them. No reason can be given why <hi>Card. Howard</hi> should be shut out of all their <hi>Councils,</hi> unless it be, that the <hi>Nobleness</hi> of his Birth, and the <hi>Gentleness</hi> of his Temper,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66365:8"/>
are too hard even for his <hi>Religion</hi> and his <hi>Purple,</hi> to be mastered by them. And it is a Contradiction, that nothing but a Belief capable of receiving <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> can reconcile, to see Men pretend to observe <hi>Law,</hi> and yet to find at the same time an <hi>Ambassadour</hi> from <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> when there are so many <hi>Laws</hi> in our <hi>Book of Statutes,</hi> never yet repealed, that have declared over and over again all Commerce with the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>high Treason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. The late famous <hi>Judgment</hi> of our <hi>Judges,</hi> who knowing no other way to make their <hi>Names</hi> immortal, have found an effectual one to preserve them from being ever forgot, seems to call for another Method of Proceeding. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> they have set must be fatal either to <hi>them</hi> or <hi>us.</hi> For if 12 <hi>Men,</hi> that get into <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>Furrs,</hi> have an <hi>Authority</hi> to dissolve all our <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is to be hereafter lookt at with as much scorn, as it has hitherto drawn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. That doubtful VVords of <hi>Laws,</hi> made so long ago, that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lawgivers</hi> is not certainly known, must be expounded by the <hi>Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> is not to be questioned: but to infer from thence, that the plain VVords of a <hi>Law,</hi> so lately made, and that was so vigorously asserted by the <hi>present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> may be made <hi>void</hi> by a Decision of theirs, after so much Practice upon them, is just as reasonable a way of arguing, as theirs is, who because the <hi>Church of England</hi> acknowledges, that the <hi>Church</hi> has a Power in <hi>Matters of Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> will from thence conclude, that this Power must go so far, that thô Christ has said of the Cup, <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> we must obey the <hi>Church</hi> when she decrees, that we shall not drink of it. <hi>Our Judges,</hi> for the greater part, were <hi>Men</hi> that had past their Lives in so much <hi>Retirement,</hi> that from thence one might have hoped, that they had studied our <hi>Law</hi> well, since the <hi>Bar</hi> had called them so seldom from their <hi>Studies</hi>: and if <hi>Practice</hi> is thought often hurtful to specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that which disorders and hurries the Judgment, they who had <hi>practised</hi> so little in our <hi>Law,</hi> had no byass on their Understandings: and if the habit of taking <hi>Money</hi> as a <hi>Lawyer</hi> is a dangerous preparation for one that is to be an <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judge,</hi> they should have been <hi>incorruptible,</hi> since it is not thought, that the greater part of them got ever so much <hi>Money</hi> by their <hi>Profession,</hi> as pay'd for their <hi>Furrs.</hi> In short, we now see how they have <hi>merited</hi> their <hi>Preferment,</hi> and they may yet expect a further <hi>Exaltation,</hi> when the Justice and the <hi>Laws of England</hi> come to be in hands, that will be as careful to preserve them, as <hi>they</hi> have been to destroy them. But what an Infamy will it lay upon the Name of an <hi>English Parliament,</hi> if instead of calling those <hi>Betrayers of their Countrey</hi> to an account, they should go by an after-game to confirm what these <hi>Fellows</hi> have done.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The late <hi>Conferences</hi> with so many <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>both Houses,</hi> will give such an ill-natured piece of Jealousy against them, that of all Persons living, that are the most concern'd to take care how they give their <hi>Votes,</hi> the VVorld will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Threatnings</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> had as large a share in those <hi>secret Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as Reasoning or Persuasion: and it must be a more than ordinary degree of Zeal and Courage in them, that must take off the Blot, of being <hi>sent for,</hi> and <hi>spoke to,</hi> on such a subject and in such a manner. The worthy Behaviour of the <hi>Members</hi> in the <hi>last Session,</hi> had made the <hi>Nation</hi> unwilling to remember the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66365:9"/>
committed in the <hi>first Election</hi>: and it is to be hoped, that they will not give any cause for the future to call that to mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if a <hi>Parliament,</hi> that had so many Flaws in its first Conception, goes to repeal <hi>Laws,</hi> that we are sure were made by <hi>Legal Parliaments,</hi> it will put the <hi>Nation</hi> on an Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that nothing but necessity will drive them to. For a <hi>Nation</hi> may be laid asleep, and be a little cheated; but when it is awakned, and sees its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it will not look on and see a <hi>Rape</hi> made on its <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> without examining, <hi>from whence have these Men this Authority</hi>? they will hardly find that it is <hi>of Men</hi>; and they will not believe that it is <hi>of God.</hi> But it is to be hoped, that there will be no occasion given for this angry question which is much easier made than answered.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. If all that were now asked in favour of <hi>Popery,</hi> were only some Gentleness towards the <hi>Papists</hi>; there were some reason to entertain the <hi>Debate,</hi> when the Demand were a little more modest: If Men were to be attainted of <hi>Treason,</hi> for being <hi>reconciled</hi> to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling</hi> others to it; if <hi>Priests</hi> were demanded to be <hi>hanged,</hi> for taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; and if the <hi>two thirds</hi> of the <hi>Papists Estates</hi> were offered to be <hi>levied,</hi> it were a very natural thing to see them uneasy and restless: but now the matter is more barefaced; they are not contented to live at ease, and enjoy their <hi>Estates</hi>; but they must carry all before them: and <hi>F. Petre</hi> cannot be at quiet, unless he makes as great a <hi>Figure</hi> in <hi>our Court,</hi> as <hi>Pere de la Chaise</hi> does at <hi>Versailles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Cessation of all Severities against them, is that to which the <hi>Nation</hi> would more easily submit; but it is their <hi>Behaviour</hi> that must create them the continuance of the like Compassion in another <hi>Reign.</hi> If a restless and a persecuting <hi>Spirit</hi> were not inherent in that <hi>Order,</hi> that has now the <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> they would have behaved themselves so decently under their present Advantages, as to have made <hi>our Divines,</hi> that have charged them so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, look a little out of countenance: and this would have wrought more on the good Nature of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Princely Nobleness</hi> of the <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> whom we have in <hi>view,</hi> than those <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> to which we see their Tempers carry them even so early, before it is yet time to show themselves. The Temper of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> the Heroïcal Vertues of <hi>those</hi> whom we have in our Eyes, but above all, our most <hi>holy Religion,</hi> which instead of Revenge and Cruelty, inspires us with Charity and Mercy, even for Enemies, are all such things, as may take from the Gentlemen of that <hi>Religion</hi> all sad apprehensions, unless they raise a Storm against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and provoke the <hi>Iustice of the Nation</hi> to such a degree, that the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors</hi> may find it necessary to be <hi>just,</hi> even when their own Inclinations would rather carry them to <hi>shew Mercy.</hi> In short, they need fear nothing but what they create to themselves: so that all this stir that they keep for their own <hi>Safety,</hi> looks too like the securing to themselves <hi>Pardons</hi> for the <hi>Crimes</hi> that they intend to commit.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66365:9"/>VIII. I know it is objected as no small prejudice against these <hi>Laws,</hi> that the very making of them discovered a particular Malignity against <hi>His Majesty,</hi> and therefore it is <hi>ill Manners</hi> to speak for them. The <hi>first</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps an Eye at his being then <hi>Admiral</hi>: and the <hi>last</hi> was possibly levelled at him: thô when that was discovered, he was excepted out of it by a special <hi>Proviso.</hi> And as for that which past in 73, I hope it is not forgot, that it was enacted by that <hi>Loyal Parliament,</hi> that had setled both the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Crown and the Rites of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that had given the <hi>King</hi> more <hi>Money</hi> than all the <hi>Parliaments of England</hi> had ever done in all former Times. <hi>A Parliament</hi> that had indeed some Disputes with the <hi>King,</hi> but upon the first step that he made with relation to <hi>Religion</hi> or Safety, they shewed how ready they were to forget all that was past: as appeared by their Behaviour after the <hi>Triple Alliance.</hi> And in 73, thô they had great cause given them to dislike the <hi>Dutch war,</hi> especially the strange beginning of it upon the <hi>Smir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Fleet</hi>: and the <hi>stopping</hi> the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> the <hi>Declaration</hi> for <hi>Toleration,</hi> and the <hi>writs</hi> for the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> were Matters of hard Diges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet no sooner did the <hi>King</hi> give them this new Assurance for their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> then, thô they had very great Reasons given them to be jealous of the <hi>war,</hi> yet since the <hi>King</hi> was engaged, they gave him 1200000 <hi>Pounds</hi> for carrying it on; and they thought they had no ill Penniworths for their <hi>Money,</hi> when they carried home with them to their <hi>Countreys</hi> this new <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> which we are desired now to throw up, and which the Reverend <hi>Iudges</hi> have already thrown out, as a <hi>Law</hi> out of date. If this had carried in it any new piece of <hi>Severity,</hi> their Complaints might be just; but they are extream tender, if they are so uneasy under a <hi>Law</hi> that only gives them Leisure and Opportunities to live at home. And the last <hi>Test,</hi> which was intended only for shutting them out from a share in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Body,</hi> appears to be so just, that one is rather amased to find that it was so long a <hi>doing,</hi> than that it was <hi>done</hi> at last: and since it is <hi>done,</hi> it is a great presumption on our Understandings to think, that we should be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with it. If it was not sooner done, it was because there was not such cause given for Jealousy to work upon: but what has appeared since that time, and what has been <hi>printed</hi> in his <hi>late Majesties</hi> name, shews the World now, that the <hi>Iealousies</hi> which occasioned those <hi>Laws,</hi> were not so ill grounded, as some well meaning Men perhaps then believed them to be. But there are some times in which all Mens Eyes come to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. I am told, some think it is very indecent to have a <hi>Test</hi> for our <hi>Parliaments,</hi> in which the <hi>King's Religion</hi> is accused of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; but if this reason is good in this particular, it will be full as good against several of the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and many of the <hi>Homilies.</hi> If the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> is so formed by


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66365:10"/>
                     <hi>Law,</hi> that the <hi>King's Religion</hi> is declared over and over again to be <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> what help is there for it? It is no other, than it was when His Majesty was Crowned, and <hi>Swore</hi> to maintain our <hi>Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope none will be wanting in all possible respect to his sacred Person; and as we ought to be infinitly sorry to find him engaged in a <hi>Religion,</hi> which we must believe <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> so we are far from the ill manners of reflecting on his Person, or calling him an <hi>Idolater</hi>: for as every Man that reports a Lye, is not for that to be called a Lyar; so thô the ordering the Intention, and the prejudice of a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persuasion are such abatements, that we will not rashly take on us to call every Man of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> an <hi>Idolater</hi>; yet on the other hand, we can never lay down our Charge against the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> unless at the same time we part with our <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">X. Others give us a strange sort of <hi>Argument,</hi> to perswade us to part with the <hi>Test</hi>; they say, <hi>the King must imploy his Popish Subjects, for he can trust no other; and he is so assured of their Fidelity to him, that we need apprehend no Danger from them.</hi> This is an odd Method to work on us, to let in a sort of People to the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> since the <hi>King</hi> cannot trust <hi>us,</hi> but will depend on <hi>them:</hi> so that as soon as this <hi>Law</hi> is repealed, they must have all the Imployments, and have the whole power of the <hi>Nation</hi> lodged in their <hi>hands</hi>; this seems a little too gross to impose, even on <hi>Irishmen.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> saw for many Years together, with how much Zeal both the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and many of the <hi>Gentry</hi> appeared for his Interests; and if there is now a Melancholy Damp on their Spirits, the <hi>King</hi> can dissipate it when he will; and as <hi>the Church of England</hi> is a Body that will never <hi>rebel</hi> against him, so any Sullenness, under which the late Administration of Affairs has brought them, would soon vanish, if the <hi>King</hi> would be pleas'd to remember a little what he has so often <hi>promised,</hi> not only in <hi>Publick</hi> but in <hi>Private</hi>; and would be contented with the Excercise of his own <hi>Religion,</hi> without imbroiling his whole Affairs, because <hi>F. Petre</hi> will have it so: and it tempts Englishmen to more than ordinary degrees of <hi>Rage,</hi> against a sort of <hi>Men,</hi> who it seems, can infuse in a <hi>Prince,</hi> born with the highest sense of Honour possible, Projects, to which without doing some Violence to his own Royal Nature, he could not so much as hearken to, if his <hi>Religion</hi> did not so fatally mufle him up in a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But if we are so unhappy, that <hi>Priests</hi> can so disguise Matters, as to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead a <hi>Prince,</hi> who without their ill Influences would be the most <hi>Glorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and would soon reduce the <hi>Grand Louis</hi> to a much humbler <hi>figure</hi>; yet it is not to be so much as imagined, that ever their Arts can be so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily successful, as to impose on an <hi>English Parliament,</hi> composed of <hi>Protestant Members.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">I. THe Preamble of a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> is oft writ in hast, and is the flourish of some wanton Pen: but one of such an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nature as <hi>this is,</hi> was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more severely examined; there is a new designation of his <hi>Majesties Authority</hi> here set forth of his <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> which is so often repeated, that it deserves to be a little searched into. <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Authority,</hi> are Termes already received and known; but for this <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> as it is a new Term, so those who have coined it, may make it signify what they will. The <hi>Roman Law</hi> speaks of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps Legibus solutus,</hi> and <hi>Absolute</hi> in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural signification, importing the being without all Ties and Restraints; then the true meaning of this seems to be, that there is an <hi>Inherent Power</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> which can neither be restrained by <hi>Lawes, Promises,</hi> nor <hi>Oaths</hi>; for nothing less than the being <hi>free</hi> from all these, renders a <hi>Power Absolute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. If the former Term seemed to stretch our Allegeance, that which comes after it, is yet a step of another nature, tho one can hardly imagine what can go beyond <hi>Absolute Power</hi>; and it is in these Words, <hi>Which all our Subjects are to obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserve.</hi> And this is the carrying obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many sises beyond what the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> has ever yet claimed: For all <hi>Princes,</hi> even the most Violent pretenders to <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> till <hi>Lewis the Great's</hi> time, have thought it enough to oblige their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> to submit to their <hi>Power,</hi> and to bear whatsoever they thought good to impose upon them; but till the Days of the late <hi>Conversions</hi> by the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> it was never so much as pretended, that <hi>Subjects</hi> were bound <hi>to obey their Prince without Reserve,</hi> and to be of his <hi>Religion,</hi> because he would have it so. Which was the only Argument that those late <hi>Apostles</hi> made use of; so it is probable this qualification of the duty of <hi>Subjects</hi> was put in here, to prepare us for a terrible <hi>le Roy le veut</hi>; and in that case we are told here, that we must <hi>obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserve</hi>; and when those severe Orders come, the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and all such as exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> will be bound by this <hi>Declaration</hi> to shew themselves more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than any others, <hi>to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>: and those poor pretensions of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Religion, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> will be then reckoned as <hi>reserves upon their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> which are all now shut out.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. These being the grounds upon which this <hi>Proclamation</hi> is founded, we ought not only to consider what consequences are


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66365:11"/>
now drawn from them, but what may be drawn from them at any time hereafter; for if they are of force, to justify that which is now inferred from them, it will be full as just to draw from the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises an Abolition of the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> of the Rights of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Church-Lands,</hi> but to all <hi>Property</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. In a word, it asserts a <hi>Power</hi> to be in the <hi>King,</hi> to command what he will, and an Obligation in the <hi>Subjects,</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he shall <hi>command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. There is also mention made in the Preamble of the <hi>Christian Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which his <hi>Majesty</hi> would have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished among <hi>Neighbours</hi>; but another dash of a Pen, founded on this <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> may declare us all <hi>Hereticks</hi>; and then in wonderful Charity to us, we must be told, that we are either <hi>to obey without Reserve,</hi> or to be <hi>Burnt without Reserve.</hi> We know the <hi>Charity</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> pretty well: It is indeed <hi>Fervent</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi>: and if we have forgot what has been done in former Ages, <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> have set before our eyes very fresh instances of the <hi>Charity</hi> of that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>: While those Examples are so green, it is a little too imposing on us, to talk to us of <hi>Christian Love and Charity.</hi> No doubt his <hi>Majesty</hi> means sincerely, and his Exactness to all his <hi>Promises,</hi> chiefly to those made since he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> will not suffer us to think an unbecoming thought of his Royal Intentions; but yet after all, tho it seems by this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> that we are bound to <hi>obey without Reserve,</hi> it is hardship upon hardship to be bound to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without Reserve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. There are a sort of People here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, that will be very hardly found out: and these are the <hi>Moderate Presbyterians</hi>: Now, as some say, that there are very few of those People in <hi>Scotland</hi> that deserve this Character, so it is hard to tell what it amounts to; and the calling any of them <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,</hi> cuts off all their share in this Grace. <hi>Moderation</hi> is a quality that lyes in the mind, and how this will be found out, I cannot so readily guess. If a Standard had been given of Opinions or Practices, then one could have known how this might have been distinguished; but as it lyes, it will not be easy to make the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination; and the declaring them all <hi>Immoderate,</hi> shuts them out quite.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Another Foundation laid down for repealing all <hi>Laws</hi> made against the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> is, that they were enacted in <hi>K. Iames the Sixth</hi>'s Minority: with some harsh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, that are not to be insisted on, since they shew more the heat of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than the Dignity of the Prince, in whose name they are given out; but all these <hi>Laws</hi> were ratifyed over and over again by <hi>K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iames,</hi> when he came to be of full Age: and they have received many Confirmations by <hi>K. Charles the First,</hi> and <hi>K Charles the Second,</hi> as well as by his <hi>present Majesty,</hi> both when he represented his <hi>Brother</hi> in the year 1681. and since <hi>he</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self came to the <hi>Crown:</hi> so that whatsoever may be said concerning the first Formation of those <hi>Laws,</hi> they have received now for the course of a whole hundred <hi>years,</hi> that are lapsed since <hi>K. Iames</hi> was of full Age, so many Confirmations, that if there is any thing certain in Humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we might depend upon them; but this new coyned <hi>Absolute Power</hi> must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all before it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. It is also well known, that the whole Settlement of the <hi>Church Lands</hi> and <hi>Tythes,</hi> with many other things, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Establishment of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> was likewise enacted in <hi>K. Iames</hi>'s minority, as well as those <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> so that the Reason now made use of, to annul the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> will serve full as well, for another Act of this <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> that shall abolish all those; and if Maximes that unhinge all the Securities of Humane Society, and all that is sacred in Government, ought to be lookt on with the justest and deepest prejudices possible, one is tempted to lose the respect that is due to every thing that carrys a Royal stamp upon it, when he sees such grounds made use of, as must shake all Settlements


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66365:11"/>
whatsoever; for if a prescription of 120. <hi>years,</hi> and Confirmations reiterated over and over again these 100. <hi>years</hi> past, do not purge some Defects in the first For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of those <hi>Laws,</hi> what can make us secure: but this looks so like a Fetch of the <hi>French Prerogative Law,</hi> both in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses with Relation to the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> and those concerning <hi>Dependences</hi> at <hi>Mets,</hi> that this seems to be a Copy from that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Original.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. It were too much ill nature to look into the History of the last Age, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on what grounds those characters of <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> given to the <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Q. Mary</hi> are built; but since <hi>K. James</hi>'s <hi>Memory</hi> has the character of <hi>glorious</hi> given to it, if the civility due to the <hi>fair sex</hi> makes one unwilling to look into the one, yet the other may be a little dwelt on. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Glory</hi> that belongs to <hi>K. James</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> is, that he was a Prince of great Learning, and that he imployed it chiefly in writing for his <hi>Religion</hi>: of the <hi>Volume</hi> in <hi>folio,</hi> in which we have his <hi>works,</hi> two thirds are against the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; one part of them is a Commentary on the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> proving that the <hi>Pope is Antichrist</hi>; another part of them belonged more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to his Post and Dignity; which is the warning that he gave to all the Princes and states of <hi>Europe,</hi> against the Treasonable and bloody Doctrines of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> The first Act he did when he came of Age, was to swear in person with all his family, and afterwards with all his people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a <hi>Covenant,</hi> containing an Enumeration of all the <hi>points</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and a most solemn renunciation of them, somewhat like our <hi>Parliament</hi> Test: his <hi>first Speech</hi> to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England</hi> was Copious on the same subject: and he left a <hi>Legacy</hi> of a <hi>Wish</hi> on such of his <hi>posterity</hi> as should go over to that <hi>Religion,</hi> which in good manners is suppressed. It is known, <hi>K. Iames</hi> was no <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and that he made more use of his <hi>Pen</hi> than his <hi>Sword</hi>: so the <hi>Glory</hi> that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to his <hi>Memory</hi> must fall chiefly on his Learned and Immortal Writings: and since there is such a Veneration expressed for him, it agrees not ill with this, to wish, that his <hi>Works</hi> were more studied by those who offer such Incense to his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. His <hi>Maj.</hi> assures his people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon his <hi>certain knowledge</hi> and <hi>long Experience,</hi> that the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as they are <hi>good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, so they are likewise Dutiful subjects</hi>: but if we must believe both these equally, then we must conclude severely against their being <hi>Good Christians</hi>; for we are sure they can never be <hi>Good Subjects,</hi> not only to a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Prince,</hi> but even to a <hi>Catholick Prince,</hi> if he does not <hi>extirpate Hereticks</hi>; for their beloved <hi>Council of the Lateran,</hi> that decreed <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> has likewise decreed, <hi>that if a Prince does not extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions, the Pope must depose him, and declare his Subjects absolved from their Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and give his Dominions to another:</hi> So that even His <hi>Majesty,</hi> how much soever he may be a Zealous <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet cannot be assured of their fidelity to him, unless he has given them secret assurances, that he is resolved to <hi>extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions;</hi> and that all the Promises which he now makes to these poor wretches are no other way to be kept, than the assurances which the <hi>Great Lewis</hi> gave to his <hi>Protestant Subjects,</hi> of his observing still the <hi>Edict of Nantes</hi> even after he had resolved to break it, and also his last promise made in the <hi>Edict,</hi> that repealed the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> by which he gave Assurances, that no Violence should be used to any for their <hi>Religion,</hi> in the very time that he was ordering all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Violences to be put in execution against them.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. His <hi>Majesty</hi> assures us, that on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions the <hi>Papists</hi> have shewed themselves <hi>Good and faithfull subjects to him and his Royall Predecessors</hi>; but how <hi>Absolute</hi> soever the Kings <hi>Power</hi> may be, it seems his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of History is not so <hi>Absolute,</hi> but it may be capable of some Improvement. It will be hard to find out what <hi>Loyalty</hi> they shewed on the <hi>occasion</hi> of the <hi>Gunpowder Plot,</hi> or during the whole progress of the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66365:12"/>
                     <hi>Rebellion of Ireland</hi>; if the King will either take the words of <hi>K. Iames</hi> of <hi>Glorious Memory,</hi> or <hi>K. Charles</hi> the first, that was indeed of <hi>pious and blessed Memory,</hi> rather than the word of the penners of this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> it will not be hard to find <hi>occasions</hi> where they were a little wanting in this their so much boasted <hi>Loyalty:</hi> and we are sure, that by the Principles of that <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> can never be assured of the <hi>Fidelity</hi> of those he calls his <hi>Catholick Subjects,</hi> but by enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to them to make his <hi>Heretical Subjects</hi> Sacrifices to their Rage.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. The <hi>King</hi> declares them capable of all the Offices and <hi>Benefices</hi> which he shall think fit to bestow on them, and only restrains them from <hi>invading the Protestant Churches by force</hi>: so that here a door is plainly opened for admitting them to the exercise of their <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> so they do not break into them by <hi>force</hi>; and whatsoever may be the sense of the term <hi>Benefice</hi> in its antient and first signification, now it stands only for <hi>Church Preferments</hi>; so that when any <hi>Churches,</hi> that are at the <hi>Kings</hi> gift, fall vacant, here is a plain intimation, that they are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to them; and then it is very probable, that all the <hi>Lawes</hi> made against such as go not to their <hi>Parish Churches,</hi> will be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely turned upon those that will not come to <hi>Mass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">XII. His <hi>Majesty</hi> does in the next place, in the vertue of his <hi>Absolute Power</hi> / An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null a great many <hi>Laws,</hi> as well those that established the <hi>Oaths of Allegeance and supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> as the late <hi>Test,</hi> enacted by himself in person, while he represented his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: upon which he gave as strange an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say to the World of his <hi>Absolute Iustice</hi> in the Attainder of the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> as he does now of his <hi>Absolute Power</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Test</hi> it self; he also repeals his own Confirmation of the <hi>Test,</hi> since he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> which he offered as the clearest Evidence that he could give of his Resolution to maintain the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and by which he gained so much upon that <hi>Parliament,</hi> that he obtained every thing from them that he desired of them; till he came to try them in the Matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> This is no extraordinary Evidence to assure his People, that his <hi>Promises</hi> will be like the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, which alter not</hi>; nor will the disgrace of the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner</hi> that enacted that <hi>Law,</hi> lay this matter wholly on him; for the <hi>Letter,</hi> that he brought, the <hi>Speech</hi> that he made, and the <hi>Instructions</hi> which he got, are all too well known to be so soon forgotten: and if <hi>Princes</hi> will give their <hi>Subjects</hi> reason to think, that they forget their <hi>promises,</hi> as soon as the turn is served for which they were made, this will be too prevailing a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the <hi>Subjects</hi> to mind the Princes <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> as little as it seems he himself does; and will force them to conclude, that the <hi>truth</hi> of the Prince, is not so <hi>Absolute</hi> as it seems he fancies his <hi>power</hi> to be.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. Here is not only a repealing of a great many <hi>Lawes,</hi> and established <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi> but by the Exercise of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power</hi> / a new <hi>Oath</hi> is imposed, which was never pretended to by the <hi>Crown</hi> in any former time; and as the <hi>Oath</hi> is created by this <hi>Absolute Power</hi> / so it seems the <hi>Absolute Power</hi> must be supported by this <hi>Oath</hi>: since one branch of it, is an obligation to <hi>Maintain His Majesty and his Lawfull Successors in the exercise of this their Absolute Power and Authority against all deadly,</hi> which I suppose is <hi>Scotch</hi> for <hi>Mortalls</hi>: now to Impose so hard a yoke as this <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power</hi> on the <hi>Subjects,</hi> seems no small stretch; but it is a wonderfull <hi>exercise</hi> of it to oblige the <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> this: it had been more modest, if they had been only bound to bear it, and submit to it: but it is a terrible thing so far to extinguish all the remnants of naturall Liberty, or of a legall Government, as to oblige the <hi>Subjects</hi> by <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>maintain the exercise of this,</hi> which plainly must destroy themselves: for the short execution by the Bow-strings of <hi>Turkey,</hi> or by sending <hi>orders</hi> to men to return in their heads, being an <hi>exercise of this Absolute Power</hi> / it is a litle hard to make men swear to <hi>maintain the King in it</hi>: and if

that <hi>Kingdom</hi> has suffered so much by the many <hi>Oaths</hi> that have been in use among them, as is marked in this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> I am affraid this new <hi>Oath</hi> will not much mend the matter.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. Yet after all, there is some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; his Majesty assures them, he will use no <hi>Violence</hi> nor <hi>force,</hi> nor any <hi>Invincible Necessity to any man on the account of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion:</hi> It were too great a want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to fancy, that a time may come in which even this may be remembred, full as well, as the <hi>Promises</hi> that were made to the <hi>Parliament</hi> after His Majesty came to the <hi>Crown</hi>: I do not, I confess, apprehend that; for I see here so great a caution used in the choice of these words, that it is plain, very great Severities may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with them: It is clear, that the generall words of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by these last of <hi>Invincible Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> / so that the <hi>King</hi> does only <hi>promise</hi> to lay no <hi>Invincible Necessity</hi> on his <hi>Subjects</hi>; but for all <hi>Necessities,</hi> that are not <hi>Invincible,</hi> it seems they must expect to bear a large share of them; Disgraces, want of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, Fines, and Imprisonments, and even Death it self are all <hi>Vincible</hi> things to a man of a firmness of mind: so that the <hi>Violences of torture,</hi> the <hi>Furies of Dragoons,</hi> and some of the <hi>Methods</hi> now practised in <hi>France,</hi> perhaps may be Included within this <hi>Promise</hi>; since these seem almost <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible</hi> to humane nature, if it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with an Extraordinary measure of Grace: but as to all other things, His Majesty binds himself up from no part of <hi>the Exercise of his Absolute Power</hi> by this Promise.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. His <hi>Majesty</hi> orders this to go Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> without passing thro the other <hi>Seals</hi>: now since this is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-signed by the <hi>Secretary,</hi> in whose hands the <hi>Signet</hi> is, there was no other step to be made but thro the <hi>Privy Seal</hi>; so I must own, I have a great curiosity of knowing his Character in whose hands the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> is at present; for it seems his Conscience is not so very supple, as the <hi>Chancellors</hi> and the <hi>Secretaryes</hi> are; but it is very likely, if he does not quickly change his mind, the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> at least will very quickly change its <hi>Keeper</hi>; and I am sorry to hear, that the <hi>L. Chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Secretary</hi> have not another Brother to fill this post, that so the guilt of the ruin of that <hi>Nation,</hi> may lie on one single <hi>Family,</hi> and that there may be no others involved in it.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. Upon the whole matter, many smaller things being waved, it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream unpleasant to find fault, where one has all possible dispositions to pay all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; we here in <hi>England</hi> see what we must look for. A <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> was tryed, but it proved a little Stubborn; and now <hi>Absolute Power</hi> comes to set all right; so when the <hi>Closetting</hi> has gone round, so that <hi>Noses</hi> are counted, we may perhaps see a <hi>Parliament</hi> here, but if it chances to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward, and not to <hi>obey without Reserve</hi> / then our Reverend <hi>Iudges</hi> will copy from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and will not only tell us of the Kings <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> but will discover to us this new Mystery of <hi>Absolute Power, to which we are all bound to obey without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</hi>

                  <head>A LETTER, Containing some REFLECTIONS On His MAJESTIES DECLARATION For LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE. Dated the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1687.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p n="1">I. I Thank you for the Favour of sending me the late <hi>Declaration</hi> that His <hi>Majesty</hi> has granted for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> I confess, I longed for it with great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and was surprised to find it so different from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pattern; for I imagined, that it was to be set to the second part of the same tune: nor can I see why the Penners of this have sunk so much in their stile; for I suppose the same men pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both. I expected to have seen the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Language of <hi>Absolute Power, to which all the Subjects are to obey without reserve; and of the cassing, annulling, the stopping, and disabling of Laws</hi> set forth in the Preamble and body of this <hi>Declaration</hi>; whereas those dreadful words are not to be found here: for instead of <hi>repealing the Laws,</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> pretends by this only to <hi>suspend them</hi>; and tho in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this amounts to a <hi>repeal,</hi> yet it must be confessed that the words are softer. Now since the <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> to which His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> pretends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not founded on such poor things as <hi>Law</hi>; for that would look as if it were the gift of the <hi>people</hi>; but on the Divine Authority, which is supposed to be delegated to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> this may be as well claimed in <hi>England</hi> as it was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>:


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66365:15"/>
and the pretension to <hi>Absolute Power</hi> is so great a thing, that since His <hi>Majesty</hi> thought fit once to claim it, he is little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to those that make him fall so much in his Language; especially since both these <hi>Declarations</hi> have appeared in our <hi>Gazettes</hi>; so that as we see what is done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we know from hence what is in some peoples hearts, and what we may expect in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. His <hi>Majesty</hi> tells his people, that <hi>the perfect Injoyment of their Property has never been in any Case invaded by him since his coming to the Crown.</hi> This is indeed matter of great Incouragement to all good <hi>Subjects</hi>; for it lets them see, that such Invasions, as have been made on <hi>Property,</hi> have been done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge: so that no doubt the continuing to levy the <hi>Customes</hi> and the <hi>Additional Excise</hi> (which had been granted only during the late <hi>Kings</hi> Life,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Parliament</hi> could meet to renew the Grant, was done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge; the many Violences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only by <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but <hi>Officers,</hi> in all the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which are severe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions on <hi>Property,</hi> have been all without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge; and since the first Branch of <hi>Property</hi> is the Right that a man has to his <hi>Life,</hi> the strange Essay of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Government,</hi> that was shewed at <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; and the no less strange proceedings of the present <hi>Lord Chancellour,</hi> in his <hi>Circuit</hi> after the <hi>Rebellion</hi> (which are very justly called <hi>His Campagne,</hi> for it was an open Act of Hostility to all <hi>Law</hi>) and for which and other Services of the like nature, it is believed he has had the reward of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and the <hi>Executions</hi> of those who have left their <hi>Colours,</hi> which being founded on no <hi>Law,</hi> are no other than so many <hi>Murders</hi>; all these, I say, are as we are sure, Invasions on <hi>Property</hi>; but since the <hi>King</hi> tells us, that no such <hi>Invasions</hi> have been made since he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> we must conclude that all these things have fallen out without his Privity. And if a standing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Army,</hi> in time of Peace, has been ever lookt on by this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as an Attempt upon the whole <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> in gross, one must conclude, that even this is done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. His <hi>Majesty</hi> expresses his Charity for us in a kind wish, <hi>that we were all Members of the Catholick Church</hi>; in return to which we offer up daily our most earnest prayers for him, that he may become a Member of the <hi>truly Catholick Church</hi>: for Wishes and Prayers do no hurt on no side: but His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> adds, that <hi>it has ever been his Opinion, that Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor people forced in matters of meer Religion.</hi> We are very happy if this continues to be always his sense: but we are sure in this he is no obedient <hi>Member</hi> of that which he means by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>: for it has over and over again decreed the <hi>Extirpation of Hereticks.</hi> It encourages <hi>Princes</hi> to it, by the Offer of the Pardon of their Sins; it threatens them to it, by denouncing to them not only the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but that which is more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the loss of their <hi>Dominions</hi>: and it seems they intend to make us know that part of their Doctrine even before we come to feel it, since tho some of that Communion would take away the Horror which the Fourth <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> gives us, in which these things were decreed, by denying it to be a <hi>General Council,</hi> and rejecting the Authority of those <hi>Canons,</hi> yet the most learned of all the <hi>Apostates</hi> that has fallen to them from our <hi>Church,</hi> has so lately given up this Plea, and has so formally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Authority of that <hi>Council,</hi> and of its <hi>Canons,</hi> that it seems they think they are bound to this piece of fair dealing, of warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us before hand of our Danger. It is true <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayes, <hi>The Church does not always exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her Power of deposing Heretical Princes, tho she always retains it:</hi> one reason that he assigns, is, <hi>because she is not at all times able to put it in execution:</hi> so the same reason may perhaps make it appear unadviseable to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Hereticks,</hi> because that at present it cannot be done; but the <hi>Right</hi> remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and is put in execution in such an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting manner in all places where that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>


                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66365:15"/>
prevails, that it has a very ill Grace, to see any <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> speak in this strain: and when neither the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> nor the Greatness of their <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor yet the Interests of the <hi>Emperour</hi> joyned to the Gentleness of his own temper, could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these Bloody <hi>Councils,</hi> that are indeed parts of that <hi>Religion,</hi> we can see no reason to induce us to believe, that a <hi>Toleration of Religion</hi> is proposed with any other design but either to divide us, or to lay us asleep, till it is time to give the Alarm for destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If all the <hi>Endeavours, that have been used in the last four Reigns, for bringing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom to a Unity in Religion have been ineffectual,</hi> as His <hi>Maj.</hi> says; we know to whom we owe both the first beginnings and the progress of the Divisions among our selves; the Gentleness of <hi>Q. Elisabeth's</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the numbers of those that adhered to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> made it scarce possible to put an end to that Party during her Reign, which has been ever since restless, and has had credit enough at <hi>Court</hi> during the three last <hi>Reigns,</hi> not only to support it self, but to distract us, and to divert us from apprehending the danger of being swallowed up by them, by fomenting our own Differences, and by setting on either a <hi>Toleration,</hi> or a <hi>Persecution,</hi> as it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to serve their <hi>Interests.</hi> It is not so very long since, that nothing was to be heard at <hi>Court</hi> but the supporting the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and the Extirpating all the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>: and it were easy to name the persons, if it were decent, that had this ever in their Mouths; but now all is turned round again, the <hi>Church of England</hi> is in Disgrace; and now the Encouragment of <hi>Trade,</hi> the Quiet of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the Freedom of <hi>Conscience</hi> are again in Vogue, that were such odious things but a few years ago, that the very mentioning them was enough to load any man with Suspitions as backward in the <hi>King's</hi> Service, while such Methods are used, and the Government is as in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, divided between hot and cold fits, no wonder if Laws so unsteadily executed have failed of their effect.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. There is a good reserve here left for <hi>Severity</hi> when the proper Opportunity to set it on presents it self: for his <hi>Majesty</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himself only against the <hi>forcing of men in matters of meer Religion</hi>: so that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Religion and Policy come to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven, that <hi>meer Religion</hi> is not the case, and that <hi>Publick Safety</hi> may be pretended, then this <hi>Declaration</hi> is to be no more clai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med: so that the fastning any thing upon the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> that is inconsistent with the Publick Peace, will be pretended to shew that they are not persecuted for <hi>meer Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> when it was resolved to extirpate the <hi>Protestants,</hi> all the Discourses that were written on that Subject were full of the <hi>Wars</hi> occasioned by those of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in the last Age, tho as these were the happy Occasions of bringing the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> they had been ended above 80. years ago, and there had not been so much as the least Tumult raised by them these 50. years past: so that the <hi>French,</hi> who have smarted under this Severity, could not be charged with the least Infraction of the <hi>Law:</hi> yet Stories of a hundred years old were raised up to inspire into the <hi>King</hi> those Apprehensions of them, which have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the terrible effects that are visible to all the World. There is another <hi>Expression</hi> in this <hi>Declaration,</hi> which lets us likewise see with what Caution the Offers of Favour are now worded, that so there may be an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion given when the Time and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture shall be favourable to break thro them all: it is in these words, <hi>So that they take especial Care that nothing be preached or taught amongst them, which may any ways tend to alienate the Hearts of our People from us or our Government.</hi> This in it self is very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and could admit of no Exception, if we had not to do with a set of <hi>men,</hi> who to our great Misfortune have so much Credit with His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and who will be no sooner lodged in the Power to which they pretend, than they will make every thing that is

It is true, the words that come after unriddle the Mystery a little, which are, <hi>when His Majesty shall think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them to meet</hi>: for the meaning of this seems plain, that his <hi>Maj.</hi> is resolved, that they shall never meet, till he receives such Assurances, in a new round of <hi>Closetting,</hi> that he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But the total <hi>Subversion</hi> of a <hi>Government,</hi> being so contrary to the <hi>Trust</hi> that is given to the <hi>Prince</hi> who ought to execute it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will put men upon uneasy and dangerous Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: which will turn little to the Advantage of those who are driving matters to such a doubtful and desperate issue.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. If there is any thing in which the Exercise of the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> seems In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable, it is in those <hi>Oaths of Allegeance</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi> that are thought necessary to Qualify men either to be admitted to enjoy the Protection of the <hi>Law,</hi> or to bear a share in the <hi>Government</hi>; for in these the Security of the Government is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and therefore the total extinction


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66365:16"/>
of these, as it is not only a Suspension of them, but a plain repealing of them, so it is a <hi>Subverting</hi> of the whole Foundation of our <hi>Government</hi>: For the Regulation that <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> had set both for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects having the Protection of the State by the <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> and for a share in places of trust by the <hi>Tests,</hi> is now pluckt up by the roots; when it is declared, <hi>that these shall not at any time hereafter be required to be taken, or subscribed by any persons whatsoever</hi>: for it is plain, that this is no <hi>Suspension</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but a formal <hi>Repeal</hi> of it, in as plain Words as can be conceived.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. His <hi>Majesty</hi> says, that <hi>the Benefit of the Service of all his Subjects is by the Law of Nature Inseparably annexed to and inherent in his Sacred Person.</hi> It is somewhat strange, that when so many <hi>Laws,</hi> that we all know are suspended, the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is so hard to be found out, should be cited; but the Penners of this <hi>Declaration</hi> had b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st let <hi>that Law</hi> lie forgotten among the rest; for there is a scurvy Paragraph in it, concerning <hi>self Preservation,</hi> that is capable of very unacceptable Glosses. It is hard to tell what Section of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> has markt out either such <hi>a Form of Government,</hi> or such <hi>a Family</hi> for it. And if His <hi>Majesty</hi> renounces his Pretensions to our <hi>Allegeance</hi> as founded on the <hi>Laws of England,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himself to this <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> he will perhaps find the Counsel was a little too rash; but to make the most of this that can be, the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> does indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Governours</hi> of all Societies a Power to serve themselves of every Member of it in the cases of extream Danger; but no <hi>Law of Nature</hi> that has been yet heard of will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if by <hi>special Laws,</hi> a sort of men have been disabled from all Imployments, that a <hi>Prince</hi> who at his Coronation <hi>Swore</hi> to maintain those <hi>Laws,</hi> may at his pleasure extinguish all these Disabilities.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. At the end of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> as in a Postscript, His <hi>Majesty</hi> assures his Subjects, that he will <hi>maintain them in their Properties, as well in Church and Abbey Lands, as other Lands</hi>: but the Chief of all their <hi>Properties</hi> being the share that they have by their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives</hi> in the <hi>Legislative Power</hi>; this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> which breaks thro that, is no great Evidence that the rest will be maintained: and to speak plainly, when a <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> is so little remembred, other <hi>Promises</hi> must have a proportioned degree of Credit given to them: as for the <hi>Abbey Lands,</hi> the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the <hi>Church</hi> is according to the Principles of that Religion <hi>Sacriledge</hi>; and that is a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> and there can no <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> be given to any who continue in it: and so this <hi>Promise</hi> being an Obligation to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men in a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> is null and void of it self: <hi>Church-Lands</hi> are also according to the Doctrine of their <hi>Canonists,</hi> so immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Gods Right,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> himself is only the Administrator and Dispencer, but is not the Master of them; he can indeed make a truck for God, or let them so <hi>low,</hi> that God shall be an easy <hi>Landlord</hi>: but he cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods <hi>Property,</hi> nor translate the Right that is in him to <hi>Sacrilegious Laymen</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. One of the Effects of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> will be the setting on foot a new run of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi> over the <hi>Nation</hi>: for there is nothing how Impudent and base soever, of which the abject flattery of a Slavish Spirit is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. It must be confest, to the reproach of the Age, that all those strains of flattery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Tacitus</hi> sets forth with so mueh just Scorn, are modest things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to what this <hi>Nation</hi> has produced within these <hi>seven years</hi>: only if our Flattery has come short of the Refinedness of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it has exceeded theirs as much in its loathed Fulsomness. The late <hi>King</hi> set out a <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which he gave the most solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances possible of his adhering to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and to the <hi>Religion established by Law,</hi> and of his Resolution to have Frequent <hi>Parliaments</hi>; upon which the whole <hi>Nation</hi> fell as it were into Raptures of Joy and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: but tho he lived four Years after that, he called no <hi>Parliament,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Triennial Parliaments</hi>: and the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66365:17"/>
manner of his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Papers</hi> printed after his Death in his Name, have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed, that he was equally sincere in both those Assurances that he gave, as well in that Relating to <hi>Religion,</hi> as in that other Relating to Frequent <hi>Parliaments</hi>; yet upon his <hi>Death</hi> a new set of <hi>Addresses</hi> appeared, in which all that Flattery could Invent was brought forth, in the Commendations of a <hi>Prince,</hi> to whose <hi>Memory</hi> the greatest kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can be done, is <hi>to forget him</hi>: and because his present <hi>Majesty</hi> upon his coming to the <hi>Throne</hi> gave some very general <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Maintaining the Church of England,</hi> this was magnified in so Extravagant a strain, as if it had been a Security greater than any that the <hi>Law</hi> could give: tho by the regard that the <hi>King</hi> has both to <hi>it</hi> and to the <hi>Laws,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he is resolved to maintain both equally: since then the <hi>Nation</hi> has already made it self sufficiently ridiculous both to the present and to all succeeding Ages; it is time that at last men should grow weary, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ashamed of their Folly.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are now invited to set an Example to the rest: and they who have valued themselves hitherto upon their Opposition to <hi>Popery</hi> and that have quarrelled with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for some small Approaches to it, in a few <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> are now solicited to rejoyce, because the <hi>Laws</hi> that secure us against it, are all plucked up: since they enjoy at <hi>present</hi> and <hi>during pleasure</hi> leave to meet together. It is natural for all men to love to be set at ease, especially in the matters of their Consciences; but it is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that those who allow them this favour, do it with no other design, but that under a pretence of a <hi>General Toleration,</hi> they may Introduce a <hi>Religion</hi> which must <hi>persecute</hi> all equally: it is likewise apparent how much <hi>they</hi> are <hi>hated,</hi> and how much <hi>they</hi> have been <hi>persecuted</hi> by the Instigation of those who now Court them, and who have now no game that is more promising, than the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> into new Quarrels: and as for the <hi>Promises</hi> now made to them, it cannot be supposed that they will be more lasting than those that were made some time ago to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who had both a better Title in <hi>Law</hi> and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Merit upon the <hi>Crown</hi> to assure them that they should be well used than these can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. The <hi>Nation</hi> has scarce forgiven some of the <hi>Church of England</hi> the <hi>Persecution</hi> into which they have suffered themselves to be cosened: tho now that they see <hi>Popery</hi> barefaced, the Stand that they have made, and the vigorous Opposition that they have given to it, is that which makes all men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forget what is past, and raises again the Glory of a <hi>Church</hi> that was not a little stained by the Indiscretion and Weakness of those, that were too apt to believe and hope, and so suffered themselves to be made a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> to those who would now make them a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> and the Fury that the <hi>Popish Party</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed against them, had recommended them so much to the Compassions of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and had given them so just a pretension to favour in a better time, that it will look like a curse of God upon them, if a few <hi>men,</hi> whom the Court has gained to betray them, can have such an ill Influence upon them as to make them throw away all that Merit, and those Compassions which their Sufferings have procured them; and to go and court <hi>those</hi> who are only seemingly kind to them, that they may destroy both <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us.</hi> They must remember that as the <hi>Church of England</hi> is the only Establishment that our <hi>Religion</hi> has by <hi>Law</hi>; so it is the main body of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all the <hi>Sects</hi> are but small and strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling parties: and if the Legal Settlement of the <hi>Church</hi> is dissolved, and that body is once broken, these lesser bodies will be all at Mercy: and it is an easy thing to define what the Mercies of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. But tho it must be confessed, that the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are still under some Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to receive every thing that gives them present ease, with a little too much kindness; since they lie exposed to many severe <hi>Laws,</hi> of which they have of late felt the weight ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavily, and as they are men, and some


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66365:17"/>
of them as ill Natured men as other people, so it is no wonder if upon the first surprises of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> they are a little delighted, to see the <hi>Church of England,</hi> after all its Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Submissions to the <hi>Court,</hi> so much mortified by it; so that taking all together it will not be strange if they commit some Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon this occasion. Yet on the other hand, it passes all imagination, to see some of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> especially those whose Natures we know are so particularly sharpned in the point of <hi>Persecution,</hi> chiefly when it is levelled against the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at this <hi>Declaration,</hi> and make <hi>Addresses</hi> upon it. It is hard to think that they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to so high a pitch of Christian Charity, as to thank those who do now <hi>despitefully use them,</hi> and that as an earnest that within a little while they will <hi>persecute</hi> them. This will be an Original, and a Master piece in Flattery, which must needs draw the last degrees of Contempt on such as are capable of so abject and sordid a Compliance, and that not only from all the true <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but likewise from those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> it self; for every man is apt to esteem an Enemy that is brave even in his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as much as he despises those whose minds sink with their Condition. For what is it that these men would thank the <hi>King</hi>? Is it because he breaks those <hi>Laws</hi> that are made in their Favour, and for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: and is now striking at the Root of all the Legal Settlement that they have for their <hi>Religion</hi>? Or is it because that at the same time that the <hi>King</hi> professes a <hi>Religion</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> yet he is not contented with the Exercise of it as it is warranted by <hi>Law,</hi> but carries it so far as to erect a <hi>Court</hi> contrary to the express words of a <hi>Law</hi> that was so lately made: That <hi>Court</hi> takes care to maintain a due proportion between their <hi>Constitution</hi> and all their <hi>proceedings,</hi> that so all may be of a piece, and all equally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Law.</hi> They have suspended one <hi>Bishop,</hi> only because he would not do that which was not in his Power to do: for since there is no Extrajudiciary Authority in <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi> can no more proceed to a Sentence of Suspension against a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> without a Tryal, and the hearing of Parties, than a <hi>Judge</hi> can give a Sentence in his Chamber without an Indictment, a Tryal, or a Iury: and because one of the <hi>Greatest Bodies</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would not break their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and obey a <hi>Mandate</hi> that plainly contradicted them, we see to what a pitch this is like to be carried. I will not Anticipate upon this <hi>ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Court,</hi> to tell what Iudgments are coming, but without carrying our Iealousies too far, one may safely conclude, that they will never depart so far from their first <hi>Institution,</hi> as to have any regard, either to our <hi>Religion,</hi> or our <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> in any thing they do. If all this were acted by avowed <hi>Papists,</hi> as we are sure it is projected by such, there were nothing Extraordinary in it: but that which carries our Indignation a little too far to be easily governed, is to see some <hi>Pretended Protestants,</hi> and a few <hi>Bishops,</hi> among those that are the fatal <hi>Instruments</hi> of pulling down the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and that those <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> Sacrifice their <hi>Religion</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi> to their Ambition and Interests; this has such peculiar Characters of Misfortune upon it, that it seems it is not enough if we perish without pity, since we fall by that hand tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot hold asking you, how much <hi>Money</hi> you had, from the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Paper,</hi> which you pretend to <hi>Answer:</hi> for as you have the character of a man that deales with both hands, so this is writ in such a manner as to make one think you were hired to it, by the Adverse Party: but it has been indeed so ordinary to your Friends, to write in this manner of late, that the Censures upon it are divided, both fall heavy: some sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Sincerity others accuse them for want of a right Understanding: for tho all are not of the pitch of the <hi>Irish Priests</hi> Reflections, on the Bp of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells's</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was indeed <hi>Irish</hi> double refined; yet both in your Books of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, and Policy, and even in your <hi>Poems,</hi> you seem to have entred into such an inter-mixture with the <hi>Irish,</hi> that the thread all over is <hi>Linsey-woollsey.</hi> You acknowledge that the Gentleman whom you answer has a <hi>Polite Pen,</hi> and that his <hi>Letter is an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious paper, and made up of well-Composed Sentences and Periods.</hi> Yet I believe he will hardly return you your Complement. If <hi>it</hi> was well writ, your Party wants either Men or Judgment extreamly, in allowing you this province of answering it. If the <hi>Paper</hi> did you some hurt, you had better have let the Town be a litle pleased with it for a while; and have hoped that a litle time or some new paper (tho one of its force is scarce to be expected) should have worn it out, then to give it a new luster by such an <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Time of the Dissenters Sufferings,</hi> which you lengthen out to 27 <hi>years,</hi> will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amount to <hi>seven.</hi> For the long Intervals it had, in the last <hi>Reign,</hi> are not forgot: and those who animated the latest and severest of their sufferings are such, that in good manners you ought not to reflect on <hi>their</hi> Conduct. <hi>Opium</hi> is as certain a <hi>poison,</hi> tho not so <hi>violent,</hi> as <hi>Sublimate</hi>; and if more <hi>corrosive Medicines</hi> did not work, the <hi>Design</hi> is the same, when <hi>soporiferous</hi> ones are used: since the Patient is to be killed both ways: and it seems that all that is in debate is, which is the safer: the accepting a present ease when the ill intent with which it is offered, is Visible, is just as wise an


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66365:19"/>
action, as to take <hi>Opium</hi> to lay a small Distemper when one may conclude from the <hi>dose,</hi> that he will never come out of the Sleep. So that after all, it is plain on which side the <hi>Madness</hi> lies. The <hi>Dissenters</hi> for a little present ease, to be enjoyed at Mercy, must concur to break down all our hedges, and to lay us open to that Devouring <hi>Power,</hi> before which nothing can stand that will not <hi>worship</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>All that for which you reproach the <hi>Church of England</hi> amounts to this, that a few good words, could not persuade her to destroy her self; and to Sacrifice her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and the Laws to a party that never has done nor ever can do the <hi>King</hi> half the service that she has rendred him. There are some sorts of propositions that a man does not know how to answer: nor would he be thought Ingratefull who after he had received some Civilities from a person to whom he had done great service, could not be prevailed with by these so far as to spare him his Wife or his Daughter. It must argue a peculiar degree of confidence to ask things, that are above the being either askt or granted. Our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Government</hi> are matters that are not to be parted with to shew our good breeding: and of all men living you ought not to pretend to <hi>Good Manners,</hi> who talk as you do, of the <hi>Oppression</hi> of the last <hi>Reign.</hi> When the <hi>King's</hi> Obligations to his <hi>Brother,</hi> and the share that he had in his <hi>Councils,</hi> are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; the reproaching his <hi>Government,</hi> has so ill a grace, that you are as Indecent in your Flatteries as Injurious in your Reflections. And by this gratitude of yours to the Memory of the late <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church of England</hi> may easily Infer, how long all her Services would be remembred, even if she had done all that was desired of her.</p>
                  <p>I would fain know which of the <hi>Brethren of the Dissenters in forreigne Countries sought their Relief from Rebellion.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> Reformed by the Authority of their <hi>Princes,</hi> so did the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and like wise the <hi>Switsers.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> they maintained the Princes of the <hi>Blood</hi> against the <hi>League:</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> the Quarrell was for <hi>Civil liberties</hi>; Protestant and Papist concurring equally in it. You mention <hi>Holland</hi> as an Instance that <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> can dwell together: <hi>since Papists there shew that they can be friendly neighbours, to those whom they think in the wrong:</hi> It is very like they would be still so in <hi>England,</hi> if they were under the lash of the law, and so were upon their good behaviour, the Goverment being still against them: and this has so good an effect in <hi>Holland,</hi> that I hope we shall never depart from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pattern: some can be very Humble Servants that would prove Imperious Masters. You say that <hi>Force</hi> is our only <hi>Supporter:</hi> but tho there is no force of our side at present, it does not appear that we are in such a tottering condition, as if we had no <hi>Supporter</hi> left us. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are of our side: and the indiscreet use of <hi>Force,</hi> when set on by our Enemies, has rather undermined than supported us. But you have taken pains to make us grow wiser, and to let us see our Errors, which is perhaps the only obligation that we owe you; and we are so sensible of it, that without examining what your Intentions may have been in it, we heartily thank you for it.</p>
                  <p>I do not comprehend what your quarrell is at the <hi>squinting Term</hi> of the <hi>next heir,</hi> as you call it; tho I do not wonder that <hi>squinting</hi> comes in your mind whensoever you think of HER; for all people look <hi>asquint</hi> at that which troubles them: and


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66365:19"/>
                     <hi>her</hi> being the <hi>next heir</hi> is no less the <hi>delight</hi> of all good men, than it is your <hi>affliction:</hi> all the pains that you take to represent <hi>her</hi> dreadful to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> must needs find that credit with them, that is due to the Insinuations of an Enemy. It is very true, that as <hi>she</hi> was bred up in our <hi>Church,</hi> she adheres to it so Eminently, as to make <hi>her</hi> to be now our <hi>chief Ornament</hi> as we hope she will be once our <hi>main Defence.</hi> If by <hi>the strictest form of our Church</hi> you mean an <hi>Exemplary Piety,</hi> and a <hi>shining Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> you have given her true <hi>Character:</hi> But your designe lies another way to make the <hi>Dissenters</hi> form strange Ideas of her, as if she thought <hi>all Indulgence to them Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal:</hi> But as the Gentleness of her nature is such, that none but those who are so guilty, that all mercy to them would be a Crime, can apprehend any thing that is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, from <hi>her,</hi> so as for the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> her going so constantly to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches shews, that she can very well endure their Assemblies, at the same time that she prefers, ours. <hi>She</hi> has also too often expressed her dislike at the heats that have been kept up among us concerning such Inconsiderable Differences, to pass for a <hi>Bigot</hi> or a <hi>persecutor</hi> in such matters: and <hi>She</hi> sees both the mischief that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion</hi> has received from their subdivisions, and the happiness of granting a <hi>due Liberty of Conscience,</hi> where she has so long lived, that there is no reason to make any fancy that she will either keep up our Differences, or bear down the <hi>Dissenters</hi> with Rigor. But because you hope for nothing from her own Inclinations, you would have her terrified with the <hi>strong Argument of Numbers,</hi> which you fancy will <hi>certainly secure them from her recalling the favour.</hi> But of what side soever that Argument may be <hi>strong,</hi> sure it is not of <hi>theirs</hi> who make but <hi>one to Two hundred:</hi> and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you scarce expect that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> will rebel, that you may have your <hi>Masses,</hi> and how their numbers will <hi>secure them,</hi> unless it be by enabling them to <hi>Rebell,</hi> I cannot Imagine: this is indeed a <hi>squinting</hi> at the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> with a witness, when you would already muster up the Troops that must rise against <hi>her.</hi> But let me tell you, that you know both <hi>Her</hi> Character and the <hi>Prince's</hi> very ill that fancy, they are only to be wrought on by <hi>Fear. They</hi> are known to your great grief; to be above that: and it must be to their own Mercifull Inclinations, that you must owe all that you can expect under them, but neither to their <hi>fear</hi> nor to your own <hi>Numbers.</hi> As for the <hi>hatred and Contempt, even to the degree of being more Ridiculous then the Mass under which you say Her way of Worship is in Holland,</hi> this is one of those figures of speech that shew how exactly you have Studied the <hi>Jesuites Moralls.</hi> All that come from <hi>Holland,</hi> assure us, that she is so Universally beloved and esteemed there, that every thing that she does, is the better thought of even because <hi>she</hi> does it. Upon the whole matter, all that you say of the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> proves too truly that you are that for which you reproach the <hi>Church of England,</hi> a Disciple of the Crown only <hi>for the</hi> loaves; for if you had that respect which you pretend for the <hi>King,</hi> you would have shewed it more upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>Nor am I so much in love with your stile, as to imitate it, therefore I will not do you so great a pleasure, as to say the least thing that may reflect on that <hi>Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Church of England</hi> has taught me to <hi>reverence</hi> even after all the <hi>Disgraces</hi>


                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66365:20"/>
that she has received from it: and if she were not Insuperably restrained by her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, instead of the <hi>Thin Muster</hi> with which you reproach <hi>her, she</hi> could soon make so <hi>thick</hi> a one as would make the <hi>Thinnes</hi> of yours, very visible upon so unequall a division of the Nation: But she will neither be threatned nor laughed out of her <hi>Religion</hi> and her <hi>loyalty:</hi> tho such insultings as she meets with, that almost pass all humane Patience, would tempt men that had a less fixed principle of submission, to make their Enemies feel to their cost, that they owe all the Triumphs they make, more to <hi>our Principles,</hi> than to their own <hi>Force.</hi> Their laughing at <hi>our</hi> Doctrine of <hi>non resistance,</hi> lets us see, that it would be none of <hi>theirs</hi> under the <hi>Next Heir,</hi> at whom you <hi>Squint,</hi> if the <hi>strong Argument of Numbers</hi> made you not apprehend that <hi>Two Hundred to one</hi> would prove an Unequal Match.</p>
                  <p>As for your <hi>Memorandums,</hi> I shall answer them as short as you give them</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will be hard, to persuade people, that a Decision in favour of the <hi>Dispencing Power,</hi> flowing from <hi>Judges</hi> that are both <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>payed,</hi> and that may be <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> at <hi>pleasure,</hi> will amount to the <hi>recognising of that Right by law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will be hard to persuade the world, that the <hi>Kings</hi> adhering to his <hi>Promises,</hi> and his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> and to the known <hi>Lawes</hi> of the land, would make him <hi>Felo de se.</hi> The following of different methods were the likelier way to it, if it were not for the <hi>Loyalty of the Church of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will be very easy to see the use of continuing the <hi>Test</hi> by <hi>Law</hi>; since all those that break thro it, as well as the <hi>Judges,</hi> who have authorised their Crimes, are still liable for all they do: and after all your <hi>huffing,</hi> with the <hi>Dispencing Power,</hi> we do not doubt but the apprehension of an after reckoning sticks <hi>deep</hi> somewhere, you say, <hi>it may be supposed, that the aversion of a Protestant King to the Popish party, will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exclude them, even without the Test.</hi> But it must be confessed, that you take all possible care, to confirm that <hi>Aversion</hi> so far, as to put it beyond a <hi>it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi> And it seems you understand <hi>Christs</hi> Prerogative, as wel as the <hi>Judges</hi> did the <hi>Kings,</hi> that fancy the <hi>Test</hi> is against it: it is so suteable to the nature of all <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to take Assurances of <hi>those</hi> who are admitted to Places of Trust, that you do very ill to appeal to an <hi>Impartial consideration,</hi> for you are sure to lose it there.</p>
                  <p>Few <hi>English men,</hi> will believe you in earnest when you seem zealous for publick <hi>liberty,</hi> or the <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> or that you are so very apprehensive of <hi>Slavery:</hi> And your Friends must have very much changed both their Natures and their Principles, if <hi>their conduct does not give cause to renew the like Statutes against them,</hi> even tho they should be repealed in this <hi>Reign,</hi> notwithstanding all your confidence to the contrary. I will still believe that the <hi>strong Argument of Numbers</hi> will be always the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest of all others with you: which as long as it has its <hi>Force,</hi> and no longer, we may hope to be at quiet. I concurre heartily with you in your Prayers for the <hi>King,</hi> tho perhaps I differ from you in my Notions, both of his <hi>Glory</hi> and of the <hi>Felicity of his People</hi>: and as for your own particular, I wish you would either not at all Imploy your Pen, or learn to write to better purpose: but tho I cannot admire your Letter, yet I am</p>

                        <hi>THe Secretary hand</hi> is known to al the <hi>Writing Masters</hi> of the Town; but here is an Essay of the <hi>Secretary's Stile</hi> for the Masters of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: This is an Age of Improvements, and Men that come very young into Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, make commonly a great progress; therefore common things are not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted here: it is true, some Roughnesses in the


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66365:21"/>
                        <hi>Stile</hi> seem to intimate that the Writer could turn his <hi>Conscience</hi> more easily than he can do his Pen, and that the one is a little stiffer and less compliant than the other. He tells the <hi>Addressers,</hi> that <hi>His Majesty is well satisfied with their Loyalty contained in their Address; for the which he resolves to perpetuate the favour.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the <hi>Secretary Stile</hi> and the <hi>Notary Stile</hi> come nearer one another than was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed: <hi>For the which</hi> here, &amp; <hi>infringe the same</hi> afterwards, are beauties borrowed from the <hi>Notary Stile</hi>: the <hi>foresaid</hi> is not much courser. The King's <hi>perpetuating the Favour</hi> is no easy thing, unless he could first <hi>perpetuate</hi> himself. Now tho his Majesty's Fame will be certainly <hi>immortal,</hi> yet to our great Regret his Person is <hi>mortal</hi>; so it is hard to conceive, how this <hi>perpetuity</hi> should be setled.</p>
                     <p>The Method here proposed is a new Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the <hi>Secretary Stile:</hi> which is the <hi>Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the next ensuing Parliament the taking off all Penal Laws.</hi> All former <hi>Secretaries</hi> used the modest Words of <hi>proposing</hi> or <hi>recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>; but he who in a former <hi>Essay</hi> of this <hi>Stile,</hi> told us of his <hi>Majesty's Absolute Power, to which all the Subjects are to obey without reserve,</hi> furnishes us now with this <hi>new</hi> term of the <hi>King's appointing</hi> what shal be done in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But what if after all, the <hi>Parliament</hi> proves so stubborn, as not to comply with this <hi>Appointment,</hi> I am afraid then the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi> will be of a shrort continuance. He in the next place, mentions the <hi>Liberty or Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted by the King. Liberty</hi> is not so hard a Word, but that it might be understood without this Explanation <hi>or Toleration,</hi> unless the <hi>Secretary Stile</hi> either approaches to the <hi>Notary Stile</hi> in some nauseous Repetitions, or that he would intimate by this, that all the <hi>Liberty</hi> that is left the Subjects is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this <hi>Toleration.</hi> And indeed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Absolute Power</hi> was once asserted, it was never fit to name <hi>Liberty</hi> without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction. After this comes a stately Period, <hi>The Enemies to him, to you, and to this Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yet I should be sorry if it were true; for I hope there are many <hi>Enemies to this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> who are neither <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> nor to these <hi>Addressers</hi>; and that on the contrary they are <hi>Enemies</hi> to it, because they are the <hi>best Friends</hi> that both the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> have. It is now no secret, that tho' both the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> are great Enemies to <hi>Persecution,</hi> and in particular to all Rigour against the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet they are not satisfied with the way in which this <hi>Toleration</hi> is granted. But the reckoning of them as <hi>Enemies</hi> either to the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>People,</hi> is one of the Figures of this <hi>Stile,</hi> that will hardly pass: and some will not stick to say, that the Writer of this <hi>Letter,</hi> has with this dash of his Pen, declared more Men <hi>Enemies</hi> to the King, than ever he will be able to make <hi>Friends</hi> to him. He tells them next, that these <hi>Enemies</hi> will be <hi>using all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to infringe the same.</hi> This is also a strong Expression. We know the use of the <hi>Noun Infraction,</hi> but <hi>Infringe</hi> is borrowed from the <hi>Notaries</hi>; yet the plain sense of this seems to be, that those <hi>Enemies</hi> will disturb the <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> of which I do not hear any of them have the least thought, yet by a secret Figure of the <hi>Secretary Stile,</hi> perhaps this belongs to all those who either think that the <hi>King</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it by Law, or that will not give their Vote to confirm it in <hi>Parliament</hi>: but I am not so well acquainted with all the Mysteries of this <hi>Stile,</hi> as to know its full depth.</p>
                     <p>There comes next a long period of 50 words, for I was at the pains to count them all, which seemed a little too prolix for so short a <hi>letter,</hi> especially in one that writes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>French</hi> pattern. <hi>But as ever the Happiness of his Subjects, Standing in Liberty of Conscience, and the Security of their Properties, next the Glory of God, hath been his Majesty's great End; So he Intends to continue, if he have all suteable Encouragement and Concurrence from you, in your Doctrine and Practice.</hi> The putting <hi>ever</hi> at the beginning of the Period, and at so great a Distance from that to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, is a new beauty of <hi>Stile.</hi> And the <hi>Standing</hi> of this <hi>Happiness,</hi> makes me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on that which I hear a <hi>Scotch Preacher</hi>

delivered in a <hi>Sermon,</hi> that he doubted this <hi>Liberty</hi> would prove but like a <hi>Standing Drink.</hi> The <hi>King's receiving suteable Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from his Subjects,</hi> agrees ill with the height of <hi>Stile</hi> that went before, of <hi>appointing what the Parliament must do. Kings</hi> receive returns of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> from their <hi>Subjects</hi>; but hitherto <hi>Encouragement</hi> was a word used among Equals: the applying it to the <hi>King,</hi> is a new figure. A man not versed in the <hi>Secretary Stile</hi> would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed this matter thus. <hi>His Majesty has ever made the Happiness of his Subjects, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in Liberty of Conscience, and the Security of Property, his great end, next to the Glory of God: and he intends to do so still, if he receives all suteable returns from you in your Doctrine and practice.</hi> I have marked this the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to make the difference between the <hi>Common</hi> and the <hi>Secretary Stile</hi> the more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But what need is there of the <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Addressers,</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> if he <hi>appoints the next Parliament to take off all the Penal Laws.</hi> Must we likewise believe that His Majesty's Zeal for the <hi>Happiness of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> depends on the Behaviour of These <hi>Addressers</hi>: and on the <hi>Encouragement</hi> that he receives from them, so that he will not <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> it, unless they <hi>Encourage</hi> him in it. This is but an Incertain tenure, and not like to be <hi>perpetual.</hi> But after all the <hi>Secretary Stile</hi> is not the <hi>Royal Stile,</hi> so notwithstanding this beautiful Period, we hope our Happiness is more steady, than to turn upon the <hi>Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings</hi> of a few Men: otherwise if it is a <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Happiness</hi> yet it is a very tottering one. The <hi>Protestant Penal Statutes,</hi> is another of his Elegancies: for since all the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> as well those against <hi>Papists,</hi> as those against <hi>Dissenters,</hi> were made by <hi>Protestant Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> one does not see how fitly this Epithete comes in here; another would have worded this, thus, <hi>the Penal Statutes made against Protestants.</hi> But the <hi>new Stile</hi> has figures pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it self, that pass in the <hi>Common Stile</hi> for <hi>Improprieties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Noble <hi>Lord</hi> is not contented to raise His Majesty's Glory above all other <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Kings,</hi> in this grant of <hi>Liberty or Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which there is no competition to be made; for tho the Most <hi>Christian King,</hi> who is the <hi>Eldest son of that Church,</hi> has indeed exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted her <hi>Orders</hi> in their full extent of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet His Majesty, who is but the <hi>Cadet</hi> in that <hi>Churche's</hi> Catalogue of honour, it seems does not think that he is yet so much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his <hi>Mother</hi> as to gratify her by the Destruction of his People: yet I say, as if this were too little, the <hi>King's</hi> Glory is here carried farther, even above the <hi>Protestant Kings, who have gone before him: whose Maxime was to undo you, by Fining, Confining and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away your Estates, and to harrass you in your Persons, Liberties and Priviledges.</hi> Here is an honour that is done the King's <hi>Ancestors</hi> by one of his <hi>Secretaries,</hi> which is indeed new, and of his own Invention: the <hi>Protestant Kings</hi> can be no other than the Kings <hi>Brother, his Father, and his Grandfather. Kings</hi> shut out Q. <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> who might have been brought in if the more general term of <hi>Crowned heads</hi> had been made use of; but as the Writer has ordered it, the satyr falls singly on the King's <hi>Progenitors:</hi> for the <hi>Papers</hi> that were found in the <hi>Strong Box,</hi> will go near to put the late <hi>King</hi> out of the list of <hi>Protestant Kings:</hi> so that this Reproach lies wholly on the King's <hi>Father</hi> and his <hi>Grand-father.</hi> It is a little surprising, after all the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that has been Imployed to raise the Character of the late <hi>Martyr</hi> to so high a pitch, that one of his Sons <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> should set it under his hand in a <hi>letter</hi> that he pretends is written by the <hi>King's</hi> Commands, <hi>that he made it a Maxime to undo his People.</hi> The Writer of this <hi>Letter</hi> should have avoided the mentioning of <hi>fines,</hi> since it is not so long, since both <hi>He</hi> and his <hi>Brother</hi> valued themselves on a point that they carried in the <hi>Council of Scotland,</hi> that <hi>Husbands</hi> should be fined for their <hi>wives</hi> not going to <hi>Church,</hi> tho it was not founded on any Law.

living <hi>he</hi> ought to be the last that should speak of <hi>the taking away Estates</hi>; who got a very fair one during the present <hi>Reign,</hi> by an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> that Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in a <hi>Method</hi> as new as his <hi>Stile</hi> is; Upon this ground, that two <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councellours</hi> declared, they believed him <hi>guilty.</hi> He will hardly find among all the <hi>Maximes of those Protestant Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Kings</hi> any one that will Justify this.</p>
                     <p>It seems the <hi>New Stile</hi> is not very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in Words, since <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>three</hi> times repeated in so short a <hi>Letter</hi>: He tells them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that their <hi>Doctrine must tend to cause all the subjects to walk obediently</hi>; now by <hi>obediently</hi> in this <hi>Stile,</hi> is to <hi>obey the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Pomer without reserve</hi>; for to <hi>obey ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law,</hi> would pass now for a Crime: this being then his meaning, it is probable that the <hi>Encouragements</hi> which are necessary to make His Majesty conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the happiness of his Subjects, will not be so very great, as to Merit the <hi>perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this favour.</hi> There is with this a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy charge laid upon them as to their <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; that it must be such as shall be most pleasing to His Majesty</hi>; for certainly that can only be by their turning <hi>Papists</hi>: since a <hi>Prince</hi> that is so zealous for his <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as His Majesty is, cannot be so well pleased with any other thing as with this. <hi>Their concurring with the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Penal Laws,</hi> comes over again; for tho Repetitions are Impertinencies in the <hi>Common Stile,</hi> they are Flowers in the <hi>new one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Conclusion, he tells them, that the <hi>King expects, that they will continue their prayers for him</hi>; yet this does not agree too well with a <hi>Catholick</hi> Zeal: for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of <hi>Damned Hereticks</hi> cannot be worth the asking; for the third time he tells them to <hi>look well to their Doctrine</hi>: now this is a little ambiguous; for it may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signify, that they should study the Controversies well, so as to be able to defend their Doctrine solidly, or that they should so mince it, that nothing may fall from them in their <hi>Sermons</hi> against <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> this will be indeed a <hi>looking to their Doctrine</hi>; but I do not know whether it will be thought a <hi>looking well to it or not.</hi> He adds, <hi>that their Example be Influential:</hi> I confess this hard new Word frighted me: I suppose the meaning of it is, that <hi>their practice may be such as that it may have an Influence on others</hi>: yet there are both good and bad Influences, a good Influence will be the animating the people to a Zeal for their <hi>Religion</hi>; and a <hi>bad one</hi> will be the slackning and sofning of that Zeal. A little more Clearness here had not been amiss.</p>
                     <p>As for the last Words of this Letter; <hi>that all these are his Majesty's Commands</hi>; it is very hard for me to bring my self to believe them. For certainly he has more Piety for the Memory of the <hi>late Martyr,</hi> and more regard both to <hi>himself,</hi> to his <hi>children,</hi> and to his <hi>people,</hi> than to have ever given any such commands.</p>
                     <p>In order to the communicating this Piece of Elegance to the World, I wish the Translating it into <hi>French</hi> were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Mr. <hi>d' Albeville</hi>: that it may appear whether the <hi>Secretary Stile</hi> will look better in his <hi>Irish French,</hi> than it does now in the <hi>Scotch English</hi> of him who pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne dit.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. THe Accusing the <hi>Church of England</hi> of Want of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> or the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to a <hi>new Test,</hi> after so fresh a one, with relation to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> argues a high degree of Confidence in him who undertakes it. <hi>She</hi> knew well what were the Doctrines and Practices of those of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> with Relation to <hi>Hereticks</hi>; and yet <hi>She</hi> was so true to her <hi>Loyalty,</hi> that <hi>She</hi> shut her eyes on all the Temptations, that so just a fear could raise in her: and <hi>She</hi> set her self to support His <hi>Majesties</hi> Right of <hi>Succession,</hi> with so much Zeal, that <hi>She</hi> thereby not only put her self in the power of her Enemies; but <hi>She</hi> has also exposed her self to the Scorn of those who insult over her in her Misfortune. <hi>She</hi> lost the Affections even of many of her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; who thought that her Zeal for an Interest, which was then so much decry'd, was a little too fervent: and all those who judged severely of the proceedings, thought that the Opposition which <hi>She</hi> made to the side that then went so high, had more Heat than Decency in it.

                     </gap> There appeared such peculiar Marks of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Heartiness, at every time that the <hi>Duke</hi> was named, whether in Drinking his Health, or upon graver Occasions, that it seemed affected: and when the late <hi>King</hi> himself (whose Word they took that he was a <hi>Protestant</hi>) was spoke of but coldly, the very Name of the <hi>Duke</hi> set her Children all on fire; this made many conclude, that they were ready to Sacrifice all to him; for indeed their behaviour was inflamed with so much Heat, that the greater part of the <hi>Nation</hi> believed they waited for a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to declare themselves. <hi>Faith in Jesus Christ</hi> was not a more frequent Subject of the <hi>Sermons</hi> of many, than <hi>Loyalty</hi>; and the <hi>Right of the Succession to the Crown,</hi> the Heat that appeared in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and the Learning that was in their <hi>Books</hi> on these Subjects, and the Eloquent Strains that were in their <hi>Addresses,</hi> were all <hi>Originals</hi>; and made the World conclude, that whatever might be

laid to their charge, they should never be accused of any want of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> at least in this <hi>King's</hi> time, while the remembrance of so signal a service was so fresh. When His <hi>Majesty</hi> came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> these men did so entirely depend on the Promise that he made, <hi>to maintain the Church of England,</hi> that the doubting of the performance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them the worst sort of <hi>Infidelity.</hi> They believed, that in His <hi>Majesty,</hi> the <hi>Hero,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> would be too strong for the <hi>Papist</hi>: and when any one told them, <hi>How weak a tie the Faith of a Catholick to Hereticks must needs be,</hi> they could not hearken to this with any patience; but looked on His <hi>Majesties Promise</hi> as a thing so Sacred, that they imploy'd their Interest to carry all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi> of <hi>Parliament-Men,</hi> for those that were recommended by the <hi>Court,</hi> with so much Vigour, that it laid them open to much Censure. In <hi>Parliament</hi> they moved for no <hi>Lawes</hi> to secure their <hi>Religion</hi>; but assuring themselves, that <hi>Honour</hi> was the Kings <hi>Idol,</hi> they laid hold on it, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that a publick reliance on his <hi>Word,</hi> would give them an Interest in his <hi>Majesty,</hi> that was Generous, and more suteable to the Nobleness of a Princely Nature than any new <hi>Laws</hi> could be: so that they acquiesced in it, and gave the <hi>King</hi> a vast <hi>Revenue</hi> for Life: In the Rebellion that followed, they shewed with what Zeal they adhered to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> even against a Pretender that declared for them. And in the Session of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which came after that, they shewed their disposition to assist the <hi>King</hi> with new <hi>Supplies</hi>; and were willing to Excuse and Indemnify all that was past; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they desired with all possible Modesty, that the <hi>Laws</hi> which His <hi>Majesty</hi> had both <hi>Promised,</hi> and at his Coronation had <hi>Sworn</hi> to maintain, might be <hi>executed.</hi> Here is their Crime, which has raised all this Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry; They did not move for the Execution of Severe or Penal <hi>Laws,</hi> but were willing to let those sleep, till it might appear by the behaviour of the <hi>Papists,</hi> whether they might deserve that there should be any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation made of them in their Favour. Since that time, our <hi>Church-men</hi> have been constant in mixing their Zeal for their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> with a Zeal for <hi>Loyalty</hi> against <hi>Rebellion,</hi> because they think these two are very well consistent one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

                  <p n="2">II. One Instance in which the <hi>Church of England</hi> shewed her Submission to the <hi>Court,</hi> was, that as soon as the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> had drawn a new Storm upon themselves, by their medling in the matter of the <hi>Exclusion,</hi> many of her Zealous <hi>Members</hi> went into that Prosecution of them, which the <hi>Court</hi> set on foot, with more Heat, than was perhaps either justifiable in it self, or reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in those Circumstances; but how cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable soever some angry men may be, it is somewhat strange to see those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> blame us for it, which has decreed such unrelenting Severities against all that differ from her, and has enacted that not only in <hi>Parliaments</hi> but even in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils.</hi> It must needs sound odly to hear the Sons of a <hi>Church,</hi> that must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all <hi>others</hi> as soon as it can compass it, yet complain of the Excesses of <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Imprisonments,</hi> that have been of late among us. But if this Reproach seems a little strange when it is in the Mouth of a <hi>Papist,</hi> it is yet much more provoking, when it comes from any of the <hi>Court.</hi> Were not all the <hi>Orders</hi> for the late <hi>Severity</hi> sent from thence? Did not the <hi>Judges</hi> in every <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,</hi>


                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66365:23"/>
and the Favourite <hi>Justices of Peace</hi> in every Sessions, imploy all their Eloquence on this <hi>Subject</hi>? The Directions that were given to the <hi>Justices</hi> and the <hi>Grand Juries</hi> were all repeated Aggravations of this Matter: and a little <hi>Ordinary Lawyer,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other visible Merit, but an Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fury in those Matters, on which he has chiefly valued himself, was of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den taken into His <hi>Majesties</hi> special Favour, and raised up to the <hi>Highest Posts</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> All these things, led some of our Obedient <hi>Clergy,</hi> to look on it as a piece of their Duty to the <hi>King,</hi> to encourage that <hi>Severity,</hi> of which the <hi>Court</hi> seemed so fond, that almost all People thought, they had set it up for a Maxime, from which they would never depart. I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to excuse all that has been done of late years: but it is certain, that the most cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Severities</hi> have been acted by persons that were raised up to be <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi> for that very end: they were <hi>Instructed, Trusted,</hi> and <hi>Rewarded</hi> for it, both in the <hi>last</hi> and under the <hi>present</hi> Reign. <hi>Church-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were distributed, rather as Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of this devouring Zeal, than of a real Merit; and men of more moderate Tempers were not only ill lookt at, but ill used. So that it is in it self very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to throw the load of the late Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on the <hi>Church of England,</hi> without distinction: but it is worse than in good manners it is fit to call it, if this Reproach comes from the <hi>Court.</hi> And it is somewhat unbecoming to see that, which was set on at one time, disown'd at another; while yet he that was the <hi>Chief Instrument</hi> in it is still in so high a <hi>post</hi>; and begins now to treat the <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with the same <hi>Brutal Excesses,</hi> that he bestowed so lately and so liberally on the <hi>Dissenters</hi>; as if his design were to render himself e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually odious to all Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The <hi>Church of England</hi> may justly expostulate when she is treated as <hi>Seditious,</hi> after she has rendred the highest Services to the <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> that any <hi>Church</hi> now on Earth has done: She has beaten down all the Principles of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> with more Force and Learning, than any Body of men has ever yet done; and has run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of enraging her Enemies, and losing her Friends, even for those, from whom the more learned of her Members knew well what they might expect. And since our <hi>Author</hi> likes the figure of a <hi>Snake in ones Bosom</hi> so well; I could tell him, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Apologue,</hi> we took up and sheltred an <hi>Interest,</hi> that was almost Dead, and by that warmth gave it Life, which yet now with the <hi>Snake in the Bosom,</hi> is like to bite us to Death. We do not say, we are the <hi>only Church that has Principles of Loyalty</hi>; but this we may say, that we are the <hi>Church</hi> in the World that carries them the <hi>highest</hi>; as we know a <hi>Church</hi> that of all others sinks them the <hi>lowest.</hi> We do not pretend that we are <hi>Inerrable</hi> in this point, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that some of our <hi>Clergy</hi> miscarried in it upon <hi>King Edwards</hi> Death: Yet at the same time, others of our Communion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered more steadily to their <hi>Loyalty</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> than <hi>She</hi> did to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> that she made to <hi>them.</hi> Upon this Subject our <hi>Author</hi> by his false Quotation of <hi>History,</hi> forces me to set the <hi>Reader</hi> right, which if it proves to the disadvantage of his Cause, his Friends may thank him for it. I will not enter into so tedious a digression as the justifying <hi>Queen Elisabeths</hi> being Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and the throwing the <hi>Bastardy</hi> on <hi>Queen Mary</hi> must carry me to; this I will only say, that it was made out, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best sort of <hi>Arguments</hi> used by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> I mean the constant Tradition of all Ages, <hi>King Henry the</hi> VIII. marrying with <hi>Queen Katherine,</hi> was <hi>Incestuous,</hi> and by Consequence <hi>Queen Mary</hi> was the <hi>Bastard,</hi> and <hi>Queen Elisabeth</hi> was the <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate issue.</hi> But our <hi>Author</hi> not satisfied with defaming <hi>Queen Elisabeth,</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> was no sooner set up by her, <hi>than She enacted those Bloody Cannibal Laws, to Hang, Draw and Quarter the Priests of the Living God</hi>: But since these <hi>Lawes</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb

Boldness in our <hi>Authors</hi> Assertion, who says, that they had <hi>no Hope nor Interest in that Cause</hi>: The State of that <hi>Court</hi> is not so quite forgot, but that we do well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what Credit the <hi>Queen</hi> had with the <hi>King,</hi> and what Hopes <hi>She</hi> gave the <hi>Party</hi>; yet they did not so entirely espouse the <hi>Kings Cause,</hi> but that they had likewise a flying Squadron in the <hi>Parliaments Army,</hi> how boldly soever this may be denyed by our <hi>Author</hi>; for this I will give him a proof, that is beyond exception, in a <hi>Declaration</hi> of that <hi>King's,</hi> sent to the <hi>Kingdom of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> bearing date the 21. of <hi>April</hi> 1643. which is printed over and over again, and as an <hi>Author</hi> that writes the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>late Wars,</hi> has assured us the clean draught of it, corrected in some places with the <hi>King's</hi> own hand, is yet extant: so that it cannot be pretended, that this was only a bold assertion of some of the <hi>Kings Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> that might be ill affected to their Party. In that <hi>Declaration</hi> the <hi>King</hi> studied to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess his <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Justice of his Cause, and among other things, to clear himself of that Imputation that he had an <hi>Army of Papists</hi> about him, after many things said on that head, these words are added: <hi>Great numbers of that Religion have been with great alacrity entertained in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Army against us: and others have been seduced, to whom we had formerly denyed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; as appears by the Examination of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prisoners, of whom we have taken twenty and thirty at a time of one Troop or Company of that Religion.</hi> I hope our <hi>Author</hi> will not have the Impudence to dispute the Credit that is due to this Testimony: but no Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, how evident soever they may be, can affect some sort of men; that have a Secret against blushing.</p>
