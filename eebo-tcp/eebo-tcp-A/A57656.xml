            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </note> [<hi>He is not scrupulous in defect of our Churches to enter Popish Churches, and pray with Papists; for though the Heathen temples polluted the Israelites, yet the Popish impieties are not such as pollute their temples, or our prayers made in them</hi>] Observe here first, that his words imply a necessity of praying in Churches, whereas Christ bids us pray in our <hi>chambers</hi>; and the <hi>Apostle</hi> wills us to lift up pure hands in every place: <hi>Moses</hi> his prayer was heard as well on the red-sea-shore, as <hi>Aarons</hi> was in the tabernacle; and <hi>Iob</hi> was heard as well on the dung-hill, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Temple. God is not now tyed to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Garizim.</hi> Secondly, to pray with <hi>Papists,</hi> is a countenancing and a confirming of their Idolatry. Thirdly, it is a scandall to the weaker brethren, and woe to him by whom scandall cometh. Fourthly, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues notorious dissimulation and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; and we know what <hi>simulata sanctitas</hi> is.

Sixthly, Popish Churches, being actually imployed about Idolatry, doe no lesse pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and profane, then the Heathen Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did; because Popish Idolatry is no lesse (if not more) hurtfull and impious, then Heathen; for it is grosser Idolatry to worship Images, the work of mens hands, then to adore the Sun and Moon, the work of Gods hands. I reade of foure sorts of Idolatry: 1. <hi>Hermeticall,</hi> which is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images: 2. <hi>Poeticall,</hi> the worship of deified men: 3. <hi>Physicall,</hi> the worship of the great <hi>Platonick</hi> animall, the world, or the parts thereof: 4. <hi>Metaphysicall,</hi> the worship of <hi>Angels,</hi> or other created spirits: all these sorts of Idolatry are practised by Papists, except the third.</p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55644:10"/>
and <hi>Sacraments</hi>; other devices are but will-worship. Secondly, the sight of a <hi>Crucifix</hi> adored, should rather excite his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then his devotion. When <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ezechia</hi> saw the golden <hi>Calfe</hi> and brasen <hi>Serpent</hi> abused, we reade not of their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of their just indignation: a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cross is but a woodden remembrancer of <hi>Christ</hi>; and silence at the sight of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is a secret consent: and how can any be devout in that wherein God is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured?</p>

Fourthly, I confesse [<hi>it is the method of charity to suffer without reaction</hi>] in particular wrongs, but not when Gods glory is in question. <hi>Christ</hi> prayed for those that persecuted him, but whipped them that dishonoured his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers House. To suffer God to be wronged, and not to be moved, is not charity, but luke-warmnesse or stupidity.

from the soule, because it lives by it selfe, not by another, as the body doth, or by accident, as the souls of beasts do. 5. Mens soules have subsistence by themselves, not by their <hi>composita,</hi> as accidents, and the formes of beasts have; which is the cause of their decay. 6. The soule hath a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall desire to immortality, which if it should not enjoy, that desire were given to it from God in vaine: <hi>At Deus &amp; Natura nihil faciunt frustra.</hi> 7.

                     </gap> therefore Serpents should be worshipped: hee would perswade you that this was no miracle, but an <hi>Egyptian</hi> trick. Secondly, he might have more easily perswaded you, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and other Nations, from the report of this miracle, learned their worshipping of Serpents, then that <hi>Moses</hi> learned this erecting of the Serpent from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Thirdly, here could be no sympathy either between the disease and matter of the Serpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was brasse, (being there was brasse enough in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, with looking on which their stings might have been cured:) or between the figure of the Serpent and the wound; for the figure, being a quality and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, could not be the subject of <hi>sympathy</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a hid vertue, having alwaies a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall substance for the subject of it: and seeing that <hi>sympathies</hi> and <hi>antipathies</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not the matter of things, and therefore are not elementary qualities, but the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

such <hi>sympathy,</hi> as to cure an inflammation by the bare look on it afar off. Fourthly, where there is a <hi>sympathy</hi> between two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there is a delight and an attraction of the one to the other. <hi>Rhabarb,</hi> by <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> drawes <hi>choler</hi> to it; but what delight or attractive vertue was there in an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall brasen Serpent, to draw out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of a wound? Fifthly, where cures are performed by <hi>sympathy,</hi> there is a touching of the thing curing, and the thing cured: as <hi>Rhododendrum,</hi> which kills As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, being eat by them; cures men of the bitings of Serpents, being applyed to them. Sixthly, had hee told you, that it was not the image of the Serpent, but the imagination of the beholder that cured him, hee had said somewhat; but yet hee had deceived you: for, though the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation helps much to the curing of some diseases in one or two, perhaps among a thousand; yet it was never knowne, that so many people together, as the Israelites, should have each one of them such strong imaginations, as to be cured by them: It was not then either the image, or the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55644:23"/>
that cured them, but their faith in him that was lifted upon the Crosse, as the Serpent was erected by <hi>Moses</hi> in the desart.</p>
                  <p>These other perswasions of Sathan [<hi>to make you doubt of</hi> Elias <hi>his miracle, of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion of Sodome, of the Manna in the desart</hi>] are impious and ridiculous; for though <hi>Bitumen</hi> and <hi>Naphtha</hi> will suddenly, and at some distance catch fire; yet hence it will not follow, that <hi>Elias</hi> used such stuffe for the consuming of his sacrifice; for the stuffe, being a fat substance, gathered from the superficies of the water of <hi>Asphaltites</hi> lake, or the dead-sea neere <hi>Iericho,</hi> was as well knowne to <hi>Baals</hi> priests, as to <hi>Elias,</hi> being neighbours to that lake. Againe, the Text saith, that the <hi>fire</hi> of the LORD came downe, which consumed the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and dried up the water; and how could <hi>Eliah</hi> so deceive such a multitude of people, being there present, as to kindle a fire in the water with <hi>Bitumen,</hi> and they not perceive it?

                     </note> First, you call the Heavens [<hi>the immateriall world</hi>:] so you confound the <hi>celestiall</hi> world with the <hi>intellectuall,</hi> which only is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, and had its being in the divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, before it was made. Secondly, if the Heavens be immateriall, they are not movable; for matter is the subject of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Why then doe you call the great Sphere <hi>the first movable</hi>? Thirdly, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall world cannot be the habitation of materiall substances; where then will the bodies of the <hi>Saints,</hi> after the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, have their residence? Fourthly, if the Heavens have not matter, they have not quantity and parts. Fifthly, nor are they compounded substances of matter and forme, but simple, as spirits. Sixthly, though they have not such a matter, as the elementary world, yet immateriall they are not: they have a matter, the subject of quantity, though not of generation and

corruption. Your second errour is [<hi>that you call Gods essence the habitation of Angels; and therefore they live every-where, where his essence is.</hi>] Divinitie tells us, that <hi>Angels</hi> are in a place <hi>definitivè</hi>; and that they, as we all, live and move in him, as in our <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, protecting,</hi> and <hi>sustaining</hi> cause, but not as in a place; for <hi>Angels</hi> move out of one place to another, and while they are on earth, they are not in heaven: but if Gods essence be their habitation, then they never change place; for his essence is every-where, and so you make them partakers of Gods proper attribute, <hi>Ubiquity.</hi> Your third errour is [<hi>that God hath not subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the creation of Angels to ours, but, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring spirits, they are willing to fulfill Gods will in the affaires of man.</hi>] Then, belike, God made them not to be ministring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the heires of salvation, but they are so of their owne accord: if so, wee are more beholding to them for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, protection and instruction of us, then to God, who made them not for this end, but (as you say) for his owne glory: But if you were as good at <hi>Divinity,</hi> as at <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi>

Your fourth errour is [<hi>that both generation and creation are founded on contrarieties.</hi>] If creation were a transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which still presupposeth a subject, I would be of your opinion; but seeing it is not, and hath no subject, without which contrarieties cannot be in nature, I deny, that creation is founded on contrarieties; neither is <hi>non-entity</hi> contrary, but the totall privation of being, which God gave to the creature.</p>

Fourthly, the effect is never nobler then the cause; but the soule, in regard of understanding, doth in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie far exceed the body. Fifthly, a body can no more produce a spirit, then an horse can beget a man, they being different species. Sixthly, if the soule were propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in or by the seed, then this were a true enunciation, <hi>Semen est animal rationale,</hi> and so the seed should be man.

Wee are all by nature the sons of wrath, by grace &amp; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we are made the sons of God; not by changing of our natures and essences, as <hi>Illyricus</hi> thought: for, though <hi>Paul</hi> changed his condition and name, hee changed not his nature; for he was the same man, being a vessell of mercy, which he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vessell of wrath. [<hi>If hee saith, that in Eternity there is no change</hi>;] I answer, that that continued duration, which wee call
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55644:50"/>
Eternitie, is unchangeable; yet in the things themselves, which are eternall, there is a passive power or possibilitie of change, or else wee cannot say, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse is a property in God, but communicable to the creature, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. As for the fire, it may doubtlesse for a while cease to be hot, and yet not cease to be fire: as that fire in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> furnace, which did not touch the three <hi>Children,</hi> and yet burned the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; this it could not have done, had it not been fire.</p>

[<hi>No annihilation can proceed from God: it is more impossible, that</hi> not-being <hi>should flow from him, then that cold should flow immediately from fire.</hi>] 'Tis true, that God is not an efficient cause of annihilation (for of a <hi>non-entity</hi> there can be no cause) yet we may safely say, that hee is the deficient cause: for, as the creatures had both their creation, and have still their conservation, by the influx of Gods Almighty power, who, as the Apostle saith, sustaines all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55644:56"/>
things by the word of his power: so if he should suspend or withdraw this influx, all things must returne to nothing, as they were made of nothing. There is then in the creature both a passive possibilitie of annihilation, and in God an active possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to withdraw his assistance: and why should we be afraid to affirm such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in God? Before the world was made there was annihilation, and yet God was still the same, both before and since, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration in him: So, if the world were annihilated, God should lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, being in himselfe all things.

Besides, as God created not the world by necessity of his nature, but by his free will; so by that same freedome of will, hee su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines what hee hath created, and not by any necessity: and therefore not only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible bodies, but even spirits and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, have in them a possibility of annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

But, though there be a possibility in the creatures (if God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his power) of annihilation, yet wee must not think, that this possibility in them flowes from the principles of their owne nature; for in materiall substances there is no such possibility, seeing the matter is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: and much lesse can it be in imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall substances, in which there is neither physicall composition, nor contrariety.

Fourthly, that the body of a man is not the same it was, when it was the body of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55644:58"/>
a childe. Fifthly, he illustrates this by some Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: As, that a ship is still the same, though it be all new timbered: The Thames is still the same river, though the water is not the same this day that flowed heretofore: That a glasse full of water, taken out of the sea, is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the rest of the water; but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe againe, becomes the same with the other stocke: and the glasse, being againe filled with the sea-water, though not out of the same place, yet it is the same glasse full of water that it was before: That, if the soule of a newly dead man should be united to another body, taken from some hill in</hi> America, <hi>this body is the same identicall body hee lived with before his death.</hi>] This is the summe of Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi>'s Philosophy and Divinity concerning the resurrection; In which are these mistakes: First, the resurrection, by this opinion, is overthrowne; a <hi>surrection</hi> wee may call it of a body, but not the <hi>resurrection</hi> of the same body. This is no new opinion, but the heresie of the <hi>Marcionites, Basilidians,</hi> and <hi>Valentinians,</hi> whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos sententiae Sadducaeorum,</hi> as acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but halfe a resurrection: <hi>Resurrectio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci

                     </gap>, to transfigure or transforme our vile bodies in the resurrection; but if the same numericall body rise not, our resurrection will be a <hi>forming</hi> of a new body, not a <hi>transforming</hi> of the old: Or, an <hi>assumption</hi> of a body rather, then a <hi>resurrection:</hi> Or, if you please, a <hi>Pythagoricall transanimation.</hi> Thirdly, the end why man was made, or why his body was united to his soule, was, that both might enjoy God, the chief <hi>bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>; but man should be frustrated of his end, if the same body did not rise that was given him in the creation. Fourthly, if the essentiall forme of mans body was totally lost, as the formes of other creatures are by corruption, wee might have some reason to thinke, that the body should not rise the same numerically which fell: but mans soule, which is his essentiall forme, remains still the same; therefore the body shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the same. Fifthly, though the childe begotten be not <hi>numerically</hi> the same with the parent begetting, because the whole matter of the parent is not transfused into
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55644:59"/>
the childe; yet, in the resurrection, the same numericall body shall returne that fell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole matter of it remaines. Sixthly, though the union of the body to the soule in the resurrection be not <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> the same action that was in generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the body shall be the same; because the <hi>entity</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> of the body is not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the multiplication or iteration of accidents, such as union is. Seventhly, our resurrection shall bee conformable to <hi>Christs</hi>; but he raised up the same numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>temple</hi> of his body which was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as the same numericall body of <hi>Ionas</hi> was disgorged, which was swallowed by the <hi>Whale.</hi> Eighthly, if in artificiall things the introduction of a new forme makes not the matter to be <hi>identically</hi> different from what it was, much lesse can mans body be any other then what it was, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the same essentiall forme, which was never lost, though for a while separated. Ninthly, it stands with Gods justice and mans comfort, that the same body which was the soules companion in tribulation, should be also companion with it in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55644:59"/>
that the same body, which was to the soule the organ of iniquity, should be also the organ of paine and misery; the same soules and bodies that run together in the same race, let them weare the same crown, and reigne together in the same glory.

This was <hi>Iob</hi>'s comfort on the dung-hill, <hi>that though wormes destroy his body, yet hee should see God in his flesh, whom I my selfe</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall see, and mine eyes shall behold, and none other for mee, though my reines are consumed within me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His second mistake is, [<hi>That the forme, not the matter, gives numericall individuation to the body.</hi>] Is the dead body of an <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian numerically</hi> the same with the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of a <hi>Scythian</hi>? he will not say so; then they are different bodies: but by what? the forme is gone: is not then the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in respect of the matter and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which remaine in the carkasse? 'Tis true, that the chiefe cause of <hi>individuation</hi> is the <hi>forme</hi> in men, yet not as it gives es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; for so it makes the <hi>specificall</hi> union
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55644:60"/>
by which all men are one; but as it gives existence to the matter, which it terminates with quantitie, and invests with other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which matter and accidents are the secondary cause of <hi>individuation:</hi> but in dead bodies, the forme of man being gone, there remaines nothing but the form of a <hi>carkasse,</hi> or the form of <hi>mixtion,</hi> which determinating the matter of the <hi>carkasse</hi> with its accidents, makes up the <hi>numericall individuation,</hi> by which one carkasse is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from another.</p>
                  <p>His third mistake, [<hi>That the matter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forme, hath no actuall being.</hi>] The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it is a substance and hath <hi>entity,</hi> as it is the other principle of generation, and as it is the cause of motion, it must needs have an actuall being, or else it can be none of these: it must be all one with privation, if it have no <hi>actuall being.</hi> 'Tis true, it hath not that measure of actuall being, which it receives from the <hi>forme,</hi> till the union; and yet I see not how the <hi>matter</hi> is at any time without <hi>forme,</hi> seeing it is never without <hi>privation,</hi> which presupposeth a forme in the matter, which is to be expelled
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55644:60"/>
for introduction of another.</p>
                  <p>His fourth mistake, [<hi>That identitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to the matter by it selfe.</hi>] So he may as well say, that <hi>entity</hi> belongs not to the matter by it selfe; for <hi>identity</hi> followes the <hi>entity,</hi> as <hi>unity</hi> doth, which is in a maner the same that <hi>identity:</hi> he should have said, that matter gives not identity to things, neither <hi>genericall, specificall,</hi> nor <hi>numericall,</hi> for such proceeds from the forme; yet there can be neither of these <hi>identities,</hi> without the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for the conjunction of the forme with the matter makes <hi>identity</hi>; and yet before the forme be united, the particular parts of the matter have their particular <hi>identities</hi> and inclinations to such and such formes: as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mans seed to the forme of a man, not of an <hi>horse</hi>; an <hi>egge</hi> to the forme of a <hi>chick,</hi> not of a <hi>man</hi>; so after the soule is gone, that identity remaines in the matter which was before, to wit, an inclination to that forme which once it had, rather then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other; or, rather then any other part of the matter can have to this forme.</p>
                  <p>His fifth mistake, [<hi>That the body of a man is not the same it was.</hi>] Philo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ophers say,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55644:61"/>
that the matter remaines after the forme is gone; so that a dead body, in respect of its matter, is the same it was whilst the soule was in it: If then the absence or change of the forme takes not away the identity of the matter, much lesse can that identity of the body be gone, whilst the soule remains in it. They that bring markes and spots in their skins, as <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> did, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them still untill their skin be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; which shewes, that the body is the same in infancie a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d old age. If <hi>Ulysses</hi> had not brought home, after his twenty years travell, the same body he carried out, his <hi>Nurse</hi> had not knowne him by his foot; nor had his dogge fawned on him. I know the common opinion is, that the body is the same in respect of continuation, and because it hath the same essentiall forme; otherwise there is a continuall deperdition and reparation of the matter by nutrition and auction: but I cannot find, that there is any <hi>deperdition</hi> of the solid parts, or any alteration in the <hi>heterogeneall,</hi> but onely in the bloud and spirits, or such fluid parts: And doubtlesse, the <hi>primogeneall</hi> or <hi>radicall</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55644:61"/>
humour, which wee bring with us, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine still in us, till it be quite wasted, and then there is no reparation; so that the body is still the same, whilst the soul is in it, both in respect first, of continuation; secondly, of the forme of man; thirdly, of the forme of mixtion; fourthly, of the solid <hi>homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall</hi> parts; fifthly, of all the <hi>heterogeneall</hi>; sixthly, of the <hi>radicall</hi> moisture and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat: so that if there be any deperdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is in respect of the fluid parts only, and that so slowly and insensibly, that there is no reason why wee should thinke, the body of an old man to be any other then what it was in child-hood; and if it were not the same, it could not be the fit subject of generation and corruption, nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, augmentation and alteration.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for his Similies, they will not hold: for, a <hi>ship</hi> which is all new timbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though it be called the same in vulgar speech, yet indeed is not the same; for the forme which remaines, is onely artificiall and accidentall, which ought not to carry away the name of identity or diversity from the materialls, which are substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55644:62"/>
Secondly, the <hi>Thames</hi> is the same ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver now that heretofore, not in respect of the <hi>water,</hi> which is still flowing, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the same <hi>springs</hi> that feed it, the same <hi>channell</hi> that contains it, and the same <hi>bankes</hi> that restraine it; so that the <hi>Thames</hi> is still the same, but the water without these other makes not the <hi>Thames:</hi> neither is there any consequence from a fluid to a solid body. Thirdly, a glasse full of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, is the same glasse when it's full and empty; but the water is not the same which is taken out of divers parts of the sea: I meane not the same <hi>individuall</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though it be the same <hi>specificall,</hi> to wit, of the same sea; no more then two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lopt off from a tree are the same, though the tree be the same. Fourthly, the soule of a newly dead man, united to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, will not make it the same <hi>iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> body he lived with before his death; for, if the soule of <hi>Dives</hi> had entered into the scabby body of <hi>Iob</hi> or <hi>Lazarus,</hi> had that been his indenticall body which hee left? then that tongue of <hi>Iob</hi> or <hi>Lazarus</hi> which was, must be tormented in flames,

                  <p>In the Postscript [<hi>Sir</hi> Kenelme <hi>doth not conceive grace to be a quality infused by God into the soule, but a concatenation rather or complex of motives, that encline a man to piety, and set on foot by Gods grace and favour.</hi>] 'Tis true, wee are not justified by any inherent or infused quality in us, which the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> call <hi>gratia gratis data</hi>; for when the <hi>Scripture</hi> speaks of our <hi>justification,</hi> it speaks of that <hi>grace,</hi> which is set in opposition to <hi>workes</hi>; not only such as may be done by a naturall man out of the light of reason, but such as are called the gifts of Gods Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified not by his workes, but by faith;<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
