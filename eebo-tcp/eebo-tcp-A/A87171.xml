            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Humble Petition, or Repreſentation of Mr. <hi>William Harriſon,</hi> Gentleman, and Souldier, To his Excellency Sir THO. FAIRFAX, Captain Generall of the Forces raiſed for the King and Parliament.</head>
            <p>MAy it pleaſe Your Excellency to understand, that the true cauſe which made me for a while to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue my Service in your Regiment, was upon notice given me that one Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> had got an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution forth againſt me, Who about foure yeares ſince did violently draw his Sword upon me, and I gave backe a little, and drew mine to defend my ſelf. It was my fortune to wound him, and I could have killed him, but I cloſed with him to diſarme him, at what time one <hi>Gadſon</hi> a Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ran in, and laid hold of my haire, whereupon I was inforc'd to defend my ſelfe and to draw my knife, and did cut one in the face, and the others fingers, and had got them both downe, and diſarmed them; for which the Committee of Northampton kept me in priſon ſeven Moneths and thirteen dayes without Bail; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got my liberty by the meanes of Sir <hi>Rowland St. Iohn,</hi> and other Gentlemen that were my friends, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bought a brace of Geldings, and came to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies Regiment, to Capt. <hi>Laurence</hi> his Troope, where I and my man did Service above a twelve-Moneth, untill I heard that my Enemy Mr. <hi>Marriot,</hi> a man of an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſpirit, who ſued me in the time of my ſervice under your Excellency (I not knowing it) had gotten an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forth againſt me, <hi>Gadſon</hi> and he being the one witnes for the other. This was about three dayes before the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb facs="tcp:114297:2"/>
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at what time I loſt out of my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a Gelding worth (as times are now) at leaſt 16 pound. Being very loath to become a priſoner againe, I acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Captaine with my ſad condition, and deſired him that he would grant me a Paſſe to goe into <hi>Holland;</hi> hee deny'd me, but at the laſt did grant it. The man whom I did hurt had bad ſeven Articles of a most high Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proved againſt him; and the whole Country wondred that he was not ſequeflred. It will be proved that he bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a Gentleman who gave falſe information to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte. His goods were then worth two thouſand pound to be proved, but he is ſince broke, and now lyeth in Gaole. All his goods are made away. Your Petitioner hath two friends that have paid 500 pound for him. And three or foure honeſt men were inforced to fly their Countrey for his Debts. Many have paied 100 l. and 40. l. a Man for him; in the meane time hee lyeth in jaole, drinketh Sack and is merrie. His ſureties curſe that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and their Wives and Children who miſ-informed the Committee; And ſay that if the Committee had done right, they ſhould have ſequeſtred his eſtate, which might have helped to have paid the Souldier.</p>
            <p>This buſineſſe and theſe ſufferings being out of your Petitioners way above one hundred and forty pound as hee will prove, and the onely occaſion that your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to his great griefe was inforced to leave for a while the Regime it as Captain <hi>Laurence</hi> &amp; Lieutenant <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> can beare him witneſſe, your Petitioner moſt humbly prayeth that your Excellence will be pleaſed to take him &amp; his Petition into your conſideration.</p>

            <head>A further Relation of the Grievances of the ſaid M. <hi>William Harriſon,</hi> with a true diſcovery of abundance of Treaſure ſent downe into the Weſt, and divers perſons there imployed to raiſe Forces (under pretence of the Service for <hi>Ireland)</hi> to make Warre againſt the Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Excellency.</head>
            <p>HAving received a Paſſe for the Low-Countries, and intending to take ſhipping at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> I was diſſwaded from it by one Maſter <hi>Duke,</hi> who liveth within ten miles of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> it was at that time thought that the <hi>Scots</hi> and we ſhould have differed; whereupon I marched North-ward, but God be thanked, it was not ſo; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I turned my courſe and marched Weſt-wards to ſome of my wives friends, knowing it not ſafe to returne to my own Countrey, my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Marriot</hi> having ſuch power with great Men in it. There I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> ſhould be Field-Marſhall for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> whereupon I came to <hi>London,</hi> and got a friend, one Maſter <hi>Vickars</hi> a Wine-Merchant, to goe along with me to the Field-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, and 40 men whom I had liſted to goe with me into <hi>Ireland,</hi> in caſe that things were ſo ſetled, that the Army might disband and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Arreares, but when I came to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> I found that the Field-Marſhall was gone to the Head-quarters at <hi>Saffron-Wallden,</hi> I made haſte after him, and having enquired out his Quarters, I made bold to goe into his Parlour where I found him ſitting alone; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſented my ſervice to him, he very nobly ſhewed me kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and asked me to whom I formerly did belong; I told him, and ſhewed him my Paſſe; whereupon he aſſured me, that on the next day my Captaine and Major would be in Towne, and moreover aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that if the Service went on, I ſhould not want Command: I was not willing to ſtay there long, moneys being ſhort, and having had no pay in eleven moneths. But the next day my Major and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine came, and they did me the favour, readily to conſent and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me unto Major Generall <hi>Skippon,</hi> whom we found very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie upon the Treatie, where Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ſeeing my Captaine, imployed him upon a Meſſage to ſome Gentlemen in the Towne: But I ſtaid and heard the Grievances related in the Church, having taken a reſolution with my ſelfe, not to adventure for <hi>Ireland</hi> without the Army was ſatisfied and disbanded. It was my fortune pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after to obſerve Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> in the ſtreet, I ran after him, and once more made bold to demand of his honour how the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe ſtood for <hi>Ireland?</hi> He told me, That for ought he knew, I might
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114297:3"/>
have as much Command there as himſelfe. Whereupon I matched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Weſt, where ſtaying for a ſeaſon, I could heare but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Truth in any thing; I reſolved therefore to returne to <hi>London,</hi> to underſtand how the Affaires ſtood, hoping that in ſo much time I ſhould find things ſetled. My miſ-fortune was ſuch, that my Horſe miſcarried in the way, but a friend lent me another, which when I came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I ſent downe by the Carrier. Being come unto the Citie, I found a generall Melancholly and Diſtraction of Spirit, which made me feare a new Warre, inſomuch that I could not ſleepe all night; In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I tooke Poſt for the Weſt againe, but had no warrant, and in this diſpatch I continued untill I came to <hi>Marleborough,</hi> where I deſired Poſt-Horſe to ride all night, which the Poſt-maſter granted, but the Committee denyed, partly becauſe I had no warrant, and partly becauſe they underſtood that I belonged to Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax;</hi> I told them that I was very ſorry that any who belonged to his Excellency ſhould be ſo under-valued as not to be allowed Poſt-Horſes for money to follow their neceſſary imployments. The Poſt told me, that the Committee was informed, that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was falling off from what he was. I anſwered him in the heat of blood, <hi>That he was the ſonne of a Whore that told him ſo.</hi> And ſo having ſatisfied the charges of the houſe, I walked forth into the ſtreet, no man regarding me, where an honeſt young-man, one who had beene a Souldier, <hi>Thomas Slatter</hi> by name, proffered to goe along with me, and to doe me any courteſie he could for Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> which accordingly he did, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying my Cloake for me, I all that night travail'd in my Bootes, and by the next night we came into <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> and had marched on foot full fiftie miles. There I found a friend who lent me a Horſe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed me unto other friends; being with whom, I did ſend for divers Gentlemen from the Counties of <hi>Gloceſter, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> who loved me well: And having communicated my ſelfe unto them, and ſhewed that the intent of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was to reſtore the King to his Parliament to Gods glory and our comfort, he enjoying his Crowne and Dignitie, and the Subjects their Liberties and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I found the Gentlemen ſo propenſe unto that Cauſe, that for ſo good an end I ſhould not want for men, money, horſe, or Armes, but I readily ſhould have them.</p>
            <p>Finding ſuch a generall inclination, I ſuddenly prepared for <hi>London</hi> againe, and tooke my way by <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> and ſent two meſſengers on foot to <hi>Stow-in-the-Old,</hi> to lodge there at the ſigne of the Crowne, at the houſe of one <hi>Dickson.</hi> They came thither on Saturday night was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114297:4"/>
three weekes, and found there ten gueſts, ſeven of them ſeeming to be Gentlemen, and the other three to be their ſervants, who were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a ſpeciall friend in private to that houſe. I came there on the Lords Day in the morning, and brought with me a Gentleman that was my friend: Theſe ten being merry, and frolike with the Hoſt of the houſe, he told them, That the King and Parliament would agree. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately they declared themſelves to be utterly againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and his Army, rayling againſt his Excellency in a nature too high to report, and withall affirming, That if they had came through his Army they had beene all made ſlaves. Thereupon they confeſſed, they were going to <hi>Worceſter</hi> to rayſe Forces for <hi>Ireland.</hi> They had in their Port-mantle as much gold and ſilver as two men could eaſily lay upon a Horſe, they could not put their hands into their pockets to pay for a quart of Wine, but they pulled forth handfulls of gold. I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that this pretence of them for <hi>Ireland</hi> was onely a deſigne to rayſe Forces againſt his Excellencies Army, for <hi>I</hi> knew it could not be for <hi>Ireland, I</hi> called unto me the man of the houſe who was my friend, and told him that they were baſe fellowes, for <hi>I</hi> was confident, that what they had ſaid was falſe: <hi>I</hi> therefore deſired him that he would be pleaſed to depart his houſe; and when they were ſet at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>I</hi> and the three men with me would kill three or foure of them, and give quarter to the reſt, and bring up their money, horſe and armes unto Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi> The Inne-keeper was daunted at it, and ſaid, that they were ſent thither by a ſpeciall friend, however if he thought they were againſt the King and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> he would willingly on the high-way be one of my ſide, and withall importuned me to be patient, and to forbeare them in his owne houſe. <hi>I</hi> was much vexed at it, and the rather, becauſe they would have had away my two foot-men with them: Upon my Soule, had the man of the houſe beene right, we ſhould have both maſtred and diſ-arm'd them.</p>
            <p>Seeing I could not prevaile, I made haſte from thence unto the Army, and ſhortly after lay at <hi>Teddington</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> at the ſigne of the <hi>Griffin</hi> extreamly weary. On the next morning, I heard that the Head-quarters would bee at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and going thence to Mr. <hi>Parrots</hi> at <hi>Shidlington,</hi> I underſtood that the Head-quarters were at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> which made me and my friend to ride our Horſes very hard, inſomuch that I tired mine, and left it with the Conſtable of <hi>Barton,</hi> and came on foot to <hi>Uxbridge</hi> on the laſt Sunday morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I there ſpoke with divers Gentlemen of my acquaintance, to whom I made known the progreſſe of my Journey, and my many ſufferings, and what was that which I came about.</p>
            <p>

The Commanders being then buſie at Councell, I met with young Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> ſon to the Lieutenant Generall, by whoſe means I found out Lieutenant <hi>Merris,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen, by whom I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that his Excellency was not raiſing of forces, but onely ſtanding on his owne Guard, hoping that all would be well. I intended indeed to preſent my ſervice to his Excellency with about threeſcore or foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore foot, and to give him in a true relation of the ſtate of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where I had beene, knowing where to Arme five hundred men. And if his Excellency would be pleaſed to ſend downe a Colonell or two, I would have ſhewed him in a little compaſſe he could be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with one Regiment of Horſe, and 2000 Foot; but God be prayſed I found things in a better poſture, howſoever I was extreamly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, conſidering how I had loſt my ſelfe in the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Relating my minde to the ſouldiers, they kindly embraced me, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them in order all my grievances; and out of the true reality of their affections, and ſenſe and fellow feeling of my ſufferings, It is the deſire of the ſouldiers, with the advice of many of my betters in the Army, that this ſhould be committed to the Preſſe, and the firſt Book to bee delivered to the Committee of North-ampton, to have a ſight thereof, by which they may perceive how much miſ-information hath abuſed them, And the Souldier doth not doubt but that the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee (ſeeing how faithfull I have been ever unto the ſervice, and at what expence of money, and how I had both tired my ſelfe and Horſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the well-fare of the Kingdome) would of themſelves bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either to give or lend mee a horſe with all furniture fitting for a Gentleman, that ſo I may the better be accommodated to preſent my ſelfe unto his Excellency, and perſonally, and by word of mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my ſelfe unto him. And withall, whereas in the Articles which I Articled againſt Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> of <hi>Hartwell</hi> Parke, they were not put in a way, or any mention of ſequeſtration to bee made for 2000 pounds worth of goods then to be proved which was occaſioned by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who gave falſe Information, and deluded the Committee, of whoſe honour I am and alwayes have been very tender, for I dayly pray for Mr. <hi>Ouſley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> the High Sheriffe, and the reſt: And whereas in aſſiſting Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> heretofore with the hazzard of my life at <hi>Hartwell</hi> Parke, I ſo farre ventured to ſave his goods, that I killed a Horſe, and wounded foure men: The Honourable and moſt vertuous Lady <hi>Crane</hi> (to whom they did belong) did forgive mee all, when Maſter <hi>Marriot</hi> was to ſave mee harmleſſe, although it ſhould coſt him five hundred pound, for which fact ſome of the Committee

ſufferd me to be Fin'd, which Fine I paid, in the proceeding of which troubles both my wife and children wanted. It is the ſouldiers deſire, that the Saddle ſhould be laid upon the right Horſe, Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the benefit of the croppe, and that the Fine that was paid ſhould be reſtored to my wife and children. And if the Gentleman who miſ-informed the Committee, ſhall bee found out in <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Towne or thereabouts, it is the Souldiers deſire that hee ſhall bee ſent up unto the Generall, or kept in ſafe cuſtody untill hee ſhall make good the 2000 pound for which I ſhall produce my witneſſes; And the buſineſſe to be heard in the Army. And if that any man ſhall deny the party I ſhall demand, the Souldiers will fetch him with 2000 Horſe. It is alſo deſired that all Executions, Writs, and Warrants, and Actions of Battery, concerning Mr. <hi>Marriots</hi> buſineſſe be made void. And if a new warre ſhal happen in this Kingdome (which God forbid) I doe here fully declare my ſelfe to bee for King and Parliament, and willingly to adventure my life in the ſervice, and that I will give in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Generall a liſt of thoſe Gentlemens names in the Counties of <hi>Gloceſter, Worceſter, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Salope,</hi> that are able and ready to raiſe one thouſand Horſe, and two thouſand Foot and willingly and altogether venture both lives, limbes, and fortunes for the King and Parliament, for the ſafety, the reconcilement, and the happineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doe dayly and devoutly pray.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſayes that the Committee is much railed on in this Kingdome, but he believes it is long of falſe intelligence; It is our deſire in the whole Army, that if the ſaid <hi>Marriot</hi> ſhall deny to pay back this Fine, that you Gentlemen of the Committee doe pay it to his Wife and Children, and that you will be pleaſed to keep the ſaid <hi>Marriot</hi> with Bread and Water, till he reſtore the mony to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: for it is nothing but right, and in Conſcience you ought to ſee juſtice done. We heare that many Knaves brought Letters to Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Samuel,</hi> and did ſay any thing to doe Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> wrong; they had beſt give him ſatisfaction, for we know Sir <hi>Richard Samuel</hi> well enough.</p>
            <p>It is our whole Armies deſire, That if in caſe Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſhall finde out the Gentleman who kept <hi>Marriot</hi> from being ſequeſtred, that then he challenging the man to you, he be kept ſafe till wee fetch him, and Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> produce his witneſſe, and then the buſineſſe to be heard before Sir <hi>Tho. Fairefax,</hi> and the two thouſand pound before ſpoken of to be returned to the Parliaments uſe.</p>
