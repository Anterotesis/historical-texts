            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THe laſt Month I gave you to underſtand of your incivility towards me, intimating the time and place alſo; and becauſe your regardleſneſſe is ſtill continued, I thought good the ſecond time to write, although you denyed me to ſpeak, once and againe, and to let you to know that there is not a more certaine time of ſinning againſt God, his truth, and children, then of ſuffering for wronging them. For he that affirms, that to be the Church of Chriſt that is not, wrongs the Lord the Husband, and his holy Spouſe alſo. And he that gives any other meaning of the Scripture, then what the holy Ghoſt intendeth, hurts and wounds the truth of Gods teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and his Children alſo. Now the truth is, thou art the man that haſt blaſphemed the Tabernacle of God, and them that dwell therein, affirming her to be untempered morter, and fading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is true, dureable, &amp; everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And that to be the meaning of Chriſt, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 16. 17. and the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9; 10. which was never meant nor intended by them. <hi>Sir,</hi> you did not conſider the Scriptures when you read them, if you had, you might have diſcerned the meaning otherwiſe then that you have there declared: and if it be poſſible, look on the Text with a ſingle eye, and then you may perceive more then yet you have, for this is a ſpirituall Scripture, and none but ſpirituall eyes can diſcern it. In the letter it runs thus, upon <hi>Peters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <hi>Thou art Chriſt; the Son of the living God. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou Simon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For fleſh and bloud hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> You ſee the Lord pronounces him bleſſed, becauſe he was one that the Lord had inſpired, taught, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; that it was not <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion as he was a naturall, but as he was a ſpirituall man, and ſo uttered from the Spirit of adoption, as in another place the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>We beleeve and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> And as in the foregoing words he calls him Lord, ſaying, <hi>Whether ſhall we goe, thou haſt the words of Eternall life.</hi> Again, conſider the terms he uſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>We beleeve and are ſure;</hi> this ſure and ſtedfaſt Faith is that Faith which <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y had that received him, that is, that loved, underſtood, and obeyed him, <hi>To whom he gave the priviledge of Sonſhip, even them that beleeve on his name,</hi> And then he ſhewes what manner of men they are in theſe words, <hi>Which were borne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God:</hi> ſo then this bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is from a bleſſed man, a regenerated man, the Confeſſion of a Child of the Covenant, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the other place ſaith, ſpeaking in the meaning of the Lord, <hi>The word is nigh thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: That is</hi> (or this is) <hi>the word of faith which we preach, the word or Covenant of Promiſe:</hi> That is, whoever by vertue of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Word or Statute of life, the Covenant of Grace, ſhall be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſhall <hi>Beleeve in his heart, and confeſſe with his mouth, the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as before is ſhewed, <hi>he ſhall be ſaved,</hi> for ſuch a one is the Child of ſalvation. Now <hi>Doctour,</hi> ſee how you have wronged theſe Scriptures by making the firſt a ground of a long diſcourſe of Philoſophy, in declaring to the people
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118541:4"/>
how in the improvement of naturall Faculties, firſt the Judgement is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then the Will conſenteth, and accordingly the Affections are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
               <p>I tell you the truth <hi>Doctour,</hi> I was aſhamed of your Doctrine, and that made me ſpeak, though you returned me a ſcoffe. And when your wiſdom led you to ſhew us the meaning of the Apoſtles tearms (<hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing</hi>) by a Sillogiſme without diſtinguiſhing the meanings that were of divers ſignifications in the Word of God, I was ſo bold as to tell you before all the people your Argument was fallacious, and tended to deceive, becauſe the tearms were dubious: and then you ſcorn'd and deſpis'd me again. And according to theſe corrupt Expoſitions, are all the reſt of your Arguings, whereof, except you prevent me by your ſpeedy repentance, I ſhall make a publick <hi>Anatomy</hi> to the view of the World, and Subſcribe my Name</p>

               <p>THe laſt night late, I met with a more civill Letter of yours, and ſurely therein you ſhall not outdoe me. Wherefore now, taking all your <note n="a" place="margin">Gods Servants in ſpeaking the truth to the blame of ſuch as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, doe not reproach them, for they are commanded to reprove them, and muſt not call bitter ſweet, nor ſweet bitter.

In your Letter <hi>July</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> you ſay he that affirmeth that to bee the Church of Chriſt which is not, wrongs the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he that gives any other meaning of the Scripture then what the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt intendeth, hurts and wounds the truth of Gods Teſtimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To both theſe I <note n="b" place="margin">And to aſſent to the truth is tollerable, with a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but that you are the man that have blaſted God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is plainly proved in my ſecond Letter, and throughout the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all following.</note> aſſent.

               <p>You ſay I affirm her that is True, Durable, and everlaſting, to be fading, and framed with untempered morter; and that to be the meaning of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 16. 17. and of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. which was never meant, nor intended by them, which if I were guilty of, I confeſſe your accuſation Juſt. Let us therefore ſpeak of them both apart. Firſt of the firſt, wherein we muſt firſt endeavour to bring your words to your meaning, or your meaning to your words. For if it <note n="c" place="margin">My words &amp; meaning if you take a true view of them, doe not contradict, as you ſhall ſee in my diſcovering of your owne daubing, which you ſay is the Church of Chriſt, and Gods perfect work in building his owne habitation.</note> relate unto the firſt Rules ſet down, it is a kind of contradiction. The Rule intimating the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a falſe Church to appear as a true: the other, the making of a true Church to be as a falſe. But if you mean two ſeverall things, then I ſuppoſe your rule would infer an imputation on me of having maintained
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118541:5"/>
our Church to be the Church of Chriſt, which you ſay is not ſo, and your Church not to be the Church of Chriſt, which nevertheleſſe is ſo. For (ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) you mean not that ever I affirmed the Church of Chriſt to be fading, and framed with untempered morter, but rather that ſuch Churches which were ſo fading, and framed with untempered morter, are not the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that whereby we aver our ſelves to be the true Church of Chriſt, is by keeping the <note n="d" place="margin">Do you dare to boaſt of pure Ordinances, when all you doe in the outward, without the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall part, and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is abominable iniquity: and, for bodily exerciſes that rotten Strumpet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will outdoe you, although you ſhould add your owne vanity in your lacivious waſhing your Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels feet and legs alſo, for ſhame bring not in your former carnality unrepented of, under the Vizzard of the Churches innocency. But conſider what is written, for in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion, or Baptiſme, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth any thing, but a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And again, faith that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by love. And againe, but keeping the Commandements of God. Are any of theſe heavenly effects brought forth by your Plants? Nay, a bad tree cannot bring forth good fruits: For all that hath proceeded from you, are but ſower Grapes, and yet you will compare your bramble Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with the Grapes of the Vines of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </note> pure Ordinances of Chriſt, according to his word; and if you think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, you ſhould inſtance in any perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. On the other ſide, we ſay that yours is not the true Church of Chriſt, becauſe you keep not the true Ordinances of Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word. And we inſtance in Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, and could inſtance in more. Now this we doe not for any Spleen or Malice, (for I ſay the ſame things to my beſt Friends) but that I might provoke you and them to examine your ſelves exactly by the Word of God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Traditions of men.</p>

            <p>In the 20<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> page of his Book of <hi>Vaine Syllogiſmes,</hi> he hath theſe words, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Chamberlen</hi> here took liberty to make a ſhort Diſcourſe concerning the Church, which indeed is very much and large, but to little purpoſe; and therein declareth himſelfe not to be acquainted with true Divinity; for what are all Heatheniſh or carnall Chriſtian Aſſemblies, to the Congregation of Chriſts Members, which are his Church, or the multitudes of carnall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in their devotion and worſhip, in the litterall, externall Ordinances, and yet notwithſtanding be a ſinfull Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evill doers, children that are corrupters, ſuch as in heart have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Lord, and have provoked the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to anger, and are gone aſtray backward, that is, have eſtranged, alienated, or ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from God, through their impenitency and hardneſſe of heart, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their pretence of outward ſanctity in Externall Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Church Diſcipline, where there is no ſuch thing at all in truth and in ſincerity, although drawne out from others into ſeperated Congregations, according to the traditions of mens devices, filling themſelves with the old wine of hariſaicall righteouſneſſe. And although among other Churches, the <hi>Doctour</hi> is pleaſed to affirm, that the Church of Chriſt comprehendeth all the Saints, but in that he ſheweth not his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meaning what a Saint is, he thereby cleareth not himſelfe from being ignorant thereof, foraſmuch as Antichriſt himſelfe gives the Title of Saints to his ungodly Church alſo.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Doctour</hi> would have edified the Congregation, he ſhould in the firſt place have diſtinguiſhed between the true Church, and all ſuch as are falſe, by a right definition, and deſcription of the Saints and true Church of Chriſt, from all others that aſſume to take upon them her Name, and yet are ignorant of her Nature, which he wholly omitting, hath loſt his labour, and rendered himſelfe unwiſe to the Children of wiſdome. And for wanting better principles, in his Premiſes, he makes his concluſion as equally corrupt in theſe words, page 21. The Church of Chriſt, ſaith he, is then, and ſo long the Church of Chriſt, as ſhe ſaith and doth what Chriſt gave her to ſay and doe, even as Chriſt himſelfe. By which ſaying he maketh the being and continuance of the Church to depend on her own obedience; and for proof thereof, quo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es <hi>John</hi> 7. 17. &amp; 8. 26 28. &amp; 14. 10. 24. &amp; 5. 19, 20. and concludeth thus, and when ſhe ſaith or doth otherwiſe, ſhe ſpeaketh, or playeth the Harlot in that particular. Which is not the doctrine of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, but of the ſpirit of Antichriſt: For the Doctour makes the Church to be her owne Keeper, but the ſpirit of God ſaith, the Lord is the ſhepheard and keeper of her. The Spirit of Chriſt ſaith, ſhe is chaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, the Doctour on the contrary affirmeth ſhe may play the whore, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118541:6"/>
be a Harlot. The Spirit ſaith, ſhe is led into all truth, that ſhe is the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pillar, and upholder of it, and ſo impregnable that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her, that every member is living, every ſtone precious. But on the contrary, the Doctour ſaith, ſhe is mutable, and ſo changeable, as that ſhe may ſay and doe contrary to it, that leads her, that guides her, that ſpeaks in her. Oh miſerable doctrine, and no leſſe miſerable are thoſe that receive it; for if the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch, yet the Doctour would have the people beleive he is not blind, but ſeeth; and therefore quotes many Scriptures to prove it, as are before mentioned, which being the letter of the Text, without any expoſition, we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the meaning thereof. Our Lord being at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Jewes, ſaith the Text, marvelled concerning him and his Doctrine; ſome ſaid he was a good man, others, that he deceived the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but Jeſus anſwered. My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me, and ſo adviſeth them how they might have benefit by it. If any man will doe his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelfe, where there is not one word of the Church of Chriſt; for they that doe not obey his will, are not his Church, nor any other title to the Doctours purpoſe. In the ſecond place, he continues his ſpeech to his perſecuting enemies, which I hope upon ſecond thoughts he doth not underſtand to be his Church. In the third place, he graciouſly informs and confirms his faithfull ſervant <hi>Phillip,</hi> in the Myſtery of his Divinity, as of his Humanity, and that his words are the works of God; but not a word in the Doctours meaning. And in the 24. verſe, as he ſpeaks of them that love him, ſo he ſpeaks of them that hate him, whom to affirme to be his Church, is to blaſpheme her. And in the laſt place, <hi>John</hi> 5. 19, 30. the Lord ſpeaks of himſelfe as diſtinguiſhable from the Father, and alſo declareth the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall union of both Natures, Humane and Divine. The true meaning of theſe Scriptures being thus conſidered, ſhewes plainly that his doctrine and their intention, were at a vaſt diſtance; for it is far from their meaning, that the Church of Chriſt may play the Harlot, and of pure, become baſe and unclean, becauſe they teſtifie that ſhe is ſo long to laſt, and continue holy, even every member of her his body, as Jeſus Chriſt her head is to be Chriſt, who was yeſterday, and to day, and for ever. And ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ving your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this doctrine ſheweth that you are ſtill tainted with the old leaven of corrupt Popery, and Arminianiſme, which will be more manifeſted when I come to ſhew what the true Church of Chriſt is indeed, diſcovering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your fancie more particulerly and exactly.</p>
            <p>Another concluſion that he would teach the people was, That his Church was a Baptized Church, and had the true marks of a true Church, which is the true Preaching the Word, and the true adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he calls them. Here the Gentleman is at a loſſe alſo, and beats the air as before, and that which he ſaith is to as little purpoſe, his terms not being cleared to what ſenſe he means, from their various ac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eptations. But the truth is, his owne meaning by Baptiſme is but that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that any man may bear witneſſe to, that is preſent, as he affirms in page 23. So then, his Baptiſme is of the ſame nature as his Church is, both carnall, the inſide foule, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his heart was, not right in the ſight
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118541:7"/>
of God, his eſtate naturall and miſerable, in the Gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity, yet waſht and cleanſed without. Where doe you read in the Scriptures that the Churches of God, true ſpirituall Chriſtians, did ever brag and boaſt of the fleſhly and carnall parts of the Ordinances of the Goſpel, as you have done? No, they ſee thoſe are ſhaddows, elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repreſentations, and ſay, that it is not Baptiſm in the fleſh, that ſaves not; but the Baptiſm of the heart, the heart ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and the body waſhed with pure water, by this ſpirituall Baptiſme men are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So alſo they affirm, that's not Circumciſion that is in the fleſh, but that is Circumciſion that is of the heart in the ſpirit, and not in the Letter, inward, ſpirituall, and heavenly Baptiſme. And this Circumciſion is that which Gods Church glories in, and not the outward, that Divells may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of as well as Saints. But the Doctour fears not to avouch, that the waſhing with the <hi>Old Ford,</hi> or Thames water, and the like places is that Baptiſme, which the Scripture in a ſpeciall ſenſe ſpeaks of, by which men are regenerated, becauſe he maketh it the true mark of the rue Church. Indeed this is the opinion of the ſtupid, obdurat, hard-hearted Jews and Papiſts, and of moſt carnall Proteſtants, in which they are all alike. But as the true Church of Chriſt is ſpirituall, ſo is her Baptiſme, and ſo are her fruits and manifeſtations, her marks and ſeals, by which ſhe is diſtinguiſhed from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches that are falſe, as when I come to eſtabliſh the truth ſhall be cleared.</p>
            <p>But the Doctour further affirmeth, that their Baptized Churches have the true Preaching of the Word; and he thinks himſelfe to be none of the meaneſt amongſt the reſt: and therefore in the firſt place, and in the behalf of all the Baptized Churches, as he calls them, we will examine his owne true Preaching of the word as he affirms in page 24. That his Church, and all other Baptized Churches baptize ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, according to <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. becauſe, as he ſaith, they are beleivers and repenters. Again, ſaith he, they that Baptize ſuch as confeſſe with their mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and beleeve in their hearts that God hath raiſed him from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. baptizeth ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But baptized Churches baptize ſuch as confeſſe with their mouth the Lord Jeſus, and beleeve with their hearts that God raiſed him from the dead; therefore baptized Churches baptize ſuch as ſhall be ſaved. This profeſſed workman for want of true underſtanding to divide the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, hath from his own mouth eternalized his own ſhame, for want of a clear and true diſtinction in the ſame terms that have divers meanings. And that his folly may the more be manifeſted, we will ingeniouſly conſider the Scriptures; the firſt we read thus, <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now to find out the true meaning hereof, two terms of neceſſity muſt be opened; for one and the ſame term admitting of divers meanings in Scripture, that ſenſe muſt be diſtinguiſhed from all others of like nature, that is properly and only intended in that place. Now for the term [<hi>Faith</hi>] it hath divers ſignifications in the Scripture; ſomtimes it is referred unto God, ſomtimes unto men; when unto God, then it implyeth or intendeth nothing elſe but the ſure and certain unalterableneſſe of his promiſe, and decree. If unto men, then it ſignifieth and intendeth either the doctrine of

the Goſpel it ſelfe, or their faithfulnes that declare it, or elſe ſome ſpeciall gifts which the Spirit of God indueth his ſervants with; now of ſuch gifts there are but three ſorts that bear the name of faith. Somtimes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and certain underſtanding of the truth of Gods word, is called <hi>Faith,</hi> which for diſtinction ſake may be called, and that truly, <hi>The Faith of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtoricall Faith;</hi> which Faith, although all the Saints under the Scriptures adminiſtration of the Goſpel have, yet it is not peculiar to them alone, but common to all periſhing Chriſtians, ſuch as the Doctours Church conſiſteth of, and may abundantly exceed in yea, even Sathan himſelfe. The ſecond gift of the holy Ghoſt, is that by which any one miraculouſly doth ſuch things as canſeth admiration in the beholders, exceeding naturall effects, and is often in holy Writ called by the name of Faith, and ſo may be denominated <hi>Miraculous Faith.</hi> But with this gift the unholy may more excell, then the holy men of God; for <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did no Miracle, but <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytour did many; in which gift of Faith the Prieſts and Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Rome</hi> were famous; as the Spirit of the Lord foretold. <hi>And they ſhall doe great wonders, and works of great power, ſo that they would deceive if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the very elect.</hi> Which kind of Faith may properly be defined thus, That it is a certain undoubted confidence whereby a man beleeveth that God Almighty will by him doe this or that Miracle, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Through Faith in his name.</hi> The third ſort of the gifts of the Spirit, which any man receiveth to Eternall life, is called by the name of Faith; and that more often then thoſe before named, which the Scripture calleth <hi>The Faith of God, The Faith of the Son of God, the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, the Faith of Abraham, the Faith that worketh by love, the Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> which is often and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called by godly men, <hi>juſtifying Faith;</hi> and of this ſort and kind of Faith, all the Saints, and they onely have, which may be truely defined in this manner, that it is a full, ſure, and firme confidence ingraven by the power of the Spirit of God, in a penitent, broken heart, whereby he aſſuredly beleeveth that all his ſins are remitted, and that he is reconciled and made one with God, in everlaſting love and favour through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now the Doctour ought to have conſidered which of all theſe three ſorts of Faith is meant by our Saviour in the place he alledges; the laſt ſort of Faith cannot be underſtood, for that is included in the next tearm [<hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>] as I ſhall ſhew when I give you the meaning. Nor the ſecond ſort, for that's not peculiar to them that ſhall be ſaved. And therefore without all contradiction it muſt be the firſt ſort of Faith, which all the Elect of God muſt have in ſome meaſure or other, wrought by Gods Spirit, before he works, either Repentance, or Remiſſion of ſins; which kind of Faith may well be expreſſed in ſaying that it is, and it is nothing elſe but a ſure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſettled aſſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the mind and heart, by which a man moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly beleeveth ſuch things as are revealed for the Salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>Now the ſecond Tearme in the Text is [<hi>Baptized</hi>] which word is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of divers ſignifications in the Scripture; and he ought here to have dealt like a ſkilfull ſpirituall workman, as before is expreſt; that is, in the firſt place to have ſhewed the manifold acceptations the ſame word alſo hath in the Holy Ghoſts expreſſion, and then which of all the meanings by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118541:8"/>
the ſame tearm is here to be underſtood, which the Doctor having omitted, of neceſſity I muſt do this work for him, to find out the true meaning of this Scripture alſo. Wherefore I ſay of the tearm [<hi>Baptiſme</hi>] as of the tearm <hi>Faith,</hi> that it hath divers, diſfinct, and ſeverall meanings in the Scriptures; ſometimes is meant by it externall elementary Baptiſme, that which is from below, but more often that which is ſpirituall and heavenly, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, as repentance is called Baptiſme, and ſo is Remiſſion of Sinnes; and theſe two heavenly operations together, being Regeneration, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king parts of the New man, are called Baptiſme, and ſo are the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt given to this New creature, called Baptiſme: as alſo, the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Grace in the holy converſation of this Child of God. His mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vivification are called Baptiſme; as alſo are his bleſſed ſufferings for righteouſneſſe ſake. <hi>Can you be Baptized with the Baptiſme that I am Baptized with?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Doctour;</hi> may it pleaſe you to learne which of all theſe diſtinct meanings is that which is intended by our Lord and Saviour: the laſt it cannot be, for in that our Lord ſpeaks of the work and exerciſe of a New man, born, and not of the Birth it ſelfe: the firſt it cannot be, for that is from below; and it is impoſſible for the water of the great Ocean Springs, or Fountains to unharden the heart, to convert a naturall man, to renew the ſinner, to ſanctifie the polluted; then without all queſtion it muſt be the Baptiſme of Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the waſhing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, for whoſoever is ſo Baptized, doth ſo repent, and beleeve, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things conſidered, I pray ſee what a corrupt manner of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this of yours, and how theſe Scriptures prove what you have affirmed, let the people of the Lord judge. For as you have by your falſe Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions killed and taken away the life and meaning of Gods holy Word, in theſe paſt inſtances of Divine Writ; even ſo in like manner hath your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling been with all other Scriptures you have made uſe of; for which in due time and place you ſhall receive juſt reproof. In the next place, I ſhould have diſcovered your ignorance of the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, which is your confirmation of your Diſciples, under the power of your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as you uſe to ſay, by which you doe not onely intereſt your ſelves into their Eſtates, but have the diſpoſing of their bodies alſo. But I will defer that till I ſhall determine it rightly by the Scriptures of truth, and will now take in hand the point you have ſpent moſt of your Syllogiſmes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, concerning the Miniſtry of the Church of Chriſt; and you ground your large Diſputes on a Queſtion, page 2. which you frame thus. Whether privat men, I mean Tradeſ-men, ſay you may Preach the Word of God without Ordination. By which it appears his meaning is, they may; and ſo goes on in all fury, and in a conceit of an uncontrollable ability to make good his three fold Cord of Major, Minor, and Concluſion, with cunning, ſophiſticall words of Juglers, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome in his time, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. And the man is ſo confident, that he thinks neither word nor ſpirit may countermand him, but when the account of his Queſtion is audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I think he will wiſh he had been better imployed, for the Doctour is fallen into a miſt, as he was before, and doth all his work in darkneſſe; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118541:8"/>
he ſhall find them to prove no leſſe then works of darkneſſe themſelves, by not clearing three tearms in his Queſtion; that is, <hi>Private men, Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Preaching:</hi> and that I may the more fully diſcover the Doctours weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his queſtion's examination ſhall be by the Scriptures, and then it will appear how the Scriptures meaning, and the Doctours doth diſagree. Now we find the firſt tearm, <hi>Private man,</hi> made uſe of by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 20, 21. Knowing this firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that no Propheſie of the Scripture is of any private interpretation (or motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as ſome tranſlate) <hi>for the Propheſie came not at any time by the will of man,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle teacheth us here that the private man he ſpeaks of, is a naturall man; and he explains his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſo, in theſe words, <hi>By the will of man:</hi> that is, by no naturall mans abilities whatſoever. And as he denies that the Propheſie of truth and holy Writ came by the power, parts, and gifts of any man in nature, ſo alſo he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>By whom God makes knowne his word, will, and Propheſies,</hi> that is, by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men, in theſe plain words, <hi>But holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt</hi> Now Doctour, ſee that which yet you never ſaw; the Church of Chriſt, her Preachers and Prophets of the Lord are not carnall, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall men, and their motion and enablement thereunto, is not by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit, but through the movings and ability of the holy Ghoſt. Where is now therefore the multitude of your Arguments, and Syllogiſmes, of men and Trades men, and gifted men, not taking into conſideration, there are men and men, and gifts and gifts, which for want of Scripture diſtinction, all the pains you have taken to ſpin ſo many curious threads to make a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall webb of, no ſooner is it toucht by the Divine finger of the ſpirituall meaning of the word of God, but your glorious ſhew of humane, and of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or private men falls all into filthy duſt: for although carnall men may litterally preach, as <hi>Judas</hi> and others have done, yet none but holy men can Preach ſpiritually. And in this diſtinction the other tearms are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood alſo, of Ordination and Tradeſ-men, both Divine, the one in perſon, the other in approbation, and miſſion for holy men of God. The Meſſengers and Miniſters of Chriſt, are ſent, appointed, and Ordained by the Lord himſelfe, and juſtified and approved of by the Saints And their Preachings and Declarations are not their own viſions and though<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, as the Doctours are, but the truth, word, and mind of the Lord; the ſame ſpirit in them enables them to open the Scriptures now, which wrote them by the hands of his holy Prophets and ſervants, which ſhall be more fully cleared when I come to the truths confirmation.</p>
            <p>Now this brief diſcovery of the Doctours large miſtakes, ſhall ſuffice for this time; ſome other things there are, which we ſhall have occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, as we find them to hinder us in the way of truth And therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promiſe in the firſt place I ſhall make a clear and plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the true Church of Chriſt, and ſo follow the Doctour the ſame way he goes. <hi>But who is ſufficient for theſe things,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; <hi>But wee are not as many which corrupt or deceitfully deal with the Word of God, but as of ſincerily, but as of God;</hi> in the ſight or in the powerfull preſence of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt, although the Doctour deſpiſe us. Be it known unto him therefore, and all the world, that the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt is of a holy and pure nature, every part and member of her: for he that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118541:9"/>
her, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one; that is, of the one Holy Spirit; ſo then, as in her new nature ſhe is Holy and Divine, ſo ſhe is heavenly and ſpirituall; ſpirituall Children which make a ſpirituall Family, or Houſhold; ſpirituall Trees which make a ſpirituall, fruitfull, fragrant Garden; ſpirituall Stones built up a ſpirituall Houſe, Temple, Tabernacle, a repoſe, an habitation for the heavenly God, the Father of Spirits, to abide, to delight, to dwell and reſide in. Yea more yet, ſhe is a ſpirituall body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of none but of ſpirituall members, knit and joyned together with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſinews, ſupplyed with ſpirituall grace from the Fountaine, the Head, the ſpirituall Head Jeſus Chriſt, from which all the joynts and bands, having nouriſhment, miniſtred and knit together, groweth or increaſeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God; from the Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, conveyeth all over the body, to the leaſt Member, with ſpirituall veins, through which, an everlaſting ſupplying grace is continued. For as ſhe is the building and workmanſhip of God, the Children and Houſhold of God, the Plantation and Garden of the Lord, ſo ſhe is kept by the power of God unto ſalvation. And he that keepeth this his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his choſen, called and ſanctified ones, doth neither ſlumber nor ſleep, but ever watcheth: And he their Holy Shepheard is mighty, and ſtronger then all, ſo that no oppoſite power and ſtrength is able to take them out of his hand.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the faithfull ſervant and Apoſtle of Chriſt writing unto the holy and bleſſed Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> affirms them to be Saints, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that they are in Chriſt Jeſus. Now all that are in Chriſt Jeſus are holy and faithfull, for they are juſtified by faith, and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, and as the Root is holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo are the branches alſo; yet the Apoſtle ſaith to theſe holy ones, <hi>You were the Children of wrath as well as others.</hi> And to another Church he ſaith, <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> ſpeaking before of wicked and unholy men; <hi>But yee</hi> (ſaith he, meaning now) <hi>are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified, but yee are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</hi> That is, through the power of Chriſt, by the operation of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Therefore to know the way and method which God takes in the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſervants that are his Church, the diſcovery and opening thereof, will make not onely the Deſcription of the Church of Chriſt more clear, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, but give us a definition alſo of her ſupernaturall making, parts: For as ſince the creation, propagation or birth gives being to all men naturally; ſo heavenly and ſpirituall birth ſince the fall of man, is ordained and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God to give ſpirituall being to all his Saints, and Children, which are the Church of God, as it is written, <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit:</hi> ſo it is ſpirituall birth that gives being to ſpirituall men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But foraſmuch as this one Scripture doth fully prove the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in both parts thereof, that is that birth taken in a two fold meaning, is the production both of naturall men, and ſpirituall men. And the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the wiſdome of the Holy Ghoſt by declaring that which is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, by that which is naturall, teacheth us that there is much reſemblance of the births in the manner, although not in the nature. In the naturall birth there is a conception in the beginning, and a reception in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, till bringing forth, or accompliſhment. And all theſe diſtinctions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118541:9"/>
with their concomitants may be comprehended in the tearm birth, now that which doth accompany conception, is compunction in nature, in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſhalt thou conceive, and in the reception, all the while till the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and in the deliverance, pain, ſorrow, labour, pangs, throwes intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable dollorous till the Child is born, and then comes eaſe, comfort, and rejoycing; even ſo it is in the ſpirituall birth, in a likeneſſe and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, for the manner of it, but in the nature, no ſimilitude at all, for the the one is from below, the other from above, as it is written; <hi>Except a man be born again from above, of water and the Spirit, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God:</hi> In which words there are four parts, and the tearms therein to be diſtinctly conſidered of. The firſt is, Of whom our Lord ſpeaks by the name <hi>man,</hi> and by it he means a naturall man. And ſecondly, That this man is to be born again; his meaning is not as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> at that time underſtood him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that place of nature from whence he came forth, but to be born from above by a ſupernaturall force, power, vertue, and operation of the Spirit of God. In the third place, He ſpeaks of the matter of the Birth, and that hath two parts: The firſt is heavenly and ſpirituall water, meaning thereby the grace and gift of God, which the holy Ghoſt often in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, calls by the name of water, which is the Baptiſme of Repentance, a true turning to God. The ſecond part conſiſteth of another more excellent work of the Spirit, which is here called the Holy Ghoſt, but in other places by metaphoricall tearms, blood, and fire, by which is meant the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt, or Remiſſion of ſins. The firſt part is full of ſpirituall grief, and diſconſolation, the laſt full of heavenly comfort and conſolation. And laſtly, <hi>By ſeeing the Kingdome of God,</hi> he means the knowing and being a member of his Church in the ſtate of Regeneration, receiving the Spirit of Adoption, through which he is made the Child of God, and if Children, then Heirs of the everlaſting Kingdome, the World to come, the inheritance of the Saints: ſo then; from this Scripture thus opened we are taught, that Gods method and way to convert men from nature to grace, to make them members of his Church, is to <hi>Turne them from darkneſſe to light, from the power of Satan. to be reconciled unto God:</hi> To deliver us from the power of darkneſſe, and tranſlate us into the Kingdome of the Son of his love. And by this way and means the Lord made and conſtituted the true Church of Chriſt at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſe,</hi> as he doth all other Churches of his, which were Saints, and faithfull brethren in Chriſt, And ſo did he likewiſe that famous Church at <hi>Epheſus, Yee were ſomtimes darkneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but now are yee light in the Lord, walk as Children of light,</hi> Mark I pray you, he calls this Church, theſe Saints, theſe Faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Children of light,</hi> and how came they to be ſo, but by being <hi>Borne of God,</hi> of his own will begat he them, being born again of incorruptible ſeed, the Word of God, which is the Word of his Grace, the New Covenant, the Word of Promiſe, the Covenant of Life, the making us partakers thereof, is the taking away the ſtony heart, and in the place thereof to give his Elect a heart of fleſh, that is, a ſoft, tender, and humble heart, and in it to write his everlaſting love, mercy, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, never to be obliterated, or revoked, as before is ſhewed. For thoſe whom he thus loves once, he loves unto the end. And theſe Children of God, are thoſe little ones the Scripture ſpeaks of, thoſe humble ones the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118541:10"/>
Lord teacheth, thoſe contrite and penitent ones, that the Lord comforteth, refreſheth, and reviveth; this is his <hi>Sion,</hi> his little City, his deſired Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his delightfull dwelling, his Holy Mountaine. And where two or three of theſe are gathered together in his Name; where by Name we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Spirit, there is he in the midſt of them; that is it that is it that makes them his Church, even his holy preſence; that is it that makes them his Houſe, his Tabernacle, to doe his great pleaſure in Earth, by his Spirit, as the everlaſting Father, and the Son doth in Heaven, whoſe voyce not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, is as much as not to regard the voyce of God himſelfe. Oh Doctour, for you, to compare your hay, wood, and ſtubble, with the purity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Churches mettle, which is Gods building, it will even ſo eclipſe your ruſh light, and ſplit your hulk, and ſhipwrack your bark for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as never to recover, and your ſandy foundation will ſhortly cauſe ſuch a fall of your fooliſh Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> building, as never to be built again. And that you may repent of your ignorance of the true Church of Chriſt, I will give you another diſcovery of her excellency, by her pure eſtate, and glorious condition, which the Propheticall Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw in a Viſion, and writ it for poſterity, in theſe words, <hi>And a great ſigne appeared in Heaven, a Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and on her head a Crown of twelve ſtars. And being great with Child, ſhee cryed travelling and labouring to be delivered.</hi> In which Scripture there are many things conſiderable. 1. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wonderment and admiration, for the great excellency of it. 2. The place where it appeared, and that was in Heaven. 3. What it was that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and that was a woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. Then her cloathing and apparell all over her body. 5. As alſo what ſhe was crown'd with on her head. 6. What ſhe trod under her feet; and not only denominating all things without her, but 7. what was within her alſo. <hi>And being great with Child, ſhe cryed travelling, and labouring to be delivered.</hi> This precious Virgin Spouſe, the Lords Bride, being in her condition ſpirituall, did ſhine forth in her primitive eſtate, not in any outward pomp and humane carnall glory; as now in any externall forme, or ſoft Rayment, after the faſhion of the multitude of gathered Churches in theſe dayes; but in her heavenly gifts, and holy vertues, her chaſt and prudent converſation, the ſhining of her faith, love, patience, and moderation; in all things ſhe was ſuch as ſhe was the light of the world, to the wonderment and admiration of all the Children that had eyes to behold her. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>She appeared in Heaven,</hi> the meaning is, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Goſpel was beleeved, the truth of God, and way to ſalvation profeſſed, as in <hi>Iudea, Italy, Macedonia, Aſia,</hi> and divers other places, Cities, and Countries; in which ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the Church of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, For from you ſounded out the word of the Lord not onely in Macedonia, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia, but alſo in every place your faith to God-ward is ſpread abroad,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that the Church of Chriſt is ſignified by the appellation and title of a Woman; that is uſuall and often the expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures; as <hi>The Kings Daughter, The Daughter of Sion, The Spouſe of Chriſt, The Lambs Wife, The Mother of all the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. And there is great reaſon for the Female Sex reſembles the Church of Chriſt in many reſpects; as for their fruitfulneſſe, for their beauty, for their ſubjection and paſſiveneſſe, and tender bowels of compaſſion. And that ſhe may want nothing that may tend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118541:10"/>
to her full deſcription in her whole attire, to make her all glorious without as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within.</hi> The ſon of Righteouſneſſe, even his own Righteouſneſſe is her Mantle, her cloathing, It is a metaphoricall ſpeech, often uſed in the Scripture, thereby declaring the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by being cloathed in ſine linnen, by a wedding Garment, and a white ſtone, and very apt is the reſemblance, for as a ſtole or Garment, covers and adornes the naturall body; ſo the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt covers and cloaths, adorns and beautifies the poverty and brokenneſs of the peninent ſouls of his Elect. And this Garment is of that nature, and quality, as that it warms and ſuſtains the feeble and thirſty ſoule, with the aſſurance of the mercy and favour of God in Chriſt Jeſus for ever. And the Holy Ghoſt giveth teſtimony alſo of the fruits of her lively juſtifying faith, in declaring her newneſſe of life in her deteſtation of ſin, and true love to her Lord in this figurative expreſſion, <hi>And the Moon under her feet,</hi> declaring thereby her mortification and death too, and of her ſinfull corruption, and worldly naturall affection; and alſo her vivification and daily renewed mind, to a heavenly converſation, delighting and meditating day and night in the Holy Law and Word of God, being no more carnally, but ſpiritually minded. The next externall, yet ſpirituall deſcription is the Ornament of her head, wherein ſhee took moſt pleaſure, ſaying, <hi>Shee wore on her head a Crowne,</hi> not with gold and ſilver beſet with precious ſtones, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter thereof it exceeded all theſe, for it was made of the holy and pure Doctrine of the Twelve Apoſtles, which teſtimonies and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theirs are the Lords lights and torches to guide and direct ſinners when they are benighted and darkned with their ſins, and for this cauſe are called by the name of ſtars. And laſtly, the Holy Ghoſt declares the effects, and operation of Gods ſpirit and word in her, for by the heavenly truth which was by her ears received, her heart ſpiritually conceived, and ſhee was greatly filled with a deep ſence of her owne vileneſſe and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; with bemoaning and mournfully lamenting her ſad forlorn conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, travelling and labouring under great oppreſſion, by reaſon of ſin, in reſtleſſe deſire of reconciliation to God; which paines and anguiſh of her mourning heart and contrite ſpirit, the Apoſtle moſt truly compareth to the throwes and paines of a woman in travell of Child-birth, of which ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pains and labour ſhee could not poſſible by any means be eaſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, untill her Lord were formed in her, even untill her tender heart were ſanctified by faith; for nothing could cure the wound but the aſſurance of mercy, nor nothing ſatisfie her reſtleſſe deſire, but the love of God inſured her in Chriſt her Lord, and written in the fleſhy Tables of her heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his everlaſting Covenant. Thus you ſee both the definition and deſcription of the true Church of Chriſt, that ſhe is holy and ſpirituall, within and without alſo, diſtinguiſhed and diſevered from all other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by Regeneration; as the outward Court and the Temple were parted by a vaile, and deſcribed by ſuch perfect fruits of righteouſneſſe, as no Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall Congregations can bring forth. And herein I have made good my promiſe to you in this firſt particular: The ſecond thing I promiſed, was to make known unto you the divine Ordinances of this holy Church, and they are many, but we will briefly and that truly diſcover ſuch as are moſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118541:11"/>
materiall to our purpoſe. Now as ſhee her ſelfe is ſpirituall, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions one with another, ſo alſo is every part of her worſhip ſpirituall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and yet we muſt ever remember, that moſt Ordinances conſiſt of two parts; the one carnall and outward, the other ſpirituall and inward: Now the common and carnall Chriſtians are moſt buſied about the carnall part, as fleſhly waſhings, corporall eatings, litterall Expoſitions, and verball ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that were ſtrict to tyth mint, and the meaneſt externall things, but wholly omitted the weightieſt and greateſt, that which was internall, as true Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diligently waſhed the outſide, but minded not at all to cleanſe inwardly the heart, in all which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Doctour, you ſpent moſt of your labour, and very few words or none, about the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall part. And one Reaſon was, becauſe all your Diſputes tended but to a carnall Church, for a Congregation of carnall Chriſtians make no better then a carnall Church; and carnall Arguments and actions doe manifeſt the hearts of ſuch to be carnall.</p>
            <p>But I deſire your Repentance of theſe things, and haſten to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the truth, that may make you a Child thereof indeed; and therefore we will returne to a further diſcovery of the true Churches ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Worſhip in the Heavenly part of Gods Ordinances, in which ſhee and her Children are moſt converſant, for they are alwayes mindfull of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant of their Lord, in the heavenly parts of it; they mourne, and weep, and ſuffer together, in their patience poſſeſſe their ſouls, and paſſe through the Valley of Tears, participating each with other, knowing they are thereunto called of God, not only to beleeve, but to ſuffer for his ſake: the aſſured hope they have of the great portion, inheritance, and ſalvation they are born unto by the ſpirit, doth ſo ſupport them, that they rejoyce in tribulation, the Holy Ghoſt bearing them witneſſe, <hi>That if they ſuffer with him, they ſhall alſo reign with him. Know you not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, as if he had ſaid in other words, you know aſſuredly) <hi>that as many of us as are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Jeſus Chriſt, were Baptized into his death; therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſme into death.</hi> Mark the tearms, <hi>Baptized,</hi> or <hi>Buried with him into death,</hi> which ſheweth, if men be Members of his body, then if our head ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the Members muſt ſuffer alſo: and as ſure as the Head is raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo his Members are raiſed in our mind and affections, to newneſſe of life. And in the ſame ſence he ſaith again, <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſſe and ſimilitude of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his Reſurrection.</hi> And theſe broken melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearted Saints, that at firſt in their Regeneration were thus humbled, and made low, and poor in Spirit, yielding, inclining, and bowing to the will and pleaſure of Almighty God. This heavenly grace which the Lord calls water in a ſpirituall meaning, abides in and with them alwayes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole life; and by it they are enabled to be Baptized with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as they were born or begotten of water, which is Repentance: So likewiſe at the Lords Supper, they ſometimes, and that with much comfort, eat and drink corporally the Elements of Bread and Wine, and therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Lords death till his comming; but they alwayes by faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of his body and blood, the Spirit of Adoption that dwells in them, ſtill bearing witneſſe of the Lords everlaſting kindneſſe, with the refreſhings
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118541:11"/>
of the light of his countenance, affording them more comfort, then all the abundance of earthly things, or ſhaddows of that which is ſpirituall, the witneſſe and evidence of the Spirit of God, exceeds all teſtimonies and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, and fills the ſoul with ſatisfaction. Now in this condition they know the truth of their Lords words by bleſſed experience. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed, living bread that came downe from heaven, and they that eat thereof, eat everlaſting life. It is immortall food, this body and blood is the reſurrection and the life, for they that eat this fleſh, and drink this blood, dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them.</hi> This food cauſeth union, co-habitation, one-neſſe of mind, and likeneſſe of affection between Chriſt and his Members. This is the fatted Calfe that fed the prodigall, this is the Childrens bread pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of God himſelfe for his ſervant <hi>Iacob,</hi> thoſe excellent dainties, ſweet and fat things, full of marrow, the wine and milk, the honey-comb with the honey, with which the Lord feeds his friends, his beloved and choſen ones, which food doth not only cheare, delight, and comfort, but it confirms, and ſeals with aſſurance, even that gold Ring that ſealed the Fathers favour to his loſt Son, the beſt Robe of all the Wardrobe, for there is none like it in Heaven nor in Earth, for it is the Righteouſneſſe of the Saints, it covers all nakedneſſe, it defends from all dangers, and it ever finds acceptance with their heavenly Father, in all ſervices and ſacrifices, for theſe worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have their hearts purged from an evill conſcience, and their Garments dipt in blood for the Lamb is in them, and they in him. And thus ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all are their prayers alſo, this ſacrifice likewiſe is a broken heart, and as it is the ſpirits habitation and dwelling, ſo it is his place of acting and working; and although the Saints themſelves cannot tell how to pray as they ought, yet the Spirit their continuall comforter, guider, and directer helpeth them, and ſecretly prompteth them with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered, with the Organ of the Tongue, ſo inward, faithfull, and fervent, are the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits requeſts to God that only knowes the meaning thereof: and for their matter they are faithfull ſupplications, they ask in faith, in the name of their Lord, that is, in the powerfull aſſiſtance of Chriſts Spirit; <hi>And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence we have in him</hi> (ſay the Saints) <hi>if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> and if we know that he hears us, that is, if the Spirit do ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us, we know then, that we have the Petitions that we deſired of him; for number they are but few; for place, private; for practice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, often and frequent; <hi>Pray continually,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>And ſhall the Elect cry day and night</hi> unto God their Father, againſt their Enemies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>and ſhall not he avenge them? yea he will avenge them, and that ſpeedily.</hi> In all their ſpirituall warfare, this is the laſt and principall piece of Armour, <hi>Praying alwayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance.</hi> This Servant of our Lords had very well learned his Maſters Leſſon, <hi>Watch and pray, leaſt yee enter into temptation;</hi> and this part of their worſhip is ſpirituall, as the worſhippers themſelves are ſpirituall. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, their underſtanding the Scripture, is not only litterall, but ſpirituall; and that it may the more clearly appear, we muſt remember to make uſe of this diſtinction, that the Scriptures may be ſpoken of as of a Body, and a Spirit, in the letter and the meaning thereof.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118541:12"/>
our Lord ſaith, <hi>He is taught unto the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> it is all one as if he had ſaid, he had been taught of God, and that ſhewes he is a Child of God, a holy man, as I have inſtanced before in the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> deſcription to this purpoſe; and by bringing forth of his treaſure, he means the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his ſpirituall gifts, from the ſupernaturall ſtore houſe within him. Again, our Lord ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth in me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers of water of Life. This he ſpake</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>of the gifts they ſhould receive that beleeved on him.</hi> This effectuall faith, which is twice repeated, and that to which the Word of God witneſſeth to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying drink to the thirſty ſoule, ſheweth ſuch a one to be Regenerate; and the flowing fountain proceeding from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe heavenly gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. And agreeable to this is that which is ſpoke of <hi>Stephen</hi> that Holy Martyr, when thoſe choyce and learned Students of the Synagogues of the Libertines men of four ſeverall Nations, <hi>Cyrenians, Allexandrians, Cyreans,</hi> and <hi>Aſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ans;</hi> theſe, even ſuch were not able to reſiſt the wiſdome and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which he ſpake.</p>
            <p>So the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> ſpeaking to the ſhame of ſuch Prophets that ſpeak without an anſwer from God, that have no Viſion but their own, to whom the day, the light of Gods truth is darke over them, and the Sun is gone downe from them, and yet will Propheſie though they confound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>But truly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgement, and of might, to declare unto</hi> Jacob, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> That is, to Preach to <hi>Jacob.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (ſpeaking of the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Whereof</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am made a Miniſter, according to</hi> (or by) <hi>the gift of grace given to me, by, or through the effectuall working of his power.</hi> And ſo he teſtifies to another Church, <hi>Whereof I am made a Miniſter, according to the diſpenſation of God, which is given to me for you fully:</hi> That is, perfectly, truly, and ſpiritually to preach the Word of God. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> teſtified to the face of ſuch at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> as had Crucified our Lord with wicked hands, and proceeded alſo to forbid them to ſpeak any more to anyman in his name, notwithſtanding their threatnings we cannot (ſaid they) <hi>but ſpeake the things we have ſeene and heard.</hi> What Gods Meſſengers ſee, hear, and learne of the Father, that they declare, that they preach. Chriſt gives the gifts God hath ſet them in his Church, his body, but every member hath not the ſame Office, therefore the differing gifts give being to different Offices and Officers, and all ſpirituall, as the whole body is and are approved of, and allowed by the reſt of the Members, all the Saints.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhould have ſpoken of the keyes, power, and rich treaſures of this Church, but Doctour you are not able to bear it at this time, that is, neither to underſtand it, nor receive it.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, I will anſwer all that he hath ſaid in one word, for all that he hath ſpoken is to be underſtood of the inviſible Church, but all my Diſputes are of viſible Congregations, and Sir, what you mean by them, your owne words declare, page 23. as is touch before, ſuch as any man may know (ſaith he) and if that be ſo, then I am ſure they conſiſt of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and carnall men; and of the ſame nature are their adminiſtrations, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118541:13"/>
               <hi>for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to ſay the true Church of Chriſt is inviſible, is the old cunning cheat of the Devil, to keep men from Repentance, and from attaining that eye ſalve, through which they might diſcerne the things that belong unto their peace, and depart from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and make haſte to <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſaith the Doctour, The <hi>Baptized</hi> Churches have forſaken <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of none but Baptized Members, nothing but pure Ordinances; we are knit together in Church fellowſhip. But by your leave, if ye be carnall, and cannot diſcerne the Church of God, and therefore deny her viſibility, which her Lord affirmeth of her, to be a City ſet upon a Hill, a candle on a Table, the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth. If you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the true Church, and yet you profeſſe your ſelves Churches, then you are no other then the carnall Jewes Church, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from below, which is in bondage with her Children; and the Righteouſneſſe thereof, but the Righteouſneſſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who uſed to waſh the out-ſide, and fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I tell you plainly, Doctour, there are but two Churches in the whole World; one carnall, the other ſpirituall; two ſeeds, the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent; two ſorts of Children, them of light, and them of darkneſſe; two heards of Cattell, the fat and the lean; two kinds of people, the curſed and the bleſſed; and I adviſe you therefore to truſt no longer in lying words, ſaying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> for no outward conceivings, or humane traditions, or inventions, can be Gods Houſe, Church and Temple, but thoſe before deſcribed; and as the Holy Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Temple of the Lord are theſe, ſuch as throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſinnes, and amend their wayes and their doings,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, I adviſe you againe now heedfully and ſpeedily, to mind the Apoſtles counſell, <hi>To day if you will hear his voyce, harden not your heart, leaſt you enter not into his reſt:</hi> where he teacheth you, and me, and all, that to enter into Gods reſt through Faith, is by Repentance.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I will omit no means to take you off from minding ſo much your falſe Church, I will ſhew you in what condition you and all men elſe ſtand in this C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mmon-wealth of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider this I pray you, that this Common-wealth being a Univerſity of Believers, the whole multitude conſiſteth of two ſorts.</p>
            <p>The one ſort Regenerate Believers, ſuch as are borne of God, whoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eſtate is before deſcribed; and this ſort onely are the Church of Chriſt, as before alſo is affirmed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of Believers are outward Chriſtians, and are indewed with the common Faith onely, from which faith and grace they may fall, and periſh, and yet before their apoſtacy have equall right with ſpirituall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118541:13"/>
Chriſtians, in outward externall Ordinances, as the letter of the word and prayer, the waſhing away the filth of the body, and the corporall ſignes of the Lords Supper, and all which, for the more cleare condemnation in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the Goſpel. Now foraſmuch as the Congregation and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England</hi> in theſe reſpects is like the Congregation or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that in Gods great Houſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are both honourable, and diſhonourable Veſſels,</hi> ſervants evill, ſlow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and negligent, as good and diligent Virgins, fooliſh as well as wiſe, ſome ſpirituall, but moſt carnall, and all to be provided for by the Stewards of this great Houſe, ſuch as are in ſupreame authority, not onely in matters between man and man, but alſo in duties between God and man; not onely for <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> but alſo for the publick worſhip and ſervice of God. And as <hi>Moſes, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> provided not onely corporally, but ſpiritually for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo and in like manner the ſupream authority of <hi>England</hi> ought to provide for every one his portion, that no lack or want may befall any capacity, neither of carnall, or ſpirituall Chriſtians, and as wholeſome and good lawes for men, ſo pious and decent Rules for Gods publick worſhip, ſo far as it concernes their power and direction. And conſider alſo, the Jewes before Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation had a Rule for moſt of their externall Ordinances by the Word; as the expreſſe day for Gods Worſhip, and the Tribe who to wait on the ſervice alſo, the time when, the member what, and the parties themſelves both active and paſſive for Circumciſion And for the Paſſeover, what for the matter, the kinde, the age, the preparation, the parties who to provide it, and the manner for participation. Now there is no ſuch expreſſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the carnall Ordinances of God, ſince Chriſts Incarnation and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; 'tis true, there's example for Baptiſme, but no command who ſhall Baptize, neither when for time, nor how for manner, whether all parts of the body in generall, or which member in particular. And ſo for the Supper of the Lord, Bread and Wine are the Elements in the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, and in the future practice injoyned, but who ſhall provide it? and what kinde of wine, or what ſort of Bread, or who in particular ſhall bleſſe or adminiſter it, or how the Communicants ſhall take it, is not in the word determined; and without theſe and the like circumſtances, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances cannot be celebrated. Now if the preſent Authority ſhould give Rules for the whole Common-wealth, or Congregation, for all perticulars; as formerly they have done in a Parochiall way, for time, place, perſons, and adminiſtrations, thereby the ſpirituall and heavenly Chriſtian is bound to yield obedience as the carnall and outward Chriſtian; for as the Saints are free as they relate to the perſon of a true Chriſtian, for ſo their communion is above the reach and rule of any outward direction, for their Baptiſms they are ſpirituall, as I have ſhewed before; their Teacher exceeds all Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from men, for they havean <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy one, that teacheth them all things.</hi> And they ſtand not in need of any private or carnall mens teaching; yet as they ſtand, or ſuſtain the perſons or Members of a State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and under Authority; ſo Gods Law binds them to be obedient to every Ordinance of man; and their communion externally with carnall Chriſtians, doth no more prevent or preinic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their communion ſpiritually,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118541:14"/>
then <hi>Cain's</hi> externall communion corrupted <hi>Abel's, Iſhmaels</hi> defiled <hi>Iſaacks</hi> or the proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> polluted the penitent <hi>Publicans.</hi> And although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſpiritually, yet not externally nor corporally ſevered one from another, till the harveſt, leaſt with extirpating the bad, the good may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer prejudice. And therefore it appears plainly, that in a Common-wealth that profeſſes the Faith, the carnall with the ſpirituall may commuicate in the externall Ordinances of Gods worſhip, except the injunctions are evill and unlawfull, as were the abominations of Antichriſt, from which the Saints are commanded to ſeparate, leaſt by pertaking with her ſins they ſhall be puniſhed with the participation of her plagues. And alſo that it is in the power of the Magiſtrate to order all externalls for the publick worſhip of God, that are not already ſo done by the S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iptures: Now if this be ſo, then what ground or warrant have you or any man whatſoever, to ſelect form, and order Congregations of your ſelves, when the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is congregated already by Chriſtian Authority. And how can thoſe that are under this Authority caſt off their obedience, to which in conſcience they are bound; and gather Churches out of Churches, without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God or man; for they were in the profeſſion and communion of Gods Ordinances before, and emboddyed and congregated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before by Acts of the Nationall Congregation, the high Court of Parliament. And what other things they doe ordaine and conſtitute, that was not done before by the ſaid Authority, the wiſeſt and learnedſt of them all cannot ſhew rightly, nor prove plainly, but it will appear to be their owne imagination, tradition, and phancy, by duely conſidering the Scriptures, with what is aboveſaid, in the diſtinction between the ſpirtuall and carnall Chriſtians; as alſo, the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the externall part of Gods Ordinances, and the Divine and Heavenly part. I am ſure theſe Rules are according to the practice of our Lord and his Apoſtles, they never neglected the publick, nor diſobeyed the Magiſtrate therein, nor contemned participation with them, yet let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bear in minde, that the faithfull and regenerate Chriſtians are the Church of God; and although the carnall Chriſtians are amongſt them in externall participation, yet they are not of them, nor doe ſpiritually partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate with them. The conſequence of ſelected Church-gatherings, admits of many abſurdities, as I have ſhewed in former diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>Thus much Doctour for the publique good hath your private miſtaken conference occaſioned; and we have more yet to make knowne upon the next opportunity.</p>
            <p>And my concluſion ſhall be a word or two to the State and Authority of this Nation, againſt an ancient, continued, ſuperſtitious diſtinction of the people of this whole Common-wealth, even of all degrees, from the higheſt to the loweſt, that diſtinguiſh the whole into two parts, Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, Clergie, and Layetie.

            <p>THou that haſt read what is here declared for publique good; ſee the Doctour and his doings in the glaſſe of one Scripture, <hi>2 Pet. 3. 15, 16.</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of his brother <hi>Paul,</hi> and of his writings according to the wiſedome of God given unto him, he ſpeaks of ſome that notwithſtanding had received the common faith, yet were unlearned and unſtable, who did wreſt not onely what they ſaid, but alſo the other Scriptures to their owne deſtruction. Now the tearms in the Text doe ſhew us plainly what theſe Believers were, even ſuch as ſhould periſh, firſt becauſe they were unlearned, that is, not ſpiritually taught of God: ſecondly, they were ſuch as were unſtable, that is, were not built upon the foundation, neither were deep rooted, as the good ground, but ſuch Chriſtians as were lyable to wither, as the ſtony ground, to be choaked as the thornes, and to looſe what they had, as the High-way ſide. And ſuch Chriſtians as theſe doe not underſtand onely, but they pervert or give falſe Expoſitions of the Scriptures, thoſe Heavenly things intended by the Text, are not underſtood by their earthly minds; therefore it is ſaid, That there are ſome things hard to be underſtood, that is, the Heavenly eſtate of the Children of God, their ſpirituall ſufferings here, and their glorious hope they have of the everlaſting inheritance in the World to come, which ſupernaturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies as they are in themſelves are hard, that is, not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by carnall Chriſtians, ſuch as the Doctour hath declared himſelfe to be in all his Arguments.</p>
