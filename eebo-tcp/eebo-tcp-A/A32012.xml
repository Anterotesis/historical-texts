            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end that the Endeavours of our late deare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King JAMES of blessed memory, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings since his Death in the cause of our deare and onely Sister, Brother in law, Nephewes, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and Princes <hi>Palatine</hi> of the Rhyne may not be forgotten, or pretendedly unknowne, wherein we have studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laboured nothing more then the Peace of Christendome, and the avoyding the effusion of innocent blood, by seeking the restitution and reestablishment of the Electorall house of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> in their ancient Rights, Dignities, and Possessions within the Empire, out of which they have beene by violence and force of Armes, and other undue proceedings expelled and banished, contrary to the ancient Lawes and Constitutions of the Sacred Empire Wee have thought fit for the Vindication of our owne Honour, to call to mind and to publish to the world, both a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Relation of our Actions and endeavours past, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent resolutions in the same cause.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be unknowne to all the Princes and Estates of Europe and more particularly to those who have had any interest or relation to the publique affaires of <hi>Germany,</hi> how both Our self,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94296:2"/>
and our Father have, during these twenty yeares past, by many and severall Embassages, Treaties, and other negotiations, to our great expence &amp; charges, both with the late Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the K. of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other Princes, and Estates of the Empire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all friendly and treatable meanes to procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and reestablishment of Our said deare Sister, Brother in law, and Nephewes, in their antient Rights and Possessions, as the onely and possible way to settle a good and firme Peace in the Empire, and consequently with all Princes interested therein, without which it is impossible to expect or hope for a good, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and honest pacification of those troubles which have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy almost rent and consumed, and involved all the Princes of Christendome in a most bloody and destructive Warre.</p>
            <p>And for a cleare demonstration of Our syncere intentions, not onely our owne pious inclination, and care of the publique peace, hath induced Us to omit divers occasions whereby wee might by such power as God hath put into Our hands, have prevented the violences and oppressions used to our said Sister and Nephewes; But wee have been led on, and invited thereunto by divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, assurances, and reversall Letters, both from the late Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and King of Spaine; and other Usurpers of the Inheritances of the Electorall House <hi>Palatine,</hi> that they would at last in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of our Meditations, hearken and incline to a just and honest Peace by the restitution of the Estates and Dignities of our deare Sister and Nephewes, whereby we have beene drawne not onely to passe by our owne and the publique interest, and to forbeare to ingage our Armes in so just a cause, but also have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by our Fathers and Our authority, the withdrawing, and disbanding of the Forces of Count <hi>Mans<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But what effects all these Our peaceable and Christian endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have produced, and how all Our pious Negotiations have beene eyther delayed or deluded; thereby and by processe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94296:3"/>
time to roote and establish the usurpations of the House <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and our Patience and Piety thereby abused, is so manifest by the continuall oppression of our said deare Sister &amp; Nephews; that we are forced to protest that there hath beene nothing suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to our desires or hopes, but a resolution of despaire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtaining by the wayes of Iustice, Treaty or Amity, that which hath beene so often promised to, and expected of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Christian peace.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding we having lately received advice from Our deare Uncle the King of <hi>Denmarck,</hi> that at last by his mediation and procurement the present Emperor and Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> have condiscended to a treaty to be held at the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> upon the 6. day of <hi>May</hi> last past, for the reviewing and resetling of the controversies of the House <hi>Palatine,</hi> as a preparation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to a generall peace and Amnistia through the whole Empire; And that he with some of the Electors of the Empire is accepted as Mediator of the said cause, and hath deceived strong and pregnant assurances of a better inclination and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition towards the re-establishment of the Electorall Family in their Rights and Dignities; And to that end hath procured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient safe conduct from the Emperour to our Nephew and his Brethren, freely to come in person, or to send their Deputies to that Dyet at the time and place appointed, with all other clauses requisite for their safeties, going, abiding, or comming from thence, and there to plead the Iustice of their owne cause, and that in prosecution thereof, he hath instructed and dispatched his Ambassadours to assist either in person, or by the Deputies of our Nephews, at the said Treaty of Pacification, and hath desired us herein to comply with him by sending our Ambassadours quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and instructed to the same purpose of procuring a good, and setled peace within the Empire, according to the intimation of the Princes Electors signified to him by their Letters, thereby desiring us to assist in the present Assembly at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which end our Nephew the Prince Electour <hi>Palatine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving resolved by our Counsell and advice to send his Deputies according to the invitation and hopes intimated of a good issue to be expected by the amiable way of treaty and composure.</p>

and in some hope of better fruits then hitherto all our endeavors have produced; Have resolved to make this our last legall by the way of treaties, and to lend our Ambassadours to the Emperour, and other Princes in the said Dyet assembled: And to that purpose have given him full power and instructions to contribute all our authority to the procurement and settlement of a good and blessed peace, by the reestablishment and restuittion of the possessions and dignities of our said deare Sstier, Nephewes, and Electorall Family, without which no peace can either be honest or secure.
