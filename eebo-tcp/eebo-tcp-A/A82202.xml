            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have long expected with great impatience, an happy end of our waſting diviſions by meanes of a Perſonall Treaty, ſo often preſſed by our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and earneſtly deſired by the Generality of the Kingdome, as appeareth by the late ſeverall Petitions of the reſpective Counties to that purpoſe. But we find by ſad experience that the <hi>Independent</hi> party, inſtead of applying themſelves to the ſettlement and compoſure of differences, according to their faith publiquely given to the whole Kingdome, (But moſt ſhamefully violated in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of the Army) have ſeized into their hands, and Garriſoned all the ſtrong places of the Kingdome, overrunning, diſarming, and plundering the Country, as if it were a Conquered Nation. And all this for no other cauſe: But that they in an humble way had manifeſted their deſires of Peace, and to have an end of thoſe heavy preſſures; which lay upon them, by the arbitrary power of Committees, and the unjuſt continuation of the Acciſe and Land-taxes, after the utter defeat of the Kings party; from whoſe fines and Compoſitions they drew money enough to have ſatisfied moſt part of the debtes of the Kingdome. And ſeeing likewiſe that the Power and affaires of the Navy, were put into ſuch hands, as were not onely enemies to the King and Kingdome, but even to Monarchy it ſelfe, that the ſtile of Commiſſions at Sea were lately altered, leaving out the Kings name, and mentioning onely the Parliament and Army, which we underſtood to be a diſinheriſon of His Majeſty and His Children, that we had no ſetled forme of Divine worſhip, no Communions, little or no Preaching on board but by illitterate and mechanique perſons, that there was a deſigne of introducing Land Souldiers into every Ship to maſter and over-awe the Sea men, things ſo contrary to the ancient Cuſtomes and orders of the Sea, that we thought our ſelves bound in Conſcience to doe ſomething for the recovery of our owne right &amp; re-ſtabliſhment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion according to the word of God, and the Covenant ſolemnly taken, the Honor, preſervation, and freedome of His Majeſty, the Priviledge of Parliament, and the Liberty of the Subject, and not be made any longer the unhappy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the miſery of King and Kingdome, at which time God put it into our mindes, and incouraged our hearts, and ſtrengthened our hands, to remove Collonel <hi>Rainsburrow</hi> from the command of the Fleet, a man of moſt deſtructive Principles both in Religion and Policy, and a knowne enemy to the Peace and Antient Government of this Kingdom, which we have ſworne to uphold and maintaine with our lives and fortunes, deſiring all honeſt Sea-men not to be deluded any longer with words, but one and all, to joyne with us, and to put too their hands to ſo honeſt a worke, the glory whereof (next under God) will be imputed to them, and the reward no queſtion will be proportionable, both in this world, and the world to come, we have been long preſſed in the Kings Name though againſt His will and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, let us now do Him ſome reall ſervice in this time of His great affliction, which God hath wonderfully enabled Him to bear, and will doubtleſſe in his good time reſtore Him to us, and us to our known Laws and Liberties, looke upon the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> heir apparent of the three Crownes, and <hi>Generaliſsimo</hi> under His Royall Father of all Forces by Sea and Land. Looke upon the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> Lord high Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> Princes of ſo much hope and forwardneſſe, that the world not the like, extracting from the higheſt blood in Chriſtendome, allied to, and befriended by all forraigne Potentates, invited by the <hi>Scottiſh Nation,</hi> and by the beſt part of ours to the recovering of their owne, who have had no hand in the miſeries of this Kingdome, and conſider with your ſelves by what Law of God or man they can be thruſt out of their juſt Poſſeſſions into exile there to live as it were upon the almes of ſtrangers; Come in and joyne with us, and you ſhall want nothing, we have good Ships, good hearts, good hands, and which is worth all, God, and the Law on our ſide. And the Almighty ſearcher of all hearts ſo proſper us in our undertakings as we intend the advancement of his glory in the ſettlement of the true Proteſtant Religion, according to his holy word, the Honour freedome and juſt rights of His Majeſty, the confirmation of the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject by an equall and well grounded Peace.</p>
