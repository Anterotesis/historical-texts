         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as much as to expresse to him that vnderstands not the

it a <hi>Penent,</hi> when it blowes Southeast: a thing in these

very rare and wonderfull, which prosperous &amp; hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

of great aduantage, since that nothing could happen (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
with much industry desired) that might stand
mor auaileable to the furtherance of our Veiage to good
effect.</p>
               <p>But it is a saying no lesse common, then commonly
prooued true, that many things happen betwéen the cup
and the lip, man purposeth and God disposeth: that who

to fall vnder the tempest of ruine: that when good
hap and hope, health and wealth are at the highest, and
like the glorious morning Sunne is vp early to awake
vs, with the promise of a delightfull day, yet euen then
immediately, by the ouercharging of the clowds, the day
is ouercast and our expectation frustrate, the Sun hath
forsooke his promise to lend vs his beames; calmenesse
is turnd to tempests, &amp; the fairnes we had but hope on,
is turned to fearfulnes we had proofe once, euen such
was our hopefull estate, &amp; so sudden was our alteration.
For hauing gotten with this faire wind so high as <hi>Cape
Paul,</hi> the winde presently began to be more duller and
calme, and shortly after to chop vp westerly (which was
against vs) when neither hands nor mindes being idle
we plyed it off on the <hi>Cape,</hi> as the winde would giue vs
<pb facs="tcp:20092:14"/>
leaue for our best aduantage. In which paines hauing
spent some time, and being that day the third of Aprill,
at length we discried thrée saile of ships, whom we after
prooued to be confederates of <hi>Wards;</hi> &amp; within 2. houres
after, perceiued without any amazement (as yet hauing
no cause to mistrust them, that they had vs in chase,
but in the effect they being cleane vessels, by which it
appeared they were newly come out of harbor, &amp; which
helped them to be of better speed, then our consort the
<hi>Pearl:</hi> they came first vp to him, and in conclusion made
him strike saile, but we being of better swiftnes (&amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
seen what they had offred, it was no boot to bid vs
make haste) so that we gaue our Vessell all the saile we
could, but to a bootles purpose, for alter long chase, they
came vp also to vs; and being ech within the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the other, they called aloud to vs, and bad vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
for the great Turke, their Master: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we an
swered, that we were <hi>Englishmen</hi> and Christians, who
whilest we had either power or abilitie to resist, would
not pesantly yéeld vp our freedom to any Pagan breah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But what of all things we least doubted (séeing
they who hayled vs were Turkes) it was that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and our Countrymen, should do seruices amongst
Infidels.</p>
               <p>Yet for certaine it prooued contrary, namely, that
all the Saylers and Sea faring men within these three
ships; to wit, of the Admirall, Vizeadmirall and Rear-Admirall,
were all of them <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and all are most
of them knowen to our Master M. <hi>Daniel Banister,</hi> or to
diuers of our Company.</p>
               <p>Namely, one <hi>Linckes</hi> Master of the Admirall.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Powell,</hi> of their Vize-admirall.</p>
               <p>And one <hi>Foxeley,</hi> an ancient man of their Rear-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall.</p>
               <p>The last of which, most sternely looking vp, as stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told vs, that if we would not presently strike our top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
<pb facs="tcp:20092:14"/>
thereby to shew our yéelding was immediate, they
would ley vs directly aboard with their ships &amp; as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

               <p>When we as resolute to repell, as our enemies were
ready to offer, boldly answered them, that if they were
as constant as their speech to lay vs aboard, we willed
them come on, for we were fitted to bid them welcome.
But such a hot intertainment should they finde, as all
the water that bare them, should hardly bring them into
a coole temper againe, béeing then indeed purposely
minded (finding little comfort by resistance, and no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
to escape) to burne our selues and them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>When they vnderstanding our intent, by the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our answere, compassed vs about on euery side,
with preparation to fight, and at length to sinke vs
with their ordinance, béeing so well enabled for such a
deadly purpose, as Turkish Pirats (before this our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie)
haue, bin neuer heard to bée so strongly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
               <p>But to our purpose, wée séeing them so ready for the
encounter, neglected nothing of the strength wee had,
to fortifie vs for our defence, some of vs managing all
things fitly veneath, whilst that others mand al things
readily aboue: euery man of vs hauing made his soule
fit for heauen, and consenting his body to a watry
graue. So that we bes<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that as they were ready to call vpon vs in fire, and

not to shoote so much as the voice of one small shot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               <p>For two dayes and a night this French Pirate had
vs in chase, and the wind beginning to grow duller and

he was come within a mile of vs, so that the neerer wée

were) chose rather to fall into the hands of them, whose
pursuit made no attempt against vs, than to submit our selues
vnder the crueltie of him, who so long had held
vs in chase, which to effect we made al the spéed we could

men, as by kneeling on our knées, and holding

knowing what we were, they in charity made vp to vs,
and in short time we were come within their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

it would not prooue much for his ease to make vp any

               <p>The first hee spoke when hée came vp to vs, was,

it were a bootlesse resistance and that there was no

daies before. Captaine <hi>Danseker</hi> demaunded of Master
<hi>Startop,</hi> whether the relation of our suprisall was true
or no? who constantly in our behalfe affirmed it to bée
true, when he like a proude (yet we may call him an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest)
Pirate tolde vs, that since the men of <hi>Tunis,</hi> had had
vs in hand, he scorned to rob an hospitall: to afflict where
was miserie before, or to make pray of them who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left. Onely by a Messenger commanded vs, to
<pb facs="tcp:20092:21"/>
shoot off thrée péeces of Ordinance as a thankes to him or
ransome for our libertie and depart: but we certifying
him, that such was the crueltie of our enemies, that wee
had not so much left whereby to gratifie his curtesie, and
answer his command, he forthwith gaue order we should
be dismist, but kept the <hi>Flemming</hi> and M. <hi>Startop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Flemming</hi> was laden with Corne, and vpon it
lay diuers trusses and bales of rich stuffes to the valew
of twentie thousand pound, the which Stuffes hée tooke
away from them, being the Marchants goods, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perticuler aduenture that was due to any priuate
man: so that this is the difference betwéene these two
Pirates, <hi>(Ward</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Danseker</hi> of <hi>Argier:</hi>)
<hi>Ward</hi> makes prey of all and <hi>Danseker</hi> hath compassion
of some: the one contemning to be charitable to any, the
other holding it hatefull to take any thing from them,
who labour in continnall danger to maintaine their
liues. And we haue heard that the like cause as this, was
the falling out betwixt these two Pirates: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
they are now at difference.</p>

                     </gap>lemming</hi> (who before wee haue spoken of)
though at the first he commanded him with him, the next
day he dismissed him and sent him after vs: but M. <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top</hi>
and his whole companie hee carryed away directly
for <hi>Argier,</hi> where what will succéed vnto them it is yet
vncertaine.</p>
               <p>But I must be bolde to remember you, what in this
discourse I haue omitted, that before hee left vs, some of
our confederates, men, who vpon our first taking were
discharged out of their ship, into ours of the <hi>Chari<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ie</hi> sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how vncertaine was their hope, and how continuall
was their danger (since euery shippe we saw, wee must
feare to be a Pirate) they intreated of the <hi>Danseker,</hi> that
he would be pleased to set them a shoars: when hee not
<pb facs="tcp:20092:21"/>
onely condiscended to their request, but also gaue them
foure shillings a péece, to helpe to carry them vp into the
Countrey of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to our sorrow, hauing séene our good friend
