            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Chief Design in this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
is, So to Explain the Nature of
Providence, as to reconcile men to the
Belief of it; and to possess them with a
Religious Awe and Reverence of the
Supreme and Absolute Lord of the
World. For it is very evident, That
the Mistakes about the Nature of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
are the principal Objections against it; which
tempt some men to deny a Providence, or so weaken the
sense of it in others, that they are very little the better for
believing it. That a Divine Providence does Govern the
World, I have proved largely enough for my present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
in the <hi>Discourse concerning a Future Iudgment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 1. § 3.</note> which
I refer my Reader to: But that this Work might not seem
to want a Foundation, I have not wholly omitted the
Proof of a Providence, but have at least said enough to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50615:6"/>
convince those of a Providence, who believe, That there is
a God; which must be supposed in a Discourse of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>The Whole is divided into Nine Chapters.</head>
                  <item>I. The necessary Connection between the Belief of a
God, and of a Providence.</item>
                  <item>II. The General Notion of Providence; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
concerning a Preserving Providence.</item>
                  <item>III. Concerning God's Governing Providence.</item>
                  <item>IV. The Soveraignty of Providence.</item>

               </list>
               <p>The Explication of these Things will not only answer
many Difficulties in Providence, but will give us a clearer
Notion of the Divine Attributes, and of some of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">The necessary Connection between the Belief of a God,
and of a Providence.</head>
               <p>INstead of other Arguments to prove a Providence, I
shall at present insist only on this, That the Belief of a
God infers a Providence: That if we believe there is a
God who Made the World, we must believe that the same
God who Made the World, does Govern it too.</p>
               <p>1. For first, It is as absurd and unreasonable to think,
That the World is Governed by Chance; as to think,
That it was Made by Chance; for Chance can no more
Govern, than it can Make the World.</p>
               <p>One principal Act of Providence is to uphold all things
in being, to preserve their Natures, Powers, Operations;
to make this lower World again every Year by new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions:
For Nature seems to decay, and dye, and revive
again, in almost as wonderful a manner, and as unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us, as it was first made. Now tho it is very absurd
to say, That Chance which acts by no Rule, nor with any
Counsel or Design, can make a World, which has all the
Marks and Characters of an admirable Wisdom in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance;
yet it seems more absurd to say, That Chance
can preserve, that it can uphold the things it has made,
that it can repair the decays of Nature, nay, restore it
when it seems lost: That it can not only do the same thing
twice, but repeat it infinitely in new productions: That
Chance can give Laws to Nature,<note place="margin">Casu, inquis? itanè verò? quidquam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test casu esse factum, quod omnes in se habeat numeros veritatis? quatuor tali jacti casu vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reum efficiunt, num etiam centum venereos, si 400 talos ejeceris, casu futuros putas?—Sic enim se profectò res habet, ut nunquam perfectè veritatem casus imitetur. <hi>Cicero de Divinat.</hi> l. 1.</note> and impose a Necessity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50615:7"/>
on it to act regularly and uniformly; that is, That Chance
should put an end to Chance, and introduce Necessity and
Fate. Were there not a Wise and Powerful Providence,
it is Ten thousand times more likely, that Chance should
unmake and dissolve the World, than that it should at first
make it; for a World that came together by Chance, and
has nothing to keep it together but the Chance that made
it, which is as uncertain and mutable as Chance is, will
quickly unmake it self. Should the Sun but change his
place, come nearer this Earth, or remove farther from it,
there were an end of this lower World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if it were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
there by Chance, it is wonderful, that in so many Ages,
some new unlucky Chance has not removed it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> attributes not only the Creation but the
Preservation of all things to God. <hi>Praise him sun and
moon, praise him ye stars of light: Praise him all ye heavens,
and ye waters that are above the heavens: Let them praise the
name of the Lord, for he spake the word, and they were made;
he commanded, and they were created: He hath made them
fast for ever; he hath given them a law, which shall not be
broken,</hi> 148. Psal. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The same Wisdom and Power which Made the
World, must Govern it too: It is only a Creating Power
that can preserve: That which owes its very Being to
Power, must depend upon the Power that made it, for it
can have no principle of Self-subsistence independent on its
Cause: It is only Creating Wisdom, that perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Natures of all things, that sees all the springs of
Motion, that can correct the Errors of Nature, that can
suspend or direct the Influences of Natural Causes, that
can govern Hearts, change mens Purposes, inspire Wisdom
and Counsel, restrain or let loose their Passions. It is only
an Infinite Mind that can take care of all the World; that
can allot every Creature its portion; that can adjust the
Interests of States and Kingdoms; that can bring Good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50615:7"/>
out of Evil, and Order out of Confusion. In a word,
the Government of the world requires such Wisdom and
such Power, as no Being has but he who made it; and
therefore if the World be governed, it must be governed
by the Maker of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> If there be any such Being as we call God, a Pure,
Infinite, Eternal Mind, it is a Demonstration, That he
must Govern the world.</p>
               <p>Those who deny a Providence, will not allow, that God
sees or takes notice of what is done here below. The <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi>
tho in Civility and Compliment to the Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mankind, rather than from a real belief and sense
of a Deity, they did own a God, nay,
a great many Gods,<note place="margin">Immortali aevo summâ cum pace fruatur.</note> such as they were,
yet never allowed their Gods to know
any thing of our affairs,<note place="margin">Semota a nostris rebus, sejunctaque longè.</note> which would
have disturbed their profound Ease and
Rest, the sole Happiness of the Lazy, Unactive, <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi>
Deities; and this secured them from the fear of their
Gods, who lived at a great distance from them, and knew
nothing concerning them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the same manner this is represented in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
That wicked men would not believe that God
saw, or heard, or took any notice of what they did;
64. Psalm</hi> 5. They encourage themselves in an evil matter,
they commune of laying snares secretly; they say, Who shall
see them. 10. <hi>Psalm</hi> 11. He hath said in his heart, God hath
forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never see it. 94. <hi>Psalm</hi>
7, 8, 9, 10. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall
the God of Iacob regard it. Vnderstand ye brutish among the
people, and ye fools when will ye be wise? He that planted the
ear, shall he not hear? And he that formed the eye, shall he not
see? He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? And
he that teacheth man knowledg, shall not he know? The Lord
knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. <hi>So that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50615:8"/>
these men took it for granted, That if God did see, and
hear, and know what was done in the world, he would
reward men accordingly. And therefore the Providence of
God is described in Scripture by his seeing and observing the
Actions of men. 31. Job</hi> 4. Doth not he see my ways, and count
all my steps? 33. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18, 19. Behold the eye of the Lord is upon
them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; <hi>that is,
to protect them, and to do good to them; as it follows,</hi> to
deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
<hi>And therefore when good men pray for help and succour,
they only beg God to see and take notice of their condition;
1. Lam.</hi> 11. See, O Lord, and consider, for I am become vile.
64. <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
<hi>Thus in</hi> Hezekiah<hi>'s Prayer,</hi> Incline thine ear, O Lord, and
hear, open thine eyes, O Lord, and see, and hear all the
words of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> which hath sent to reproach the living
God: <hi>And therefore God's seeing, is made an argument
that he will reward or punish, 10. Psalm</hi> 14. Thou hast seen
it, for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with
thy hand. <hi>And indeed it is not to be imagined, that a holy
and just God, who sees and observes all the good and evil
that is done in the world, should not reward the good, and
punish the wicked; for there is no other Holy and Just
Being in the world, that has authority to reward and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
but would certainly do it. And if the Proof of a
Divine Providence be resolved into God's knowing what
is done in the world, the Dispute will be soon ended; for
those who believe that there is a God, and that he is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
Omnipresent Mind, cannot doubt whether he sees
and knows all things. As the Psalmist elegantly expresses
it, 139. Psalm</hi> 1.—13. O Lord, thou hast searched me
and known me. Thou knowest my down-sitting, and my up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising,
thou understandest my thought afar off? Thou compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all
my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50615:8"/>
thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me hehind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
for me, it is too high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither
shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there, if I make
my bed in hell, behold thou art there. If I take the wings of
the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even
there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me:
If I say, surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night
shall be light about me; yea, the darkness hideth not from thee,
but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are
both alike to thee; for thou hast possessed my reins, thou hast
covered me in my mother's womb. <hi>How is it possible, that
an Omnipresent Mind should be ignorant of any thing, or
that the Maker of the World should not be present with all
his Creature, or that being present, and seeing all their
Actions, he should be an idle and unconcerned Spectator?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> For I think in the next place, it is past all dispute,
that he who made the World cannot be unconcerned for his
Creatures. He hath implanted in most Creatures a natural
care of their Offspring; and it is made an argument of want
of understanding in the <hi>Ostrich, That she leaveth her Eggs in
the Earth, and warmeth them in the dust, and forgetteth that
the foot may crush them, or that the wild Best may break
them. She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were
not hers: Her labour is in vain without fear, because God
hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her
understanding,</hi> 39. Job 15, 16, 17. And can we think
then, that an infinitely wise Being, should be as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for the World, as the <hi>Ostrich</hi> is for her Eggs?</p>
               <p>It is certain the Maker of the World is no sluggish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
Being; for to make a World is a Work of infinite
Wisdom and Counsel, of Divine Art and Power; and not
only to give being to that which was not, is it self an act of
excellent Goodness, but there are so many legible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50615:9"/>
of a Divine Bounty and Goodness stamped upon all
the Works of Nature, that we must conclude, the World
was made by an infinitely good Being; and it is impossible
that a wise and good Being, who is a pure Act, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Life, can cast off the care of his Creatures. Besides
the Laws of God and Men, natural Affection will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
men to forget their Children; and though God has no
Superior, his own Nature is a Law to himself.</p>
               <p>This is sufficient to shew, how necessarily the belief of
a God infers a Providence, and therefore no Philosophers,
excepting <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and his Sect, who
acknowledged a Deity,<note place="margin">Epicurum verbis reliquisse Deos, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sustulisse, <hi>de Nat. Deor.</hi> l, 2.</note> ever denied a
Providence; and <hi>Tully</hi> tells us, that
he retained the name of a God, but
destroyed his Being.<note place="margin">Quo concesso confitendum est eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Consilio mundum administrari, <hi>de Nat. Deor.</hi> l. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Stoick in <hi>Tully</hi> concludes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
from the acknowledgment of
a God: And therefore tells us, that
Providence signifies the Providence of
God:<note place="margin">Providentia praecisè dicitur pro Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia Deorum. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> And those Philosophers made no
scruple of calling God Providence and
Fate,<note place="margin">Chrysippus Legis perpetuae &amp; aeternae vim, quae quasi dux vitae, &amp; Ministra Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum sit, Jovem dicit esse, eandem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que fatalem necessitatem. <hi>Ibid,</hi> l, 1.</note> and the Power of an Eternal and
Perpetual Law. For indeed Mankind
had no other notion of a God, than
that he is an Excellent and Perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Aliquam excellentem esse &amp; praestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem naturam, quae haec fecisset, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veret, regeret, gubernaret. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note>
who made, and who governs the
World. This is the notion which the
Philosophers, who acknowledg'd a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
defended against <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Atheists;<note place="margin">Imposuitis in cervicibus nostris sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternum Dominum, quem dies &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes timeremus; quis enim non timeat omnia providentem, &amp; cogitantem, &amp; animadvertentem, &amp; omnia ad se per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere putantem, curiosum, &amp; plenum negotii Deum. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> this is the notion of a
God, which Atheists oppose, the God
whom they fear, an Eternal Lord,
who observes, and takes notice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, and thinks himself concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all the Affairs of the World.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50615:9"/>
And therefore the Dispute, Whether there be a God or
no, principally resolves it self into this, Whether this
World, and all things in it, is made and governed by Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Counsel, or by Chance, and a blind material Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Fate: which proves, that the very notion of
God includes a Providence, or else either to prove or to
overthrow the Doctrine of Providence, would neither
prove, nor overthrow the Being of a God.</p>
               <p>This, I am sure, is very plain, That the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which prove the Being of a God, prove a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
If the beauty, variery, usefulness, and wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of the Works of Nature, prove that the World
was at first made by a wise and powerful Being; the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and preservation of all things, the regular motions
of the Heavens, the uniform productions of Nature, prove
the World is upheld, directed and governed by the same
Omnipotent Wisdom and Counsel. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
<hi>The invisible things of God from the creation of the world,
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> 1 Rom. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his
Dominion and Soveraignty, or his governing Providence;
this visible World does not only prove an Eternal Power
which made it, but a Soveraign Lord, who administers all
the Affairs of it. And 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. He proves the Being
of God from his Providence; <hi>Nevertheless he left not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without witness in that he did good, and gave us rain
from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with
food and gladness.</hi> And 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. He proves, that
God governs the World, and takes care of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that are in it, because he made it; <hi>For in him we
live, move, and have our being, as certain of your own Poets
have said; for we are also his off-spring:</hi> which is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
alledged by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> if we may be the Off-spring
of God, and yet not live, and move, and have our Being
in him; that is, if God's making the World does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50615:10"/>
prove his constant care and governmet of it.
But the Apostle knew in those days, that no man, who
confessed that God made the World, questioned his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and therefore makes no scruple to prove, that we
live and subsist in God, because he made us.</p>
               <p>This is a noble Argument to prove both the Being and
Providence of God (which cannot be separated) from the
Works of Nature, and the Wise Government of the World;
It would give us a very delightful entertainment, to view
all the Curiosities and suprizing Wonders of Nature; with
what beauty, art and contrivance, particular Creatures
are made, and how the several parts of this great Machine
are fitted to each other, and make a regular and uniform
World; How all particular Creatures are fitted to the use
and purposes of their several Natures, and yet are made
serviceable to one another, and have as mutual a connexion
and dependance, as the Wheels of a Clock. What an
equal and steady Hand governs the World, when its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
seem most excentrick and exorbitant, and brings Good
out of Evil, and Order out of Confusion, when things are
so perplext, that it is impossible for any one, but a God, to
disentangle them.</p>
               <p>There is no need of the subtilty of Reason and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this Cause, would but men attentively study the
Works of God, and dwell in the contemplation of Nature
and Providence; for God is as visible in his Works, as the
Sun is by its Light; when all the Wonders of Nature are
unfolded, and exposed particularly to our view, it so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers
the mind with such infinite varieties of that most
Divine Art and Wisdom, that modest men are ashamed to
ascribe such things to a blind Chance, which has no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or Counsel.</p>
               <p>Indeed to say, that a World full of Infinite Marks and
Characters of the most admirable Art, a World so made,
that no Art could make it better, was not made by a wise
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50615:10"/>
Mind, but by Chance, by a fortuitous concourse of Atoms,
which without any Design, after infinite fruitless Trials,
happened into this exact, useful, beautiful Order, that now
they are in, know when they are well, and in despight of
Chance move as constantly, regularly, artificially, in all
new Productions, as the divinest and most uniform Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
could direct: I say, to affirm this, is to put an end to
all Disputes, by leaving no Principles of Reason and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation
to dispute with.</p>
               <p>An Atheist is the most vain Pretender to Reason in the
World: The whole strength of Atheism consists in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
the universal Reason of Mankind. They have no
Principles, nor can have any, and therefore they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reason, but only confidently deny or affirm. They
can assign no Principles of Reason, which the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
allow to be Principles, from whence they can prove
that there is no God, and no Providence; but they only
reject those Principles, which all other men agree in, and
from whence it must necessarily follow, that there is a God
and a Providence.</p>
               <p>It will be of great use briefly to explain this, which will
teach you to reject Atheism and Atheists, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
your selves to dispute with them; for they have no
common Principles with the rest of Mankind to reason up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor indeed any Principles of Reason at all.</p>
               <p>A few words will suffice for this purpose. Mankind,
who have been used to thinking and reasoning, have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
agreed, That there must be something that had
no beginning, and no cause; for nothing can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
that had there ever been a time, when there was
nothing, there never could have been any thing, unless
there can be an effect without a cause, which is too absurd
for Atheists themselves to say in express words, who do not
boggle much at Absurdities; and therefore they make their
Atoms, and their <hi>Vacuum,</hi> to be eternal. It is agreed also,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50615:11"/>
That whatever had a beginning, had a cause; and the
most easy and natural progress of Human Understandings
is to reason from one cause to another, till we ascend to,
and center in, a first Cause. For it is as easy and natural
to believe one first Eternal Cause, as to believe an Eternal
Being; but though it is natural to believe something Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
it is as unnatural to believe all things to be so; we
have no notion of all things being Eternal, though we have
of an Eternal Cause; for the very reason why we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to confess something Eternal, is, because there must be
an Eternal Cause of all other things; that is, because all
things are not eternal: But if any thing, which has not an
eternal and unchangeable Nature, but is capable of being
made and unmade, changed and altered, as all the things
of this World are, might be without a Cause, then every
thing may be without a Cause; and if the Eternity of all
things be a natural Notion, it cannot be a natural Notion
that there is a first Cause. For that very Notion supposes,
that something had a beginning, and was originally made,
when it was not before, and therefore, that all things are
not eternal. For to be <hi>made</hi> in this Axiom, primarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the being of things, and is so understood by all
men: And how can such a notion of the making and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
being to any thing, be natural, if it be a natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that all things are eternal, and that nothing was
made?</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that seen and visible Effects, which have no
visible Cause adequate to the producing such Effects, are
allowed by all Mankind to be a sufficient proof of some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Cause, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us; and he spoke the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Human Nature in it; <hi>That the invisible things of
God from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the things that are made,</hi> 1. Rom. 20. For if
that which is made, must have a Cause, if there be no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cause, there must be an invisible Maker: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50615:11"/>
this World, which has no visible, must have an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Cause.</p>
               <p>And as it is natural to the Reason of Mankind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Cause from the Effect, so is it to learn the Nature
of the Cause from the Nature of the Effect; for whatever
is in the Effect, must be either specifically or virtually in the
Cause; for whatever is in the Effect, which is not in the
Cause, that has no Cause, for nothing can be a cause of
that, which it is not it self. And therefore whatever has
life and understanding, must be made by a living and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Cause; whatever has art and skill, and wise
contrivance in its frame, as every Worm and Fly has, must
have a wise designing Cause for its Maker: And then it is
certain, that this whole World was not made by chance,
or the fortuitous concourse of Atoms, but by an infinitely
wise Mind. This way of reasoning is easy and natural to
our minds; all men understand it, all men feel it: Atheists
themselves allow of this kind of proof in all other cases,
excepting the proof of a God or a Providence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no absurd, foolish way of reasoning, for then it
must not be allowed of in any case; and they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to reject it in this case, but that they are resolved not
to believe a God and a Providence. And yet this way of
reasoning from Effects to Causes, must be good in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or in none: For the Principle is universal, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be made without a Cause, and if any thing can
be made made without a Cause, this Principle is false,
and can prove nothing. And I challenge the wisest and
subtilest Atheist of them all, to prove from any Principle
of Reason, that the most beautiful and regular House that
ever he saw, which he did not see built (for that is a proof
from Sense, not from Reason) was built by men, and is a
work of Art, and that it did not either grow out of the
Earth, nor was made by the accidental meeting of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Materials, which without knowledge, art, or design,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50615:12"/>
fell into a regular and uniform Building. Had these men
never seen a House built, I would desire to know, how
they would prove, that it is a work of Art, built by a
skilful Workman, and not made by chance; and by what
medium soever they will prove this, I will undertake to
prove, that God made the World, though we did not see
him make it.</p>
               <p>But the present Enquiry is only this, Whether this be
Human Reason, the natural Reason of Human Minds?
If it be, then men, who will be contented to reason
like men, must acknowledge and assent to this Argument
from Effects to Causes, which unavoidably proves a God
and a Providence; and this is all I desire to be granted,
That those who will follow the Notices and Principles of
Human Reason, must believe that God made and governs
the World; for I know not how to reason beyond Human
Reason; those who do, may please themselves with it.</p>
               <p>Those who have found out a Reason, which contradicts
the natural Principles of Reason, must reason by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for Mankind cannot reason with them.</p>
               <p>But let us consider how Atheists reason, when they have
laid aside this Principle of Reason, from Effects to Causes.</p>
               <p>They tell us, That a most Artificial World may be made
without Art, or any wise Maker, by blind Chance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any designing Efficient Cause: That Life, and Sense,
and Reason, may result from dead, stupid, sensless Atoms;
Well! we hear this, and bear it as patiently as we can;
but how do they prove this; why, they say, <hi>it may be,</hi>
and they can go no farther: But how do they know, this
<hi>may be?</hi> Have they any such notion in their minds? have
they any natural sensation that answers these words? does
Nature teach them, that any thing can be without a Cause
adequate to the Effect? that any thing can be wisely made
without a wise Cause? that one contrary can produce the
other? that sensless, stupid Matter can produce Life,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50615:12"/>
Sensation and Understanding? Can they then tell me, what
it is that <hi>can't be?</hi> I desire to know by what Rule they
judge, what <hi>may be,</hi> and what <hi>can't be:</hi> And if they can find
any <hi>can't be</hi> more absurd and contradictious than their <hi>may
be,</hi> I will renounce Sense and Reason for ever: If nothing
can be without a Cause, according to the Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
this can't be, and therefore all that their <hi>may be's</hi> can
signify, is this, That if the Reason of Mankind deceive us,
such things <hi>may be,</hi> as the most unquestionable Principles
of Reason tells us <hi>can't be.</hi> And this is the glorious triumph
of Atheistical Reason, it can get no farther than <hi>a may be,</hi>
and such <hi>a may be</hi> as is absolutely impossible, if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Mankind be true.</p>
               <p>Set aside the relation between Causes and Effects, and
all the Arguments from Causes to Effects, and from Effects
to Causes, and there is an end of all Knowledge; and set
aside all those first Principles and Maxims of Reason, which
all men assent to at the first Proposal, the truth of which
they see and feel, and there is an end of all Reason: For
there can be no reasoning without the acknowledgment of
some first Principles, which the mind has a clear, distinct,
and vigorous perception of: And if men will distrust their
own minds in such things as they have an easy, natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of, and prefer some Arbitrary Notions, which seem
absurd Contradictions, and impossible to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and which they can have no Idea of beyond the sound
of words; they may be Atheists, if they please, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their Reason and Understanding; that is, they
may be Atheists, if they will not judge and reason like
Men: But if we are as certain of the Being of a God, and
of a Providence, as we are, <hi>that nothing can be without a
Cause,</hi> we have all the certainty that Human Nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">The general Notion of Providence, and particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Preserving Providence.</head>
               <p>HAving proved as largely as my present Design requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
That the same God who made the World, is the
Supream Lord and Governour of it. I proceed to consider
the Nature of Providence.</p>
               <p>The general Notion of Providence is God's care of all
the Creatures he has made, which must consist in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and upholding their Beings and Natures, and in such
Acts of Government, as the good Order of the World, and
the Happiness of Mankind require; which divides Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
into Preservation and Government, which must be
carefully distinguished in order to answer some great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in Providence.</p>
               <p>I begin with <hi>Preserving Providence,</hi> which commences
from the first instant of the Creation; for as soon as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are made, they need a Divine Power to preserve
them. For this is the strict Notion of Preservation, as
distinguished from a Governing Providence, That God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
all things in being from falling back into their first
Nothing, and preserves their natural Vertues, Powers and
Faculties, and enables them to act, and to attain the ends
of their several Natures: Which distinguishes this Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Providence from those many Acts of Preservation
which belong to Government: Such as preserving the
Lives of men from unseen Accidents, and visible Dangers,
nay of Beasts and of Birds too, as our Saviour assures us,
<hi>That not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18. Matth 29.</note>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50615:13"/>
in which sense the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">36. Psal. 6.</note> That God <hi>preserves
both man and beasts,</hi> supplies them with Food, and all other
things necessary to life, and preserves their Lives from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or accident, as long as he sees fit.</p>
               <p>This Preservation as distinguish'd from Government,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly teaches 17. <hi>Acts 28. For in him we live,
and move, and have our being.</hi> We were not only made
by him, but we live, and move, and have our being in
Him; as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us of Christ, <hi>That
he upholds all things by the word of his power,</hi> 1. Hebr. 3.</p>
               <p>The Schools have divided this into two distinct Acts.
1. God's upholding and preserving the Being and Natures
of all things. 2. His Co-operating with all Creatures, and
by a perpetual influx and concourse actuating their natural
Powers to perform their natural Actions; that is, That we
<hi>have our being in him,</hi> that <hi>we live, and move, and act in
him,</hi> or by a new influx of power from him.</p>
               <p>As for the first, The preservation of all things in being,
besides those Texts of Scripture, which expresly attribute
this to God, the Schools urge several Arguments for the
proof of it, which I think may be resolved into this one;
That whatever does not necessarily exist by the internal
Principles of its own Nature, must depend on its Cause, not
only for its Being, but for its Continuance and Preservation.
For there is no medium between necessary Existence, and
dependance on its Cause.</p>
               <p>The very notion of a Creature does not only include in it,
<hi>its being made,</hi> but its <hi>dependance on its Maker for its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in being:</hi> For whatever does not necessarily exist,
must not only be made at first, but must be upheld and
preserved in being; for it can no more preserve, than it can
make it self: It was nothing once, and what was once no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
may be nothing again, and therefore cannot subsist
of it self, but in dependance on its Maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50615:14"/>
It is not with the Being and Natures of things, as it is
with the Works of Art, which though they cannot make
themselves, yet when they are made, can subsist without
the Artist that made them. As a House cannot build it self,
but when it is built, it continues of it self, as long as the
Materials and Workmanship last, when the Workman has
left it; for the Workman does not give being to the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
but only to the Form, which subsists in the Matter,
and that in its first Cause: but whatever receives its Being
from another, as all Creatures do, has nothing to support
its Being, but the Cause that made it.</p>
               <p>This is so certain, that I should make no scruple to say,
That God can no more make an Independent Creature,
which can subsist without him, than he can make an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Creature, which shall have no beginning; which is
not want of Power in God, but a repugnancy and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the Nature of Creatures. That which once
was not, can never be so made as to have no beginning;
that which has not a necessary existence, as nothing has,
which once was not, cannot be made to exist necessarily,
without dependance on its Cause, because necessary exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
is not in its Nature, for then it would always have
been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> has another Argument to prove the dependence
of Creatures on the perpetual influx of Power from the first
Cause, which possibly some may think only a School-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
but seems to me to have great weight in it; and it
proceeds upon this Supposition, (which all men must
grant) That if God made the World out of nothing, he
could annihilate all things, and reduce them into nothing
again, if he so pleased: Now he says, That Annihilation
is not an Act of Power, for all positive Acts of Power must
have some real and positive effect; whereas to annihilate
is to make nothing, and therefore to do nothing: Now if
to annihilate be no Act of Power, then it can be nothing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50615:14"/>
else, but a withdrawing that Power, which supported all
things in being; and that proves, That all things are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in being by the Divine Power, if they cannot subsist,
but fall into nothing again, when that Upholding and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Power is withdrawn.</p>
               <p>This is a very sensible Argument, if we distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
what we call destroying, and annihilating, which
is apt to confound us in this matter. To destroy, is only
to change the present form and compages of things, while
the matter and substance continues the same; thus God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Old World by Water, and will destroy this
World by Fire again; which is like pulling down a House,
without destroying the Materials; and this is an Act of
Power, and has a positive effect; but to annihilate, is to
reduce something to nothing, which is to do nothing, and
therefore is no Act of Power, but only a Cessation of Power.
And if not to uphold, is to annihilate, then all things sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
as well as are made, by the Power of God.</p>
               <p>I shall only add, That God cannot make a Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
on himself, without bestowing on it a self-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
Nature, or necessary existence; for whatever does
not necessarily exist by the internal Principles of its Nature,
must depend on something else to uphold it in being. Now
besides, what I observed before, That whatever necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
exists, can't be made, but must be eternal. For that
which exists necessarily, must always exist, without a
Cause, and without a Beginning; for nothing can begin
to have a necessarily self-subsisting Nature. I now add, That
whatever necessarily is, can't be changed, destroyed, annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
for whatever necessarily is, necessarily is what it is;
which proves, That if God can annihilate whatever he has
made, then all things subsist by the Will, and Pleasure, and
Power of God, not by the internal Principles of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for whatever necessarily exists, can never be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
for that is a contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50615:15"/>
How God upholds all things in being, we no more
know, than how at first he made all things, when there
was nothing; and therefore it is a vain Inquiry of the
Schools, which no man can resolve, and which serves no
End in Religion, Whether Creation and Preservation be
the same, or two different Acts? Whether Preservation be
a continued Creation? or whether they be two distinct and
different Acts of Power, to Make, and to Preserve? For
how can any man know this, who neither knows, how God
creates, nor how he preserves. Thus much is certain,
That to Create, is to give being to that which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
to Preserve, is to continue that in being which was
made before; and when any thing is once created, it can
never be new created, till it fall into nothing again; for to
create, is to make out of nothing, not to make a thing
which already is; but by what Acts of Power either of
these is done, we cannot tell, nor are we concerned to
know; for what way soever this is done, we equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on God, we live and subsist in him.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing fit to be observed, That this Act
of Preservation, which consists in upholding all things in
being, is fixt by a perpetual and unchangeable Decree:
That though God will dissolve this present frame of things,
and it may be, cast the World into a new Mould, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is made, neither Matter, nor Spirit, shall be
annihilated, or reduced into nothing again. This I think
we may safely conclude from the Promises and Threatnings
of Eternal Rewards and Punishments, which supposes,
that both Good and Bad men shall live for ever, the
one to be happy, the other to be miserable to Eternity;
and then we may reasonably conclude, That the World,
whatever Changes it may suffer, will continue as long
the Inhabitants of it do.</p>
               <p>This is the first Act of what we call Preserving Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to uphold all things in being, in distinction, as I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50615:15"/>
observed before, from those several Acts of Preservation,
which concern a Governing Providence.</p>
               <p>A Second Act of Preserving Providence, is what the
Schools call, God's Co-operation and Concourse with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in all their Actions, that we not only live, and have
our being, but that we move in God; that whatever we
do, we do by a natural Power received from God; and
this is as certain, as that we have our being in him; for if
we live, we must move in him.</p>
               <p>But then whether God's Co operation and Concourse
be a different Act from his preserving the natural Vertues
and Powers of Action, is a nicer and more intricate Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and neither the thing, nor the reason of it, is easy
to be conceived. Natural Powers are Internal Principles
of Action, when a Creature acts from an inward Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Nature; but if these Natural Powers, while they are
preserved in their full force and vigour by God, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
themselves, without a new extrinsick, determining
motion from God, then they seem to be no Natural Powers,
for they cannot act by Nature, if this be true; the Fire
don't burn by nature, for though God preserves its nature,
it cannot burn without some new co-operating Power,
which is not in its nature. A man don't reason and judge,
chuse and refuse by Nature; for though God preserve his
Natural Powers and Faculties of Understanding and Will,
yet he can neither understand nor will, unless he be moved,
acted, determined by God: This seems to make the whole
World a meer Apparition, and empty Scene, which has
nothing real. Whatever we see done in the World, is not
done by Creatures, who seem to do it; for they are only
acted like Machines, not from the Internal Principles and
Powers of Nature, but from External Motion: But God
does every thing himself by an immediate Power, even all
the Contradictions and Contrarieties we see in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:50615:16"/>
This is a very great difficulty, which I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to determine one way or other; but thus much, I
think, we may safely say, That if we will attribute any
thing to Creatures, if we will allow, that they ever act
from a Principle of Nature, we must confess, that God
co-operates only to the natural Power of Action, that is,
That he only enables them to act according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without changing, influencing, determining their
Natures, otherwise than these Natural Powers would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
act. For this is all that is necessary to Action,
when God has created the Natural Powers; and this is all
the co-operation that can belong to God, as the Maker and
Preserver of all things.</p>
               <p>Whatever is more than this, as I acknowledge there is
a great deal more that God does, it belongs to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not to a Preserving Providence: God does a great deal
more, than merely co-operate with our Natural Powers
<hi>to perform Natural Actions,</hi> but this he does as a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
not merely as a Preserver: The not distinguishing
of which has occasioned great mistakes in the Doctrine of
Providence; as to show this briefly.</p>
               <p>God has endowed all Creatures with such Natural
Powers and Vertues, as may answer the End for which
they were made. He has made the Sun to shine, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
and refresh the World; the Fire to burn, the Earth
to bring forth all sorts of Herbs, and Grass, and Corn, and
Fruit, the Vapours to ascend out of the Earth to purge and
fan the Air with Winds, and to fall down again in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Showers; every Herb and Flower and Tree has its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Seeds to propagate its Kind, as all living Creatures
have.</p>
               <p>Now as it had been to little purpose for God to have
made a World without upholding it in being, for Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
can no more preserve, than they can make themselves;
so it had been to as little purpose, to have endowed all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50615:16"/>
Creatures with such Vertues and Powers, as belong to their
several Natures, without such a natural Co-operation,
whatever that be, as shall enable their Natural Powers to
act, and to attain the ends of their Natures; and therefore
God established this Natural Concourse and Co-operation
to actuate all the Powers of Nature, by a perpetual Law,
which is that Blessing God bestowed upon all Creatures at
the time of the Creation. For though this Blessing, to
Encrease, and Multiply, and to replenish the Sea, and Air,
and Earth, which preserves and invigorates the Powers of
Nature, be expressed only of living Creatures, the Fish,
and Fowls, and Beasts, and Men, yet it equally belongs
to the whole Creation, as will be easily granted; and
makes Nature regular and constant in all its Motions and
Productions.</p>
               <p>But there are other Acts belong to God's Government
even of the Material World, as I shall shew you more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
As to direct the Vertues and Influences of Nature,
or to suspend and restrain them: To make the Earth fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or barren, the Air wholsome or Pestilential, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Dews and Showers of Heaven, or to give the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and latter Rain in its Season, to cause it to Rain upon
one City, and not upon another, and so to temper the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of Nature, as to punish the Wickedness, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Obedience of Mankind; these are Acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and of a quite different kind from actuating the
Powers of Nature to attain their Ends, and to do what they
were made for.</p>
               <p>Thus to consider the Rational World; God has endowed
Man with the Natural Faculties of Understanding and
Will, to judge, and to chuse for himself; and he preserves
these Faculties, and gives them a natural Power to act, to
understand, and will: But this natural Co-operation of
God can extend no farther than to the natural Power of
acting, not to any specifical Acts; it does not improve any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50615:17"/>
man's Understanding, nor incline his Judgment, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
his Choice; it makes no alteration in the Powers of
Nature, but only enables them to act according to their
Natures; it is only like winding up a Clock, which puts
it into motion, but gives no new preternatural motions to
it, but leaves its motions to be guided by its own Springs
and Wheels Whatever this Co-operation of God be,
which is thought necessary to actuate our Natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it gives no new Byas to us, but leaves us perfectly
in a state of Nature, and only enables us to do that, which
we should do of our selves without any such Co-operation
of God, could we act without it.</p>
               <p>But in the Government of Mankind God exercises a very
different Power over the minds of men. He changes the
Hearts and Counsels of men, imprints new thoughts upon
their Minds, claps a new byas upon their Wills and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
the Hearts of Princes are in his hands, and he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them as Rivers of Waters. He renews and sanctifies
Good men by his Spirit; enlightens their Understandings,
changes their Wills, inspires them with Divine Affections:
He gives up Bad men to the impostures of wicked spirits,
to their own affected Ignorance, Blindness, Inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the Obstinacy and Perverseness of their own Wills,
and to the Empire of their Lusts. Every one must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that this is a very different thing from God's co-operating
with our Natural Faculties to will, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
for that makes no change in our Natural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
and Wills, but only enables them to act;
but this improves, and heightens, and regulates our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
enlarges our Knowledge, and rectifies our Choice,
and directs and governs our Passions; and yet these things
have not been well distinguished, which has very much
obscured and perplexed the Doctrines both of Providence
and Grace, as I shall now shew you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50615:17"/>
For having thus briefly explained the difference between
a Preserving and Governing Providence, that this may not
be thought a more subtil than useful Speculation, it will
be necessary to shew you, of what great use this is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
some of the greatest Difficulties in the Doctrine of
Providence.</p>
               <p>Now as the foundation of all, I shall ask but one thing,
which every man must grant; That it becomes God to
preserve the Creatures which he has made, to uphold them
in being, and to actuate their Natural Powers, as far as is
necessary to enable Creatures to perform those Natural
Actions, which their Natures are fitted and made for.
If it became the Wisdom and Goodness of God to make
Creatures with such Powers and Faculties of acting, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him also to preserve their Beings, and Natures, and
Powers of Action. To Make, is to give a Being and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to that which was nothing; to Preserve, is only to
continue its Being, and to enable it to act according to its
nature; and therefore we must either approve or disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of both alike.</p>
               <p>Let us then lay down this as an acknowledged Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
That we must not quarrel with the Providence of
God, for any thing which is a mere Act of Preservation,
not an Act of Government. For to uphold the being, and
nature, and operations of all things, is no fault, whatever
evil consequences may attend it; and therefore those who
have a mind to quarrel at Providence, must find some fault,
if they can, in God's government of Creatures, not in the
Acts of Preservation; and this easily answers some of the
most difficult Objections against Providence. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>Since no Creature can move, or act, or do any thing,
without the Concourse and Co-operation of God, some are
wonderfully puzled to give an account, why God should
co-operate with any Creature in sinful Actions. Why
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50615:18"/>
God should actuate mens Understandings and Wills, and
their other natural Powers and Faculties, when he certainly
knows, that if he enables them to act, they will act wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly;
they will chuse that which is wicked, and will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their wicked Designs: That if they have the exercise
of their Natural Powers, they will defile themselves with
Adultery, and Drunkenness, and Theft, or Murther, and
all manner of Wickedness: And how can a holy God co-operate
in all the Wickedness which is committed? When
men do wickedly by the Power and Co-operation of God,
without which they can do nothing, how does the Sin
come to be the man's, when the Action is God's, as done
by his immediate Power?</p>
               <p>I shall not trouble you with other Answers, which are
commonly given to this Difficulty; for what I have now
discoursed, gives a plain and easy solution to it: For all
this, however it be represented, comes to no more, than
God's preserving the Natures of Creatures, and actuating
their Natural Powers to perform the Offices of Nature;
and if this be such a fault, as intitles God to all the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
they commit, the original Fault is in making such
Creatures; for if it were no fault to make them, it can be
no fault to preserve their Natures. Does it become the
Wisdom of God to make Creatures, who must act depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
on himself, and to deny them the natural Powers of
acting, which is to unmake them again? And if this does
not become the Wisdom of God, then it can be no fault in
God to co-operate with the natural Powers of men, even in
their sinful Actions; nor any more intitle God to their Sins,
than his making Creatures with such natural Powers: For
to preserve their Natures, and to actuate their natural
Powers, is no more a cause of their Sin, than to make such
Natures, and such natural Powers.</p>
               <p>To represent this as plainly as I can, Let us suppose that
God had created Man with a natural power to act without
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50615:18"/>
needing such a perpetual concourse and co-operation to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to act, would this charge God with the Sins of
men, because they act, even when they sin, by a power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from him in their first Creation? If this makes God
the Author of Sin, then God can't make a Creature, who
is capable of sinning by the abuse of its natural Powers,
without being the Author of Sin, which is too absurd for
any thinking man to say: And yet if it does not, How
does God's perpetual concourse and co-operation with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to enable them to act, and to exert their natural
Powers, make God the Author of Sin? for this is no more
than a natural power to act, and it makes no difference,
whether this natural power be given once for all, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Power in Creatures, or be supplied every minute;
for both ways the Power is the same, and equally derived
from God: and if the natural power of acting charges God
with mens Sins, the Charge lies equally against a creating
and co-operating Power; if it does not, God is no more
chargeable with Sin for co-operating with mens natural
Powers in every Action, than he would be, for creating
such natural Powers as could act of themselves.</p>
               <p>God's Government of the World must be fitted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Creatures which he has made, without deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the natural Powers of Action; and therefore
while he co-operates with Creatures only to act according
to the liberty of their own Natures, this is no fault in this
Government, nor contributes any thing more to the Sins of
Creatures, than preserving their Natures, which as much
becomes God, as it did to make them.</p>
               <p>Thus some think it a great blemish to Providence, that
Adulterous Mixtures prove fruitful, when <hi>encrease and
multiply</hi> is an established Decree from the first Creation;
and the setled Course and Order of Nature must not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
by the Sins of men: They may as well object against
Providence, That a man who steals his Neighbour's Grain,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50615:19"/>
and sows it in his own Land, should have a plentiful Crop
the next year from his stolen Seed. And whatever Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men have concerning the origination of the Soul, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be propagated <hi>ex traduce,</hi> or did praeexist, or be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
created by God, and infused into prepared Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it makes no difference in the case; for when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Nature is setled, and the Blessing pronounced and
established by the Divine Decree, it does not unbecome
God to preserve the powers of Nature to produce their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Effects; I am sure, there want not wise Reasons in
God's Government of the World, why it should be so,
to restrain some mens Lusts, and to shame and punish
others.</p>
               <p>Nay, I believe, whoever considers this matter well, will
acknowledge, that it goes a great way in answering the
greatest Difficulty of all, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eternal Punishments
of Wicked Men in the next World.</p>
               <p>The Objection is not against God's punishing Wicked
Men in the next World; for no body pretends, that this is
unjust for God to punish the Wicked, whether in this
World, or in the next.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Objection against the nature of these Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for indeed we do not distinctly know what they
are, no more than we know what the Happiness of Heaven
is. Those Descriptions our Saviour gives of them, <hi>of lakes
of fire and brimstome, blackness of darkness, the worm that
never dieth, and the fire that never goeth out,</hi> prove that
they are very great, because these Descriptions are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to present to us very frightful and terrible images of the
Miseries of the Damned: But this is not the Complaint
neither; for it is confessed, that Wicked Men deserve to be
very miserable.</p>
               <p>But the Objection is against that vast disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Time and Eternity; How it is reconcilable with the
Divine Justice to punish Temporal Sins with Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50615:19"/>
that when men can sin but for a very few years,
they must suffer for it for ever?</p>
               <p>Now the difficulty of this seems in part to be owing to
a mistating the case: There is no proportion indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Time and Eternity; and it is therefore difficult to
conceive, that every momentary sin should in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deserve eternal punishments; but there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to conceive, that an immortal sinner may by some short
and momentary sins sink himself into an irrecoverable state
of misery, and then he must be miserable as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to be; and if he can never die, he must be always
miserable, and may be so, without any Injustice in God.
We do not here consider the proportion between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the sin and the punishment, between a short
transient act, and eternal punishments; for it is not the sin,
but the sinner, that is punished for his sin; and therefore
we must not ask, How long punishment a short sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves?
but, How long the sinner deserves to be punished?
and the answer to that is easy, As long as he is a sinner:
And therefore an immortal sinner, who can never die, and
will never cease to be wicked, (which is the hopeless and
irrecoverable state of Devils and damned Spirits) must
always be miserable; and it is just it should be so, if it be
just to punish sinners; and there is nothing to quarrel with
God for, as to the Eternity of Punishments, unless it be,
that he does not annihilate Immortal Spirits, when they
are become incurably wicked and miserable. The Justice
of God is only concerned to punish sinners; that their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishents
are eternal, is a necessary consequence of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
and this can't be charged on God, unless it be
a fault to make immortal creatures, and to preserve and
uphold immortal creatures in being; or to punish sinners
while they deserve punishment, that is, while they are
sinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50615:20"/>
It may give some light to this matter, to remove the
Scene into this world: We see the punishment of sin in
this world bears no proportion to the time of committing
it, but to the lasting effects of the sin. One short single
act of Lust may not only leave a lasting Reproach on
mens Names, but destroy the health and ease of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the pleasure of their lives, for their ever in this
world; and had Man continued immortal after the fall,
these miserable effects must have continued for ever, and
then there had been a visible Eternal Punishment for a very
short transient sin, and yet no man would have blamed
the Justice of God for it; which shews, That a sin, which
is quickly committed, may be eternally punished, and that
very justly too, when the effects of it are incurable, and
the person immortal: And thus it is in a great many other
cases in this world, where the effects of sin last as long as
the Men last; and if this be the case of the other world,
and of the miseries and punishments of the damned, as
we certainly know in a great measure it is, that their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
are the natural effects and consequents of their
sins, there can be no objection against the Eternity of their
Punishments, but that God does not annihilate them:
And how hard soever any man may think it to be, that a
sinner should be eternally miserable, I believe no man will
venture to say, that God ought in Justice to annihilate
creatures whom he has made immortal, when by their
own fault they must be eternally miserable, if they live
for ever. To preserve and uphold creatures in being, is,
in it self considered, what becomes the Wise Maker of all
things; and I am sure there can be no reason given, to
prove, that God ought to annihilate sinners, to prevent
their being miserable for ever, but what will much more
prove, that God ought to have withdrawn his natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
from his creatures, or to have annihilated them, to
prevent their sinning; or, which is the last result of all, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50615:20"/>
I have already observed, and the only fault, if there be
one, That he ought not to have made an Immortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who could sin, and be miserable for ever.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this whole Argument with some few
Inferences.</p>
               <p>1. If Creatures must be preserved, as well as made by
God, then the present continuance and preservation of all
things, is a visible Argument of the Being of God. Some
men will not believe that God made the world, because
they did not see him make it; but they see a world preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
when there is no one thing in the world more able to
preserve, than to make it self; and who then is it that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
this world, and all things in it? This must be a
work of Reason and Wisdom, as well as Power; and the
only reasonable Creature in this visible world, is Man; and
Man cannot preserve himself, and knows that he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
nothing else; and therefore the Preservation of all
things must be owing to some Invisible Cause, whom we
call GOD.</p>
               <p>2. If we live, and move, and have our being in God,
we are entirely his, and owe all homage and obedience to
him; for he did not only make us, but we have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
dependance on him, we live and subsist in him. Had
he only made us at first, that had given him a title to us
for ever; but could we have lived without him, when he
had made us, tho it had not been a less fault, yet it had been
less foolish and absurd, to have lived without any notice or
regard of him; as some ungrateful persons deal by their
Friends and Patrons, when they have set them up in the
world, and enabled them to live by themselves: but to
forget that God in whom we live, who preserves and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
us in being every moment, is to affront a present Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,
if we value being; and tho we cannot tempt
God by this to let us fall into nothing, yet we shall make
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50615:21"/>
it just for him to punish us, to preserve us in being, to feel
the weight of his Wrath and Vengeance, which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
worse, for <hi>happy had it been for such a man, that he had
never been born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For if he not only made but upholds and preserves us
in being, he must be our Sovereign Lord and Governor;
for no other has any original and absolute interest in us;
we are in his hands, and none can take us out of them,
nor touch us, but by his order. To give being and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, is the foundation of all other acts of Government,
no other Being has a Right to govern, no other Power can
govern. He alone can give Laws, can reward or punish,
can govern Nature, can direct, over-rule, controul all other
Powers, for all things are in his hands, and therefore he
commands them all.</p>
               <p>4. And this may convince us, how irresistible the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power is; for all the power of Creatures is derived
from him, and depends on him, as Light does on the Sun,
and therefore they can have no power against him; and
what distraction then is it, to provoke that Almighty
God, whom we cannot resist? Humble thy self, Sinner,
before thy Maker, thy Preserver, and thy Judge; obey
his Will, to whose Power thou must submit; let him be
thy Fear and thy Dread; thy only Fear, for thou needest
fear none else; all Power is his, none can resist him, none
can act without him; he sets bounds to the Raging of the
Sea, to the Fury of Princes, to the Madness of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Thou art safe in his hands, safe in obedience to his
Will, but thou canst never escape him, never flie from
him, never defend thy self against him, for thou livest in
him.</p>
               <p>5. This also proves that God must see and know all our
actions, for we live and move in him. He is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with us, privy to our most secret thoughts and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
observes all our wandrings, sees us in all our retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50615:21"/>
                  <hi>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where
the workers of iniquity can hide themselves.</hi> This the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in express words teaches, and the reason of the thing
speaks it; for if we cannot think, nor move, nor subsist
without God, he must be always intimately present with
us; which should possess us with a constant Awe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of his Pure and All seeing Eye.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning God's Governing Providence.</head>
               <p>NEXT to <hi>Preservation,</hi> as that signifies God's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
all things in being, and preserving and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
their Natural Powers, we must consider God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the world; for God is the Supreme and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Lord of the world, <hi>who doth whatsoever pleaseth
him both in heaven and in earth;</hi> and therefore the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Government of all things must be in his hands, or else
something might be done, which he would not have
done.</p>
               <p>This all men grant in general words, who own a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
but when they come to particulars, there are so
many excepted cases which they will hardly allow God to
have any thing to do in, that they seem to mean little
more by God's Government, than a general Inspection of
Human Affairs, his looking on to see the World govern it
self; for three parts of four of all that is done in the world,
they resolve into bare Permission, as distinguish'd from an
Ordering and Disposing Providence; and then it can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
no more, than that God does not hinder it; and if this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50615:22"/>
be all, God governs the world in such cases no more than
men do: The only difference is, that God can hinder
when he don't, but men don't hinder, because they can't;
but still merely not to hinder, does not signifie to govern.</p>
               <p>But rightly to understand this matter, the best way is, to
consider how the Scripture represents it; and because there
are great variety of acts in the government of the world,
of a very different consideration, I shall distinctly enquire
into God's government of Causes, and his government of
Events.</p>
               <p>1. God's government of Causes; and we must consider
three sorts of Causes, and what the Scripture attributes to
God with respect to each. 1. Natural Causes. <hi>2dly.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
Causes, or what we call Chance, and Accident,
and Fortune. <hi>3dly.</hi> Moral Causes, and free Agents, or
the government of mankind.</p>
               <p>1. Natural Causes, or God's Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
World, of the Heavens, and Earth, and Seas, and
Air, and all things in them, which move and act by a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Nature, not by Choice. Now the Scripture
does not only attribute to God all the Vertues and Powers
of Nature, which belongs to Creation, and to a Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Providence, but the direction and government of all
their Natural Influences, to do what God has a mind
should be done. God does in some measure govern the
Moral by the Natural World; he rewards or punishes men
by a wholsome or pestilential air, by fruitful or barren sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
he hinders or promotes their designs, by winds and
weather, by a forward or a backward Spring, and makes
Nature give Laws to men, and set bounds to their Passions
and Intriegues; to overthrow the most powerful Fleets and
Armies; to defeat the wisest Counsels, and to arbitrate the
Differences of Princes, and the Fate of Men and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
And if God govern men by Nature, he must go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50615:22"/>
Nature too, for necessary Causes cannot be fitted to
the government of free Agents, without the direction and
management of a Divine Providence, which guides, exerts,
or suspends the Influences of Nature, with as great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as men act. Men do not always deserve well or ill;
and if the kind or malign Influences of Nature must be
tempered to mens deserts, to punish them when they do
ill, and to reward them when they do well, Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which of themselves act necessarily without Wisdom
or Counsel, must be guided by a Wise Hand.</p>
               <p>Thus reason tells us it must be, if God govern the
world, and God challenges to himself this Absolute and
Sovereign Empire over Nature: God has bestowed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Vertues and Powers on Natural Causes, and in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
cases makes use of the Powers of Nature, and neither
acts without them, nor against the Laws of Nature;
which makes some unthinking men resolve all into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without a God or a Providence; because, excepting
the case of Miracles, which they are not willing to believe,
they see every thing else done by the Powers of Nature;
and if it were not so, God had made a World, and made
Nature to no purpose, to do every thing himself, by an
immediate Power, without making use of the Powers of
Nature: But the ordinary government of Nature does not
signifie to act without it, or to over-rule its Powers, but to
steer and guide its motions, to serve the Wise Ends of his
Providence in the government of Mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as God does not usually act without Nature, nor
against its Laws, so neither does Nature act by steady and
uniform motions, without the direction of God: But
while every thing in the material world acts necessarily,
and exerts its Natural Powers, God can temper, suspend,
direct its Influences, without reversing the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
As for instance; Fire and Water, Wind and Rain,
Thunder and Lightning, have their Natutral Vertues and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50615:23"/>
Powers, and Natural Causes; and God produces such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
as they are made to produce by their Natural Powers;
he warms us with Fire; invigorates the earth by the benign
Influences of the Sun and Moon, and other Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets;
refreshes and moistens it with Springs and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and Rain from Heaven; fans the Air with Winds,
and purges it with Thunders and Lightnings, and the
like; but then, when and where the Rains shall fall, and
the Winds shall blow, in what measure and proportion,
times and seasons, Natural Causes shall give or withhold
their Influences, this God keeps in his own Power, and
can govern, without altering the standing Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and this is his government of Natural Causes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to reward or punish men as they shall deserve. Thus
God reasons with</hi> Iob <hi>concerning his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
38. Job 31, 32, &amp;c.</hi> Canst thou bind the sweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? canst thou
bring forth Mazzaroth in his season, or canst thou guide Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus
with his sons? knowest thou the ordinances of heaven,
or canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? canst thou
lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may
cover thee? canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and
say unto thee, here we are? <hi>This is above Human Power,
but belongs to the Government and Providence of God:</hi>
Fire and hail, snow and vapour, and stormy winds, fulfil his
word, 148. <hi>Psal. 8. Sometimes God restrains the influences
of Nature,</hi> shuts up heaven, that it shall not rain, 2 <hi>Chr. 7. 13.
At other times he</hi> calls to the clouds, that abundance of water
may cover the earth. He gives the former and the latter rain in
its season, and preserveth to us the appointed weeks of harvest,
5. <hi>Jer. 24 as he promised to</hi> Israel, 11 <hi>Deut</hi> 14, 15. I
will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first
rain and the latter rain, that thou mayst gather in thy corn,
and thy wine, and thy oyl; and I will send grass in thy fields
for thy cattle, that thou mayst eat and be full. <hi>He prescribes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50615:23"/>
in what proportions it shall rain, 2. Joel</hi> 23, 24. Be glad
ye children of Sion, and rejoyce in the Lord your God; for
he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will
cause to come down for you the former rain, and the latter
rain in the first month. <hi>Nay, God appoints on what place
it shall rain. 34. Ezek.</hi> 26. And I will make thee, and the
places round about my hill, a blessing; and I will cause the
shower to come down in his season, there shall be showers of
blessing. 4. <hi>Amos</hi> 7, 8. And also I have withholden the rain
from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest;
and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain
upon another city: One piece was rained upon, and the piece
whereupon it rained not, withered: So two or three cities wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to one city to drink water, but they were not satisfied.</p>
               <p>It is impossible to give any tolerable account of such
Texts as these, without confessing. That God keeps the
Direction and Government of all Natural Causes in his
own hands; for particular Effects, and all the Changes of
Nature can never be attributed to God, unless the Divine
Wisdom and Counsel determines Natural Causes to the
producing such particular Effects. Great part of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
or Miseries of this Life is owing to the good or bad
Influences of Natural Causes, that if God take care of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
he must govern Nature; and when he promises
Health and Plenty, or threatens Pestilence and Famine,
how can he make good either, if he have not reserved to
himself a Soveraign Power over Nature.</p>
               <p>The sum is this, That all Natural Causes are under the
immediate and absolute Government of Providence; that
God keeps the Springs of Nature in his own hand, and
turns them as he pleases. For meer Matter, though it be
endowed with all Natural Vertues and Powers, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
produce their Natural Effects, yet it having no wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and counsel of its own, cannot serve the Ends of a Free
Agent, without being guided by a Wise Hand; and we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50615:24"/>
see in a thousand Instances what an Empire Human Art
has over Nature, not by changing the nature of things,
which Human Art can never do, but by such a skilful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Causes, as will produce such Effects, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,
and if I may so speak, untaught Nature could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have produced; and if God have subjected material
Nature to Human Art, surely he has not exempted it from
his own Guidance and Power.</p>
               <p>This shews how necessary it is, that God by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Providence should govern Nature; for Natural
Causes are excellent Instruments, but to make them useful,
they must be directed by a Skilful Hand; and those various
Changes which are in Nature, especially in this Sublunary
World, (which we are most acquainted with) without any
certain and periodical returns, prove, that it is not all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism;
for Mechanical Motions are fixt and certain, and
either always the same, or regular or uniform in their
Changes.</p>
               <p>It is of great use to us to understand this, which teaches
us, what we may expect from God, and what we must
attribute to him in the government of Nature: We must
not expect in ordinary Cases, that God should reverse the
Laws of Nature for us; that if we leap into the fire, it shall
not burn us; or into the water, it shall not drown us; and
by the same reason, the Providence of God is not concerned
to preserve us, when we destroy our selves by Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Lust; for God does not work Miracles to
deliver men from the evil Effects of their own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Folly: But all the kind Influences of Heaven
which supply our wants, and fill our hearts with food and
gladness, are owing to that good Providence which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
Nature to yield her encrease; and those disorders
of Nature which afflict the world with Famines, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,
and Earthquakes, are the effects of God's Anger
and Displeasure, and are ordered by him for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50615:24"/>
of a wicked world. We must all believe this, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that we mock God, when we bless him for a healthful
Air, and fruitful Seasons, or deprecate his Anger, when
we see the visible Tokens of his Vengeance, in the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Nature: For did not God immediately interpose
in the government of Nature, there would be no reason
to beg his Favour, or to deprecate his Anger upon these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us consider God's Government of Accidental
Causes, or what we call Chance and Accident, which has
a large Empire over human Affairs; not that Chance and
Accident can do any thing properly speaking; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is done, has some proper and Natural Causes which does
it; but what we call Accidental Causes, is rather such an
Accidental Concurrence of different Causes, as produces
unexpected and undesigned Effects; as when one Man by
Accident loses a purse of Gold, and another Man walking
in the Fields without any such expectation, by as great an
Accident finds it. And how much of the Good or Evil
that happens to us in this World, is owing to such Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
Surprizing, Accidental Events, every man must
know, who has made any Observations on his own, or
other mens Lives and Fortunes. The Wise Man observed
this long since, 9. <hi>Eccl. 11. I returned and saw under the Sun,
that the race is not to the swift, nor the battel to the strong,
neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
to them all.</hi> Some unusual and casual Events change the
fortunes of men, and disappoint the most proper and natural
means of Success: What should conquer in a Race but
Swiftness; or win the Battel but strength? What should
supply mens wants, and increase Riches, but Wisdom and
Understanding in Human affairs? What more likely way to
gain the Favour of Princes and People, than a dextrous and
skilful Application and Address? And yet the Preacher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50615:25"/>
in his days, and the observation holds good still, that
it is not always thus: <hi>Time and chance,</hi> some favourable
Junctures, and unseen Accidents, are more Powerfull than
all Human Strength, or Art, or Skill.</p>
               <p>Now what an ill state were Mankind in, did not a Wise
and Merciful Hand Govern what we call Chance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
How can God Govern the World, or Dispose of
mens Lives and Fortunes without Governing Chance, all
unseen, unknown and surprizing Events, which disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the Counsels of the Wise, and in a moment unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
change the whole scene of Human Affairs? Upon
what little unexpected things do the Fortunes of Men, of
Families, of whole Kingdoms turn? And unless these
little unexpected things are Governed by God, some of the
greatest Changes in the World are exempted from his Care
and Providence.</p>
               <p>This is reason enough to believe, That if God Governs
the World, he Governs Chance and Fortune; that the
most unexpected Events, how Casual soever they appear
to us, are foreseen, and ordered by God.</p>
               <p>Such Events as these are the properest Objects of God's
Care and Government; because they are very great instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Providence; many times the greatest things are
done by them, and they are the most visible demonstration
of a Superiour Wisdom and Power which Governs the
World: By these means God disappoints the Wisdom of
the Wise, and defeats the Power of the Mighty; <hi>Frustrateth
the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; turneth
wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish, 44. Isai.</hi>
25. Did Strength and Wisdom always prevail, as in a great
measure they would, were it not for such unseen disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Mankind would take less notice of Providence, and
would have less reason to do it, since they would be the
more absolute Masters of their own Fortunes; a powerful
combination of Sinners, managed by some crafty Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50615:25"/>
would govern the World: But the uncertain turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and changes of Fortune keep Mankind in awe, make
the most prosperous and powerful Sinners fear an unseen
Vengeance, and give security to Good men against unseen
Evils, which cannot befall them without the order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God.</p>
               <p>That there are a great many accidental and casual
Events, which happen to us all, and which are of great
consequence to the Happiness or Miseries of our Lives, all
men see and feel; that we cannot defend our selves from
such unseen Events, which we know nothing of, till we
feel them, is as manifest, as that there are such Events;
and what so properly belongs to the Divine Care, as that
which we our selves can take no care of? The Heathens
made Fortune a Goddess, and attributed the government of
all things to Her, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Whereby they only
signified, the government of Providence in all casual and
fortuitous Events; and if Providence governs any thing,
it must govern Chance, which governs almost all things
else, and which none but God can govern. As far as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Prudence and Foresight reaches, God expects we
should take care of our selves; and if we will not, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
us to reap the fruits of our own Folly; but when we
cannot take care of our selves, we have reason to expect
and hope, that God will take care of us; in other Cases,
Human Prudence and Industry must concur with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence; in Matters of Chance and Accident,
Providence must act alone, and do all it self, for we know
nothing of it; so that all the Arguments for Providence do
most strongly conclude for God's government of all Casual
Events.</p>
               <p>And the Scripture does as expresly attribute all such
Events to God, as any other Acts of Providence and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
In the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> when a man killed his
Neighbour by accident, God is said to deliver him into his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50615:26"/>
                  <hi>hands;</hi> 21. Exod. 12, 13. He that smiteth a man, so that
he die, shall be surely put to death. And if a man lie not in
wait, but God deliver him into his hands, then I will appoint
thee a place, whither he shall flee: <hi>Where</hi> God's delivering
him into his hands, <hi>is opposed to him</hi> that smiteth a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
that he die; <hi>and</hi> to him that comes presumptuously upon his
neighbour to slay him, 15. <hi>verse, and therefore signifies one
who kills his Neighbour by meer Accident: As it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
in</hi> 19. Deut. 4, 5. And this is the case of the slayer
that shall flee thither, <hi>i. e. to the City of Refuge:</hi> Whoso
killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time
past: As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to
hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut
down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon his neighbour, that he die, he shall flee unto one of
these cities, and live. <hi>What can be more accidental than
this? And yet we are assured, that this is appointed by the
Divine Providence, that God delivers the man who is killed,
into the hands of him that killed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is any thing more casual than a Lot? and yet <hi>Solomon</hi>
tells us, <hi>The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing
thereof is of the Lord,</hi> 16. Prov. 33. Which is not confined
to the Case of Lots, but to signify to us, That nothing is
so casual and uncertain, as to be exempted from the disposal
of Providence. For what seems accidental to us, is not
Chance, but Providence; is ordered and appointed by God
to bring to pass what his own Wisdom and Counsel has
decreed: As is very evident from some remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Providence which are recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p>By how many seeming Accidents and casual Events was
<hi>Ioseph</hi> advanced to <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Throne? His Dreams, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God foretold his Advancement, made his Brethren en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
at him, and watch some convenient opportunity to
get rid of him, and so confute his Dreams: <hi>Iacob</hi> sends <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
to visit his Brethren in the Fields, where they were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50615:26"/>
keeping their Sheep; this gave them an opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
their Revenge, and at first they intended to murther
him; but the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> accidentally passing by, they sold
<hi>Ioseph</hi> to them, and they carried him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and sold
him to <hi>Potiphar. Potiphar</hi>'s Wife tempts him to Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and being denied by <hi>Ioseph,</hi> she accuses him to his
Lord, who cast him into the King's Prison: Whilst he was
there, the King's Butler and Baker were cast into the same
Prison, and dreamed their several Dreams, which <hi>Ioseph</hi>
expounded to them, and the Event verified his Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Butler, who was restored to his Office, forgat
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> till two years after, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dreamed a Dream,
which none of the Wise-men could interpret, and then
<hi>Ioseph</hi> was sent for, and advanced to the highest place of
Dignity and Power next to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> The years of Famine
brought <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Corn, where
they bowed before him, according to his Dream; this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
the removal of <hi>Iacob</hi> and his whole Family into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Ioseph</hi> placed them in the Land of <hi>Goshen,</hi>
by which means God fulfilled what he had told <hi>Abraham;
Know of a surety, That thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict
them four hundred years,</hi> 15. Genes. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How casual does
all this appear to us? but no man will think that Prophesies
are fulfilled by Chance, and therefore we must confess, that
what seems Chance to us, was appointed by God.</p>
               <p>Thus God intended to deliver <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the
hands of <hi>Moses: Moses</hi> was born at a time, when the King
of <hi>Egypt</hi> had commanded, That every Son that was born
to the <hi>Israelites</hi> should be cast into the River. His Mother
hid him three months, and being not able to conceal him
any longer, exposed him in an Ark of Bulrushes among the
Flags by the River-side: <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter came down
to wash her self in the River, and finds the Ark with the
Child in it; puts him to his own Mother to nurse, whereby
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50615:27"/>
he came to know his own Kindred and Relations, and to
be instructed in the Knowledge and Worship of the God of
<hi>Israel.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter takes him home,
and breeds him up as her own Son, whereby he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in all the Learning of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in all the Policies
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, which qualified him for government:
When he was forty years old, he had lived long enough in
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and God thought fit to remove him into
better Company, and to accustom him to a more severe life;
and this was done by as strange an Accident. He slew an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
in defence of an oppressed <hi>Iew,</hi> and was betrayed
by his own Brethren, and forced to flie from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to
save his own Life; till the time was come for the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and then God sent him back into <hi>Egypt</hi> to
bring his people out from thence with Signs and Wonders
and a Mighty Hand.</p>
               <p>Thus God had foretold <hi>Ahab</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Micaiah,</hi>
that if he went up against <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> he should perish
there, and this was accomplished by a very great Chance:
For <hi>a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
between the joynts of the harness,</hi> of which he died. 1 <hi>Kings
22.</hi> 34. The Blood which came from his Wound ran into
the Chariot, and <hi>one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria,
and the dogs licked up his blood;</hi> which was a very Casual
thing, and little thought of by him who did it, and yet
fulfilled God's threatning against <hi>Ahab: In the place where
dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even
thine,</hi> 21. ch. 29. v.</p>
               <p>I shall add but one example more of this nature, and it
is a very remarkable one; God's deliverance of the <hi>Iews</hi>
in the days of <hi>Esther,</hi> from the wicked Conspiracy of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
This <hi>Haman</hi> being advanced to great Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by King <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> took great offence at <hi>Mordecai</hi>
the <hi>Iew,</hi> who refused to reverence him as others did; and
for his sake obtained a Decree from the King, to destroy all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50615:27"/>
the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Provinces of his Dominions: <hi>Mordecai</hi> sends
to Queen <hi>Esther</hi> to go to the King, and to petition him
about this matter: This was a very hazardous Attempt,
it being Death by the Law for any Person, Man, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to go to the King without being called, unless the
King held out his Golden Scepter to them: But the Queen
at last, after three days fasting, ventured her own Life to
save her People, and obtained Favour in the King's sight,
who held out the Golden Scepter to her: All that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
at that time, was, That the King and <hi>Haman</hi>
would come to the Banquet which she had prepared; and
being then asked, What her Petition was? with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that it should be granted; she begged, That the
King and <hi>Haman</hi> would come the next day also to her
Banquet, and then she would declare it: <hi>Haman</hi> was much
exalted with the King's Favour, and that Queen <hi>Esther</hi>
had admitted none to the Banquet with the King, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but still <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who refused to bow before
him, was a great Grievance; and by the advice of his
Friends, he built a Gallows Fifty Cubits high, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that night to beg of the King, That <hi>Mordecai</hi> might
be hanged on it; and had he come in time, his Petition
had been certainly granted; but it so happened, that that
very night the King could not sleep, and he called for the
Book of the Records of the Chronicles, and there they
found written, That <hi>Mordecai</hi> had discovered the Treason
of two of the King's Chamberlains against him; and
finding upon enquiry, that he had never been rewarded
for it, he resolved to do him Honour, and made <hi>Haman,</hi> who
was at the door to beg that <hi>Mordecai</hi> might be hanged, his
Minister in doing him Honour: This prepared the King
to grant Queen <hi>Esther</hi>'s Request, and hanged <hi>Haman</hi> upon
the Gallows he had built for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and preserved the
<hi>Iews</hi> from that Destruction he had designed against them.
And thus it is almost in all the Remarkable Passages of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50615:28"/>
there is so much appearance of Chance and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which has the greatest stroke in some wonderful
Events, as may satisfie considering men, That the world
is governed by a Divine Wisdom and Counsel, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Power, and that the immediate and visible Causes
have always the least hand in it.</p>
               <p>For can we think otherwise, when we see as many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
marks of Wisdom, and Goodness, and Justice, in
what we call Chance, as in any other acts of Providence?
Nay, when the Wisdom of Providence is principally seen
in the government of Fortuitous Events? When we see a
World wisely made, tho we did not see it made, yet we
conclude, That it was not made by Chance, but by a Wise
Being; and by the same reason, when we see Accidental
Events, nay, a long incoherent Series of Accidents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to the producing the most admirable effects, we ought
to conclude, That there is a Wise Invisible Hand which
governs Chance, which of it self can do nothing wisely.
When the Lives and Fortunes of Men, the Fate of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Empires, the Successes of War, the Changes of
Government, are so often determined and brought about
by the most visible Accidents; when Chance defeats the
Wisest Counsels, and the Greatest Power; when Good
men are rewarded, and the Church of God preserved by
appearing Chances; when Bad men are punished by
Chance, and the very Chance whereby they are punished,
carries the marks of their sins upon it, for which they are
punished; I say, can any man in such cases, think that all
this is mere Chance? when, how accidental soever the
Means are, or appear to be, whereby such things are done,
there is no appearance at all of Chance in the Event; but
the Changes and Revolutions, the Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Chance, are all as wisely done, as if there had
been nothing of Chance and Accident in it. This is the
great security of our lives, amidst all the uncertainties of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50615:28"/>
Fortune, That Chance it self can't hurt us, without a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Commission: This is a sure foundation of Faith, and
Hope, and Trust in God, how calamitous and desperate
soever our external condition seems to be, that God never
wants means to help; that he has a thousand unseen ways,
a whole Army of Accidents and unexpected Events at
command, to disappoint such designs, which no visible
Art or Power can disappoint, and to save those whom no
visible Power can save.</p>
               <p>This is an undeniable Reason for a perpetual Awe and
Reverence of God, and an entire submission to him, and a
devout acknowledgment of him in all our ways, That we
have no Security but in his Providence and Protection;
for whatever provision we can make against foreseen and
foreknown evils, we can never provide against Chance;
that is wholly in God's hands, and no human Wit or
Strength can withstand it; which may abate the Pride and
self-confidence of men, and teach the Rich, and Great, and
Mighty, a Religious Veneration of God, who can with
so much ease <hi>pull down the mighty from their seat, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
those of low degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The next thing to be explained, is God's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Moral Causes or Free Agents, that is, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men, considered as the Instruments of Providence
which God makes use of for the accomplishment of his
own Wise Counsels.</p>
               <p>Most of the good or evil which happens to us in this
world, is done by Men; if God rewards, or if he punishes
us, usually Men are his Ministers in both, to execute his
Vengeance, or to dispence his Blessings; and therefore God
must have as Absolute a Government over Mankind, of all
their Thoughts, and Passions, and Counsels, and Actions,
as he has of the Powers and Influences of Natural Causes, or
else he cannot reward and punish when and as he pleases.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50615:29"/>
If men could hurt those whom God would bless and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
or could do good to those whom God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
both good and bad men might be happy or miserable
in this world, whether God would or not; our Fortunes
would depend upon the Numbers and Power of our Friends
or Enemies, upon the good or bad humours and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those among whom we live, and Providence could
not help us.</p>
               <p>Now this is the great Difficulty, How God can exercise
such an Absolute Government over Mankind, who are
Free Agents, without destroying the Liberty and Freedom
of their Choice, which would destroy the nature of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Vice, of Rewards and Punishments: The necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of allowing this, if we will acknowledge a Providence,
and the plain Testimonies and Examples of this Absolute
and Uncontroulable Government, which we find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
have made some men deny the Liberty of Human
Actions, and represent Mankind to be as mere Machines, as
a Watch or Clock, which move as they are moved: And
then they know not how to bring Religion, and the Moral
Differences of Good and Evil, and the Natural Justice of
Rewards and Punishments, into their Scheme; for nothing
of all this can be reconciled with Absolute Necessity and
Fate. Others, to avoid these Difficulties, are afraid of
attributing too much to Providence, or have such confused
and perplex'd Notions about it, that there are few cases
wherein they can securely depend on God.</p>
               <p>But I think this Difficulty will be easily removed, if we
distinguish between God's government of Men, as Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Creatures, and Free Agents, and his government of
them as the Instruments of Providence; the first considers
them in their own private and natural Capacity, the second
in relation to the rest of Mankind; which makes a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the Reason, and in the Acts of Government.</p>

Man considered in his own nature, is a reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and free Agent, and therefore the proper govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Man, consists in giving him Laws, that he may
know the difference between good and evil, what he ought
to chuse, and what to refuse, and in annexing such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and punishments to the observation or to the breach
of these Laws, as may reasonably invite him to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and deter him from sin; and as this degenerate state
requires, in laying such external restraints on him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
him such internal assistances of Grace, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom sees proportioned to the weakness and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Human Nature: and when this is done, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
God to leave him to his own choice, and to reward
or punish him as he deserves; for a forced Vertue deserves
no Reward, and a necessity of sinning will reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
from Punishment. The nature of a reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of Vertue and Vice, of Rewards and Punishments,
represent it as very becoming the Wisdom and Justice of
God, to leave every man to the freedom of his own choice,
to do good or evil, to deserve Rewards or Punishments, as
far as he himself is only concerned in it.</p>
               <p>But when we consider man in Society, the case is alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for when the good or evil of their actions extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
themselves, to do good or hurt to other men, the
Providence of God becomes concerned either to hinder, or
to permit and order it, as may best serve the Wise Ends of
Government, as those other men who are like to be the
better or the worse for it, have deserved well or ill of God.
Tho God has made man a free Agent, yet we must not
think that he has made such a Creature as he himself can't
govern: No man doubts, but that God can when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
by an Irresistible Power, turn mens hearts, and chain
up their Passions, and alter their Counsels; the only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, When it is fit for God to do this: And no man
can question the fitness of it, when the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50615:30"/>
of the world requires it. God makes no man good
or bad, vertuous or vicious, by a perpetual and irresistible
force; for this contradicts the nature of Vertue and Vice,
which requires a Freedom and Liberty of Choice; but
God may by a secret and irresistible influence upon mens
minds, even force them to do that good, which they have
no inclination to do, and restrain them from doing that
evil, which otherwise they would have done, which does
not make them Good men, but makes them the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Providence in doing good to men; and God who
is the Soveraign Lord of all Creatures, may, when he sees
fit, press those men, if I may so speak, to his Service,
who would not do good upon choice. This shows the
difference between the Government of Grace, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
the first has relation to Vertue and Vice, to make
men good, to change their Natures and sinful Inclinations
into habits of Vertue; and therefore admits of no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
force than what is consistent with the freedom of Choice,
and the nature of Virtue and Vice: but the Government
of Providence respects the external Happiness or Misery,
Rewards or Punishments of Men or Nations; and to this
purpose God may use what Instruments he pleases, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
such Authority over Nature or Men, as is necessary
to accomplish his own Wise Counsels of Mercy or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And it was necessary to premise this distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the confounding these two, has occasioned great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and mistakes both in the Doctrine of Grace and
Providence.</p>
               <p>Let us then now more particularly consider, How God
governs Mankind, so as to make them the Instruments
and Ministers of his Providence in the world. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of the Divine Wisdom are Infinite and Unsearchable,
and we must not expectfully to comprehend all the Secrets
and Mysteries of God's Government, but something we
may know of this, enough to teach us to reverence God,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50615:30"/>
and to trust in him, and to vindicate his Providence from
the Cavils of Ignorance and Infidelity; which is as much
as is useful for us to know: And I shall reduce what I
have to say, to Two General Heads: 1. The Government
of mens Minds, of their Wills, their Passions, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
2. The Government of their Actions.</p>
               <p>1. God's Government of the Minds of Men, their
Wills, and Passions, and Counsels; for these are the great
Springs of Action; and as free a Principle as the Mind of
man is, it is not ungovernable; it may be governed, and
that without an Omnipotent Power, against its own Byas,
and without changing its inclinations: and what may
be done, certainly God can do; and when it is necessary
to the Ends of Providence, we may conclude he will do it.
Let a man be never so much bent upon any Project, yet
hope or fear, some present great advantage, or great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
the powerful intercession of Friends, a sudden
change of circumstances, the improbability of success, the
irreparable mischief of a defeat, and a thousand other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
will divert him from it; and how easie is it
for God to imprint such thoughts upon mens minds with
an irresistible Vigor and Brightness; that it shall be no
more in their power to do what they had a mind to, than
to resist all the Charms of Riches and Honours, than to
leap into the Fire, and to chuse Misery and Ruin.</p>
               <p>That thus it is, the Scripture assures us; 21. Prov. 1. <hi>The
king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he turneth it whither soever he will:</hi> And if the King's
heart be in the hand of the Lord, we cannot doubt but he
hath all other mens hearts in his hand also, and can turn
and change them as he pleases. Thus the Wise man tells
us, <hi>A man's heart deviseth his ways, but the Lord directeth
his steps,</hi> 16. Prov. 9. Men consult and advise what to do,
but after all, God steers and directs them which way he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50615:31"/>
pleases; for tho <hi>there are many devices in a man's heart, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the counsel of the Lord that shall stand,</hi> 19. Prov. 21.
Which made the Wise man conclude, <hi>Mans goings are of
the Lord, how then shall a man understand his own ways?</hi>
20. Prov. 24. That is, God has such an Absolute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the hearts and actions of men, when his
Providence is concerned in the Event, that no man
can certainly know what he himself shall chuse and
do; for God can. in an instant alter his mind, and make
him steer a very different course from what he intended:
as the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> assures us; <hi>I know that the way
of man is not in himself, it is not in man that walketh to direct
his steps,</hi> 10. Jer 23. And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us something more
strange than this; <hi>The preparation of the heart in man, and
the answer of the tongue, is of the Lord.</hi> 16. Prov. 1. or as
the Hebrew seems to signifie, <hi>the preparation of the heart is
from man;</hi> a man premeditates and resolves what he will
say; but notwithstanding that, <hi>the answer of the tongue is
of the Lord.</hi> When he comes to speak, he shall say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what God pleases: Which sayings must not be
expounded to an universal sense, that it is always thus; but
that thus it is, whenever God sees fit to interpose, which
he does as often as he has any wise end to serve by it.</p>
               <p>Thus we are told, That <hi>when a mans ways please the Lord,
he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> 16. Prov. 7.
And it is a very remarkable Promise God makes to the
Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that when all their Males should come
Three times every Year to Worship God at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by
which means their Country was left without defence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Rapine of their Enemies, who dwelt round
about them, That <hi>no man should desire their land, when they
go up to appear before the Lord.</hi> 34. Exod. 24. We have
many Examples of this in Scripture, and some of those
many ways whereby God does it. When <hi>Abraham</hi> sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Gerar,</hi> he said of <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, that she was his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50615:31"/>
Sister, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> the King of <hi>Gerar</hi> sent and took her:
but God reproved <hi>Abimelech</hi> in a dream, and tells him, that
he had withheld him from Sinning, and not suffered him
to touch her. 20. <hi>Genes. 1. &amp;c.</hi> Thus when <hi>Iacob</hi> fled from
<hi>Laban</hi> with his Wives and Children, and <hi>Laban</hi> pursued
him, God appeared to <hi>Laban</hi> in a dream, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him that he should not speak to <hi>Iacob</hi> either good or
hurt. 31. <hi>Genes.</hi> 24. Such appearances were very common
in that Age, though they seem very extraordinary to us;
but God does the same thing still by strong and lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
upon our minds; by suggesting and fixing such
thoughts in us, as excite or calm our Passions, as encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us to bold and great Attempts, or check us in our
career by frightful Imaginations, and unaccountable Fears
and Terrors, or by such other Arguments as are apt to
change our Purposes and Counsels.</p>
               <p>Sometimes God does this by a Concurrence of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Causes, which at other times would not have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual;
but shall certainly have their Effect when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
the impression.</p>
               <p>Thus God in a moment turned the Heart of <hi>Esau,</hi> when
he came out in great Rage against his Brother <hi>Iacob.</hi> It
was an old Hatred he had conceived against him for the loss
of his Birthright and of his Blessing; and he had for many
years confirmed himself in a resolution to cut him off, the
first opportunity he had to do it: And could it be expected,
that the Present which <hi>Iacob</hi> sent him, which he could have
taken, if he had pleased, without receiving it as a Gift;
and that the Submission of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he was in his
Power, should all on a sudden make him forget all that was
past, and the very Business he came for, and turn his bloody
Designs into the kindest Embraces? No! this was God's
work, the effect of that Blessing which the Angel gave
to <hi>Iacob,</hi> after a whole Nights wrestling with him in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
32.</hi> and 33. <hi>Genes.</hi> and when God pleases, the weakest
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50615:32"/>
means shall change the most sullen and obstinate Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
               <p>Of the same nature with this is the Story of <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Abigail: Nabal</hi> had highly provoked <hi>David</hi> by the churlish
Answer which he sent him, and <hi>David</hi> was resolved to
take a very severe revenge on <hi>Nabal</hi> and his House; but
God sent <hi>Abigail</hi> to pacifie him, who by her presence, and
dutiful and submissive Behaviour and wise Counsels, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
him from those bloody resolutions he had taken, as
<hi>David</hi> himself acknowledges: <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy
advice, and blessed be thou who hast kept me this day from
coming to shed blood, and from avenging my self with my own
hand,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> pursued <hi>David</hi> in the Wilderness to take away his
Life, and God delivered him Twice into <hi>David</hi>'s hands;
and the kindness <hi>David</hi> shewed him in not killing him
when he was in his Power, did at last turn the Heart of
<hi>Saul,</hi> that he pursued him no more. 1 <hi>Sam. 26. 27. ch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God confounded the good Counsel of <hi>Ahitophel</hi> by
the advice of <hi>Hushai,</hi> which <hi>Absolom</hi> chose to follow; and
the Text tells us this was from God, <hi>who had purposed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the good counsel of Ahitophel, to the intent that he might
bring evil upon Absolom.</hi> 2 Sam. 17. 14. Such an absolute
Empire has God over the minds of men, that he can turn
them as he pleases, can lead them into new thoughts and
counsels with as great ease, as the waters of a river may
be drawn into a new Channel prepared for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> When God does not think fit to change and alter
mens Wills and Passions, he can govern their Actions, and
serve the ends of his Providence by them. When God
suffers them to pursue their own Counsels, and to
do what they themselves like best; he does that by
their hands, which they little expected or intended. The
same Action may serve very different Ends; and therefore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50615:32"/>
God and Men may have very different intentions in it; and
what is ill done by men, and for a very ill End, may be
ordered by God for Wise and Good purposes: Nay, the
ill Ends which men Designed, may be Disappointed; and
the good, which God intended by it, have its Effect: And
this is as Absolute a Government over mens Actions, as
the ends of Providence require, when whatever men do,
if they intend one thing, and God another, <hi>the counsel of
God shall stand,</hi> and what they intended shall have no effect
any farther than as it is subservient to the Divine Counsels;
as to give some plain examples of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren being offended at his Dreams
and at the peculiar kindness which their Father
<hi>Iacob</hi> shewed him, resolved to get rid of him; but God
intended to send him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to advance him to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Throne, and to transplant <hi>Iacob</hi> and his Family thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore God would not suffer them to slay him
as they at first intended, but he suffered them to sell him to
the <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> who carried him into <hi>Egppt:</hi> which disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
what they aimed at in it, never to see or hear more
of him; but accomplished the Decrees and Counsels of
God. Another Example we have in the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi>
who came against <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with a powerful Army with
an intention to destroy it, but God intended no more than
to Correct them for their Sins; this God suffered him to
do, but he could do no more. <hi>O Assyrian, the rod of mine
anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation: I will
send him against a hypocritical nation; and against the people
of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil, and to
take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire in the street.</hi>
Thus far God gave him Commission; that is, thus far
God intended to suffer his Rage and Pride to proceed; but
this was the least of his intention: <hi>Howbeit he thinketh not
so, but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations, not a
few:</hi> but in this God disappointed him. <hi>Wherefore it shall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50615:33"/>
come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole
work upon mount Zion and on Ierusalem, I will punish the fruit
of the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his
proud looks.</hi> 10. Isai. 5, 6, 7, 12.</p>
               <p>A great many Examples might be given of this nature,
but these are sufficient to show what different Intentions
God and Men have in the same actions; and how easily
God can defeat what men intend, and accomplish by them
his own Wise Counsels, which they never thought of.
When God has no particular Ends of Providence to serve
by the Lusts and Passions, and evil Designs of men, he
commonly disappoints them; that when <hi>they intend evil,
and imagine a mischievous device, they are not able to perform
it,</hi> 21. Psal. 11. Or he turns the evil upon their own
heads; <hi>The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made,
in the net which they hid, is their own foot taken; the Lord is
known by the judgment which he executeth; the wicked is sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the work of his own hands,</hi> 9 Psal. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. Or he
doubly disappoints their malice, not only by defeating the
evil they intended, but by turning it to the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of those it was intended against; which was visible
in the case of <hi>Haman,</hi> whose malice against <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and
all the <hi>Iews</hi> for his sake, did not only prove his own ruin,
but the great advancement of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the Glory
and Triumph of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly shewn, what Government God has
both of the Hearts and the Actions of men, how easily
he can alter their Counsels, and manage their Passions,
make them do what good they never intended, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the evil which they did intend, or turn it into good;
this is a sufficient Demonstration, how Absolute the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence is; for he who has such an Absolute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Nature, of what we call Chance and Fortune,
and of the Wills and Actions of men, can do whatsoever
pleaseth him. But that we may have the clearer and more
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50615:33"/>
distinct apprehension of God's government of mankind,
to make them the Instruments of his Providence, I shall
more particularly, but very briefly, state this matter, both
with respect to good and to bad men.</p>
               <p>1. As for Good men, there is no difficulty in their case;
for they are the Ministers of a good and beneficent Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
they do good out of Temper and Inclination, and
a Habit and Principle of Vertue, and out of Reverence to
the Divine Laws; and are ready to obey every extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
impression to excite and determine them to such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
good offices as God thinks fit to employ them in:
And this is nothing but what is very honourable for God,
and what becomes good men; for to do good is the Glory
of Human Nature, as well as of the Divine Providence;
and good men will observe the Laws of Vertue in doing
good; and while good is done by honest and vertuous
means, there can be no Objection against Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> But as Bad men are most difficulty governed, so
the greatest difficulty is in vindicating Providence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of the Ministries of Bad men; for it is commonly
thought a great blemish to Providence, when Glorious and
Admirable Designs are brought to pass by the Sins of men.
Now the Foundation of this Objection is a great mistake,
as if God could not serve his own Providence by the Sins
of men, without being the Cause of mens sins; for there
is no colour nor reasonable pretence of an Objection against
God's making the Sins of men serve wise and good ends, if
he can do this without having any hand in mens sins.</p>
               <p>It is the great Glory of Providence, to bring good out of
evil; and while all the Events of Providence are Just, and
Righteous, and Holy, and Wise, and such as become a
God, it is much more admirable to consider, that all this
should be, while there is so much wickedness and disorder
in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50615:34"/>
The true state of this matter in short is this: God never
suggests any evil designs to men; that is owing to their
own wicked hearts, or to the Temptations of other wicked
men, or of wicked Spirits; but when men have formed
any wicked Designs, he sometimes, as you have heard,
changes their purposes, or deters them from putting them
in execution; and when he suffers them to proceed to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he either shamefully disappoints them, or serves some
wise and good end, by what they wickedly do: And if
Providence consists in the Care and Government of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
how can God govern mankind better, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
bad men to do no more hurt, than what he can turn to
good. God does not govern the world by an immediate
and miraculous Power, but governs men by men, and
makes them help and defend, reward and punish one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore there is no other ordinary way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
bad men (excepting the Civil Sword, which
reaches but a few Criminals) but to punish them by the
Wickedness of other bad men; and what can more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Wisdom and Justice of Providence, than to
make bad men the Ministers and Executioners of a Divine
Vengeance upon each other, which is one great End God
serves by the Sins of men. I'm sure it is for the great
good of the world, that God has the government of bad
men, that they cannot do so much hurt as they would, and
that the mischief God permits them to do, is directed to
fall on such persons as either want Correction, or deserve
Punishment. For this is another thing very observable in
God's government both of the good and bad actions of
men, that as in the government of Natural Causes God
directs where, and when, and in what proportion Nature
shall exert its Influences; that it shall rain upon one City,
and not upon another; so God does not only excite men
to do good, but directs and determines them where to do
it; chuses out such persons as they shall do good to, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50615:34"/>
appoints what good they shall do, and in what measures
and proportions they shall do it: And he not only sets
bounds to the Lusts and Passions of bad men, but when he
sees fit to permit their wickedness, he directs where the
hurt and mischief of it shall light: We need no other
proof of this, but the very Notion of Providence, which
is, God's Care of his Creatures; for that requires a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Application of the good or evil which men do, to
such particular persons as God thinks fit to do good to, or
to afflict and punish; which is the most material and most
necessary exercise both of the Wisdom, and Justice, and
Goodness of Providence. For if God suffered men to do
good or evil at random, without directing them to fit and
proper Objects, the Fortunes of particular men would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon as great a Chance, as the mutable Lusts, and
Passions, and Fancies of men.</p>
               <p>The only Use I shall make of this at present, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you how perfectly we are in God's hands, and how
secure we are in his Protection; what little reason we have
to be afraid of men, whatever their Power, how furious
soever their Passions are; how vain it is to trust in men,
and to depend on their favour; for they can neither do
good nor hurt, but as they are directed by God; and
therefore he alone must be the Supreme Object of our Fear
and Trust: <hi>If God be for us, who can be against us?</hi> If we
make him our Enemy, who can save us out of his hands?
So that we have but one thing to take care of, and we are
safe: Let us make God our Friend, and he will raise us
up Friends, and Patrons, and Protectors; will deliver us
out of the hands of our Enemies, or make our Enemies
to be at peace with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Having thus explained God's government of
Causes, let us now consider his government of Events:
And I think it will be easily granted me, That if all those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50615:35"/>
Causes by which all Events are brought to pass, are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, God must also have the Absolute Government
of all Events in his own hands.</p>
               <p>But yet the government of Causes and of Events, are
of a very different consideration; and to represent this as
plainly and familiarly as I can, I shall 1. shew you, What
I mean by Events, when I attribute the government of all
Events to God. 2. Wherein God's government of Events
consists. 3. The Difference between God's Absolute go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of all Events, and Necessity and Fate. 4. That
the Exercise of a particular Providence consists in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of all Events.</p>
               <p>1. What I mean by Events: Now every thing that is
done, may in a large sense be called an Event, and is in some
degree or other, under the government of Providence, as
all the actions of men are; but when I speak of God's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Events, I mean only such Events as are in
Scripture called God's <hi>doings,</hi> as being ordered and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him; that is to say, all the good or evil which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to private men, or to Kingdoms and Nations in this
world. Every thing that is done, is not God's doing; for
there is a great deal of evil every day committed, which
God does not order and appoint to be done, but has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbid the doing of it; but there is no good or evil
which happens to any man, or to any Society of men, but
what God orders and appoints for them; and this is God's
government of all Events. This is the proper exercise of
Providence, to allot all men their Fortunes and Conditions
in the world, to dispense Rewards and Punishments, to
take care that no man shall receive either good or evil, but
from the Hand, and by the Appointment of God; this is
the Subject of all the Disputes about the Justice, and
Goodness, and Wisdom of Providence; and all the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
against Providence, necessarily suppose that thus
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50615:35"/>
it is, or thus it ought to be, if God governs the world:
For unless Providence be concerned to take care that no
men be happy or miserable, but as they deserve, which
cannot be without the Absolute Government of all Events,
the prosperity of bad men, and the sufferings of the good,
the many miseries that are in the world, and the uncertain
changes and turnings of Fortune, can be no Objection
against Providence: And indeed, were not this the case,
Providence would be so insignificant a Name, that it
would not be worth the while to dispute for or against it;
for a Providence which neither can do us good nor hurt,
or which cannot always and in all cases do it, is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or worth no more than it can do good or hurt.
And therefore all the good or evil, which does or can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
Men or Kingdoms, is in Scripture attributed to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and promised or threatned by God, as men shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
either; such as Length of Days, or a sudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Death; Health, or Sickness; Honour, or Disgrace;
Riches, or Poverty; Plenty, or Famine; War, or Peace;
the changing Times and Seasons; the removing Kings, and
setting up Kings; and with respect to all such Events as
these, whatever the immediate Causes of them be, God
is said to do whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> But we shall better understand this, by enquiring
into the Nature of God's Government. Now God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Events consists in ordering and appointing
whatever good or evil shall befal men; for according to the
Scripture, we must attribute such a Government to God,
as makes all these Events <hi>his Will and Doing;</hi> and nothing
can be his Will and Doing, but what he Wills and Orders.</p>
               <p>Some men think it enough to say, That God permits
every thing that is done, but will by no means allow that
God Wills, and Orders, and Appoints it, which they are
afraid will charge the Divine Providence with all the evil
that is done in the world; and truly so it would, did God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50615:36"/>
order and appoint the evil to be done; but tho God orders
and appoints what evils every man shall suffer, he orders
and appoints no man to do the evil; he only permits some
men to do mischief, and appoints who shall suffer by it,
which is the short Resolution of this Case. To attribute
the evils which some men suffer from other mens sins, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Gods Permission, is to destroy the Government of
Providence, for bare Permission is not Government; and
those evils which God permits, but does not order, cannot
be called <hi>his will and doing;</hi> and if this be the case of all the
evils we suffer from other mens sins, most of the evils
which men suffer, befal them without God's Will and
Appointment; and yet to attribute all the evil which men
do, to God's Order and Appointment, is to destroy the
Holiness of Providence; and therefore we must necessarily
distinguish between the evils men do, and the evils they
suffer; the first God Permits and Directs, the second he
Orders and Appoints. How God governs men hearts and
actions, I have already explained; and this is the place to
consider God's Permission of Evil; for Permission relates
to actions. Mens own wicked hearts conceive and form
wicked designs, and they execute them by God's Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but no man suffers by them, but by God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
God's Care of his creatures requires that no man
should suffer any thing, but what God orders for him;
and if such sufferings be just and righteous, how wicked
soever the Causes be, it is no reproach to Providence to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and appoint them. Suppose a man have forfeited his
Life, or Estate, or Reputation to Providence, or tho he
have made no Criminal Forfeiture of it, yet God sees fit
for other Wise Reasons to remove him out of the world,
or to reduce him to Poverty and Contempt; is it any fault
in Providence to deliver such a man into the hands of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
Oppressors, Slanderers, who are very forward to
execute such Decrees, when Providence takes off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50615:36"/>
and sets them at liberty to follow their own lusts?
And when there are so many that deserve or need these or
such kind of Punishments or Corrections, and such vast
numbers of bad men, who are ready every day to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such outrages, did not God restrain them, is it not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
visible how easily God can order and appoint such suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for men, without ordering or appointing any man's
sins? It requires no more than to bring those whom God
appoints for suffering, into the reach of such men, and to
put them into their power, and their own malice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
will do the rest: It is like exposing Condemn'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
to Wild Beasts, whose nature and inclination is to
devour; and if God chains up bad men, as we do wild
beasts, that they cannot touch any one but whom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
up to them, and lets them loose only to execute his
own Just and Righteous Judgment, can any thing be
more Honourable to Providence, or a greater Security to
Mankind?</p>
               <p>To form an Idea of this in our minds, let us suppose
this to be the case of an Earthly Prince, That he perfectly
understood all the Deserts, and all the Inclinations of his
Subjects, and had such an invisible and insensible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them, that without giving them any directions,
or letting them know any thing of his Intentions, or offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any violence to their own Inclinations, he could deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them to do that hurt which they had a mind to do, to
those, and to those only, whom he intended to punish;
and to do the good they are desirous to do, to those, and to
those only, whom he intends to reward; in case such a
Prince took care that no man should suffer more from the
wickedness of others, than what he deserved, and the
Reasons of Government required, would any man charge
such a Prince with all the Wickedness that is committed in
his Kingdom, only because he so wisely orders it, that
some bad men shall execute his Vengeance upon other bad
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50615:37"/>
men, and serve instead of Judge, and Jury, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners?
Nay, would not every man say, That this is the
most Perfect and Absolute Form of Government in the
world? Earthly Princes indeed cannot do this, but this is
the Government of God, who accomplishes his own Wise
Counsels by the Ministries of Men.</p>
               <p>And this may satisfie us in what sense all the good and
all the evil that happens either to private Men, or to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Nations, is said to be <hi>God's will,</hi> and <hi>God's doing,</hi>
and <hi>what pleaseth him;</hi> because no Man or Nation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
or punished, but by God's order and appointment:
That as many good men as there are in the world, who are
ready to do good to all they can; and as many bad men as
there are, who are ready to do all the mischief they can;
none of them can do either good or hurt to any, but to
those whom God has appointed for either; which makes
God the Absolute Lord and Sovereign of the world; since
whatever men intend, all mens Fortunes and Conditions
depend upon his Will.</p>
               <p>And since God absolutely orders and appoints nothing
but the Event, if the Event be holy, just, and good, that
is, if men be rewarded and punished according to their
works, as far as the Justice and Goodness of Providence is
concerned in this world, there can be no reasonable Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against Providence; for by what wicked means soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
men be rewarded or punished, if the Reward or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
by holy, just, and good, this vindicates the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and Justice, and Goodness of Providence; of which
more hereafter. Let mens Wickedness be to themselves,
for that is their own; but that the Wickedness of men is
over-ruled by an Invisible Hand, to accomplish Wise and
Just Decrees, that is the Glory of Providence.</p>
               <p>And this suggests another evident Reason, why all the
good or evil that befals men, is called <hi>God's will,</hi> and <hi>God's
doings,</hi> because in a strict and proper sense, it is not man's
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50615:37"/>
Will, nor man's Doings. What is done, is either what
those who did it, never intended to do; or else serves such
ends, and is ordered by God for such ends, as those who
did it, never thought of; which proves men to be only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
but God the Supreme Disposer of all Events.
If we must attribute all things that are done, either to God
or Men, then what is not done by Men, must be done by
God; and Men can't be properly said to do what they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended; and therefore whatever is either beyond or
contrary to what Men intended, must either be attributed
to Chance, or to a Divine Providence. I observed before,
what different Intentions God and men have in the same
actions; what is intended by men, is their doing; what is
intended by God, is his doing, and wholly his doing, when
what God intended was not intended by men. For this
reason <hi>Ioseph</hi> tells his Brethren, that it was not they, but
God, that sent him into <hi>Egypt, 45. Gen.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. for
they thought nothing of sending him into <hi>Egypt;</hi> but this
was what God intended, when he permitted them to sell
him to the <hi>Ishmaelites:</hi> This was their sin, as he adds,
50. Gen. 20. <hi>But as for you, ye thought evil against me;</hi> but
the good that was done, was wholly God's doings; <hi>but
God meant it unto good.</hi> And thus it is in other cases; which
shows us what the Scripture calls God's doings. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of sinners, and those evils he brings on them, is
God's doings, but not the sins whereby they are punished:
The Punishment of <hi>David</hi>'s Adultery by the Incest of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom,</hi>
was God's doing, but not <hi>Absalom</hi>'s Incest: The
sending <hi>Ioseph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and advancing him into <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Throne, was God's doing; but not the Sin of his
Brethren in selling him for a Slave: And thus it is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Scripture; nothing is called God's Will, or God's
doing, which has any Moral Evil in it; all wicked actions
are mens own will and own doings, which God permits
for wise ends, but never orders or appoints; but the good
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50615:38"/>
or evil which is done by mens sins, that is God's doing:
and I hope by this time you all know how to distinguish
between God's government of mens Actions, and his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Events; and then we may safely attribute all
Events to God's order and appointment, without danger
of charging God with the sins of men, whereby such
Events are brought to pass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Let us now consider, What difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God's Absolute Government of all Events, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Fate; for many men are very apt to confound
these two: If no good or evil befals any men, but what
God orders and appoints for them, this they think sounds
like Fate and Destiny; that every man's Fortune is writ
upon his Forehead; and that it is impossible for any man,
by all his Care, and Industry, and Prudence, to make his
Condition better than what God has decreed it to be in the
Irreversible Rolls of Fate: And yet an Unrelenting, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
Fate, is so irreconcilable with the liberty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
actions, with the nature of good and evil, of rewards
and punishments, that if we admit of it, there is an end of
all Religion, of all Vertuous Endeavours, of all Great and
Generous Attempts: it is to no purpose to pray to God, or
to trust in him, or to resist temptations, or to be diligent
in our business, or prudent and circumspect in our actions;
for what will be, will be: Or if any means be to be used,
that is no matter of our choice or care, but we shall do it as
necessarily and mechanically as a Watch moves, and points
to the Hour of the Day; for Fate has by the same Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
determined the Means and the End, and we can do no
more nor less than Fate has determined.</p>
               <p>I shall not now trouble you with an account of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Opinions of the Ancient Philosophers about Fate,
none of whom ever dreamt of such a terrible Fate as some
Christians have fancied, which reaches not only to this
world, but to all Eternity: What I have already discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50615:38"/>
is sufficient to vindicate the Doctrine of Providence
from the least imputation of Necessity and Fate.</p>
               <p>For 1. Though God over-rules the actions of men, to
do what he himself thinks fit to be done, yet he lays no
Necessity upon human actions: men will and chuse freely,
pursue their own interests and inclinations, just as they
would do if there were no Providence to govern them;
and while men act freely, it is certain there can be no Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Fate. God indeed, as you have already heard,
sometimes hinders them from executing their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
and permits them to do no more hurt than what he
can direct to Wise Ends; but no man is wicked, or does
wickedly, by Necessity and Fate. Tho he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from doing so much wickedness as he would,
yet all the wickedness he commits, is his own free Choice,
even when it serves such ends as he never thought of; and
therefore he is and acts like a free Agent, notwithstanding
the Government of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Tho God determines all Events, all the good and
evil that shall happen to Men or Nations, yet it is no more
nor no other than what they themselves have deserved;
and therefore they are under no other Fate than what they
themselves bring upon themselves by the good or bad use
of their own liberty: that is, they are under no other Fate
than to be rewarded when they do well, and to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when they do ill; but this is the Justice of Providence,
not the Necessity of Fate. Those who do ill, and deserve
ill, and suffer ill, might have done well, and have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Favourites of Providence; and therefore are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no greater Necessity of Suffering ill, than they were of
Doing ill. The reason why God keeps all Events in his
own hands, is not because he has absolutely determined
the Fates of all men, but that he may govern the world
wisely and justly, and reward and punish men according
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50615:39"/>
to their deserts, as far as the Reasons of Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
in this world. Now while the liberty of human
actions is secured, and the Events of Providence are not
the execution of Fatal, Absolute, and Unconditional De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
but acts of Government in the Wise Administration
of Justice, and dispensing Rewards and Punishments, how
Absolute soever God's Govenment be of all Events, it is
not Necessity and Fate, but a Wise, and Just, and Absolute
Government. This indeed is what some of the Wisest
Heathens called Fate, and all that they meant by the Name
of Fate, That God had fixed it by an irreversible Decree,
that Good men should be rewarded, and the Wicked pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
and thus far we must all allow Fate; and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is only the Minister and Executioner of these Fatal
Decrees; and to that end, God keeps the Government of
all Events in his own hands. Now whether we say, That
God determines what good or evil shall befal men, at the
very time when they deserve it; or, That foreseeing what
good or evil they will do, and what they will deserve, did
beforehand determine what good or evil should befal them
according to their deserts, this makes no alteration at all
in the state of the Question; for if all the good or evil that
befalls men, have respect to their deserts, this is not Fate,
but a Just and Righteous Judgment.</p>
               <p>In a word; God's Government of all Events is indeed
so Absolute and Uncontroulable, that no good or evil can
befal any man, but what God pleases, what he orders and
appoints for him; and this is necessary to the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World, and the Care of all his Creatures;
but then God orders no good or evil to befal any men, but
what they deserve, and what the Wise Ends of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
require; and this is not Fate, but a Wise and Just
Government of the World.</p>
               <p>4. That the Exercise of a Particular Providence consists
in the Government of all Events.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50615:39"/>
I have often wondred at those Philosophers who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
a Providence, but would not acknowledge
God's particular Care of all his Creatures. Some confined
his Providence to the Heavens, but would not extend it to
this lower world; and yet this world needs a Providence
as much, and a great deal more, as being a Scene of Change
and Corruption, of furious Lusts and Passions, which
need the Restraints and Government of Providence: No
Creatures need God's Care more than the Inhabitants of
this Earth; and if he take Care of any of his Creatures,
one would think he should take most Care of them who
need it most.</p>
               <p>Others, who would allow, That the Providence of God
reached this lower world, yet confined God's care to the
several Kinds and Species of Beings, but would not extend
it to every Individual; as if God took care of Logical
Terms, of Genus and Species, but took no care of his own
Creatures, which are all Individuals; or as if God could
take care of all his creatures, without taking care of any
particular creature; <hi>i.e.</hi> That he could take care of all
his creatures, without taking care of any one of them.</p>
               <p>Thus they would allow God to take care of the great
Affairs of Kingdoms and Commonwealths, but to have
no regard to particular Men or Families, unless they made
a great Figure in the world; as if Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
were not made up of particular Men, and
particular Families; or that God could take care of the
whole, without taking care of every part; or as if there
were any other reason for taking care of the whole, but to
take care of those particulars who make the whole. To
talk of a General Providence, without God's Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of every Particular Creature, is manifestly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and absurd; for whatever Reasons oblige us to
own a Providence, oblige us to own a Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:50615:40"/>
If Creation be a Reason why God should preserve and
take care of what he has made, this is a Reason why he
should take care of every creature, because there is no
creature but what he made; and if the whole world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of particulars, it must be taken care of in the care of
particulars; for if all particulars perish, as they may do
if no care be taken to preserve them, the whole must
perish.</p>
               <p>And there is the same reason for the Government of
Mankind; for the whole is governed in the Government
of the parts; and Mankind can't be well governed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Wise Government of every particular Man.</p>
               <p>I'm sure that the Objections against a Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
are very foolish. Some think it too much trouble to
God to take care of every particular; as if it were more
trouble to him to take care of them, than it was to make
them; or as if God had made more creatures than he could
take care of; as if an Infinite Mind, and Omnipotent
Power, were as much disturbed and tired with various and
perpetual Cares, as we are. Others think it below the
Greatness and Majesty of God, to take cognizance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mean and contemptible creature, or of every private
man; as if it were more below God to take care of such
creatures, than it is to make them; as if numbers made
creatures considerable to God; that tho one man is below
God's care, yet a Kingdom is worthy of his care and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
when the whole world to God is but <hi>as the drop of the
bucket, and the small dust of the balance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is certain there can be no particular Providence,
without God's Government of all Events; for if any good
or evil happens to any man without God's Order and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
that is not Providence, whatever other name
you will give it: So that if God does take a particular
care of all his creatures, this is a demonstration that he has
the Absolute Government of all Events, for without it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50615:40"/>
he cannot take Care of them; and if God have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Events, as the Scripture assures us he has, this
confirms us in the belief of a particular Providence; for if all
the Good or Evil that happens to every particular man is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, that is proof enough that God takes Care of
every particular Man. God's Government of all particular
Events, and his Care of all Individuals, include each other
in their very Natures: The Care of particular Creatures
consists in the Government of all particular Events; and
the Government of all Events, is the Exercise of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Providence; as our Saviour represents it 10. <hi>Matth.
29, 30, 31. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one
of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But
the very hairs of your head are all numbred. Fear ye not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ye are of more value than many sparrows.</hi> Where
God's particular Providence over all his Creatures is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by his particular care of all Events; which extends
even to the Life of a Sparrow, and to the Hairs of our
Heads.</p>
               <p>Thus much is certain, That without this belief, That
God takes a particular Care of all his Creatures, in the
Government of all Events that can happen to them; there
is no reason or pretence for most of the particular Duties of
Religious Worship. For most of the Acts of Worship
consider God, not merely as an Universal Cause, (could
we form any Notion of a general Providence without any
Care of particular Creatures, or particular Events) but
as our particular Patron, Protector, and Preserver.</p>
               <p>To fear God, and to stand in awe of his Justice; to
trust and depend on him in all Conditions; to submit pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to his will under all Afflictions; to pray to him for the
supply of our Wants, for the relief of our Sufferings, for
Protection and Defence; to love and praise him for the
Blessings we enjoy, for peace, and plenty, and health, for
friends and benefactors, and all prosperous Successes: I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50615:41"/>
say, these are not the Acts of Reasonable men, unless we
believe that God has the Supreme Disposal of all Events,
and takes a particular Care of us. For if any Good or
Evil can befal us without God's particular Order and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
we have no reason to trust in God who does
not always take Care of us; we have no reason to bear our
Sufferings patiently at God's hand, and in Submission to
his Will; for we know not whether our Sufferings be God's
Will or not; we have no reason to love and praise God for
every Blessing and Deliverance we receive, because we
know not whether it came from God; and it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to pray to God for particular Blessings, if he does not
concern himself in particular Events: But if we believe
that God takes a particular Care of us all, and that no
Good or Evil happens to us but as he pleases; all these Acts
or Religious Worship are both Reasonable, Necessary,
and Just. But of this more hereafter.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Sovereignty of Providence.</head>
               <p>HAving in the former Chapter shewn, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Divine Providence consists in Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
and Disposing all Events: For the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, and to prevent a great many ignorant Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
against it, besides what I have already said, it will
be necessary more particularly to explain the Nature and
Essential Characters and Properties of God's Governing
Providence. And I shall begin with</p>
               <p>1. The Sovereignty of Providence. For God being
the Sovereign Lord of the World, must Govern with a
Sovereign Will, For a Sovereign Lord, is a Sovereign and
Absolute Governor. For which reason the Scripture so
often resolves all things into <hi>the sole will and pleasure of
God;</hi> and in many cases will allow us to seek for no other
Cause.<note place="margin">4. Dan. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>He doth according to his will in the army of heaven,
and among the inhabitants of the earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">135. Psal. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatever the Lord
pleased, that did he in heaven and in earth, in the seas, and
all deep places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Will of God is Sovereign, and Absolute, and
Unaccountable; needs no other proof, but that his Power
is Absolute, and his Wisdom Unsearchable; for Absolute
Power, makes an Absolute Will. He who has Power to
do whatever he will, can do whatever he will; and that is
the definition of a Severeign and Absolute Will. And
thus the Scripture resolves the Sovereignty of God into
Power:<note place="margin">9. Job 4.</note> That <hi>none can stay his hand, or say unto him, what
dost thou? He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who
hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50615:42"/>
And indeed a Power which is Supreme and Absolute,
which can do all things, and which has no greater Power
above it, none equal to it, has a right to Sovereignty. For
Absolute Power must be the Maker of all things, and that
must give an Absolute Right to all things; and that gives
a Right to Absolute Government, if there be any such
thing as a Natural Right to Government; for if God have
a Natural Right to Govern his Creatures, he must have a
Right to Absolute Government; because the Right he has
in his Creatures is Absolute and Uncontroulable. No
Creature has such an Absolute Power, and therefore no
Creature has such a Sovereign and Absolute Will neither:
For how Powerful soever any man is, God is more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than he, and can call him to an account; and no Power,
no Will which can be Checked, and Controul'd, and called
to an Account, is perfectly Absolute.</p>
               <p>And as Absolute Power makes the Divine Providence
Absolute and Unaccountable, so does perfect and unerring
Wisdom; but for a very different reason: Absolute Power
has no Superior Power to give Laws to it, and to call it to
an Account: Perfect and Unerring Wisdom, has no Superior
Wisdom to take an Account, or to Judge of its Actions; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can Judge of Wisdom, but Wisdom; and an Inferior
cannot comprehend a Superior Wisdom; especially when
there is such a vast disproportion as there is between a Finite
and an Infinite Understanding; which must of necessity
in a thousand instances make <hi>the judgments of God unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and his ways past finding out:</hi> It neither becomes the
Infinite Wisdom of God in all cases to give an account of his
Actions, nor the Modesty of Creatures to demand it; as
<hi>Elihu</hi> tells <hi>Iob, Why dost thou strive against him? for he
giveth not account of any of his matters.</hi> 33. Job 13.</p>
               <p>But both these are thought very grievous by some men.
They are terribly afraid of an Absolute Power which can
do what it pleases, and justify whatever it does by an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50615:42"/>
and Unaccountable Will. Others are very uneasie
that God does any thing without giving them the
reasons why he does it; and to be revenged of Providence,
they will allow nothing to be Wisely and Justly done,
which they can't comprehend: every Event which they
can't account for, they make an Objection against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and thus they may easily object themselves into
Atheism or Infidelity; for they can never want such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
while infinite and unsearchable Wisdom Governs
the World.</p>
               <p>Here then I shall lay the Foundation of all, in justifying
the Sovereignty of Providence, which will justifie every
thing else: And I shall distinctly consider God's Sovereign
and Absolute Power, and his Unsearchable and Unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Wisdom.</p>
               <p>1. Absolute Power; and the very naming Absolute
Power puts an end to the dispute about the extent of God's
Dominion over his Creatures: For Absolute Power has no
limits, and can have none; and therefore Absolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
extends to all that Absolute Power can do. This is
what Mankind are afraid of, who judge of God's Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power by the Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government
of some Absolute Monarchs: But true Absolute Power
can do no wrong, cannot injure and oppress its Creatures;
but will do good and judge righteously, defend the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and punish the Wicked. If I can make it appear,
that this is the essential Character of Absolute Power, it
will make us infinitely secure in the Divine Providence;
for all men must grant that the Power of God is Absolute;
and if this Absolute Power Governs the World, the World
must be very well and justly Governed, if Absolute Power
can do nothing but what is Just and Good. Now this is
the Natural Notion which all Mankind have of Supreme
and Absolute Power, which is the Supreme and Natural
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50615:43"/>
Lord and Judge of the World. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> reasoned
with God, and therein spake the sense of Mankind; <hi>Shall
not the judge of all the earth do right?</hi> 18. Genes. 25.
If Absolute Power could do wrong, there were no certain
redress of those wrongs and injuries, which Inferior
Powers do; for the last Appeal must be to the Greatest and
most Absolute Power; and if that will not certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify
the injuries of Inferior Powers, but instead of that
may do wrong it self, we cannot certainly promise our selves
ever to have right done us.</p>
               <p>This shews how necessary it is, That Absolute Will and
Power should be Absolute Rectitude and Justice, if there
be any such thing as Justice in Nature. For Absolute
Power is by Nature the last and Supreme Judge; and the
Natural Judge of Right and Wrong, must be Natural
Justice and Rectitude; or else Natural Justice is a mere
Speculative Notion, which can never be reduced to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
For there never can be exact and perfect Justice in
the World, unless there be a Judge who is exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Justice: And if Absolute Will and Power be not that
Judge, there can be none; for Absolute Power, if it be
not Absolutely and perfectly Just, can do Wrong, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else Judges Right.</p>
               <p>But besides this, it is demonstrable <hi>à priori,</hi> that Absolute
Power, must be Absolute Rectitude and Justice.</p>
               <p>1. Because all infinite Perfections, how different soever
they are in our Conceptions of them, are but one infinite
Being, which is Absolutely Perfect; and therefore in a
Being Absolutely Perfect, one Absolute Perfection can
never be divided or separated from any other Absolute
Perfection; and therefore Absolute Power can never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from Absolute Justice: For to say any Being is
Absolutely Perfect, (which is the most Natural Notion of
God) and yet that it wants any Absolute Perfection, is a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50615:43"/>
Contradiction: Absolute Will and Absolute Government,
is the most Perfect Will and most Perfect Government;
and that is the most Perfect Justice and Goodness, if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Goodness be any Perfections.</p>
               <p>We must not judge of the Absolute Will and Absolute
Government of God, by what we call Absolute Power in
men; which is the foundation of all the Mistakes about
God's Government: We find men apt to abuse their Power,
the more Absolute it is, into Tyranny and Oppression; and
this makes some afraid, that God's Absolute Will and
Power may use his Creatures very hardly also; but the
case is very different, as different as the Absolute Power of
Men is from the Absolute Power of God.</p>
               <p>What we call Absolute Power in men, is not Absolute
Power; that is, it is not perfect Power, it is not a Power
which can do all things, for there are Infinite things, which
the most Absolute Prince has not Power to do; and that
is not Absolute Perfect Power, which can't do all things.
Absolute Government among men, signifies only an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
Liberty to do all that it will and can do: A
Will which is under no Human Restraints, which may
will whatever it pleases, and do whatever it wills, as far
as it can, but has not Power to do all that it would. Now
such an Absolute Will as this, which has not all Power,
may be very wild and extravagant, and far from willing
always what is right and just; for such a Will as this is
no Perfection; and therefore as it is separated from a truly
Absolute Power, so it may be separated from Rectitude
and Justice. Nay, such a Will is not truly Absolute, no
more than its Power; because there is a Will, as there is
a Power, above it; and no Will is Absolute, which has a
superior Will to controul it, and to give Laws to it; and
yet God is higher than the highest, to whose Sovereign
Will the most Absolute Princes are accountable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not Absolute themselves. Now reason tells us,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50615:44"/>
That a Will which has a Superior Will and Law, is not it
self unerring Rectitude and Justice, and therefore may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
from what is right and just, as experience tells us such
Absolute Wills very often do; and when the Will can chuse
wrong, the Power, which is the Minister of such an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Will, must do wrong also. But now reason tells us,
that the Supreme Will must be the Supreme Law, that is,
Perfect and Absolute Justice, and therefore can no more
will any thing that is unjust, than Justice it self can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just;
and if this Absolute and Soveraign Will be Absolute
Power, Absolute Power must be perfectly Just and Good,
as being inseparable from Perfect Justice: And therefore
the Absolute Power of God can no more do any wrong,
than his Absolute Will can chuse it.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, if we do but consider the Nature of truly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Power, which can do whatever it will, this alone
may satisfy us, That God, who is this Supreme Powerful
Being, can neither will nor do any wrong: For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
things well, we shall plainly see, that tho some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Power is required to enable men to do wrong, yet
it is always want of Power which tempts them to do
wrong.</p>
               <p>There are two visible Causes of all the Injustice that is
committed in the world, and both of them are the effects
of weakness. 1. That men want Power to do what they
have a mind to do, without doing some wrong or injury to
others. 2. That men are overpowered by their own pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to do what they know they ought not to do, and
which they would not do, had they the perfect Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of themselves.</p>
               <p>As for the first, Is there any man in the world, who is
not a perfect bruit, who does not wish that it were lawful
for him to do what he has a mind to, and that he might
have what he desires to have, without offering Violence or
Injury to any body? Would not a Thief much rather chuse
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50615:44"/>
to find a Treasure, than to take a Purse upon the Road?
Would not an Ambitious and Aspiring Monarch rather
chuse, That all Princes should resign their Crowns to
him, and all Nations become his Subjects, than to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to win their Crowns by his Sword, and to make bloody
Conquests with the lamentable Ravage and Spoils of flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Countries? Do not men intend to supply some real
or imaginary want in all the Injuries they do? And does
not this suppose weakness and want of Power, to want
any thing else? For is it possible for Absolute Power to
want? So impossible is it for Absolute Power to do any
Injury.</p>
               <p>He who is the sole Lord and Proprietor of the world,
(as he is and must be whose Power is Supreme and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute),
He whose all Creatures are, and whose Wisdom
and Power can accomplish whatever he would have done,
without doing the least Injustice, can never be tempted to
injure his own Creatures, nor can ever want any thing
which should tempt him to do an Injury; and therefore
Absolute Power must be Absolute Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> All the Injuries that are done, are owing to the
Lusts and Passions of men, which are the weaknesses even
of Human Nature, when they are not under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reason. No man does any Injury, but to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
some Lust or Passion; and that is a weak and impotent
mind, where Passion reigns. Reason is the Strength and
Vigor of the Mind, and a man who lives by Reason, never
does any Injury, but through mistake, which is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Reason. But now Absolute Power is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
adventitious thing, but is a Powerful Nature, and
a Powerful Nature is all Power, and there can be no place
for the Rule and Empire of Passion; and if it be one Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or other which always does the Injury, Absolute
Power, which is void of Passion, can do none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50615:45"/>
Excepting a Divine Love, (which is the true Image of
the Divine Nature, and never does any Injury, and ought
not to be reckoned among the Passions), all our other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the effects of weakness, and are Arguments of a
weak, limited, and confined Nature.</p>
               <p>Desire and Hope prove that we want something which
we cannot certainly bestow upon our selves; Fear is a
sense of danger, which argues want of Power to defend
our selves: Anger and Revenge is a resentment of some
Injuries we have received, and that argues want of Power,
to suffer Injuries: Hatred and Malice are but greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Anger and Revenge; and the greater they are, the
greater sense they argue of Fear and Danger, of Injuries
either expected, or received.</p>
               <p>These are the Passions which do all the mischief that is
done in the world; and it is demonstrable, that Absolute
Power is not capable of these injurious Passions, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
desire, nor hope, nor fear, can suffer no Wants nor
Injuries, nor have any sense or resentment of them; and
therefore there is no danger it should do any Injury; it is
acted by calm and steady Wisdom, which is unerring Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
too, which never did and never can do any injury.
It is true, some of these Passions are in Scripture attributed
to God, such as Anger, Fury, Hatred, Revenge; for the
Scripture speaks of God after the manner of men; but
then all that this signifies is, That God will be as severe in
his Judgments, as Anger and Revenge is, tho it is not Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in God, but a Wise, and Cool, and Equal Justice,
which punishes; which may be as severe as Anger and
Revenge, but never partial or unjust.</p>
               <p>(3.) Nay, we may observe, That Power it self is a
Great and Generous Principle, and inspires men with
Great and Noble Thoughts. Those whose Power secures
them from receiving any hurt, are never tempted to do any:
Power, which is Cruel, Insolent, Mischievous, is always
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50615:45"/>
conscious of its own weakness and danger; for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
weakness and fear, which makes men cruel; but
a Power which knows it self out of danger, out of the
reach of envy and ill-will, is always a very generous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
never insults over a prostrate Enemy; for such
great Power makes all its Enemies the objects of Pity or
Scorn, and then they cease to be the objects of Revenge.
And if Power, that little Power which men have, gives
them such a Greatness of Mind as sets them above Affronts,
and Resentments, and sense of Injuries; if this be so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to Power, that it is always expected from men in
Power, That they should have a Greatness and Generosity
of Mind proportioned to their Power; That it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to them when it is not so, and makes them despised,
and scorned, and hated, with all their Power; What then
may we expect from the Perfect and Absolute Power of
God? We may fear his Justice, but have no reason to fear
his Power; Justice will punish sinners, but his Power
will never oppress; for that is below his Power, that is too
mean and base a thing for Perfect and Absolute Power to
do: It is thought a reproach for a Great and Powerful Man
to oppress, much less then will the All-Powerful God
do so.</p>
               <p>(4.) For to observe but one thing more, it is the Glory
of Power to do good, not to do hurt, and if this be the
Natural Glory of Power, it is its Natural Perfection too,
and the most Natural Exercise of it; and therefore it is
that which Perfect Power will do. Its Nature is to do
good, but never to do hurt; that if to punish were not
to do good, Perfect and Absolute Power could not punish.</p>
               <p>If we rightly consider things, we must confess, That
it is a much greater Power to do good, than to do hurt; to
save, than to destroy; to make so excellent a Creature as
man is, and to maintain and preserve him in being, than
to kill him: In most cases it requires very little Power to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50615:46"/>
do hurt; every man, how weak and inconsiderable soever
he is, has a great deal of Power to do hurt; but there are
very few who can do much good; and therefore it is plain,
that to do good is the greater Power, and therefore to do
good, must be essential to the greatest Power. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that to do good is the most glorious Power, because
good is in it self a beautiful, lovely, and glorious thing,
but evil is very inglorious. All Creatures love to receive
good, they feel it, they rejoice in it, they adore and praise
their Maker and great Benefactor, they live in him, they
depend on him, they fly to him to supply their wants, they
take Refuge and Sanctuary in his Power, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
safe under his Wings. And can there possibly be a
more lovely Idea and Representation of Power than this?
A Power, which makes a World, and all the Creatures in
it; which contrives their Natures with all variety of Art
and Wisdom, and with very different capacities of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
according to the different Excellencies and Perfections
of their Natures, and provides for them all with a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Hand; this is great and excellent Power indeed,
which gives Being, and preserves it, and provides daily for
such infinite numbers and variety of Creatures as are in
the world; this is the lovely and charming Idea of a God;
but an Arbitrary, Lawless Power, which tyranizeth over
Creatures, which can do what mischief it pleases, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to do it, is a very terrible thing indeed, but not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
it is what all Creatures must fear, and hate, and fly
from, not praise and adore. So that if we will allow the
most Perfect and Absolute Power to be the most Glorious,
as we must do if we acknowledge Power to be Glorious,
then the most Absolute Power must be the most kind and
beneficent thing in the world; for this is the Glory of
Power, to do good.</p>
               <p>Thus we see in what sense Absolute Will and Power can
do no wrong, because the Will and Power of God, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50615:46"/>
is the only Absolute Will and Power, is Absolute Rectitude
and Justice, and Absolute Goodness too. Absolute Power
can do no wrong, because it can never will nor chuse to do
any wrong; not because Power can make that just and
right, which without such Absolute Power would have
been wrong; for no Power can make right to be wrong,
nor wrong to be right. Good and evil, just and unjust, are
of an eternal and unchangeable nature, not made so by
Power, but in their Notion antecedent to Power, and the
natural rule and measure of it. The Will of God is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Justice and Goodness, and therefore his Will is the
Eternal Rule of Justice and Goodness; and therefore in
propriety of speech, when we speak of God we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say that God wills any thing because it is just and
good, or that it is just and good because God wills it, both
which imply a distinction between the Will of God, and
Justice and Goodness, which in the Divine Nature are the
same; but since the imperfection of our understandings
cannot admit one simple Notion and Idea of an Infinite
Mind, but must apprehend every thing by distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
in God, as we do in Creatures; it is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the nature of things, to make good and evil ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the Will of God, and the Rule of his Will and
Choice, because this asserts the Eternal and Unchangeable
Nature of Good and Evil, and the inflexible Justice and
Holiness of the Divine Will, that God never can will any
thing but what is Just and Good, and never wills any thing
for any other reason, but because it is Just and Good:
Whereas to make Justice and Goodness to depend wholly
upon the Will of God, that therefore any thing is Just and
Good because God wills it, supposes that Justice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
has no stable Nature of its own, but may at any time
change its Nature with the Will of God; and it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to prove, that the Will of God can't change as the
Wills of men do, if it have no Eternal and Unchangeable
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50615:47"/>
Rule, or be not Eternal and Unchangeable Justice and
Goodness it self.</p>
               <p>When we speak of God after the manner of men, our
words must be expounded to the same sense, excepting
Metaphorical and Figurative Expressions, as when they
are used of men: Now we all know what a vast difference
there is between these two expressions, when used of men.
Such a man always wills and chuses what is good and just;
and he makes every thing good and just by willing it; the
first supposes a certain and invariable Rule of good and
evil, the second resolves the nature of good and just into
Arbitrary Will and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>And it is the very same case, when we speak of God's
Power, which is nothing else but the execution of his
Will. God's Absolute Power can do nothing but what is
just and good; but we must not therefore say, That Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power makes every thing it does, just and good; as if
Power were not regulated by Justice and Goodness, but
were the Rule of it.</p>
               <p>There is great reason curiously to distinguish in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because there are a sort of Christians who attribute
such things to God, as are irreconcilable with all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we have of Justice and Goodness, and think to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
all Objections, and to justify all, by the Sovereign
Dominion and Absolute Power of God, which can do no
wrong; but if it be a wrong to Creatures to be eternally
miserable for no other reason but the Will and Pleasure of
God, I cannot but think the Absolute Decrees of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
to be very unjust, and the Execution of such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
to be doing wrong, how Absolute soever the Power
be that does it.</p>
               <p>And I confess I cannot but wonder, that men who make
the Glory of God the End of all his actions, (as certainly
it is, when rightly understood) should attribute such
things to God as all the rest of mankind think very inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50615:47"/>
That when the truest and greatest Glory of Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power, as you have already heard, is to do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
good, they should think it sufficient to justifie such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as they have no other way to prove good and just,
merely by Absolute Power. The Glory of Absolute Power
is to do what all the world acknowledges to be good and
just; and therefore Absolute Power cannot prove those
actions to be good and just, nor make it self Glorious, by
doing such actions as mankind think very infamous and
unjust.</p>
               <p>Let us then lay down this as the Foundation of all, That
how Unaccountable soever Sovereign and Absolute Will
and Power is, it neither can nor will do any wrong; for it
is nothing else but Absolute and Sovereign Justice and
Goodness. We have no reason to be afraid of the Absolute
Power of God, no more than we have to be afraid of his
Absolute Goodness. Absolute Power is the only security
we have against suffering wrong; for it will do no wrong
it self, but will rectify all the wrongs which are done by
Inferior Powers, which none but a Sovereign and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power can do. The firm belief of this will give great
relief and satisfaction to our minds, under all the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Passages of Providence; for tho Absolute Power
be always just and good, yet <hi>its ways are</hi> sometimes <hi>past
finding out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us now consider, How unsearchable the
Wisdom of Providence is, <hi>which doth great things past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, yea, and wonders without number,</hi> 9. Job 10. Which
may satisfy us, how impossible it is for such ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as we are, to comprehend all the Wise Reasons of
Providence; and how impious it is, to reproach and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
what we do not and cannot understand.</p>
               <p>We all know the History of <hi>Iob,</hi> and the Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and his three Friends. God exercised <hi>Iob</hi> with
very severe and amazing Sufferings, for the Trial of his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50615:48"/>
Vertue; his Friends conclude from his great Sufferings,
That tho his life were visibly very innocent and vertuous,
yet he had been a secret Hypocrite, because God did not
use to punish good men, but only the wicked in such a
manner. On the other hand, <hi>Iob</hi> justifies his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and asserts more truly, That bad men were many
times very prosperous, and good men great sufferers in
this world: He complains very tragically of his sufferings,
and that he could not understand the reason why God dealt
thus with him; and this seems to be <hi>Iob</hi>'s fault, that he
insisted too much on his own Justification, and instead of
vindicating the Divine Providence, seems to accuse God
of a causeless and unaccountable Severity; for which <hi>Elihu</hi>
so severely reproved him. At last, God answers <hi>Iob</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as he had often desired he would; but instead of a
particular Justification of his Providence, or of giving
<hi>Iob</hi> the Reasons for which he had thus afflicted him, he
gives him some sensible Proofs of his own Great and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Wisdom and Power in the Works of Nature,
which <hi>Iob</hi> was so far from being able to imitate, that he
could not understand how they were done: The Force of
which Argument is this, That so weak and ignorant a
Creature as Man is, ought not to censure the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
how mysterious and unaccountable soever it be;
when the very Works of Nature convince us, That God
is infinitely Wiser and more Powerful than we are: This
should teach us great Modesty and Humility, to adore the
Divine Judgments, not to censure what we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
for the Power and Wisdom of God can do great
and excellent things, above our understandings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vain man would be wise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11. Job 12.</note> 
                  <hi>tho man be born like a wild asses
colt.</hi> They are impatient to think, that God should do any
thing which they cannot understand, and yet there is not
any one thing in Nature, which they do understand: And
if we cannot understand the Mysteries of Nature, why
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50615:48"/>
should we expect to understand all the unsearchable Depths
and Mysteries of Providence? If the Wisdom of God be
unsearchable, why should we not allow his Wisdom in
Governing the World, to be as unsearchable as his Wisdom
in Making it? For an Incomprehensible Wisdom will do
Incomprehensible Things, whatever it employs its self
about; and when we know, that if the world be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at all, it is governed by an Infinite and Incomprehensible
Wisdom, there is no reason to wonder that there are many
Events of Providence which we cannot fathom, and much
less reason to deny a Providence, because we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Reasons of all Events.</p>
               <p>But this is a matter of such vast consequence, to silence
the Sceptical Humour of the Age, and to shame those
trifling and ridiculous Pretences to Wit and Philosophy, in
Censuring the Wisdom and Justice of Providence, that it
deserves a more particular Discourse: For could we make
men confess, what all modest considering men must blush
to deny, That the Wisdom of God is unsearchable, this
would put an end to all the Disputes about Providence, and
teach us humbly to Adore and Reverence that Wisdom,
which we cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>And to prepare my way to give such full satisfaction in
this matter, as you may securely acquiesce in, without
Disputing the Reasons of Providence, or being tempted
to Deny a Providence, when you meet with any Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
too hard for you, I shall show you how impossible it
is that is should be otherwise, both from the Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and our own great Ignorance of things,
which makes the Providence of God in many cases so much
above our understandings, that we are not capable of such
knowledge.</p>
               <p>And 1. I shall show you, What reason we have secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to acquiesce in the unsearchable Wisdom of Providence,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50615:49"/>
and to trust God beyond our own knowledge, because we
are certain that Infinite Wisdom can never err, or mistake,
or do wrong. 2. That the Wisdom of Providence must
be as unsearchable and unaccountable to us, as the Wisdom
of the Creation. 3. That the wise Government of the
world requires secret and hidden Methods of Providence;
and therefore at least in this present state we ought not to
expect or desire a particular account or reason of all events.
4. That our ignorance of other matters, the knowledge
of which is absolutely necessary to understand the reasons
of Providence, makes us utterly uncapable of such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in this state. 5. I shall enquire in what cases this is
a reasonable answer to all Difficulties, <hi>That the judgments
of God are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That Infinite Wisdom, how unsearchable and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
soever its ways are, can do no wrong. As I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
before, that God's Absolute Power is Absolute
Rectitude and Justice; so all men must grant, that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and Perfect Wisdom is always in the right; for to be
in the wrong is Ignorance and Mistake. If Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
will always judge, and chuse, and act wisely, it is
then impossible that Infinite Wisdom should ever do
wrong; for to do wrong, is either not to judge, or not to
chuse wisely. In Scripture all kind of Wickedness is called
Folly, and Sinners Fools, and to learn Wisdom is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
as the only remedy against Vice; <hi>The fear of the Lord
that is wisdom; and to depart from evil, that is understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
And the reason and nature of things proves it must
be so; for all men who do wickedly, must either mistake
their Rule, or mistake their Interest; must either call Vice
Vertue, and Vertue Vice, or think to make themselves
happy by being wicked; which is a stupid ignorance of the
nature and the natural effects and consequences of things.
Now if all Wickedness be Ignorance and Folly, Infinite
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50615:49"/>
and Perfect Wisdom must be perfect Rectitude, Justice,
and Goodness; it can never do any wrong, because it can
never be ignorant of what is right.</p>
               <p>And what greater security can creatures possibly have,
That in the last issue of things they shall suffer no wrong,
than to know that they are under the Care and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Infinite Wisdom, that can do no wrong? Infinite
Wisdom indeed is incomprehensible to a finite mind, the
methods of it may seem intricate and perplext to us, full of
Mystery and surprizing Events; and thus it must be,
while Infinite Wisdom governs the world, which is so
much above the reach of our most improved and elevated
thoughts: But would not any wise man rather chuse to be
governed by such a perfect and excellent Wisdom, as can
never mistake, tho it vastly exceeds his understanding,
than to be governed by a Being no wiser, or not much wiser
than himself, all whose Counsels he can fathom; and see
to the end of? The more perfect and excellent the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is, the less we can understand it, but the more safe
we are under its conduct: So absurd is it to complain that
we cannot understand all the depths and secrets of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that we may as reasonably complain, That an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and Incomprehensible Wisdom takes care of the
world, and of all the creatures that are in it.</p>
               <p>While we know our selves safe in the hands of Infinite
Wisdom, let us be contented that God should do such
things as we cannot understand the reasons of: Are we
ever the less perfect and happy creatures, because we know
not how God made us, how he formed and fashioned us in
the womb, and breathed into us the breath of life? And
what hurt is it to us, if God preserve and govern the
world, and take care of all the creatures in it, by as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
and incomprehensible a Wisdom, as that which at
first gave being to us? We find our selves wisely made,
tho we know not how God made us; and in the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50615:50"/>
of all, we shall find and feel our selves very happy, if
we follow God, and adhere to him, tho we may not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the reasons of all intermediate Events, nor the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
steps and advances of Providence to make us happy.</p>
               <p>It is great Pride, and as contemptible Folly, to think,
that if there be a God who is infinitely wise, he should
not be able to do things above our understanding, and to
do them very wisely too, tho we do not understand them:
Let men value their understandings never so highly, and
think scorn that any thing should be above their knowledg,
yet it is certain, that there are Ten thousand things both
in the Works of Nature and Providence, which no man
fully understands, and yet which bear the marks and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures
of a most Divine and Admirable Art and Wisdom;
and since whether we will or no we must confess our own
ignorance, why should we not be as well contented to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that God can do such things as are above our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as that there should be such things done, we
know not how, nor by whom? Is it not a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to our understandings, that blind Chance should
do such things as all our Wit and Philosophy cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
than to attribute such Events to the Art and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Infinite Wisdom? Which is most reasonable,
to attribute such works as are above our understandings, to
the Infinite Wisdom of God; or to deny that they had
any wise Cause, because we cannot find out the Causes of
them, tho we can discern such Wisdom in them, as no
Human Art or Wisdom can imitate?</p>
               <p>Indeed the Passion of Admiration, which is implanted
in all men, if it be not utterly vain, is a plain natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
that there is something above our natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
which we must admire, but cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend;
for the proper object of Admiration is Art and
Wisdom, a Wisdom vastly greater than our own; and
therefore if this natural passion have a natural object,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50615:50"/>
it is certain there is a Wisdom greater than our own,
which no human understanding can comprehend; such a
Wisdom as doth <hi>great and wondrous things, and things past
finding out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sum is this; Infinite Wisdom is and must be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conntable;
her ways are unsearchable and past finding out,
and therefore we must be contented in many cases, to be
ignorant of the Reasons of Providence; and we have
great reason to be so since we are so secure that Infinite
Wisdom will always act wisely, and consult the general
good of the world, and the happiness of particular crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
tho by methods secret and incomprehensible to us:
which teaches us not to deny or censure Providence, when
we do not understand the Reasons of it; but in an entire
belief of the Wisdom of God, quietly to submit to all
Events, and to adore and reverence his Judgments with
an implicite Faith.</p>
               <p>2. The better to satisfy us in a profound Veneration of
the Wisdom of Providence, even with respect to the most
unaccountable Passages of it, we must consider, That it is
impossible we should be able to comprehend it: That we
cannot know more of God's Governing the World, than
we do of his Making it: That the unsearchable Wisdom
of God's Works, makes the Wisdom of Providence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
also.</p>
               <p>This is supposed in God's Answer to <hi>Iob,</hi> when to make
him sensible how little he understood of the Wise Ends and
Designs of Providence, he convinced him how ignorant
he was of the Works of Nature, 38, 39, 40, 41. Chapters.
<hi>Who is this that darkneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Gird up now thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee,
and answer thou me: Where wast thou when I laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the earth? declare if thou hast understanding, who
hath laid the measure thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
stretched the line upon it? whereupon are the foundations
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50615:51"/>
thereof fastned? or who hath laid the corner stone thereof?
who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth as if it
had issued out of the womb? Hast thou commanded the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
since thy days, and caused the day-spring to know his place?
Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
where is the plaee thereof? Hast thou entred into the treasures
of the snow? or hast thou known the treasures of the hail?
hath the rain a father? and who hath begotten the drops of
the dew? out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost
of heaven, who hath gendred it?</hi> By these and such like
Questions, expressed in unimitable words, God convinces
<hi>Iob</hi> how ignorant he was of the most common and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Works of Nature; which made it great Presumption
in so ignorant a Creature, to censure the Wisdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
And the Force of the Argument does not only
consist in this, That the very Works of Nature convince
us, that God is infinitely wiser than we are, and can do
great and excellent things which are above our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore that we never ought to censure any thing
that God does, because he is so much wiser than we are,
that we are not competent Judges of what he does, which
is an unanswerable Argument to teach us the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Reverence and the most absolute Resignation of our
selves to God: But the Force of this Argument reaches
farther, That our ignorance of the Works of Nature is
both the Cause and the Proof of our great Ignorance of the
Works of Providence. For no Being can know how to
govern a world, who does not know how to make it; and
he who does not know, how to govern the world himself,
is a very unfit Judge of the Wisdom of Providence, for he
can never know when the world is well and wisely govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because he does not know what belongs to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world.</p>
               <p>The wise government of all creatures must be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to their natures; and therefore without understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50615:51"/>
the Philosophy of Nature, the Springs of Motion,
the mutual dependance of Causes and Effects, what end
things are made for, and what uses they serve, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
know what is fit to be done, nor what can be done, or
by what means it is to be done; and then can never tell
when any thing is done as it should be: We know not
what the Rules, nor what the Ends of God's Government
are, which makes it impossible to judge of the Wisdom
of Government: Without understanding the Natures of
things, we must of necessity make as wild Conjectures
about Providence, as a blind man does of Light and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
As for instance; how is it possible to talk a wise
word about God's Government of Mankind, in what
manner, and by what means he turns their hearts, directs
and influences their counsels, suggests thoughts to them,
and foresees their thoughts, and how they will determine
themselves; when we know so little of the Make and
Frame of our own minds, where the spring of thoughts
is, and how we connect Propositions, and draw conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences;
what the power of the Will is, how we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our selves in indifferent matters, where the balance is
equal? for tho we feel all these Powers in our selves, yet
we know not whence they are, nor how they act.</p>
               <p>And yet how many intricate questions are there, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Disputes of Providence, which are wholly
owing to such Nice Philosophical Speculations, which we
know nothing of, and yet which some men perplex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with, and undertake very gravely to determine.</p>
               <p>Such are the Disputes about Necessity and Fate, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and Predetermination, and the liberty of Human
Actions; which as they are differently determined, make
very different and contrary Hypotheses of Providence;
and either charge God with the Sins of men, or acquit
him from any Partnership in Wickedness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:50615:52"/>
For all these questions at last resolve themselves into this,
How the Mind of man acts and determines it self? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be determined from abroad, from a necessary Train
and Series of Fatal Events, or from the Decrees and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination
or Foreknowledg of God? Or whether it
be a self-moving Being, and determines it self from the
Principles of its own Nature, and its own free Choice?
Now unless we understood the Philosophy, or the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Frame and Composition of our own Minds, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to say any thing to the purpose in this cause, any
farther than our own sense and feeling goes, and that is on
the side of liberty; for unless we are strangely imposed on,
we feel our selves free. But this may satisfy us, that as to
all the Difficulties of Providence, which can be no other
way resolved, but by a knowledge of Nature, we must of
necessity be as ignorant of them, as we are of the nature
of things; and therefore our confessed ignorance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is a good Argument in all such cases, to make us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
modest in Censuring Providence.</p>
               <p>We know enough both of the works of Nature, and
of the works of Providence, to serve all the wise ends and
purposes of living; which is all that is useful for us to
know, and all that God intended we should know; but
the Reasons and Causes of things, belong only to that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which can make and govern a world. We know as
much of Providence as we do of Nature; and would men
set bounds to their Enquiries here, which is as far as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Understandings can reach, we should hear very few
Objections against Providence.</p>
               <p>Our ignorance of Nature, and Natural Causes, and the
Natural Springs of Motion, how things were made, and how
they act, and for what ends they were made, which in
many cases we do but very imperfectly guess at, is a plain
demonstration, That we never ought to admit any Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in Nature as a sufficient Objection against the Being or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50615:52"/>
the Providence of God, in bar to all the Moral Evidence
and Assurance we have of both.</p>
               <p>We have all the Moral Evidence we can have for any
thing, That God governs the world by a Wise, and Holy,
and Free Providence; That he is not the Author of Sin;
That our Wills, at least as far as Vertue and Vice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
are under no Foreign Force and Constraint, but
chuse, and refuse, and determine themselves with a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Liberty: I say, we have undeniable evidence of this,
from the Wisdom, Justice, and Holiness of the Divine
Nature, from the difference between Vertue and Vice,
and the nature of Rewards and Punishments; these things
are plain, and such as we can understand, and such as we
cannot deny with any fair appearance of Reason; but now
all the Arguments against Providence, and for Necessity and
Fate, are mere Philosophical Speculations, which men
vainly pretend to, when it is demonstrable they can know
nothing of them. As for instance; Some tell us, That
it is not a Wise and Free Providence that governs the world,
but that all things come to pass by a Necessary Chain of
Causes, which fatally determine the Will to Chuse and
Act, as these Causes move it. Now whether there be such
a necessary Chain of Causes or not, it is certain no man
can know it, who does not as perfectly understand this
great Machine of the World, and all its Motions, as an
Artist does all the Wheels in a Watch or Clock: nor can
any man know how such a Chain of Causes should move
and determine the Mind of Man, without understanding
the Philosophy of Human Souls, how the Will is moved,
how it is determined, or determines it self; whether by
the Constitution of its Nature it always necessarily chuses
what it chuses, or might have not chose, or have chosen
any thing else: Now whatever other men may do, I'm
sure I know nothing of the Philosophy of these matters,
and therefore they don't concern me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50615:53"/>
Others make God himself to be nothing else but Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Fate, who by Eternal and Irreversible Decrees, as
necessary and essential to him as his own Being, has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
whatever shall come to pass; but no man can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know this, without an Immediate Vision, if I
may so speak, of the Naked Essence of God: His Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
and Moral Perfections give us no notice of such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Decrees; his Wisdom, Holiness, Justice, Goodness,
contain nothing of Fate and Necessity; and those who can
see the very Essence of God to be Fate, must be able to
contemplate his Pure Essence, and to know God after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner than he ever yet manifested himself to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or it may be, than it is possible for God to show
himself to Creatures.</p>
               <p>Others conclude the Fatal Necessity of all Events, from
God's Prescience: for they say, that God can foreknow
things only in his own Decrees; and therefore if God
foreknows all things, all things are decreed; or however,
what God foreknows will come to pass, will certainly and
necessarily come to pass, and therefore all Events are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and necessary, if they are all foreknown by God. But
these are Conclusions which no man can be certain of,
without pretending perfectly to understand the Nature of
Prescience, or how God foreknows things to come; for if
God can foreknow what he has not decreed, and can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
what does not come to pass necessarily, then the
Prescience of God does not infer a Fatality of all Events:
And yet this may be, for ought we know, unless we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
understand the Nature of Prescience, and how God
foreknows things to come, and then we may foreknow
things our selves. The like may be said of God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with his Creatures in all their actions, from
whence they conclude, That the Will of man in all its ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
is determined by God, without whose concourse it
cannot act, nor determine it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:50615:53"/>
These are all Nice Philosophical Speculations, which
creatures who are so ignorant of the Natures of things,
can know nothing of; and therefore they are not fit to be
made Arguments for or against any thing.</p>
               <p>The Sum is this; That since we must confess our selves
so very ignorant of the Works of Nature, without the
knowledg of which in Ten thousand Instances, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to understand the Wisdom of Providence, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and absured for us to demand an account of God's
Providences; but we ought to be satisfied, to leave God
to Govern the World with the same Sovereign and Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Wisdom, which at first gave Being to all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Wise Government of the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
secret and hidden Methods of Providence; and
therefore at least in this state we ought not to expect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
a particular Account or Reason of all Events.</p>
               <p>The Wise-man tells us, <hi>It is the glory of God to conceal a
thing,</hi> 25. Prov. 2. It is the Glory of the Divine Nature,
that it is Incomprehensible by us; and it is the Glory of
the Divine Providence to be Unsearchable; and therefore
many of the Ancient Philosophers and Poets forbid too
curious an Enquiry into the Nature or Providence of God;
and <hi>Sophronius</hi> gives a wise Reason for it, Because we are
all born of Mortal Parents, and therefore the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of an Infinite Immortal Being, must be above us:
Which is much the same Reason that <hi>Zophar</hi> gives, <hi>Vain
man would be wise, tho man be born like a wild asses colt,</hi>
11. Job 12. This is a knowledge too great for our birth,
if our Natural Capacities bear proportion to it; for God
must be a very little Being himself, could he be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by such mean Creatures.</p>
               <p>But that which I at present intend, is only to shew you,
That the Wise Government of the World requires, that
the Divine Counses, that the Events and Reasons of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50615:54"/>
should in a great measure be concealed from us;
and I hope that is a satisfactory reason, why God should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
them, if he can't so wisely govern the world without it.</p>
               <p>I would desire those persons who are so apt to quarrel
at Providence, and to take it so very ill, that God does any
thing which they don't presently understand, to sit down
and agree among themselves, How they would have God
govern the world? What it is that they would be pleased
with? But let them consider well of it before-hand, that
upon second thoughts they don't find more reason to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at their own ways and methods of governing the
world, than they now have to quarrel with Providence;
or that the rest of mankind do not find more reason to
quarrel with them, than they have now to quarrel with
God. As to give an Instance or two of this, by way of
Essay.</p>
               <p>Some seem to be very much discontented at the Uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
and Uncertainty of all Events; that all things are in a
perpetual Flux and Motion; that no man knoweth what
a day or an hour will bring forth: The instability of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which gives and takes away, and every day shews a
new face, and opens new and surprizing Scenes, has been
an old Complaint.</p>
               <p>Well then: Would they have this rectified? Would
they have all the Events of Providence as constant, and
regular, and unchangeable, as the Motions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
as the Returns of Day and Night, of Winter and
Summer? And when they see all things happen thus even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and regularly, will they then promise to believe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?
I mightily suspect that they will be farther from
believing a Providence then, than they are now. We see
that the Regular Motions of the Heavens, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Productions of Nature, which so seldom vary, that
it is thought Portentous and Ominous if they do, cannot
convince them, That God governs the Heavens and the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50615:54"/>
Earth, and all the Works of Nature, as far as all their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Powers move and act uniformly, by constant and
unerring Laws: and if the regular uniformity of Nature
is not thought by these men a sufficient Proof of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
I doubt a constant and uniform round of all Events
would be thought much less so. Those who now resolve
all the uncertain Changes and Revolutions that happen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Necessity and Fate, would have more reason to do so,
did Providence always shew the same face and appearances,
as the Heavens do.</p>
               <p>But can they tell what kind of Uniformity and Stability
of Providence it is, would please them? Would they have
all mens Fortunes equal? That there should be no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between Rich and Poor, High and Low, Princes and
Subjects, the Honourable and the Vile? I believe few of
them would like such a Levelling Providence, which, as
the state of mankind now is, would destroy the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the world, and most of the Pleasures and
Conveniences of Life; and yet without this, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God is not so uniform towards men, as it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
beasts; and those who fare worse than others of the
same nature with them, will still complain.</p>
               <p>If then Providence must not deal alike by all men, do
they mean by the Uniformity and Stability of Providence,
That mens Fortunes, whatever they are, shall always be
the same? That the Rich and Prosperous shall always be
Rich and Prosperous, and the Poor always Poor, and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
and Slaves? Unless these Objectors be all Rich and
Happy, I doubt they will never agree to this; for the
Poor and Miserable must needs think it hard usage to be
always poor, without room for better hopes.</p>
               <p>But such a Stability of Providence as this, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Wise and Just Government of the World; for
how should God restrain and punish Wickedness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and encourage Vertue, if the Rich must always be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50615:55"/>
Rich, and the Poor always Poor? Nay, how can the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God do this, without making men Vertuous
and Vicious too, by Necessity and Fate? When Wantonness
and Prodigality, Idleness and Folly, will spend or lose an
Estate; and Frugality, Prudence and Diligence will get
one. And when all men in this world must not be equal,
does it not more become the Wisdom and Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that mens own Vertues and Vices shall in a great
measure make the distinction, and carve out their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
for them?</p>
               <p>So that when men complain of the Uncertainty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability
of Fortune, as they call it, they complain of they
know not what; and were it put to their own choice what
to have in the room of it, they would not know how to
mend the matter. The wise government of free Agents,
who so often change themselves, requires very frequent,
sudden, surprizing Turns of Providence, the reasons of
which must of necessity be as invisible to us, as the thoughts
of mens hearts, and their most secret intrigues and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;
till we can make men all move alike, as regularly
and uniformly as the Heavenly Bodies do, it is an absurd
and unreasonable complaint, That Providence does not
act regularly, and that the Events of Providence are not
always the same.</p>
               <p>Another great Complaint against Providence is, That
good men are not always rewarded, nor bad men punished
according to their deserts: That many bad men are prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in this world, and some good men great sufferers:
That <hi>all things come alike to all; there is one event to the
righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean, and
to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
as he that feareth an oath,</hi> 9. Eccl. 2. This makes the
Events of Providence very sudden, mysterious, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable;
that no man knows what course to take, to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50615:55"/>
make his life easy and prosperous; for whether he be good
or wicked, he may be happy or miserable, as it happens.</p>
               <p>As for the Objection it self, I shall consider it more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
but at present I will only ask these Objectors, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to remove these Difficulties and Uncertainties of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and that they may the better understand the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all Events, they do in good earnest desire, That God
would reduce this matter to a Certainty, by punishing all
bad men, and rewarding all good men in this world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their deserts? If they do, I must tell them, as
Christ told the two Brethren, who desired that they might
sit one on his Right hand, and the other on his Left, in his
Kingdom, <hi>Ye ask ye know not what:</hi> They ask the most
dangerous thing that could possibly befal mankind; and
what they ask, would be Ten thousand times a greater
Objection against Providence, than what they complain of.
Should every Sinner be punished in this world according
to his deserts, what man is there so just and innocent as to
escape the Divine Vengeance? <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldest mark
iniquity, O Lord, who shall stand!</hi> 130. Psal. 3. Were every
Sinner punished as he deserves, I doubt there would be no
good man left to be rewarded; for where is the man that
doth good, and sinneth not? What room does this leave
for Patience and Forbearance, for the Repentance of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
for God's Pardoning-Grace and Mercy; and what a
Terrible Providence is this? How contrary to all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we have of God, and his kind and gracious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Creatures?</p>
               <p>I grant God may exercise great Patience and Long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
towards sinners; he may forgive the sins of true
Penitents, and yet punish sinners, and reward good men
even in this world; these things are very reconcilable in
God's Government of the world, for thus he does govern
the world; but they are very irreconcilable with such a
Providence and Government as these men desire, which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50615:56"/>
requires a present and visible Punishment of every sin, as
soon as committed; and as present and visible a Reward of
every good action: for unless these Punishments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
are present, all the time they are delayed, bad men
may be prosperous, and good men afflicted; which is their
very Objection against Providence; which can never be
removed, but by speedy and visible Executions, which
leave no place for the Patience and Forgiveness of God, or
for the Repentance of Sinners: And is it not much more
desirable, for ever to be ignorant of the Reasons of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
than to have such Proofs and Demonstrations of
Providence as this?</p>
               <p>Let me desire these unthinking Cavillers at Providence,
to review their Objection over again, and consider what
is the meaning of every word in it, and how upon second
thoughts they like it themselves.</p>
               <p>That they may have a plain and certain Reason of God's
Judgments, they desire that no man may suffer any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Calamity, but only for sin; and that every sinner may
be punish'd in this world according to his deserts; and
then they will believe, That there is a Providence that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
the world; tho it is better for the world that they
should continue Infidels, than be thus convinced. Well
then, who in the first place are these sinners whom they
would have punished? Do they mean every one who does
a wicked action; or every impenitent and incorrigible
sinner?</p>
               <p>If every one who at any time does any wicked action,
must be punished for it, then it is plain that no man can
escape; then there is no place for Repentance or Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but a speedy Vengeance must pursue the sinner; and
God knows, we are all sinners, and must all be punished;
and if this removes one Objection against Providence, I'm
sure it will very much encrease another, from the many
evils and miseries that are in the world, which will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50615:56"/>
more, and much greater, if every sin must receive its
just punishment.</p>
               <p>If they mean only, That impenitent and incorrigible
sinners must be punished, then they must allow, that God
may spare a sinner a great while, and then very great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may be prosperous a great while, and if they repent
at last, may finally escape the Judgments of God; and
then the Prosperity of Sinners can never be an Argument
against Providence, unless they can prescribe to God, just
how long and no longer, he may justly spare sinners.</p>
               <p>It is an easy matter to complain of any thing, and to
start Difficulties and Objections, but it is impossible for
the Wit of man to reduce Providence to such a Certainty
as these men desire: Tho God govern the world by never
such fixed and steady Laws, we can never see it in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Events, so as to be able to assign a reason of all that
good and evil which happens to particular men.</p>
               <p>For would they have God reward every good man, and
punish every wicked man, or reward and punish every
man for the good and evil that he does? There is a great
mixture of good or bad in most men, that for different
reasons they may deserve both Rewards and Punishments;
and tho God knows when it is fit to reward or punish such
men, yet it is impossible we should; and therefore whether
they be rewarded or punished, we can give no account
of it.</p>
               <p>There is also a great mixture of good and bad in most
actions; some very bad actions may not deserve Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as being the effect of Ignorance, or Surprize, or such
invincible Temptations, as Human Nature, without an
extraordinary measure of Grace, cannot conquer; and
there are a great many good actions which deserve no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as being done by Chance, besides the intention of
the doer, or done from a very bad Principle, or for very
bad ends: now we only see the good or evil that is in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50615:57"/>
action, and Human Laws can punish or reward nothing
but what is seen; but I suppose you will not say that God
ought to regard nothing else but the material and visible
action; and then it may be very Wise and Just in God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to punish men for very bad actions, nor to reward
them for very good actions; and this is another Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Events, which men ignorantly complain of.</p>
               <p>Thus some men are guilty of a great many secret sins,
or do a great many good actions, which no man knows of,
but only God and their own Consciences; and when God
visibly rewards or punishes men for the secret good or evil
they have done, the reasons of such rewards or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
must be unknown to us, because the good or evil
for which they are rewarded or punished, is unknown.</p>
               <p>All these things make the Reasons and Events of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
very uncertain and unaccountable to us; and yet
we see there may be very wise Reasons for them, which
we cannot understand, and which no man in his Wits
would desire should be understood.</p>
               <p>For would you desire that every sin you commit should
be immediately punished, without any time to repent,
without any hope of Mercy? Would you have God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and punish as Human Laws do, to consider only
what is done, without making any allowances for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and surprize, or without taking any notice of the
Principles or Ends of our actions? Would you have a
Casement into every man's breast, or have all their secret
Sins or Vertues written upon their Foreheads, that every
man may be as perfectly known to all the world, as he is
to himself? If you do not desire this, you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be ignorant of the Reasons of Providence, of
those good and evil Events which happen to men; why
God punishes one man, and spares or rewards another;
why he does not punish those whom we judge to deserve
Punishment, nor reward those whom we think worthy
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50615:57"/>
of a Reward. God has wise Reasons for all this, but we
cannot understand them; and it is happy for us all that
they are not understood.</p>
               <p>This shews how absurd it is for us to demand a Reason,
and to complain, that we cannot give a Reason of all the
Events of Providence: And I shall only observe this by
the way, That if men would in other cases take the same
course that I have done in this, they would quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how vain and senseless all their Objections against
Providence are: That is, Whatever they object against
Providence, let them turn the other side of it, and try
whether that would be better: Let them consider how
they would have what they call the Defects and Blemishes
of Providence, rectified; and whether it would be more
for the wise and happy Government of the World, if it
were so. I dare challenge the greatest Pretenders to Wit
and Reason, to give any one Instance of this nature, to
name any one thing which they quarrel at, which they
know how to mend: And if the world be so wisely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
already, that those who complain most, can't tell how
any thing could be better done, it is Ridiculous and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to find fault; which are no hard words in such a Cause
as this.</p>
               <p>But this is not all I intend, merely to shew, That this
is an Unreasonable Objection against Providence, That the
Events of it are many times very uncertain, hidden, and
mysterious, and such as we cannot give the particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of; but likewise to satisfy you, That the Wise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Mankind requires it should be so; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to you, The great and excellent Advantages of it.</p>
               <p>Now I suppose you will all grant, That what is most
for the Glory of God, for the advancement of true Piety,
and the Restraints of Wickedness, is the Wisest way of
Governing the World. And if you will grant this, I
doubt not but I shall presently satisfy you, That the Wise
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50615:58"/>
Government of the World requires secret and hidden Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Providence, such uncertain and surprizing Events,
as at least we can give no account of, till it comes to its last
and concluding Issue.</p>
               <p>1. For what is there that excites in us a greater Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God, than to see great and glorious things brought
to pass by a long and winding Labyrinth of surprizing and
perplex'd Events, which we know nothing of, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they tend, till we see where they end? Mankind
never greatly admire what is plain and obvious, and every
man's thought, because there is nothing in it which shews
any extraordinary Contrivance: But when unexpected
Events are brought to pass by unsuspected means, and yet
designed and directed by a steady and unerring Counsel;
When great things are done by such means, as have no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causality to produce such Effects, and therefore can
give no notice nor the least suspicion of what is a-doing;
When our very Fears are turned into Triumphs, and that
which seemed to threaten us with some great evils, is made
the Instrument of some great and surprizing Blessings;
When bad men are ensnared in their own Counsels, and
fall into the Pit which they have digged for others; When
God turns their Curses into Blessings, and saves good men
by the Ministry of those who intended their Ruin: These,
I say, and such like Events, of which there are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Instances both in Sacred and Prophane Story, and
which our own observation may furnish us with fresh
Examples of, justly give us great and admiring thoughts
of the Divine Wisdom; a Wisdom which is to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
and feared, as well as praised; for who would not
fear that God, <hi>who is wise in heart, as well as mighty in
strength? Who hath resisted his will, and prospered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The uncertain Events of Providence, That good
and evil is promiscuously dispenced; That God does not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50615:58"/>
always visibly reward the good, nor punish the wicked,
tho he signally rewards some good men, and as remarkably
punishes some wicked men is the Wisest Method of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Mankind. That some good men are visibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
in this world, is a just Encouragement to good
men to expect the Protection and the Blessing of God in
doing good: That some bad men are made Examples of a
Just and Terrible Vengeance, is a Warning to all bad men
to reverence the Judgments of God, and to stand in awe
of him; and that some bad men are spared, nay, are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
happy, is a good reason for men to repent, and to
hope for Pardon and Forgiveness from so Patient and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
a God.</p>
               <p>The essential difference between good and evil, the
Hopes and Fears of Natural Conscience, the Promises
and Threatnings of Scripture, and the Scripture-Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of those Miraculous Deliverances which God has
wrought for his People, and the Miraculous Destruction
he has brought upon their Enemies, are a plain proof,
That even the external Prosperity of good men, is a Mark
of God's Favour to them; and the external Sufferings and
Calamities of bad men, the effects of his Anger and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:
And then, tho all good men are not so visibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
in this world, nor all bad men punished, yet since
no good men are excepted from God's Promises, nor any
bad men from his Threatnings, the rewards of some good
men is a reason for all good men to hope; and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
executed upon some bad men, is a reason for all bad
men to fear.</p>
               <p>And this is better accommodated to the Nature of Man,
who is a Free Agent, than if God should visibly punish all
bad men, and reward all good men in this world, because
it offers less Force and Violence to men, and leaves them
more to the government of their own free choice. Should
God make such a visible difference between all good and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50615:59"/>
bad men in this world, that all good men should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
and happy, and all bad men miserable, there would
be no more choice left to men, Whether they would be
good or bad; than, Whether they would spend their lives
in Health or Sickness, in Riches or Poverty, in Honour or
Disgrace; but where the Event is not certain, there is room
left for wise Consideration, for Hopes and Fears, which
are the Natural Springs of a Free Choice.</p>
               <p>And besides this; That all good men are not rewarded,
nor all bad men punished in this world, gives us a truer
understanding of the nature of present things, and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expectations of greater Rewards and Punishments here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
We should be too apt to think, that the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this life were the best and greatest things, and
the peculiar Marks of God's Favour, did none but good
men share in them; and were they the portion of all good
men, we should grow very fond of this world, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
think of another, or of exercising such Divine Vertues
as are fitted to that state: Nay, we should want the best
Moral Argument for another Life, That all good men are
not rewarded, nor all bad men punished in this world,
which gives a reasonable expectation of another life.</p>
               <p>But when we see bad men prosperous, as well as the
good, and good men suffer as hard things as any bad men
do; this convinces us, That neither the Blessings nor the
Sufferings of this life are the Final Rewards or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of good or bad men: That God has greater Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
reserved for good men, and greater Miseries for the
wicked; which is a greater Incitement to a Divine and
Heavenly Vertue, and a greater Restraint to Wickedness,
than any present Rewards or Punishments can be. So that
this Uncertainty of Events which some men complain of,
and which we can seldom give a reasonable account of,
when we come to particular cases and particular persons,
is so far from being a Defect in Providence, that it is the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50615:59"/>
wisest Method of Governing Mankind, both considered
as a Free Agent, and as an Immortal Creature, who
must live in another world, when he removes out of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> This Uncertainty of all Events, is the trial and
exercise of many admirable Graces and Vertues, which
there would be no place for, with respect to this world,
were the Events and Reasons of Providence known and
certain: Such as Faith, and Hope, and Trust, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on God, which there would be little use of in
this world, were all good men immediately rewarded; for
they all respect absent, unseen, unknown Events. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and Sufferings, which in Scripture are called
Temptations, are the trials of Vertue: When we serve
God without any prospect of a present reward; and trust
in him, and depend on him, when we are forsaken of all
other hopes; when we say with <hi>Iob, Tho he slay me, yet
will I trust in him;</hi> or with the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, 3. 17, 18.
Altho the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the
vines, the labour of the olive shall fail, and the field shall yield
no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall
be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy
in the God of my salvation.</hi> And yet if we knew in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the particular Reasons of Providence, and what the
end and conclusion of them would be, they would be no
trials of our Faith, and Submission to God: The Faith
and Patience of <hi>Iob</hi> was wonderful, but the greatest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in all he suffered was, that he could not possibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what God meant and intended, in bringing all
those Calamities on him; but had he known, that this
was only a trial of his Patience and Vertue, and that God
would reward these sufferings with a very long and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Life, with a new increase of Children, and new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Riches and Honour, this had been no difficulty,
no trial, any more than the smart of his present sufferings;
but <hi>Iob</hi> knew nothing of all this, and therefore did great
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50615:60"/>
Glory to God, and made himself an admirable Example
of Faith and Patience to the world; and God made him
as great an Example of the Rewards of Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
Were the Events of Providence as constant, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and certain, and the Reasons of all Events as known
and visible as some men would have them, and complain
that they are not, there would be no exercise of some of
the greatest Vertues of the Christian Life, which do most
Honour to God, and are the greatest Ornaments and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Human Nature: Which evidently proves,
That the Uncertainty and Obscurity of the Events of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that we know not what shall be, nor in many
cases the Reasons of what we see, is necessary to the Wise
Government of Mankind, and therefore is no Defect, but
the Beauty and Perfection of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are necessarily ignorant of a great many
things, without the knowledge of which it is impossible
for us to understand the Reasons of Providence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought no more to complain that we are ignorant
of the Reasons of Providence, than we do of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of other matters, without the knowledge of which
the Reasons of Providence cannot be known; as to name
some few of them:</p>
               <p>1. We are very ignorant of Men, as I observed before:
We know not their hearts, and thoughts, and counsels, we
see little of their private Conversation, we cannot look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Closets and secret Retirements; and unless we
knew better what men are, it is impossible we should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Reasons of God's Providence towards them.
Now tho as to external appearances, there is some truth in
this Objection, That bad men are oftentimes very prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and good men afflicted in this world; yet I doubt not
but when this Objection is applied to the Prosperity or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50615:60"/>
of particular men, where it is once applied right,
it is a hundred times applied wrong; especially as to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of good men: For we very often take those for
good men, who are not so, and who many times pluck off
their disguise themselves, and convince the world, that
they are not so; and yet if any misfortune or adversity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
such men before they are known, we are apt to wonder
that God should afflict such good men as they are, and
think it a great difficulty in Providence; when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
know that they deserve all that they suffer, and a
great deal more.</p>
               <p>Nay, I believe there is not a good man in the world,
who knows himself, and impartially observes his own
thoughts, and passions, and actions, but knows a reason
why God at any time afflicts him; knows how he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it, and how he wants it, and can justify the greatest
severities of Providence towards himself: I am sure, all
the good men in Scripture do so, excepting <hi>Iob;</hi> they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
confess and bewail their sins, and acknowledge the
Justice and Mercy of God in what they suffer; and as for
<hi>Iob,</hi> all that he insists on, is to justify his own Uprightness
and Integrity, that he was no secret Hypocrite, as his
Friends uncharitably accused him; that he knew nothing
so bad of himself, as to deserve such amazing Sufferings as
God had brought on him: And indeed, <hi>Iob</hi>'s Case was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
peculiar; and it appeared in the conclusion, that God
did not punish him for some unknown wickedness, but to
exercise his Faith and Patience, and to make him a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Triumphant Example of a firm adherence to God
under the severest Trials.</p>
               <p>Now when there is no good man in the world, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own account can charge God with afflicting him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what his sins deserve, or the state of his Soul requires,
we have reason to think, that there is very little truth in
this Objection; that did we know other good men as well
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50615:61"/>
as we know our selves, we should as well understand the
reason why God afflicts them, as why he afflicts us; and if
there be a wise and just reason for the sufferings of good
men, whatever their sufferings are, they can be no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against Providence.</p>
               <p>And it is very often seen, that some men are thought
wicked, as wrongfully and ignorantly as others are thought
good: It is a very little matter that will give men a bad
Character in a Censorious World; a different Opinion in
Religion, or some external Modes of Worship; nay, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Interests, and State-Factions; nay, some private
Quarrels and Animosities, will make some men paint each
other as black as Hell can make them, and then quarrel
with Heaven if it does not revenge their Quarrels, and
execute that Vengeance which they doom each other to.</p>
               <p>And as for others, who with more reason are thought
bad men, as guilty of known Immoralities, yet they may
have a great deal of good in them, many Generous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Social Vertues, which may make them very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
men in a Commonwealth; and they may do so much
good, as in the opinion of mankind may deserve some Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Rewards, as may deserve Publick Trusts and Publick
Honours; and it is very hard to reproach Providence with
the Prosperity of such men, which we our selves think
well bestowed, notwithstanding their other Vices: And
other bad men may have some secret and latent Principles
of Vertue, which deserve to be cherished; and when this
is, God alone knows; but if we knew it, we should have
no reason to quarrel with the Kindness and Patience of
God to such men, which is intended to lead them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
And as for profligate sinners who are at open
defiance with God, it is seldom seen but that some remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Vengeance at one time or other overtakes them, and
vindicates the Justice of Providence in their Confusion.
So easy were it to justify the Providence of God, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50615:61"/>
good and bad men, did we sufficiently know men.
And our ignorance of men makes it a very foolish and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
Objection; for if instead of answering it, we should
deny the truth of the Objection, they have no way to
prove it. Should we assert, That all good men are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all bad men punished, who deserve to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or punished in this world, they have no way to disprove
this, but by plain matter of Fact; by shewing some good
men afflicted, who deserve a reward, and some bad men
prosperous, who deserve to be punished: Now this they
can never do, without pretending to know what is in man,
to see their Inside, to be acquainted with all their Secrets;
in a word, to know Men as God knows them: For tho
some men are afflicted, whom we think good men, and it
may be are so, and some bad men are prosperous, yet there
may be such a mixture of evil and good in these good and
bad men, which we cannot see, as may make it very wise
and just in God to afflict these good men, and to prosper
the wicked; and since we cannot possibly know these
things, it becomes us to be very modest in censuring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> We are in most cases very ignorant also of the
Counsels and Designs of Providence: We seldom know in
any measure, what God is a doing in the world; and then
it is impossible for us to understand the admirable Wisdom
of all those intermediate Events, which tend to unknown
ends. In the best-contrived Plot there will always be some
Scenes full of nothing but Mystery and Confusion, till the
End explains them, and then we admire the Skill and Art
of the Poet.</p>
               <p>Now the great Obscurities and Difficulties of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
are in such intermediate Events, before we know
what God intends by them. As to give an Instance or two
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50615:62"/>
Had we heard no more of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but that he was sold by
his Brethren into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there falsly accused by a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Mistress, and cast into Prison, we should have thought
that God had dealt very hardly with him; but when we
understand that all this was the way to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Throne,
there is no man but would be contented to be a <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Story of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Afflictions strikes Terror and
Astonishment into all that hear them: <hi>Iob</hi> himself knew
not what account to give of his Sufferings, and his Friends
gave a very bad one, by falsly and uncharitably accusing
<hi>Iob</hi> of some unknown Wickedness, to vindicate God's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
towards him; and we should have been as much
puzzl'd with it to this day, had we not been acquainted
with the Reason of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Sufferings, and with that long
and great Prosperity wherewith God rewarded his Faith
and Patience; and now no man thinks the Sufferings of
<hi>Iob</hi> any Difficulty in Providence, much less any Objection
against it.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with reference to single men; when we see
only a Scene or two of their lives, we may meet with such
prosperous or adverse Events, as we cannot account for;
but could we see from the beginning to the end, in most
cases the Divine Providence would justify it self.</p>
               <p>But then the hidden and Mysterious Designs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
relating to Churches and Kingdoms, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
so many great and wonderful Revolutions; the
Translations of Empires; the removing the Gospel from
one Countrey, and planting Churches in others, where
there were none before; the Increase and Flourishing
State of Religion in one Age, and its great Declension
and almost total Eclypse in another; those surprizing
Changes which may be observed in the Genius, Tempers,
and Inclinations of Princes and People in several Ages;
the unaccountable Beginnings of War, and the as
unaccountable Successes, and unaccountable End of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50615:62"/>
it; the long Prosperity of Persecuting Tyrants, and their
sudden Fall; These, and such like Events, must needs
be very obscure and unknown to us, who know not what
God aims at in all this, nor what Designs he is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on.</p>
               <p>The Designs of Providence many times reach from one
Age to another, nay, do not come to perfection in many
Ages, and yet have all a mutual dependance and relation
to each other, and are subservient to some last great End.
The Prophesies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
as Mysterious Books as they are, and as difficult as it is to
apply the several parts of them to their particular Events;
yet thus much is plain in them, That there is a long Series
and Chain of Events, which reach from Age to Age, with
Infinite Turnings and Variety of Wisdom, directed by a
steady and unerring Counsel, to some Unknown, but Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Conclusion. And when the Divine Counsels are so
deep and mysterious, and so far out of our sight; when
we see so little a part of what God does, and know not
what end God aims at in it, how impossible is it, that we
should understand the reason of particular Events? Had
we a certain and particular History of what God has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
done, and could we certainly understand the Prophesies
of what is still to be done in every Age, and in all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages; that we could have one View of Providence from
the Beginning to the End, we should be more competent
Judges of the Wisdom, Beauty, and Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
but when our Accounts of what is past are so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and uncertain, and our Knowledge of what is to
come much more imperfect than of what is past; when
we know so little of our own Age, of our own Countrey,
of our own Neighbourhood, it is as impossible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Reasons of Providence, as it is to understand the
wise Contrivance and Design of a Comedy, by reading one
Act, or it may be but one Scene of that Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:50615:63"/>
This is certain, that we can never understand the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Providence, without understanding the Counsels of
God, and for what end every thing is designed; for every
thing is well or ill contrived, as it serves the end for which
it is intended; and therefore we may as reasonably pretend
to understand all the secret Counsels of God, as all the
Reasons of Providence: This very Reason St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives,
why the Providence of God is so unsearchable, 11. <hi>Rom.
33, 34. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God; how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the
Lord, or who hath been his Counsellor?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> We are very ignorant also of the state of the other
world, and while we are so, it is impossible we should be
able thoroughly to comprehend the Reason of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in this world.</p>
               <p>It is a vain thing to talk of Providence, without taking
the other world into the account. Were there no other
life after this, it were not worth the while to dispute, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a Providence, or not; for whether there be
or be not a Providence, things are as they are; and if Death
put an end to us, it is of no great consequence which is
truest. The only reason why some men so zealously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
against a Providence, is because they are unwilling to
believe that there is a God, or another world; and the
reason why we so zealously contend for a Providence, is
to support our selves against all cross Events, with the
Care and Protection of a Wise and Good God at present,
and with the Hopes of a more Blessed and Happy Life
hereafter. So that in truth this Dispute is not so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against Providence, as against the Being of God,
and another Life; and therefore both these must be taken
into the account, when they make their Objections against
Providence, or all their Arguments signify nothing: As
for Instance,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:50615:63"/>
It is not enough for them to say, and to prove too, That
there are such Difficulties in Providence (for the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of Providence are their great Objection) as no
man can give a reasonable account of; but that there are
such Difficulties as Infinite Wisdom it self cannot account
for; for tho there may be many Difficulties which we
cannot particularly answer (as all wise men acknowledge
that there are), yet unless they can positively prove, That
Infinite Wisdom it self cannot answer these Difficulties,
the world may still be governed by an Infinitely Wise
Being; and it is demonstrable, that they can never prove
this; for nothing less than Infinite Wisdom, can tell what
Infinite Wisdom knows, and what Difficulties it can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
Which shews how vain all these Arguments against
Providence are, which at last resolve themselves into the
Ignorance of Human Understandings: That there is no
Providence, because we see such things done in the world,
which, for ought we know, Infinite Wisdom can give very
wise Reasons for, but we can't.</p>
               <p>Thus to come to the business in hand: It is not enough
to prove, That there are such Difficulties in Providence,
as we can give no account of, if there be no other life after
this: but they must positively prove, That there are such
Difficulties as the next world can give no account of.</p>
               <p>All men must acknowledge this to be very reasonable;
for if there be another life after this, it is evident, that the
Reasons of Providence must in many cases be wholly fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the other world. If we must live in another
world when we remove out of this, then this life is but
one short Scene of Providence, and the government of
Mankind in this world, is chiefly in order to the next; and
then the Reasons of God's government also must relate to
the next world: And if we must judge of the Providence
of God by its relation to the next world, it will give a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Answer to all the Difficulties of Providence, and give
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50615:64"/>
us a satisfactory Reason why we must not expect to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all the particular Passages of Providence in this
world.</p>
               <p>The general Answer is this, That all the seeming Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
of Providence in this world, will be rectified in
the next; and when we see this done, we shall then see
the Wisdom of what we now call the Irregular and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick
Motions of Providence. It is certain this may be
so, and no man can prove it can't be so; and if we had no
other Evidence for it, the reason and nature of things, upon
the supposition of the other world, makes it highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that it will be so.</p>
               <p>All men who believe another world, believe also that
good men shall be greatly rewarded, and the wicked puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the next life; and we Christians are assured that it
shall be so, by the express Revelations of Scripture; that
good men shall be eternally rewarded in Heaven, and bad
men eternally punished in Hell-fire: And it is wonderful
to me, that any Christians who profess to believe this,
should puzzle themselves about the Difficulties of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
for what Difficulties are there, which Eternal
Happiness and Eternal Miseries will not answer?</p>
               <p>The great Prosperity of bad men, especially when they
openly defy God and Religion, and oppress all within their
power, and persecute the true Disciples of Christ, and do
all the mischief they can in the world; and the Poverty
and Disgrace, Persecutions and Sufferings of good men,
are thought great Difficulties in Providence; but could
these Objectors but look into the next world, and see <hi>Dives</hi>
tormented in Flames, and hear him beg only for a Drop of
Water to cool his Tongue; could they see <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Bosom, no longer begging an Alms, but entertain'd
with all the Delights of Paradise: Could they see the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of Tyrants, Persecutors, and Oppressors, and
the Glorious Crowns of Martyrs, would they then any
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50615:64"/>
longer complain of Providence? Would they think God
too kind to bad men, or too hard and severe to the good?</p>
               <p>If the final Rewards and Punishments of good and bad
men are reserved for the next world, there is no difficulty
at all in the Prosperity of some bad men, and the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the good in this world; for they are not intended
so much for Rewards and Punishments, as for Methods of
Discipline and Government; that the Justice of God is
not so much concerned in it, as the Wisdom of Providence;
which we who know not what belongs to the government
of the world, are very unfit judges of. This leaves room
for God, as his own Infinite Wisdom shall direct, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
great Patience and Long-suffering towards bad men,
to make them the Ministers and Executioners of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon a wicked world, or to lead them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and to correct the sins and follies of good men, to
rectify the temper of their minds, to govern their passions,
to exercise and improve their Graces and Vertues; in a
word, to make bad men good, and to make good men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and to serve the wise ends of his Government and
Providence by both.</p>
               <p>So that the belief of another world, gives a general An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to all the Difficulties of Providence; and it does not
become a Christian to call any thing a Difficulty in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which the other world will answer. That there
are such Difficulties as we can give no account of without
another life, we all acknowledge, and know that it must
be so; for if this life have a relation to the next, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Providence in many cases must of necessity be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the next world; and therefore when an Atheist
disputes with a Christian against Providence, if he will
say any thing to the purpose, he must dispute against
Providence, upon the supposition of another life, and prove
that the Eternal Rewards and Punishments of the next
world, cannot vindicate the Wisdom and Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50615:65"/>
in this. This is the true state of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy;
and bring them to this Issue, and they will find little to
say, which will give any trouble to a wise man to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>But after all, we must confess, That we know so little
of the other world, that it is impossible for us to give a
particular reason of every passage of Providence, which
relates to the next world.</p>
               <p>I say, which relate to the next world, which are the
greatest difficulties of all to good men. The belief of
another life will answer all the Difficulties of Providence
which concern this life; but those Difficulties which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the state of the other world, it cannot answer; but
then there is a plain reason why we cannot answer such
Difficulties, <hi>viz.</hi> Because we do not know enough of the
state of the other world, to say any thing to them; and
therefore we ought not to trouble our selves about them
here, but to stay till we come into the next world; and
then it is very probable they will be no Difficulties.</p>
               <p>I shall instance in one very great one, and that is the state
of Religion in this world; which is no Objection against
Providence with respect to this life, but the whole Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of it relates to the next life. That since all men have
Immortal Souls, and must be happy or miserable for ever,
God should for so many Ages suffer the whole World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the <hi>Iews,</hi> to live in Ignorance, and in <hi>Pagan</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and Superstition: That Christ came so late into the
world to reveal the True God, and to publish the Gospel
to them; and that so great a part of the World still are
<hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> nay, that so little a part of the
Christian World retain the True Faith and Worship of
Christ: This is Ten thousand times a greater Difficulty
than any present evils and calamities, because the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of it reach to Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:50615:65"/>
But then the whole Difficulty is no more than this, That
we know not what the condition of such men is in the
other world, who lived in invincible ignorance of the
True God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ in this. This
we confess we do not know, but believe so well of God,
that we are verily perswaded, could we see what their state
is in the other world, we should see no reason to quarrel
with the Justice or Goodness of God upon their account.
And have we any reason then to quarrel with God, only
because we know not how he deals with the ignorant Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
in the next world? If we knew how God dealt
with these men, and knew that he dealt hardly by them,
as far as we could judge, this would be a difficulty; but
what Difficulty is there in knowing nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
For if we know nothing of it, we ought to say and
judg nothing of it neither. Men must be very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to quarrel with God, who will raise Objections
from what they confess they know nothing of; and yet
I cannot guess how they should know any thing of the
state of ignorant Heathens in the next world, since the
Scripture says nothing of it; and yet this can be known
only by Revelation, for we cannot look into the other
world.</p>
               <p>The plain truth of the case is this: Some men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Authority of Scripture, confidently affirm, That
ignorant Heathens shall suffer the same Condemnation
which Christ has threatned aginst wilful Infidels, and
wicked Christians; and then it may well be thought a great
Difficulty, That God should as severely punish men for
not knowing Christ, when he was never preached to them,
and they had no other possible way of knowing him, as
he will punish those who have had the Gospel of Christ
preached to them, but refused to believe in him, or have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the Faith of Christ, but lived very wickedly. This,
I confess, is a great Difficulty, but it is a Difficulty of their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50615:66"/>
own making; and I should think it much more safe for our
selves, and much more honourable for God, to confess our
Ignorance of such matters as we have no possible way to
know, and to refer all such unknown Cases to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Justice, and Goodness of God, than to pretend to
know what we cannot know, and from thence to raise such
Objections as we cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Whatever Difficulties immediately relate to the state of
the other world, we must be contented should remain Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
till we go thither; for we know so little in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
about the other world, that it is impossible we should
be able either to satisfy our selves or others in such matters;
but these are not properly Difficulties in Providence; for
they do not so much concern the government of this
world, as of the next.</p>
               <p>Thus I have at large shewn, not only, That the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power of God makes him Unaccountable, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Lord of the World; but, That his Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is above the comprehension of our Narrow Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings;
he is not bound to give any account of all the
Wise Designs of his Providence, and we are not capable
of receiving it.</p>
               <p>This indeed is so plain at the first hearing, to all men who
believe God to be Infinitely Wise, and are sensible of their
own Ignorance, that I should have been ashamed to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
so long on it, did not all men know, who know any
thing of this Dispute, That most of the Objections against
Providence, are owing wholly to this cause, That men
will not allow God to do what they cannot understand:
And the best way I could take to teach these men more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
in censuring Providence, was to shew them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
That if God govern the world wisely, there are a
thousand things which they must of necessity be ignorant
of, and then it can be no Objection against the Wisdom,
Justice, and Goodness of God in governing the world,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50615:66"/>
that they cannot in many cases give a satisfactory account
of the Particular Reasons of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let us now enquire in what cases this is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Answer to all the Difficulties of Providence, That
God <hi>giveth no account of his matters;</hi> That <hi>the judgments
of God are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.</hi> And
there is great reason for this Enquiry, that no man may
presume to attribute any thing to God, which can never
be reconciled with the common Notions of Good and Evil,
Just and Unjust, upon this pretence, That the Ways and
Judgments of God are unsearchable and unaccountable,
and that we ought not to demand a reason of them.</p>
               <p>That there are such men in the world, is sufficiently
known to those who understand any thing of some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Controversies in Religion. I need instance at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
only in the Doctrine of Eternal and Absolute Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Reprobation, on which a great many other such
like unaccountable Doctrines depend: That God created
the far greatest part of mankind on purpose to make them
eternally miserable; or at least, as others state it, That he
Order'd and Decreed, or which is the same thing, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Permitted the Sin and Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might
glorify his Mercy in chusing some few out of the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mass of Mankind to be Vessels of Glory, and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
his Justice in the Eternal Punishment of all others,
even of Reprobated Infants, as involved in the Guilt of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin. Now thus far, I confess, they are in the right,
that these are very unaccountable Doctrines; for to make
creatures on purpose to make them miserable, is contrary
to all the Notions we have of Just and Good.</p>
               <p>But tho we readily confess, That the Ways and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God are unsearchable, yet men must not think
upon this pretence to attribute what they please to God,
how absurd, unreasonable, unjust, soever it be, and then
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50615:67"/>
shelter themselves against all Objections, by resolving all
into the Unaccountable Will and Pleasure of God; for
God has no such Unaccountable Will as this is, to do such
things as manifestly contradict all the Notions which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
have of good and evil.</p>
               <p>We find in Scripture, That God abhors all such Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
as these, as infinitely injurious to him; and appeals
to the common Notions of what is Just and Equal, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the general Rules of his Providence. The whole <hi>18th.</hi>
Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is a plain proof of this; where God
complains of that Proverb, as reflecting upon the Justice
and Equity of his Providence;<note place="margin">V. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The fathers have eaten sowre
grapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the childrens teeth are set on edge:</hi> That is, that
the Children are punished for the sins of their Fathers.
How unreasonable an Imputation this is, God proves
from that Equal Right which he hath in Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">V. 4.</note>
which will not admit of such Partiality: <hi>Behold, all
souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of
the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall dye:</hi> And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
this to be the general Rule of his Providence, That
a good man who does what is just and right, shall surely
live; That if he beget a wicked son, his son shall surely
dye; and if this wicked son beget a just and righteous son,
he shall live:<note place="margin">V. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father,
neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness
of the wicked shall be upon him.</hi> That if the wicked man
turn from his wickedness, he shall live, and if the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man turn from his righteousness, he shall dye; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to them to judge, whether this be not equal: <hi>Yet ye
say,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 25, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>The way of the Lord is not equal; Hear now, O house of
Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This plainly proves, That all the administrations of
Providence are very just and equal; and that to attribute
any thing to God which contradicts the common Notions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50615:67"/>
of Justice and Righteousness, is a very great Reproach to
him, and is thought so by God himself: And therefore
when the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> complained of the Prosperity
of bad men, as a great difficulty in Providence, he lays
this down in the first place as an unshaken Principle, That
God is very Just and Righteous: <hi>Righteous art thou, O
Lord, when I plead with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy
judgments; wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?
wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</hi>
12. Jer. 1.</p>
               <p>This very Complaint, That there are great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in Providence; That <hi>the ways and judgments of
God are unsearchable, and past finding out;</hi> is a plain proof,
that all mankind expect from God, that he should govern
the world with great Justice and Equity; for otherwise,
(tho such a Providence it self would be a great Difficulty)
there could be no Difficulties in Providence, if God were
not by the Holiness and Justice of his own Nature obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to observe the Eternal and Immutable Laws of Justice
and Righteousness in governing the world: For upon this
supposition, What could the unaccountable Difficulties of
Providence be? Is it that we observe such Events as we
know not how to reconcile with the common Rules of
Justice? And what then? This is no Difficulty, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable,
if God observes no Rules of Justice in his
Government; if he act by such an unaccountable Will as
has no Law or Rule; by such a Will as regards not what
we call right and just, but makes every thing just it wills.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty and Unsearchableness of Providence,
consists not in the Rules of Providence, but in the Events;
not in reconciling the Rules of Providence to the common
Notions of Justice and Righteousness, but in reconciling
some Events to the acknowledged Justice and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God's Government. This is the Atheists Objection
against God's governing the world, because they think
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50615:68"/>
that the world is not justly and wisely governed; and
tho we can vindicate the Providence of God, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great many difficult and unaccountable Events which
the Atheists object, yet we can never vindicate the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God against Unjust and Arbitrary Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which the reason of all mankind conclude to
be arbitrary and unjust: As for Instance:</p>
               <p>Tho we see good men afflicted, and wicked men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous,
and it may be can give no particular account why
this good man is afflicted, and such a wicked man prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
yet we can vindicate the Wisdom and Justice of
Providence notwithstanding this; and the Unsearchable
Wisdom of God, is a good answer to it: But should any
man turn this into a Rule of Providence, That by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
and Unaccountable Will of God some good men
shall be finally miserable, and some bad men shall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
happy, this we can never vindicate, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
the common Notions of Justice and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And tho we cannot always judge of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Justice of a particular Event, yet we can judge
of the Rules and abstracted Notions of Justice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>
               <p>Thus God had often threatned the <hi>Iews,</hi> That he would
visit on them not only their own sins, but the iniquities of
their Fathers; which in some cases may be very wise and
just; of which more hereafter; but when by an ignorant
or spiteful mistake, they turned this into an unjust Proverb,
which all men acknowledged to be unjust, God declared
his Abhorrence of it; <hi>What mean ye, that ye use this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
concerning the land of Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18. Ezek. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>saying, The fathers have
eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge?</hi>
As if Children who had never eaten sowre Grapes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
should have their teeth set on edge by their Fathers
eating them; that is, that those who had not deserved to
be punished for their own sins, should yet be punished for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50615:68"/>
their Fathers sins: This appears manifestly unjust, and
God himself rejects it, as a Reproach to his Providence:
And how difficult soever some passages of Providence
may be, we must own no Rules of Providence which are
manifestly unjust.</p>
               <p>Thus it is too certain, that much the greatest part of
mankind will be finally miserable; and this is very recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
to the Justice of God, if the greatest part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are very wicked, and deserve to be miserable: But to
say, That God created the greatest part of mankind, nay,
that he created any one man under the Absolute Decree of
Reprobation; that he made them to make them miserable,
can never be justified by the Unaccountable Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God, because it is notoriously unjust, if mankind
are competent Judges of what is just and unjust.</p>
               <p>The Sum is this: That the Providence of God is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable,
Incomprehensible, Unaccountable, is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to attribute any thing to God, which when reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
abstracted Notions and general Rules of action, is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
unjust; but the true use of it is to reverence the
Judgments of God, and not to charge any particular Events
of Providence with Injustice, merely because we do not
understand the reasons of them. The general Notions
and Rules of Justice are not unaccountable things, for we
understand very well what they are; for Justice is the same
thing in God and Men; but the unsearchable Wisdom of
God can do a great many things wisely and justly, which
our narrow minds cannot comprehend the Wisdom and
Justice of. Now this makes Infinite Wisdom a sufficient
reason why we should acquiesce in the Wisdom and Justice
of Providence, notwithstanding such Events as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand the reasons of: But an Unaccountable Will,
which acts by no Rules of Justice, as far as we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what Justice means, can give no reasonable satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to any man; for it is no reason to be satisfied with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50615:69"/>
Providence, That God does such things by a Sovereign
and Arbitrary Will, as the reason of mankind condemns as
unjust; for this does not answer our Complaints, but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
them.</p>
               <p>This is all the Atheist endeavours to prove, and all that
he desires should be granted him, to confute the belief of a
God and a Providence. That God does such things as we
can give no satisfactory account of, does him little service,
because the Unsearchable Wisdom of God answers such
Difficulties; but if we will grant him, That God acts by
such Rules, as all men who judge impartially, according
to the natural notions and the natural sense which we have
of Justice, must think unjust; this is what he would have;
and he will give us leave to talk as much as we please, of
the Arbitrary and Sovereign Will of God, but he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no such God; for this is not the Natural Notion of
a God, to be Arbitrary, but to be Good and Just: And to
say that God is Good and Just, but not Good and Just as
men understand Goodness and Justice, is to say that we
have no Natural Notion of the Goodness and Justice of
God, and then we can have no Natural Notion of a God:
For if the Natural Notion of a God is, That he is Just and
Good; it seems hard to think, that we should have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Notion of a Good and Just God, without having any
Natural Notion what his Justice and Goodness is; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of that, should have such Natural Notions of Justice
and Goodness, as (if we believe what some men say of
God) can never be reconciled with his being Just and
Good.</p>
               <p>This then must be laid down as a standing Rule, That
we must never attribute any thing to God, which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
the Natural Notions which we have of Justice and
Goodness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under a pretence, That God is unaccountable,
and his ways and judgments unsearchable; for it is not
the Will of God, which is always directed by Goodness
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50615:69"/>
and Justice, that is unaccountable, but his Wisdom; not
the standing Rules of his Providence, which are nothing
else but perfect and unerring Justice and Goodness, but
the application of particular Events to these Rules: And
having premised this by way of Caution, I come now
more particularly to consider in what Cases this is a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Answer to all the Difficulties of Providence.</p>
               <p>1. Now in the first place I observe in general, That the
Unsearchableness of the Divine Wisdom in governing the
world, is a reasonable Answer to all difficulties which
have no intrinsick or essential evil in them. Whatever
we see done in the world, if it be possible to imagine any
Cases or Circumstances wherein such a thing may be wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and justly done, we have reason to believe that the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wisdom of God had wise and just reasons for doing it,
tho we know not what they are. For is it not great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
to charge God with doing such things unjustly,
as it is possible might be done for wise and just Reasons?
And yet I challenge all the Atheists in the world, to name
me any one thing which ever God did, that could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
in no Cases or Circumstances whatsoever, be wisely
and justly done.</p>
               <p>The Difficulties of Providence do not consist merely in
external Events; for all external Events may be good or
evil, just or unjust, with respect to their different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Time, or Place, or Person, and the like: And
therefore when we see any thing happen, which as far as
we apprehend the case, seems a difficulty in Providence, if
altering the Case would answer the difficulty, it is only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that God sees the Case to be otherwise than we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it to be, and the Difficulty vanishes: and is not
this very easy and natural to suppose, that God may know
the Case better than we do? And is it not much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to suppose, that we mistake the Case; than to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50615:70"/>
charge the Divine Providence with doing any thing hard or
unjust?</p>
               <p>But to make you sensible of this, I shall explain it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more particularly. Most of the Objections against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
relate to the good or evil that happens to private
Men, or to Publick Societies, to Kingdoms and Common-wealths;
such as the Length or Shortness of our Lives,
Health or Sickness, Poverty or Riches, Honour or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
Famine, Sword, and Pestilence; or the contrary
Blessings of Plenty, Peace, and a wholsome Air; the
Changes and Revolutions of States and Empires; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
Kings, and setting up Kings: Now what of all
this is there, that God can never wisely and justly do?
May not God have very wise and just Reasons for lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some mens Lives, and for shortening others? For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
men Rich or Poor, Honourable or Vile? For tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating
Kingdoms and Empires? For sending Peace or
War, Plenty or Famine? And if all these things can be
wisely and justly done, how can the doing of any of these
things be an Objection against Providence? Yes, you'l say,
such good or evil Events may be wrong applied to persons
who do not deserve them, and then they become unjust;
and so you apprehend they many times are; and this is
the Difficulty of Providence: But now if there be no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in the Events themselves, when there are wise and
just reasons for them, why should we not rather conclude,
That there are wise Reasons for them, when they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and appointed by God? Are not the Natural Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we have of the Divine Justice, a sufficient reason to
believe, that God never does any thing but what is just?
And is not his unsearchable Wisdom, which sees such things
as we cannot see, a sufficient reason to confess, That God
may have wise and just Reasons for what he does, tho we
know them not? This is enough to satisfy all the Friends
of Providence, and to silence its Enemies: For if all those
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50615:70"/>
Events which they think hard or unjust, may be very wise
and just, as the Natural Justice of God is reason to believe
they are, and as the unsearchable Wisdom of God proves
they may be, tho we do not see the Wisdom and Justice of
them; then it is certain, That what may be wise and just,
can be no Argument against the Wisdom and Justice of
Providence: And when we have so many Reasons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Providence, such a <hi>may be</hi> is a reasonable answer to
all such Difficulties as are themselves no more than <hi>may bees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The unsearchable Wisdom of God is a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
satisfaction, as to all Prerogative Acts which we must
seek for no other reason of, but the good Will and Pleasure
of God; I call those Prerogative Acts, which are the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of a Free and Sovereign Will, within the bounds of
Just and Good. The Divine Nature, as Infinite as it is,
confines it self within the bounds of Justice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and the Prerogative of God, as the Absolute and
Sovereign Lord, cannot transgress these bounds: but there
are a great many acts of Sovereignty relating to the free
exercise of Justice and Goodness, which are under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
direction of no Law, but are only the free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Choice of a Sovereign Will: As in Scripture
God is sometimes said to do such things <hi>according to his
Will, according to the good Pleasure of his Will, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his good Pleasure;</hi> which always relates to such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
Acts, and signifies to us, That we must seek no
farther for the Reasons of such things, than the Sovereign
Will of God; as a Sovereign Prince, while he keeps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Legal Exercise of his Prerogative, needs give no
other account of it, but that it is his Will and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>But there are some men, who will not be so civil to God,
as they are to a Sovereign Prince, to take his sole Will and
good Pleasure, for a satisfactory reason of any thing; but
quarrel about these Prerogative Acts, and ask a great many
foolish Questions, and make a great many impertinent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50615:71"/>
even against the exercise of a Free and Sovereign
Goodness.</p>
               <p>Now in truth this is to deny God the Rights of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
to demand a Reason of him beyond his own Will,
for the Acts of pure Sovereignty: but yet I will grant
these men, That tho in all such Cases we must ask no other
reason, but the mere Will of God, yet God never does any
thing for mere Will and Pleasure, in the sense that some
men do, but has always wise and hidden Reasons, which
we cannot comprehend: And tho they will not allow the
unsearchable Wisdom of God a just satisfaction to other
Objections, yet methinks where they ought to demand no
other reason but the Will of God, it should abundantly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
them to know, That tho this Will of God is Sovereign
and Unaccountable, it is always guided by Infinite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Wisdom.</p>
               <p>That you may the better understand this, I shall give
you some Instances of it, in the Prerogative Acts of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Justice. Goodness indeed is essential to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a God, but yet there are some Sovereign Acts of
Goodness which no creature could challenge from God,
which God might not have done, and yet have been very
good; and why God exercises such Free and Prerogative
Acts of Goodness, must be resolved wholly into the good
Pleasure of his own Will. This is the account the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
gives us, of that Mysterious Goodness, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the World by our Lord Jesus Christ; which
is therefore every where in Scripture called <hi>Grace,</hi> and
<hi>Free Grace,</hi> and <hi>the Love of God,</hi> and <hi>the Will of God;</hi> as
Christ tells us,<note place="margin">5. John 30. 6. 38.</note> That <hi>he came not to do his own will, but the
will of him that sent him.</hi> And the whole Oeconomy of
our Redemption,<note place="margin">1. Eph. 11.</note> is called <hi>the purpose of him who worketh
all things according to the counsel of his own will:</hi> And thus
is every part of our Redemption;<note place="margin">1. James 18.</note> as our New-Birth; <hi>Of
his own will he hath begotten us:</hi> The Gifts of the Holy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50615:71"/>
Ghost were bestowed upon the Apostles <hi>according to his own
will.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Hebr. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God worketh in us both to will and to do of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Phil. 13.</note>
All which signifies no more but this, That these are
such Prerogative Acts of Goodness, as we must seek for
no other reason of, but the Sovereign Will and good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God.</p>
               <p>Now in such Sovereign Acts of Goodness as these, the
time, and manner, and other circumstances, and the rules
and methods of administration, are all perfectly free and
voluntary, where God has not bound up himself by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Promise; and therefore we must satisfy our selves,
that God has very wise Reasons for what he does, but must
not critically examine, whether every thing be done in the
best manner that we can think on; which would put an
end to a great many foolish Enquiries, with which men
perplex themselves, and disparage the Mysteries of our
Salvation: As, Why God sent Christ into the world, for
the Salvation of Mankind? Whether there was no other
possible way to save sinners; or whether this were absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the best? Why God sent Christ so late into the world,
in the last days, when it grew near its end, and so many
Generations of men had perished in ignorance and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
before his Appearance? Why so great a part of the
world to this day have never heard of Christ? And a
great many other such like Questions as these: To all
which it is sufficient to reply, That our Redemption by
Christ is an act of Sovereign Grace, and therefore we must
enquire no farther than the Will of God. Had God never
sent Christ into the world, nor preached the Gospel to
any one Nation, we should have had no reason to complain;
for he did not owe such a Saviour to sinners; and therefore
we have less reason to complain of the time of his coming
into the world, and that his Gospel is not universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by mankind. Sovereign Grace is free and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and we need not doubt but that such stupendious
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50615:72"/>
Goodness is administred by as unsearchable Wisdom;
and it is reasonable for us to acquiesce in the belief
of God's unerring Wisdom, especially in such cases
where we have no right to enquire beyond his Will.
When we receive all from God without his owing us any
thing, it is a good answer St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives, <hi>Who hath first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11. Rom 35, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>and it shall be recompensed to him again; for
of him, and through him, and to him, are all things; to whom
be glory for ever. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Divine Justice requires, that God should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
obstinate and incorrigible sinners; but then he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
Justice with a Free and Sovereign Authority; that
is, he is not confined to time, and place, and manner of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
sinners, as the Inferior Ministers of Justice are;
but when men have made themselves <hi>vessels of wrath fitted
for destruction,</hi> then God may punish sooner or later, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
or privately, and in what manner he pleases, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving any other reason for it, but his own Will. God
has more reasons of punishing Sinners in this world, than
merely to take Vengeance of their sins; and therefore he
punishes them in such a manner as may best serve the ends
of his Providence, as may most advance his own Name and
Glory, and do most good in the world. Thus God tells
<hi>Pharaoh, For this cause have I raised thee up;</hi> that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advanced thee to the Throne, or preserved thy Life
thus long in the midst of all the Plagues I have brought
upon thy Land, <hi>for to shew in thee my power, and that my
name may be declared throughout all the earth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9. Exod. 16.</note> that is, to
take such a remarkable Vengeance on thee, as may make
all the earth confess my Glory.</p>
               <p>Would men but allow God the Authority of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
who can Spare, and Reprieve, nay, Pardon in this
world, without the imputation of Injustice, it would
answer all the Cavilling Objections against Providence,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50615:72"/>
which relate to the Punishments of bad men. God might
then be allowed to execute speedy Vengeance upon some
sinners, and to delay the Punishment of others, and to
suffer them to be prosperous for a great while, without
giving any other reason for it, than his own Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
God hath always wise Reasons for these things, tho
we do not always know them; but if the Sovereignty of
God will justify all this, without any other reason, much
more ought we to be satisfied with what God does, when
we know that he executes Judgment, and restrains and
punishes Wickedness, and governs bad men, with unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Wisdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> That the ways of God are unsearchable, is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Answer to all Difficulties which concern such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as we must confess to be above our understanding:
I have already given you a great many Instances of this
nature, which I need not repeat; and indeed he must be a
very ignorant man, who is not sensible that there is a
Knowledge which is too wonderful for him, which the
Light of Nature cannot discover, and which God has not
thought fit to reveal: And is it not reasonable in all such
cases to say, That the Ways and Judgments of God are
above our knowledge; and to be contented to be ignorant
of what we cannot know? This I am sure is the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
that is left us, and the only way to rid our minds of
such perplexing Difficulties, as are owing to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
Ignorance of things.</p>
               <p>This is sufficient to shew you, That the Providence
of God, not only as our Absolute Lord, but as the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Wise Governor of the World, is and must be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable;
and that this is a very reasonable answer to
the Difficulties of Providence; and the true use of all is,
not to strive with God, not to quarrel at his Providence,
but to reverence his Unsearchable Judgments; to bear
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50615:73"/>
whatever he lays on us, with Patience and Submission,
and to compose our minds to a firm Trust and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on him, in the most cross and threatning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
               <p>It is thought a great piece of Wit, to be able to start
some New Objections against Providence, and to find
a great many Faults in God's Government of the world:
But besides the great Irreverence to God, did such men
believe a God, it is a certain proof of the most despicable
Ignorance, That they are ignorant to such a degree, as
not to know they are ignorant; for if they did, they
would not dare to Judge and Censure Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Justice and Righteousness of Providence.</head>
               <p>THE next Enquiry is, Concerning the Justice of
the Divine Providence. Justice and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is essential to the Notion of a God; and therefore if
God govern the world, he must govern it righteously; and
this is the great and formidable Objection against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
That the world is not governed with Justice and
Righteousness: And could this be evidently and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly
proved, I would allow the Conclusion, That then
God does not govern the world. But I challenge any man
who understands what the Justice of God's Government
is, to charge the Divine Providence with any one plain
and notorious Act of Injustice; for the truth is, the ground
of all these Objections, is an ignorance of the Nature of
God's Government, and of the Justice of Providence;
and when this is truly stated, all such Objections will need
no Answer.</p>
               <p>Justice is commonly divided into Commutative and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributive
Justice; the first respects mens Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties;
the second their Deserts; the first consists in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
every man what is his own by some Natural or Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Rights; the second consists in rewarding or punishing
men, as the nature and quality of their actions deserve.
And upon both these accounts some men impeach the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence.</p>
               <p>1. Because it is too manifest, that there is a great deal of
Injustice done in the world; that a great many men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their Rights and Properties by Fraud, Injustice,
or open Violence; and therefore the world is not justly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50615:74"/>
and righteously governed; which they think in the last
issue must reflect upon the Justice and Righteousness of
Providence; if God be the Supreme and Sovereign Lord
of the world. <hi>2dly.</hi> That Rewards and Punishments are not
justly and equally distributed; that some bad men are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rewarded, and some good men greatly punished; which
is not reconcilable with the Distributive Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc.
Now the plainest and shortest way of answering
these and all such like Objections, is to consider, Wherein
the Justice of Providence consists, and what Justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of God in the government of this lower world: For
if God may govern the world very righteously, without
doing what some men think Justice requires him to do, and
without hindring what they think Justice requires him to
hinder, this is a sufficient Vindication of the Justice of
Providence, whatever other Objections they may make
against it: And I shall state this as plainly and briefly
as I can.</p>
               <p>1. First then, I suppose I may take it for granted, That
the Justice of Providence does not consist in hindring all
Acts of Injustice and Violence. There may be great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Injustice committed in the world, and yet God
may govern the world with great Righteousness: Which
is no more than to say, That men may be very wicked and
unjust, and yet God be very Just. As for God's permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
so much evil to be committed, that is a greater Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the Holiness than against the Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and shall be particularly considered under that
Head; but the Justice of Providence does not consist in
hindring men from sinning, but in punishing them when
they do. Were it unjust in God to suffer men to do any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
it would be but a very imperfect kind of Justice to
punish them for it; for upon this supposition, the Justice
of punishing sin would be founded in the Injustice of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50615:74"/>
it; and God must be first Unjust in permitting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
before he can be Just in punishing it. Which shews
how absurd it would be, to charge the Providence of God
with Injustice, because there are so many unjust men, who
do many unjust things.</p>
               <p>2. For God may do that very justly, which men cannot
do without great injustice; and therefore men may be very
unjust, and God very just: As for instance; God may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
justly take away any man's Estate, when no man can
do it without Injustce; and the Case is the same with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Honour, and Power, and Life it self; for God is
the Supreme Lord and Proprietor of the World; we are
all his, and all that we have is <hi>his:</hi> We may have a Right
to our Lives and Liberties, Estates, Honours, and Power,
against all Human Claims; but we have no Right against
God: He may give Riches, and Honours, and Power, to
whom he pleases, and take them away again when he sees
fit, without being chargeable with any Injustice; for what
he gives, and what he takes away, is his own; and <hi>may
not he do what he will with his own?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There can be no <hi>Commutative Iustice</hi> in a strict and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense, where there is no Right but on one side; for he
who has no Right, can suffer no Wrong; and he in whom
the whole Right is, can do no Wrong in giving or taking
away what is his own: And therefore <hi>Legal Rights and
Properties,</hi> which are the Foundation of Commutative
Justice, can be no Objection against Providence, for no
Creature has any Legal Property against God. The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of Providence does not relate to the Rights of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but to the Moral and Eternal Reasons of things;
it does not consist in defending every man in his Legal
Rights, which is the Justice of Human Governments, but
in rewarding or punishing men according as they deserve,
or as may best serve the wise ends of God's Government
in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:50615:75"/>
There seems to me to be no occasion for that Dispute
<hi>de Iure Dei in Creaturas,</hi> what Right God has in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
for there is no doubt but God has an Absolute, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,
Uncontroulable Right in all his Creatures; they
and all they have are his, and at his Absolute Disposal; tho
it does not hence follow, that God may without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
make Creatures on purpose to make them misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for tho Creatures have no Natural Rights against
God, yet the Justice and Goodness of the Divine Nature
gives them a Moral Right to such usage as they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve:
as for instance, That an innocent Creature should
not be miserable, and that those who deserve well, should
not be ill used. But these Moral Rights concern Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Justice, and result from the Goodness and Justice of
the Divine Nature and Government, not from the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rights of Creatures. We are absolutely at the Will
and Disposal of God, as Slaves and Vassals are at the Will
of their Lord; but our security is, That God can will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is wise, and just, and good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> From hence it evidently follows, That in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
about the Justice of Providence, we must confine
our enquiries to Distributive Justice; that is, we must not
barely consider what men have, or what they lose, or what
they suffer, nor what the immediate and visible Causes of
all this are, whether just or unjust; but we must consider
what proportion there is between their Condition, and
their Moral Deserts; or whether they enjoy or suffer any
thing which will not serve the wise and just ends of God's
Government. If men are put into such a condition, as
they have neither deserved, nor can make any good use of,
or which does not make them Instruments of the Divine
Providence to serve some wise and good ends, by what
means soever they come into such a condition, it reflects
upon the Wisdom and Justice of God, who has the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Disposal of all Events, and by a Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50615:75"/>
allots all men their several Portions and Stations in the
world: But let mens Condition be what it will, whether
they be Rich or Poor, Happy or Miserable, advanced or
ruined by Injustice, Oppression, and Violence, if this be
what they deserved, what they are fit for, what the wise
Government of the world requires, it can be no blemish
to Providence, which directs and governs all things with
Wisdom and Justice.</p>
               <p>So that it is no Objection against the Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to say, That there are a great many miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the world, and a great deal of Injustice daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in it; unless you can prove, That any of these
miserable people ought not for wise and just reasons to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such Miseries; or that any suffer by Injustice what they
ought not to suffer: For if notwithstanding all the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that are in the world, and all the Wickedness that is
committed in it, no man suffers any thing but what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
or what God may wisely and justly inflict on him,
this abundantly vindicates the Wisdom and Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> But for the better understanding of this, we must
consider more particularly the Nature of God's Justice,
and what Acts of Justice the Government of this world
requires; and how it differs from the Justice of Human
Governments; the confounding of which, has occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
most of the Objections against the Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>1. To consider the Nature and Exercise of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
for tho the general Notion of Justice be the same,
whether we speak of the Justice of God or Men; yet the
particular Acts of Justice vary, as they do even among
men, according as their Rights and Authority differ. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
signifies to give to every man what is his own, and to
take nothing from any man, but what is our own; to serve
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50615:76"/>
our selves of other men, and to reward or punish them, as
their Actions deserve, and as our Authority will justify.
So that the particular expressions of Justice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
as exercised by different persons, differ as much
as the Circumstances of mens Fortune and Conditions,
Relations, Authority, and Power, differ: For when two
men do the same thing, it may be done very justly by one,
and very unjustly by the other, because one may have a
Right and Authority to do it, and the other have none;
as a Prince or Judge may very justly execute a Criminal,
and confiscate his Estate, which a private man cannot
justly do.</p>
               <p>Now if the difference between a private man and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
between a Prince and a Subject, makes such a vast
difference in the particular Acts and Exercise of Justice and
Righteousness, as they respect such different states, that
vast disproportion which is between God and Creatures,
must make a much greater difference; that tho the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Notion of Justice and Righteousness is the same both
with respect to God and Men; yet God may do that very
justly, which men cannot justly do; as a Prince may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
some Acts of Justice, which a private man must
not do.</p>
               <p>I shall at present only instance in God's Absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Sovereignty, and shew you in some plain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
what a vast difference this makes between the Justice
of God, and the Justice of Men. Now God's Absolute
Dominion gives him Right and Authority to do whatever
is consistent with Wisdom and Goodness: For Absolute
Dominion is Absolute Authority, and Absolute Authority
makes every thing just, which is wise and good. A Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Authority has a Rule, and must not do what is wise
and good, against its Rule of Right: No man must take
away that which is anothers, and which he has no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to take away, whatever wise and good ends he can
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50615:76"/>
serve by it. Tho it were never so apparent, that it would
be a great kindness to the man himself, to take away great
part of his Estate, which he uses ill to oppress his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to make himself a Beast; tho he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Estate he has, nay, deserves to lose it; tho we
could bestow it upon men who deserve and would use it
better, or could employ it to excellent uses, for the Service
of God, and of his Church, or for the relief of the Poor:
All these wise and good Purposes, would justify no man who
invades another's Rights without a just Authority: But had
any Prince such an Absolute Authority over the Estates of
all his Subjects, that he could give or take them away as he
pleased, then such Reasons as these would justify the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of such a Sovereign Will and Power in transferring
Estates and Properties, and all men would allow it to be
very just and righteous. Now this is the Case with respect
to God, as I observed before; for he is the sole Lord and
Proprietor of the world; and therefore no other bounds
can be set to the just exercise of his Authority, but to do
what is wise and good: He may give or take away any
man's Estate, or Honour, or Power, whenever he can
serve any wise, or just, or good ends by it; for they are
all but several Trusts; we are but God's Stewards, and must
give an Account of our Stewardship: and if we do not use
our Riches and Honours well, or when he has no longer
any use of us, he has as Absolute Authority to lay us aside,
as a Lord has to change his Steward, when he pleases.</p>
               <p>Thus God is the Absolute Lord of all men: we are all his
Creatures, and are in his hands, as Clay in the hands of a
Potter; and therefore he may deal with us as he pleases,
and may serve the ends of his own Glory and Providence
of us, as far as his own Wisdom and Goodness will direct.
Thus for instance; we think it very unjust in Human Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
to punish a vertuous and innocent man, to strip
him of his Estate or Honours, to afflict his body, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50615:77"/>
him to publick scorn, and confine him to a noisom Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and at last to take away his life with exquisite Pains
and Torments: But the Sovereign Authority of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to all this, when he can serve his own Glory, and the
wise ends of his Grace and Providence by it, without doing
any real injury to his Creatures. The Wisdom of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that there should be very great and excellent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for doing this; and the Goodness of God requires,
that such good men should be greatly supported under their
sufferings, and greatly rewarded for them; but then the
Sovereignty of God gives him Authority to use the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Creatures, in doing or suffering his Will.</p>
               <p>This was the Case of <hi>Iob,</hi> whom God exercised with
great sufferings, to make him an eminent Example of
Faith and Patience; but we know what was the end of
<hi>Iob,</hi> and how greatly God rewarded his Sufferings; tho
<hi>Iob</hi> himself, while he was under these sufferings, knew not
what other account to give of them, but to resolve all into
the Sovereign Will and Pleasure of God. <hi>The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the
Lord.</hi> And, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and
shall we not receive evil?</hi> Which indeed is Answer enough
to all such Cases, while we have an implicate Faith in the
Wisdom and Goodness of Providence.</p>
               <p>Thus God dealt with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> made him the Instrument
of transplanting his Father and all his Family into <hi>Egypt;</hi>
and rewarded his sufferings, by advancing him to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s
Throne.</p>
               <p>Nay, thus God dealt with Christ himself, who, as man,
was Perfect and Innocent, <hi>who did no evil, neither was any
guile found in his mouth; who went about doing good,</hi> and was
obedient to his Father's Will in all things; and yet him
God delivered into the hands of sinners, to suffer an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
and painful Death, for the Redemption of the
world. And the Sovereignty of God will justify the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50615:77"/>
Sufferings of the most innocent men, when they serve
such admirable Ends, and are so greatly rewarded.</p>
               <p>And thus God has dealt with some of the best men that
ever lived in the world: Witness the Sufferings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and of other good men under the Old Testament,
and of the Apostles and Martyrs of Christ, who have trod
in the steps of their Lord, who have suffered with him,
that they might be glorified together. I know not what
the Sovereignty of God signifies, if he may not serve the
wise ends of his Grace and Providence, even by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Creatures, when such Sufferings, how uneasy
and grievous soever they are at present, shall turn to their
much greater good; when they shall be so greatly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that good men themselves shall think the reward an
abundant recompence for their sufferings, and glory in
those very sufferings which will have so great a reward.</p>
               <p>Thus let us consider God as the Supreme and Absolute
Judge of the World: Now a Sovereign and Absolute
Judge must do that which is just, but he is tied up by no
Rules or Formalities of Law, as Inferior Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
are; if he reward the good, and punish the wicked,
he may do it at what time and in what manner he pleases:
He is under no rule but his own Sovereign Will and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
When men have deserved Punishment, he may
spare them as long, or execute Vengeance on them as soon
as he sees fit; for he is the Absolute Judge of time, and
place, and other circumstances of executing Judgment.
This Prerogative all Sovereign Princes challenge; and it is
indeed an inseparable Right of Sovereignty.</p>
               <p>So that it is no reasonable Objection against the Justice
of Providence, That God does not immediately reward
all great and vertuous actions, nor immediately punish
wickedness, for a Sovereign Justice is under no obligation
to do this: All that we can expect from the Divine Justice
is, That good men shall be rewarded, and the wicked pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50615:78"/>
and that whenever God does reward or punish,
good men shall have no reason to complain, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
was delayed; nor bad men to glory in the long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
of punishment; but the greatness of the Rewards or
Punishments shall recompence for all delays; for then God
is just in rewarding good men, and punishing the wicked,
how long soever he delay either. Sovereign Justice is not
confined to time; and when the Sufferings of good men,
who deserve a Reward, and the Prosperity of bad men
who deserve Punishment, and the delays of both are taken
into the account, God is very Just and Righteous, how
long soever he delay to reward or punish.</p>
               <p>From what I have now discoursed concerning the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of the Divine Justice, you may easily observe,
That all the Objections against the Justice of Providence,
have no other Foundation, but our Ignorance of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God's Justice; we measure the Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by the Rules of Justice among men, without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that God is the Sovereign Lord of the world, and
therefore has a Right and Authority superior to men, and
therefore a superior Justice too.</p>
               <p>It is unjust for men to deprive one another of their Just
and Legal Lights, and therefore they think this a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the Justice of Providence too, when men suffer
wrongfully; but no man has any Right against God, who
is the sole Proprietor of the world; and therefore he may
give, and he may take away, he may set up and pull down,
and do whatsoever pleaseth him, both in Heaven and in
Earth.</p>
               <p>It is unjust for men to afflict and oppress the innocent
and vertuous, or to encourage and prosper the wicked;
and therefore they complain against Providence too, when
good men suffer, and the wicked are prosperous; but God
has an Absolute Right to the services of all his Creatures,
both of good and bad men; and if he can serve the Wise
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50615:78"/>
Ends of his Grace and Providence, by the Sufferings of
good men, or by the Prosperity of the wicked; and when
he has no farther use of their services, rewards or punishes
them according as they deserve; the Sovereignty of God
will justify the present Sufferings of good men, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of the wicked; and their final Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
will vindicate his Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> But for a fuller Vindication of the Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
we must consider the Nature of God's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this lower world, and what Acts of Justice the
present Government of the world requires. The Justice
of Government must be proportioned to the Nature and
Ends of Government; for all acts of Justice are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
at all times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is no Reproach to the Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
if God do not exercise such acts of Justice as are
not proper for the present state of the world; for Justice is
Rectitude; and what is not right and fit in such a state of
things, is not just.</p>
               <p>The great Objection against the Justice of Providence
is, That all good men are not rewarded, nor all bad men
punished according to their deserts in this world: But this
is no Objection against the Divine Justice, to those who
believe that there is another world, where all good men
shall be rewarded, and all wicked men punished; for if
all good and bad men shall be finally rewarded and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to their works, this is a sufficient Vindication
of the Justice of God.</p>
               <p>And as for the Justice of Providence, tho every good
man is not rewarded, nor every bad man punished in this
world, this is no reasonable Objection, if the state of this
world will not admit of such a strict and exact Justice.
Now not to take notice at present of what is commonly
said upon this occasion, and what I have formerly discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
more largely, That this world is not the place of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a state of Trial, Probation, and Discipline;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50615:79"/>
where good men many times suffer, not so much in Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their sins, as to exercise their Faith and Patience,
and to brighten their Vertues, and to prepare them for
greater Rewards; and bad men are prosperons, to lead
them to Repentance, or to make them Instruments of
the Divine Providence, in chastising the Wickedness of
other men, or the more remarkable Examples of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice and Vengeance in their final ruin.</p>
               <p>I say, not to take notice of these things now, I shall
only observe, That the Justice of Providence is nothing
else but the Justice of Government, which in the nature
of the thing must be distinguished from the Justice of the
final Judgment.</p>
               <p>Now to govern the world, does not signify to destroy it,
but to uphold and preserve it, and to continue a succession
of men in it, and to keep it in as good order, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of things will admit. The Providence of God,
is that Provident Care which he takes of all his Creatures,
while he thinks fit to preserve this present Frame of the
World; but to destroy the World, is not properly an Act
of Providence, but of Judgment; and yet if we consider
the corrupt and degenerate state of the world, did the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of Providence require God to punish all bad men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their deserts, he must destroy far the greatest part
of mankind in every Age. This earth would soon be little
better than a desolate Wilderness, if none but good men
were suffered to live in it: But this kind of Justice God
has renounced ever since the Universal Deluge. He then
indeed exercised such a terrible Justice and Vengeance, as
some men think can be the only proof of a Providence;
he destroyed the whole World by Water, excepting <hi>Noah</hi>
and his Sons, whom he preserved in the Ark; but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that he would never do so again, notwithstanding
the great Wickedness of mankind. <hi>The Lord said in his
heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50615:79"/>
sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
youth: neither will I again smite any more every living thing,
as I have done. While the earth remaineth, seed-time, and
harvest, and cold, and heat, and summer, and winter, and
day, and night, shall not cease,</hi> 8. Gen. 21, 22. So that God
will no more destroy the world, nor all the wicked Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of it, till the day of Judgment; and then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all wicked men cannot be punished according to their
deserts in this world.</p>
               <p>The Justice of Providence then does not consist in root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all bad men out of the world, or in making them all
miserable in it, or in rewarding all good men with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Felicity; which considering the present state of the
world, cannot be done without constant Miracles, and the
visible interposition of a Divine Power; for when bad men
are so much the greater numbers, they will have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
share and interest in this world: But the Care of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
is to govern bad men, and to protect the good;
to restrain and govern the Lusts and Passions of bad men,
to make them the Instruments and Executioners of his
just Vengeance on one another; and to make some of them
in every Age notorious Examples of his Justice, to keep
the world in awe, and to awaken in them a due sense and
reverence of the Divine Power; and to correct and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
the Miscarriages of good men, and to exercise their
Graces and Vertues. The Justice of Providence consists
in this, Not that all good men shall be prosperous in this
world, and all bad men miserable; but that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Wickedness that is in the world, the world is
kept in tolerable order, and is a tolerable place to live in;
and that bad men are as often punished, and good men as
often rewarded, as the government of this world requires;
that no man suffers any thing but what he deserves, and
what God sees good for him, if he will make a wise use of
it; and that how prosperous soever bad men are, there are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50615:80"/>
few of them go out of the world, without some Marks and
Tokens of a Divine Vengeance, tho not always so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
as to be observed by the world.</p>
               <p>The Sum is this; God is very Just in his Government
of the World; but the Government of the World does not
require the same Acts of Justice that the final Judgment
of Mankind does: And if we do but consider the Nature
of the Divine Justice, which is the Justice of a Sovereign
and Absolute Lord, and the difference between the Justice
of Providence, and of the final Judgment, that is, between
God's Governing and Judging the World, we shall easily
answer all the Objections against the Justice of Providence.</p>
               <p>This I take to be a full and true Account of the Justice
of Providence, and to agree very exactly with the actual
Administration of Providence: For it is manifest, that
all good men are not rewarded, nor all wicked men pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in this world; that a Righteous Cause is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
oppressed; and that Oppression and Injustice is very
often prosperous; which must needs appear a great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to those who make no difference between the Justice
of God and Men; who think that the Justice of Providence
is as much concerned to defend all mens Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
as the Justice of a Prince is. This makes them
quarrel against Providence, when they are hardly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
used by men, and so blinds their minds, that they
see not the true Reasons why God afflicts them, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reverence his Judgments, nor make a wise use of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Reasons of this seem very plain; the only Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, How it agrees with that account which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
gives us of God's Justice and Righteousness? For
the Righteousness of God is represented in Scripture, by
loving Righteousness, and favouring a Righteous Cause.
Thus</hi> 11. Psalm 7. The righteous Lord loveth righteousness,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50615:80"/>
and his countenance doth behold the upright. <hi>And the</hi> Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
<hi>very often encourages himself to expect the Divine
Favour and Protection, from his own Innocence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
and the Righteousness of his Cause:</hi> 35. Psal. 19.
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully, rejoice over
me; neither let them wink with the eye, that hate me without
a cause. Stir up thy self, and awake to my judgment, even to
my cause, my God, and my Lord. Iudge me, O God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thy righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me. Let
them be ashamed and brought to confusion together, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
at my hurt. Let them be cloathed with shame and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that magnify themselves against me. Let them shout for
joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause; yea, let
them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath
pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 23, 24, 26, 27. <hi>v.</hi>
The Lord shall judge the people: Iudge me, O Lord, according
to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in
me. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but
establish the just; for the righteous Lord trieth the heart and
reins. God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the
wicked every day. If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he
hath bent his bow, and made it ready: <hi>And concludes,</hi> I will
praise the Lord according to his righteousness, and will sing
praises to the name of the Lord most high; 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8, &amp;c.
<hi>Where the Righteousness of the Lord, for which the</hi>
Psalmist <hi>praises him, is his Judging and Defending a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Cause. Thus in</hi> 9. Psalm 8, 9, 10. He shall judge the
world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in uprightness. The Lord also will be a refuge to the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
a refuge in time of trouble. And they that know thy name.
will put their trust in thee; for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken
them that seek thee. <hi>It were easy to multiply Texts to this
purpose, where God is expresly declared to be an irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enemy to all Injustice and Violence, the Protector of the
Widow, the Fatherless, and Oppressed, and of all just and</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:50615:81"/>
righteons men: But those conclude a great deal too much,
who would prove from such Texts as these, That no
Righteous Man, nor Righteous Cause, shall ever be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:
That good men shall always be prosperous, and
the wicked always miserable; for it is evident, that this
was not the state of the world when these Psalms were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and therefore this could not possibly be the meaning
of them.</p>
               <p>How many Complaints does the <hi>Psalmist</hi> make against
his Enemies, those who were <hi>wrongfully</hi> his Enemies?
69. Psalm 4. <hi>That his Enemies were lively and strong;</hi> and
<hi>they that hated him wrongfully were multiplied,</hi> 38. Psalm 19.
How passionately does he pray for Protection against his
Enemies? <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever?
how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? how long shall I take
counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long
shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</hi> 13. Psalm 1, 2. The
<hi>37th.</hi> Psalm is a plain proof, that wicked men were very
prosperous in those days, tho they are threatned with final
destruction. And to the same purpose the <hi>73d.</hi> Psalm gives
us a large description of the Prosperity and Pride of bad
men, many of whom spend their lives, and end their days
prosperously: <hi>I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the
prosperity of the wicked: For there are no bands in their death,
but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other
men, neither are they plagued as other men.—Behold these
are the ungodly, who prosper in the world, they encrease in
riches.</hi> The Prosperity of bad men, and the Miseries and
Afflictions of the good, were in those days a great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in Providence, and were so to the <hi>Psalmist</hi> himself;
and therefore it is certain, that whatever he says of the
Righteousness of God, and his care of Righteous men,
and his abhorrence of all Wickedness and Injustice, cannot
signify, That God will always defend men in their just
Rights; that he will always prosper a Righteous Cause,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50615:81"/>
and Righteous Men, for this was against plain matter of
fact; and we cannot suppose the <hi>Psalmist</hi> so inconsistent
with himself, as in the same breath to compalin that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men were prosperous, and good men afflicted; and to
affirm, That the Just and Righteous Judge of the World
would always punish Unjust Oppressors, and protect the
Innocent: Nay, indeed the very nature of the thing proves
the contrary; for there can be no Unjust Oppressors, if
no body can be oppressed in their just Rights; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is certain the Divine Providence does at least for a
time suffer some men to be very prosperous in their Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and does not always defend a just and innocent
Cause; for if he did, there could be no innocent oppressed
man to be relieved, nor any Oppressor to be punished. And
if it be consistent with the Justice and Righteousness of
Providence to permit such things for some time, we must
conclude, that it is at the discretion of Providence, how
long good men shall be oppressed, and the Oppressor go
unpunished.</p>
               <p>The plain account then of this matter, as it is represented
in Scripture, is this:</p>
               <p>1. That as God is infinitely Just and Righteous himself,
so he loves Justice and Righteousness among men; he loves
Righteousness and Righteous Men, and hates all Injustice,
Violence and Injuries; for the Righteous Lord must love
Righteousness, and hate Iniquity: and therefore, though
the Divine Justice is Superior to all Human Rights, and his
Authority Absolute and Sovereign, to dispose of all his
Creatures, and of all they have, as his own Wisdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects,
yet men cannot invade each other's Rights without
Injustice; and when Rights and Properties are setled by
Human Laws, it is the Rule of Righteousness to us, to
give to every man that which is his own; and it is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of Government to punish those who invade another's
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50615:82"/>
Rights; and this is that Justice which the Righteous Lord
loves in men, and the violation of which he hates.</p>
               <p>So that the Justice of the Divine Nature makes God love
Righteousness and Justice, and hate all Injustice and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
and the Justice of Providence requires that God
should punish Injustice and Violence, and protect the Just
and Innocent, as far as the nature and ends of God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World requires; and this the Scripture
everywhere declares, that God will do: That he is angry with
the wicked every day; That he is a refuge and sanctuary, and
strong tower and rock of defence to Just and Righteous men.
Not that every particular bad man, who does unjust things,
shall be immediately punished for his Unjustice; nor that
every man, who has a just and righteous Cause, shall be
protected from the violence and injustice of the Wicked;
for the Experience of all the World proves, that this never
was done, and therefore this cannot be the meaning of the
Promises and Threatnings of Scripture: But there is enough
meant by it to vindicate the Justice of Providence in this
World, to be a support to good men, and a terror to the
wicked.</p>
               <p>1. For first, it signifies, That in the ordinary course of
Providence, where there is nothing but the justice or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Cause to be considered, God will favour a just
and righteous Cause. There may be other wise Reasons,
why God may suffer a just Cause to be oppressed, and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to be prosperous; and we ought to believe, that there
are always wise Reasons for it, when God does suffer this,
because we certainly know, that God is no favourer of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:
but he who has a just Cause, may for other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
deserve to be punished, and then God may justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him by unjust Oppressors; and thus Injustice may be
prosperous, and Justice oppressed; but where the other
sins and demerits of the man do not forfeit God's protection
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50615:82"/>
of a just Cause, the Divine Providence will make a visible
distinction between just and unjust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> And therefore no man can promise himself the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Protection, but only when his Cause is just and
right. Which is the reason, why the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as you
have already heard, so often pleads his own innocence and
integrity, and the righteousness of his Cause, to move
God to save and defend him. For God has promised his
protection upon no other terms; and whenever Injustice
prospers, it is not in favour to the unjust man, or his unjust
Cause, but in punishment to others, whom God thinks fit
to correct and chastise by such injustice. Tho wickedness
may prosper for a while, there is no way to obtain the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Favour and Protection, but by doing good; for a
Righteous God can have no favour for an unjust Cause;
and therefore if we believe that God governs the World,
we must expect his protection only in the ways of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and this will give us a secure hope and dependance
on God, <hi>That we shall not be ashamed, while we have respect
unto all his commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> And for the same Reason, though Injustice may
prosper for a time, no unjust man can be secure from a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vengeance; God does not always punish bad men as
soon as they deserve it; but sometimes he does, and he is
always angry with them, and therefore they are always in
danger. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day; if he turn
not, he will whet his sword, he hath bent his bow, and made it
ready, he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death,
he hath ordain'd his arrows against the persecutors,</hi> 7. Psalm
11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> And therefore though every particular good man
be not rewarded, nor every bad man punish'd in this World,
yet the Divine Providence furnishes us with numerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Justice, both in the protection and defence of
good men, and in the punishment of the wicked. This is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50615:83"/>
so notoriously known, that no man can deny it, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the ordinary Miseries and Calamities of Sinners,
which are the natural and necessary effects and rewards of
their Sins, and make them the scorn, and the pity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
God does very often execute very remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon remarkable Sinners, which bear the evident
Tokens and Characters of a Divine Vengeance on them,
and does appear as wonderfully for the preservation of just
and good men in a Righteous Cause. Both Sacred and
Prophane Story, and our own observation may furnish us
with many Examples of both kinds, which are sufficient
to vindicate the Justice of Providence, and the truth of
those Promises and Threatnings which are made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> The better to understand that Account the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
gives us of the Justice of Providence, I observe, That
the protection and defence of Providence is never promised
in Scripture merely to a just and righteous Cause, but only
to just, and righteous, and good men. This is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
observed; and yet as soon as it is named, it is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it needs no proof; and the consequence of it is
very considerable.</p>
               <p>We cannot indeed separate a just and righteous Man
from a righteous Cause; for as far as he is engaged in an
unjust Cause, he is an unjust Man: but if the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
be promised to the righteous Man, not to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Cause, then a righteous Cause may be oppressed,
when the man has no right to God's Protection, without
any impeachment either of the Righteousness or Justice of
God: Which shews the difference, as I observed before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Justice of Providence, and the Justice of Human
Governments. The Justice of Human Governments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
mens Rights, the Justice of Providence considers
their moral Deserts. Human Justice defends bad men in
their just Rights, the Divine Justice, which is supreme
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50615:83"/>
and absolute, has no regard to Human Rights, when the
men deserve to be punished. For God challenges to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
such an absolute right and propriety in all things, as to
give or take them away when he pleases. And therefore
he threatens <hi>Israel</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> that since they
had served <hi>Baal</hi> with the Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and
Silver, and Gold, which he gave them, <hi>Therefore will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine
in the season thereof, and will recover my wool, and my flax,
given to cover her nakedness,</hi> 2. Hos. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The 26. <hi>Levit.</hi> contains the Promises and Threatnings
to <hi>Israel;</hi> and the Condition of both is, their keeping or
transgressing his Laws, and Statutes, and Commandments;
if they observed his Laws, he would bestow all good things
on them; if they transgressed his Laws, he would take
them all away, without any regard to their Rights or
Properties. Among other Judgments, he threatens them
to deliver them into the hands of their Enemies, who
should oppress them in their own Land, or carry them
captive into strange Countries. This destroy'd all their
Rights and Properties at once; and yet I suppose no man
will say, that the <hi>Philistins,</hi> or <hi>Moabites,</hi> or <hi>Aramites,</hi> had
any right to invade <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to bring <hi>Israel</hi> under their
Yoke: and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had no better right than they,
when he destroyed the Temple and City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
carried the <hi>Iews</hi> captive to <hi>Babylon;</hi> but God was very just
and righteous in this, though he did not defend them in
their just Rights, because they had deserved such punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And thus throughout the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> the
protection of the Divine Providence is promised only to
good and righteous men, to those who love God, who
fear, and reverence, and worship, and put their trust in
him; that if men be not thus qualified, whatever their
Cause is, they have no right to the Protection of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And this is the Justice of Providence, not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50615:84"/>
Human Rights, but to protect and defend good men,
and to punish the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> We may observe also in Scripture, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Justice of Providence, and God's love to
Righteousness, and to righteous Men, he still by a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority reserves to himself a liberty to correct and
chastise good men, and to exercise their Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and to serve the ends of his own Glory by their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.
We must distinguish between Acts of Discipline
and Justice, which have very different ends and measures,
as the Correction of a Child differs from the Execution of a
Malefactor. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth; and
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. He corrects us for our
profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness,</hi> 7. Heb. 7, 8, 9.
Very good men may fall into such great sins, as may deserve
a severe correction, not only to give them a greater abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their sins, and make them more watchful for the
future, but to be an Example to others; and in such cases
Repentance it self, though it will obtain their pardon, will
not excuse them from Temporal Punishments, as we see
in the Example of <hi>David,</hi> when he had been guilty of
Adultery and Murther; upon his repentance God declared
his pardon by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> but would not remit his
punishment, which was not so much an act of Justice and
Vengeance, as of necessary Discipline. And these are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the many Afflictions of the Righteous, out of which the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, God will at last deliver them; whereas the
Punishments of the Wicked, when God, after a long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
awakes to judgment, are usually for their final
ruin and destruction.</p>
               <p>Thus good men may have many secret failings and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
known to none but God and themselves, which
may deserve severe corrections; which sometimes are made
an argument against the Justice of Providence, when the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50615:84"/>
correction is visible, but the causes for which they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
unknown.</p>
               <p>Other good men suffer for <hi>the trial of their faith, which
is more precious than of gold which perisheth;</hi> and are train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by great severities to heroical degrees of Vertue.
All this is very reconcilable with God's love of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and righteous Men, for it is the effect of this Love:
And thus good Men for a time may visibly suffer as much
as the wicked, which occasions such Complaints, that <hi>all
things fall alike to all;</hi> but such Corrections as these are not
properly Acts of Justice, but of Discipline; not so much
for the punishment of Good men, as to make them better;
not the effects of Anger, but of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> We may observe in Scripture also, That God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
a Sovereign Authority in exercising his Judgments
upon Wicked men. He does not always punish them as
soon as they deserve punishment, but sometimes waits pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
for their return; sometimes uses them as the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Justice to punish other Bad men, or to correct
the Miscarriages, and to exercise the Graces and Vertues
of Good men; and when he has finished what he had
to do by them, reserves them for a more publick and
glorious Execution, to be the Triumphs of his just
Vengeance, and standing Examples to the World, which
we know was the case of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the King of
<hi>Assyria,</hi> of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and some great Persecutors of
the Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus have I shewn you, wherein the Justice of
Providence consists, both from the nature of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice, and the Ends of God's Government in
this World, and from the Account the Scripture gives
us of it; which will enable us to answer all the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
against the Justice of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:50615:85"/>
I shall observe but one thing more, That it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from this Discourse, that we must not judge of
the goodness of any Cause by external and visible Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
much less make the oppression of a just Cause any
argument against the Justice of Providence. For Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
does not oblige God always to favour a just
Cause, when those who have a just Cause deserve to
be punished. God may justly punish Bad men by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Oppressors, for he is the Sovereign Lord of the
World, and can dispose of his Creatures as his own
Absolute Authority, and Unsearchable Wisdom shall
direct.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Holiness of Providence.</head>
               <p>THE next Enquiry is concerning the Holiness of
Providence. For God is a Holy Being, as Holiness
is opposed to all Impurity and Wickedness; and such as
God's Nature is, such his Government must be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Psalmist, 145. <hi>Psalm</hi> 17. assures us, That the
Lord is not only <hi>righteous in all his ways;</hi> which signifies the
Justice of Providence, which I have already discoursed
of; but he is <hi>holy in all his works,</hi> as he tells us more at large,
5. <hi>Psal. 4, 5, 6, For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in
wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee: The foolish shall
not stand in thy sight; thou hatest all workers of iniquity: thou
shalt destroy them that speak leasing; the Lord will abhor the
bloody and deceitful man.</hi> And yet there want not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
and such as some men think inexplicable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
against the Holiness of Providence. And therefore my
design at present is to set this in as clear a light as I can;
and to that end I shall enquire</p>
               <p>1. What the Holiness of God requires of him in the
Government of the world.</p>
               <p>2. What it does not require of him. And</p>
               <p>3. What is Inconsistent and Irreconcilable with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Providence.</p>
               <p>And if God Governs the World, as his Essential Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
requires, that he should Govern it; if what men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
Object against Providence be no just impeachment of
his Holiness; and if nothing be justly chargeable on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which is inconsistent and irreconcilable with the
Holiness of the Divine Nature; I suppose I need then
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50615:86"/>
add no more to vindicate the Holiness of Providence.</p>
               <p>1. Now as for the first, the case seems very plain, That
the Holiness of a Governour, in the Government of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creatures and Free Agents, can require no more of
him, than to command every thing that is Holy, and to
forbid all kinds and degrees of Wickedness, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the practice of Vertue, and to discourage all Wicked
practices, as much as the Wisdom of Government, and the
freedom of human Actions will allow.</p>
               <p>That God does all this, wherein the Holiness of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
consists, I know no man that denies: As wicked
as Mankind is, it is not for want of holy, and just, and
good Laws; <hi>The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, and giveth
wisdom unto the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, and
rejoyce the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, and
giveth light unto the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean and
endureth for ever; the judgments of the Lord are true, and
righteous altogether.</hi> 19. Psal. 7, 8, 9. The great complaint
is, That the Laws of God are too Holy for the Corrupt
state of this World, and most men think to excuse their
Wickedness by the degeneracy of human Nature, and the
too great Purity and Perfection of the Divine Laws, which
they have no Ability to perform.</p>
               <p>Now the Holiness of God's Laws are an undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the Holiness of his Providence and Government,
whether we consider these Laws as a copy of his Nature,
or a declaration of his Will; much more if we consider
them both as his Nature, and his Will, as all Moral Laws,
which have an eternal and necessary Goodness in them are;
for the Divine Nature and Will, must be the rule and
measure of his Providence and Government, unless he
Govern the World contrary to his own Nature and Will.
Nay, Laws themselves are not only the Rule of Obdience
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50615:86"/>
to Subjects, but of Government to the Prince; and it is
universally acknowledged to be as great a miscarriage in a
Prince, not to Govern by his own Laws, as it is in Subjects
not to obey them. Princes may be guilty of such miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
but God can't; and therefore the Laws he gives
to us, are the Rules of his own Providence; and then the
Holiness of his Laws prove, that his Government and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
must be very Holy.</p>
               <p>And indeed we have very visible and sensible proofs of
this in that care he takes to encourage the Practice of
Vertue, and to discourage Wickedness. This he has done
by those great Promises which he has made to the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Laws, and by those terrible Threatnings which he
has denounc'd against the breach of them, both in this World
and in the World to come: But this is not what I mean, for
men can despise both Promises and Threatnings if they do
not see the Execution of them; and the Promises and
Threatnings of the other World, which are much the most
considerable, are out of sight, and do not so much affect
Bad men; and that which is most proper for us to consider
here, is how the external Administrations of Providence
encourage Vertue, and discourage Wickedness and Vice.</p>
               <p>Now those who believe that all the Miseries that are in
the World are the effects or rewards of Sin, as all men
must do, who believe the Scripture; nay as all men must
do, who believe that a Just and Good God governs the
World, must confess that the Divine Providence has done
abundantly enough to discourage Wickedness: For it is
visible enough how many Miseries there are in the World:
So many, and so great, as are commonly thought a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to Providence; but if they be the just recompence
of Sin, they are only an Argument of the Justice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Providence.</p>
               <p>If we believe the Scripture, Mortality and Death, and
consequently all those Infirmities and Decays of Nature,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50615:87"/>
all those Pains and Sicknesses and Diseases, which are not
the effect of our own Sins, or which we do not inherit from
our more immediate Parents, as an entail of their Sins, are
owing to the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> which brought Death upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and all his Posterity; and such a curse upon the earth,
as has entail'd Labour and Sorrow on us.</p>
               <p>As for many other Miseries and Calamities of life, they
are visibly owing to our own, or to other mens Sins; Such
as Want and Poverty, Infamy and Reproach, Seditions and
Tumults, violent Changes and Revolutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all the Miseries and Desolations of War. Take
a survey in your thoughts of all the several sorts of Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which are in the World, and tell me what place they
could find here, by what possible means they could enter
into the World, were Sin banished out of it? What Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
could disturb Human life, were all men Just, and
Honest, and Charitable, did they love one another as
themselves? Perfect Vertue is not only an innocent and
harmless, but a very beneficial thing; it does no hurt, but
all the good it can, both to it self and others; and when
there is nothing to hurt us, neither within, nor without,
we can suffer no hurt.</p>
               <p>And is not this a sufficient proof of the Holiness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that God has so ordered the nature of things,
and the circumstances of our life in this World, that if men
will be Wicked, they shall be Miserable? Can any thing
in this World more discourage men from Sin, or make them
more zealous to reform themselves and the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than so many daily and sensible proofs, that there is
no expectation of a secure state of rest and happiness,
while either they themselves, or other men, with whom
they must of necessity converse, or have something to do,
are Wicked.</p>
               <p>For you must remember, that I am not now a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Justice, but the Holiness of Providence; and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50615:87"/>
therefore it is no Objection against what I have now said,
That many times vertuous and innocent men suffer very
greatly by the Violence and Injustice of the wicked: Tho
this may be an Objection against the Justice of Providence,
which I have already accounted for, yet it is no Objection
against the Holiness of Providence, but a great justification
of it; for the more effectual care God has taken to give all
mankind an abhorrence of all Wickedness both in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others, the more undeniable proof it is, of the
Holiness of God's Government; and this is more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done by the evils which we suffer from other mens
wickedness, than from our own. Men who are very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to their own Vices when they feel the Pleasures
and Advantages of them, learn to hate, to condemn, to
punish them, by feeling what they suffer from other mens
sins: When they lose their own Estates by Injustice and
Violence, or their Good Names by Reproaches and Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
or are injur'd in the Chastity of their Wives and
Daughters by other mens Lusts; this gives them a truer
sense of the evil of Injustice, Defamation, and Lust, and
makes them condemn these Vices in themselves, how well
soever they love them. This is the foundation of Human
Government, which keeps Mankind in order, and lays great
Restraints upon mens Lusts; for did not all Mankind suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by one another's sins, I doubt neither good nor bad men
would be so zealously concerned to punish and suppress
Vice; and therefore the Divine Providence could not have
taken a more effectual course to discourage Wickedness,
than to make all Mankind sensible of the evil of sin, by
making them all at one time or other feel the evil of sin, in
what they suffer by their own or other mens sins. For were
all men convinced (and it is strange that their own sense
and feeling will not convince them), that all the evils and
miseries of life are owing to sin, and that it is impossible to
be happy without reforming themselves and others as far as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50615:88"/>
they can, what more powerful Argument could Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
offer to us to reform the world?</p>
               <p>There are another sort of Calamities, and very terrible
ones too, which those who believe a Providence, can attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to nothing else but the just Judgment and Vengeance
of God upon a wicked world: Such as Plague, and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and Famine, Deluges, and Earthquakes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
Cities and Countries; and more ordinary Accidents,
when they act in such an extraordinary manner, as if they
were directed and guided by an unseen hand.</p>
               <p>A great many such Instances are recorded in Scripture,
and expresly ascribed to the Judgment of God: God has
threatned such Judgments in Scripture, and therefore when
we see them executed, we must conclude, That they are
inflicted by God, as the just Punishment of Sin. Nay,
those very evils and miseries which we suffer by other mens
sins, are in Scripture attributed to God, who has the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Disposal of all Events.</p>
               <p>For, as I observed before, it is not sufficient proof, that
these Judgments are not ordered by God, that we can find
some immediate Causes for them; that some of them are
owing to Natural Causes, others to Men, others to some
surprizing and unusual, or, it may be, usual Accidents; for
whoever believes a Divine Providence, does not therefore
believe that God does every thing immediately by his own
Power, without the Ministry of any Second Causes, either
Natural, or Free Agents, or what we call Accidents; but
he is only obliged to believe, That God governs all Second
Causes to produce such Effects as he sees fit; That all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
moves at God's Command; That <hi>fire and hail, snow
and vapours, wind and storm, fulfil his word,</hi> 148. Psal. 8. v.
That both good and bad men are under his Government,
and the Ministers of his Providence; and that what seems
perfect Chance to us, is directed by his Wisdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel;
and then whatever evils we suffer, and whatever the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50615:88"/>
immediate Causes of them be, we must ascribe them all to
God; especially when the same kind of Judgments, which
had the same kind of immediate Causes, are attributed to
God in Scripture, it is reason enough for us, whenever such
Judgments befal us, to ascribe them to the Providence of
God.</p>
               <p>But I need not dispute here, Whether all those Evils
and Calamities which befal sinners, are ordered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God; for till they can prove <hi>à priori,</hi> by direct
and positive Arguments, That there is no God nor a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
(which none of our Modern Atheists pretend to
do) while they dispute only by way of Objection, they
must prove, that things are not so ordered as they ought to
have been ordered, did God govern the world; and if we
can prove that they are, their Objection is answered. Now
with respect to my present Argument, to vindicate the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Providence, it is plain beyond all contradiction,
that things are so ordered for the discouragement of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and the encouragement of Vertue, as if they had
been so ordered on purpose by the greatest Wisdom, and the
most perfect Holiness; and therefore we have reason to
believe, that they were so ordered by a Wise and a Holy
Providence.</p>
               <p>As far then as to command and encourage all Holiness
and Vertue, and to forbid and discourage all Wickedness
and Vice, is a Proof of the Holiness of Providence, I
hope I have sufficiently cleared this Point; and I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to observe, That these are direct and positive
Proofs, such as every man may understand, and cannot
avoid the evidence of, and therefore are not to be shaken by
every Difficulty objected against them: For our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
is so imperfect, that there is nothing almost which
we so certainly know, but is liable to such Objections as
we cannot easily and satisfactorily answer; but one plain
positive Proof is a better Reason to believe any thing, than
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50615:89"/>
a hundred Objections against it, are not to believe it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
since it is confessed on all hands, that our knowledg
is very imperfect, it is no reason to disbelieve what we do
know, and what we are as certain of, as we can be of any
thing, because there are some things relating to the same
subject, which we do not know; and therefore unless the
Objection be as positive and evident as the proof is (and I
am sure, there are no such Objections against the Holiness
of Providence) we may very reasonably acknowledge that
there are some difficulties which we do not understand,
and yet may very reasonably believe on as we did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us now consider, What the Holiness of God's
Providence and Government does not require of him: And
I shall name but one thing which some men make a great
Objection against Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is so much
Sin and Wickedness daily committed in the World. Now
if the being of Sin in the World, or if the Wickedness of
men, were irreconcilable with the Holiness of Providence,
this were an unanswerable Objection against it; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but that Mankind are very wicked. But
what consequence is there in this, that God can't be Holy,
nor his Providence Holy, because Men are wicked? We
may as well prove that there is no God, because there is a
Devil. Such conceits as these tempted some ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
to assert Two Principles, a Good and a Bad God,
because they thought, that if there were but one God, and
he very good, there could be no such thing as evil in the
World.</p>
               <p>But would any man think this a good Argument
against the Holiness of a Prince and his Government, that
he has many Wicked Subjects? and how then do the Sins
of men come to be an Argument against the Holiness of
Providence?</p>
               <p>To state this in a few words; When we speak of God's
permitting Sin, we either mean the internal, or the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Acts of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:50615:89"/>
1. The internal Act of sin; which is nothing else but
the choice of the Will: When men chuse that which is
wicked, and fully resolve and purpose, as they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
to do it. This is the sin, this makes us guilty
before God, who knows our hearts, though Human Laws
can take no cognizance of it; as our Saviour tells us, <hi>He
that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> He who intends, and
resolves it, and wants nothing but an opportunity to commit
adultery, is an Adulterer.</p>
               <p>If God then must not permit sin, he must not suffer men
to will and to chuse any thing that is wicked, for this is the
sin; herein the immorality of the Act consists. Consider
then what the meaning of this is, that God must not leave
men to the liberty of their own choice, but must always
over-rule their minds by an irresistible Power to chuse
that which is good, and to refuse the evil. But will any
one say, that this is to govern men like men? Is this the
natural government of free Agents, to take away their
liberty, and freedom of choice? Does government signify
destroying the nature of those Creatures which are to be
governed? does this become God, to make a free Agent,
and to govern him by necessity and force?</p>
               <p>This, I confess, is a certain way to keep Sin out of the
world, but it thrusts Holiness out of the world too; for
where there is no liberty of choice, there can be neither
moral good, nor evil; and this would be a more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
objection against the Holiness of Providence, that it ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
Holiness out of the world.</p>
               <p>I grant, that God governs the minds of men as well as
their external Actions; directs and influences their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
suggests wise thoughts to them, excites good men to
great and vertuous Actions, and lays invisible restraints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lusts and Passions of Bad men; turns their Hearts,
changes their Counsels, and diverts them from ill-laid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50615:90"/>
especially when they have no external restraints on
them, and the pursuing such Counsels would be very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the world, or to the Church of God; nay, I deny
not, but in such cases God may by an irresistible power and
influence govern the minds of men, not to make them good,
but to make them the instruments of Providence in doing
such good, as they have no inclination to do; and to chain
up their Passions, that they may not do that hurt which
they intended to do; as I have shewn at large above.</p>
               <p>And I see nothing in this,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> which unbecomes the Wise
and Soveraign Lord of the world; sometimes by an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
power to govern the minds, as well as the bodies of
men, that they shall no more be able to will and chuse, than
they are to do, what they themselves please. For though
God has made man a reasonable Creature, and free Agent,
he has not wholly put him out of his own power, but that
when he sees fit, he can lay invisible restraints upon him,
or clap a counter byass upon his mind, which shall lead
him contrary to the natural tendency of his own Will and
Lusts: Thus it is in the natural World; though God has
endowed all Creatures with natural Vertues and Qualities,
and in the ordinary course of his Providence suffers them
to produce their natural effects, yet he has reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Sovereign Authority over Nature, to reverse its Laws,
or suspend its influences by an immediate and supernatural
Power; and I see no reason, why God may not do this in
the moral, as well as in the natural world, when the good
government of the world requires it.</p>
               <p>But though God may thus sometimes by a Supernatural
Power influence the minds of men, and chain up their Lusts
and Passions, yet this is not the natural government of
mankind, consider'd as free Agents; and it would no more
become God always to over-rule mens Wills in this manner,
than it would always to over-power Nature, and to govern
the natural world, not by its natural Vertues and Powers,
but by constant Miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:50615:90"/>
And if the ordinary and natural government of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
considered as reasonable and free Agents, requires
that God should leave men to the liberty and freedom of
their own choice, which is the only thing that can be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that is capable of Rewards and Punishments; then
it is no reasonable objection against the Holiness of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that God permits men to chuse wickedly, that he
does not always by an Irresistible and Sovereign Power
hinder the internal acts of Sin. Especially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that God gives men all those internal assistances of
his Grace, and lays all those internal restraints upon their
Lusts and Passions, which are consistent with the liberty of
Human Actions. Though we know not in what manner
the Holy Spirit works upon the minds of men, yet this
we know, if we believe the Gospel of our Saviour, <hi>That
God worketh in us both to will, and to do, of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
That he gives his holy spirit to those who ask him,</hi> to
be a principle of a spiritual life in them: And Bad men
themselves, if they will but confess what they feel, must
tell you, what strugglings they find in their own minds,
before they can yield to the temptations of sin: How in
some cases, especially at their first entrance upon a sinful
course of life, natural modesty, in others natural pity and
compassion, in others a natural greatness and generosity of
mind, gives check to them; how at first they blush at the
thoughts of any wickedness, and are reproached by their
own Consciences for it; how they tremble at the thoughts
of a future Judgment, or some present Vengeance to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them; and can never sin securely, till they have laughed
away the thoughts of God, and of another world. Such
care God has taken to make Sin uneasy to the minds of men,
and to reconcile them to the love of Vertue; and if after
all, they will be wicked (as free Agents may be, if they
will) this can be no blemish to the Holiness of Providence;
because it is no fault of Providence to leave free Agents to
the freedom of their own choice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:50615:91"/>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> As for the external Acts of Sin, it must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that God permits a great deal of wickedness to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
committed; such as Thefts, Murders, Adulteries,
Perjuries, and the like. Now this requires a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
for in Human Governments, this is thought a
great miscarriage, to suffer any wickedness to be actually
committed, which we can hinder the commission of. No
man would be thought innocent, much less a Prince, who
should see a man murthered, a Virgin deflowered, a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
or any other Villanies committed, without interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to hinder the commission of such wickedness, when
it was in his power to do it; and how then can we vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Holiness of Providence, which sees and observes,
and could easily hinder the commission of such wickedness,
as it daily permits? Now rightly to understand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we must consider,</p>
               <p>1. That God cannot always by an immediate Power hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the actual commission of sin, without a perpetual viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the order of Nature, and therefore this does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to an ordinary Providence, which is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of all Creatures according to their Natures. We
know indeed, That when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in great anger stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out his hand against the Prophet, who cried against the
Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> his hand immediatly dried up, so that he
could not pull it in again; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 4. And that when
<hi>Vzziah</hi> would have usurped the Priests Office to burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
he was immediatly smitten with Leprosy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
26. 19. And there is no other way but this, for God by an
immediate power to hinder the actual commission of sin, to
take away mens lives, or their natural powers of acting,
which may be of great use sometimes, when God sees fit
to work Miracles, but ought to be as rare as Miracles
are; for such a way as this of hindring sin would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put an end to the world, or to the commerce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50615:91"/>
of it, and is properly to judge the world, not to
govern it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> And therefore though God does take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a great deal of wickedness, which men intend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to commit, and watch for opportunities of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
yet he does it not by an immediate Supernatural
Power, but in Human ways; and for this reason com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us, not only to do no wickedness our selves, but by
our Advice, and Counsels, and Reproofs, Authority and
Power, to hinder other men from doing wickedly; and this
is one way whereby God hinders the actual commission of
many sins, by obliging us to hinder the commission of
them as much as we can: Which shews, how men are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to hinder the commission of those sins, which God is not
obliged by an immediate and Supernatural Power to hinder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> To be sure, for God to permit the actual commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sin, can be no greater blemish to the Holiness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
than to permit men to conceive sin in their hearts;
for therein the moral evil consists, when the Will chuses and
consents to it: The external Action may be a Natural, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical,
or Oeconomical Evil, but the moral Evil is in the
Will and Choice. And therefore the permitting or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the external commission of sin, does not so properly
concern the Holiness, as the Justice and Goodness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
for to hinder the actual commission of sin, does
not prevent the guilt of sin, for the man has the guilt of
those sins, which he would, but could not commit; but it
hinders that mischief which the actual commission of sin
would have done to other men by murthering their persons,
or defiling their Wives, or robbing them of their Estates
and good Names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> And therefore there may be wise reasons for God
to permit the external commission of many Sins, as acts of
Judgment and Vengeance on other Sinners, or as Acts of
Correction and Discipline on Good men. For since God
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50615:92"/>
very rarely Punishes Bad men, or Corrects Good men by
an immediate Power; and yet Punishments or Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the proper Exercise of Providence; it cannot
unbecome God to make the Sins of some, the Corrections
and Punishment of others; that it is so, is so visible, that
I need not prove it: For few men suffer any great Evils,
but from other mens Sins: And if God take care as most
certainly he does, to direct the evil which mens Sins do, to
light upon those who deserve to suffer by them; it is a
mighty vindication of the Wisdom and Justice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and a sufficient reason why God should permit the
external Commission of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> Especially considering how many Wise and Good
ends God can serve by permitting Sin; as to render Sin it
self infamous and hateful by the great mischief it does in the
World; to expose the Sinner himself to shame and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which both deters other men from Sin, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
very much to reform the Sinner: Nay, many times
God brings about great and excellent designs by the Sins of
men, both for the advancement of his own Glory, and the
good of Mankind, of which many instances may be given,
were it needful; which is no excuse for mens Sins, nor any
reason why God should order and over-rule men by his
Providence to commit such Sins, but is a very justifiable
reason, why God should permit the actual commission of
Sin, when he can bring good out of evil, and serve the
Wise ends of his Providence by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> And therefore lastly, God does hinder the
actual commission of Sin, as often as he sees fit
to hinder the evil and mischief, which such Sins will
do, as I have already observed; sometimes he very
remarkably disappoints wicked Designs from taking effect,
as it was in the case of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> when the
<hi>Iews</hi> were devoted to destruction: And we have as many
instances of this nature, as we have discoveries of Plots and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50615:92"/>
Treasons against the Lives of Princes, and the Peace of
Church and State; or private designs against the Lives and
Fortunes of private men; and how much unknown
Wickedness the Divine Providence every day prevents,
we cannot tell; but all the Wickedness Mankind would
commit, but can't, must be attributed to the restraints and
prevention of Providence; and then I doubt not but every
Bad man can give a great many instances of such disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
which he himself has met with; that as much
Evil as there is committed in the World, yet considering
the great Wickedness and Degeneracy of Mankind, we
have reason to believe, That God hinders a hundred times
more than he permits: And considering the Wisdom and
Justice of Providence, it becomes us to think, That God
never permits the actual commission of any Sin, but he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it for some Wise and Good ends. And this I hope is
sufficient to vindicate the Holiness of Providence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so much Wickedness, as is daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The Divine Providence is not justly chargeable
with any thing, that is utterly inconsistent and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
with the Holiness of Government.</p>
               <p>Now since the permission of Sin is very reconcilable
with the Holiness of Providence, there can be no other
reasonable Objection against it, unless we could prove by
plain and undeniable evidence, that God is the Cause and
Author of Sin; and this indeed would prove, that God
does not Govern the World with Holiness, if he had any
proper efficiency in the Sins of men: That is, did God
tempt men to Sin, or by any secret influences and impulses
incline, and even compel them to Sin.</p>
               <p>But the least thought and imagination of this is a very
great Blasphemy, and the greater and more unpardonable
Blasphemy, because there is no temptation to suspect any
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50615:93"/>
such thing of God. There is no way of knowing this, but
either by our own Sense and Experience, or by Reason, or
by Revelation.</p>
               <p>As for our own Sense and Experience, this can prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
For no man finds any other force or impulse, but
from his own lusts and sinful inclinations; <hi>Every man is
tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed.
1. Iames</hi> 14. Those who charge God with inclining mens
hearts to Wickedness, yet confess, that this is done by such
secret influences, as no man can distinguish from the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his own mind; which is plainly to confess, that
they cannot tell by their own sense and feeling, that they
are thus moved and inclined by God; but only charge their
Sins on God to excuse themselves. Every man feels what
it is that tempts him, his love of Riches, of Pleasures, or
Honours; and that the temptation and impulse is weaker
or stronger, in proportion to his fondness and passion for
these tempting Objects; but yet he feels himself at liberty
to chuse and determine himself, and finds a Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, which resists and opposes his compliance with the
temptation, as contrary to the Will and Law of God, and
the dictates of right Reason, and that for which God will
Punish him. And is there any reason for men to charge
their Sins upon God, when the only thing that gives check
to them, and makes Sin uneasy, is the conviction of their
own Consciences; that it is what God has forbid, and what
he will punish. This I think is no evidence of God's
tempting and inclining men to Sin, that he has imprinted
on our minds such a natural sense of his abhorrence of all
Evil, and such a natural awe and dread of his Justice that
while we preserve this sense strong and vigorous, no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
can fasten on us.</p>
               <p>If we appeal to Reason, the Reason of all Mankind
proves, That God does not, and cannot, tempt, incline,
and over-rule men to chuse or to act any Wickedness; for
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50615:93"/>
this is a direct contradiction to the Holiness and Purity of
his Nature, and the Justice of his Providence. All mankind
believe God to be perfect Holiness, which is essential to
the very notion of a God; and Reason tells us, that such a
Pure and Holy Being cannot be the Author of Sin; nor
were it possible to vindicate the Justice of Providence in
the punishment of sin, did men sin by Divine Impulses,
or by Necessity and Fate.</p>
               <p>And the Scripture teaches this in express words, <hi>Let
no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God:
For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth
he any man,</hi> 1. James 13. And all the Laws, and Promises,
and Threatnings, Exhortations, Reproofs, and passionate
Expostulations, which we meet with in Scripture, if they
mean any thing sincere, do necessarily suppose, that men
sin freely; and that God is so far from inclining and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men to sin, that he does all that becomes a Wise and
Holy Being to restrain and deter them from it.</p>
               <p>Now when we have such direct and positive Proofs, that
God is not, and cannot be, the Author of Sin; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that we can have no direct and positive Proof that he
is, nor is any such Proof pretended; and then some remote
and uncertain Consequences, which are owing to our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
or confused and imperfect notions of things,
or to some obscure Expressions of Scripture, are not,
and ought not to be thought sufficient to disprove a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and positive Evidence; no more than the difficulties
about the nature of motion, are a just reason to deny that
there is any motion, when we daily see and feel our selves
and the whole world move. And yet such kind of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
as these, is all that is pretended to charge the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God with the Sins of men; the most material
of which I intend at this time to examine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:50615:94"/>
1. One, and that the most plausible pretence to destroy
the Liberty of Human Actions, and to charge the Sins of
men upon God, is his Praescience and Foreknowledge of
all Future Events. That God does foreknow things to
come, is generally acknowledged by Heathens, Jews and
Christians; and Prophesy is a plain demonstration of it;
for he that can foretell things to come, must fore-know
them.</p>
               <p>Now from hence they thus argue, What is certainly
fore-known, must certainly be; and what is thus certain,
is necessary: and therefore if all future Events are certain,
as being certainly foreknown; then all things, even all
the Sins of men, are owing to Necessity and Fate: And
then God, who is the Author of this Necessity and Fate,
must be the Cause and Author of mens Sins too.</p>
               <p>Now in answer to this I readily grant, That nothing can
be certainly fore-known, but what will certainly be; but
then I deny, that nothing will certainly be, but what has
a necessary Cause. For we see ten thousand effects of free
or contingent Causes, which certainly are, though they
might never have been; for whatever is, certainly is; and
whatever certainly is now, was certainly, though not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
future a thousand years ago. That man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
very little, who knows not the difference between
the necessity, and the certainty of an Event. No Event is
necessary, but that which has a necessary Cause, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and sitting of the Sun; but every Event is certain,
which will certainly be, though it be produced by a Cause
which acts freely; and might do otherwise, if it pleased,
as all the free Actions of men are; some of which, though
done with the greatest freedom, may be as certain, and as
certainly known, as the rising of the Sun. Now if that
which is done freely, may be certain; and that which is
certain, may be certainly known; then the certainty of
God's Fore-knowledge only proves the certainty, but not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50615:94"/>
the necessity of the Event: And then God may fore-know
all Events, and yet lay no necessity on mankind to do any
thing that is wicked.</p>
               <p>In the nature of the thing, fore-knowledge lays no
greater necessity upon that which is fore-known, than
knowledge does upon that which is known; for fore-knowledge
is nothing but knowledge; and knowledge is
not the cause of the thing which is known, much less the
necessary cause of it. We certainly know at what time the
Sun will rise and sit every day in the year, but our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not the cause of the Sun's rising or sitting: Nay, in
many cases, in proportion to our knowledg of men, we may
with great certainty foretel what they will do, and how
they will behave themselves in such or such circumstances;
and did we perfectly know them, we should rarely, if ever
mistake; for though men act freely, they do not act arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
but there is always some byass upon their minds,
which inclines and draws them; and the more confirmed
habits men have of Vertue or Vice, the more certainly and
steadily they act, and the more certainly we may know
them, without making them either vertuous or vicious.</p>
               <p>Now could we certainly know what all men would do,
before they do it, yet it is evident, that this would neither
make, nor prove them to be necessary Agents. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though the perfection of the Divine Knowledge is
such, as to know our thoughts afar off, before we think
them, yet this does not make us think such Thoughts, nor
do such Actions.</p>
               <p>How God can foreknow things to come, even such
Events as depend upon the most free and contingent Causes,
we cannot tell; but it is not incredible that Infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
should do this, when Wise men, whose Knowledge
is so very imperfect, can with such great probability, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to the degree of certainty, foresee many Events, which
depend also upon free and contingent Causes: And if we
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50615:95"/>
will allow, that God's Praescience is owing to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Knowledge, then it is certain, that it neither
makes, nor proves any fatal necessity of Events. If we
say indeed, as some men do, that God foreknows all things,
because he has absolutely decreed whatever shall come to
pass, this I grant does infer a fatal necessity; and yet in
this case, it is not God's Fore-knowledge, but his Decree,
which creates the necessity: All things, upon this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
are necessary, not because God foreknows them,
but because by his unalterable Decrees he has made them
necessary; he foreknows, because they are necessary, but
does not make them necessary by foreknowing them; but
if this were the truth of the case, God's Praescience, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
only as fore-knowing, would be no greater perfection
of knowledge, than men have, who can certainly fore-know
what they certainly intend to do, and it seems God
can do no more. But thus much we learn from these mens
Confession, That Foreknowledge, in its own nature, lays
no necessity upon Human Actions; that if God can fore-know,
what he has not absolutely and peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
how certain soever such Events may be, his Fore-knowledge
does not make them necessary. And therefore
we cannot prove the necessity of all Events from God's
Fore-knowledge, till we have first proved, that God can
foreknow nothing but what is necessary: That is in truth,
That there is no such Perfection as Praescience belonging to
the Divine Nature; for to foreknow things in a Decree,
or only in necessary Causes, is no more that perfection of
Knowledge, which we call Praescience, than it is Praesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in us, to know what we intend to do to morrow, or
that the Sun will rise to morrow. But that God's Fore-knowledge
is not owing to a necessity of the Event, and
therefore cannot prove any such necessity, is evident from
hence, That the Scripture, which attributes this Fore-knowledge
to God, does also assert the liberty of Human
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50615:95"/>
Actions, charges mens Sins and final Ruin on themselves,
sets before them Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing, as
I observed before: Now how difficult soever it may be to
reconcile Praescience and Liberty, it is certain, that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Liberty can never be reconciled; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if men act freely, they do not act necessarily; and if
God does foreknow what men will do, and yet men act
freely, then it is certain that God foreknows what men
will freely do: That is, That Foreknowledge is not
owing to the necessity, but to the perfection of Knowledge:
And this is enough to satisfy all Christians, who cannot
reason nicely about these matters, that this Argument from
Praescience to prove the necessity of Human Actions, and
consequently to charge mens Sins upon God, must be falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and deceitful, because the Scripture teaches the Fore-knowledge
of God, and yet charges the guilt of mens Sins
upon themselves: And if we believe the Scripture, we must
believe both these; and then we must confess, that Praesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
does not destroy Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Another Objection against the Holiness of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is this; That God does not only foreknow, but
decrees such Events, as are brought to pass by the Sins of
men; and therefore at least in such Cases, he must decree
mens Sins too. We have a famous Example of this in the
Crucifixion of our Saviour: Never was there a more
wicked Action committed, and yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Iews,</hi>
that this was the effect of God's Counsel and Decrees. <hi>Him,
being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and
slain,</hi> 2. Acts 23.</p>
               <p>But if we consider the words carefully, this very Text
will answer the Objection. For what does St. <hi>Peter</hi> say
was done <hi>by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
God?</hi> Did they <hi>take him, and by wicked hands crucify and
slay him by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50615:96"/>
God?</hi> This is not said; but he was <hi>delivered,</hi> that is, put
into their power, <hi>by the determinate counsel and fore-knowledge
of God,</hi> and then they took him, and with wicked
hands slew him: And then we must observe, that here are
two distinct Acts of God relating to this Event; <hi>The deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
counsel,</hi> and <hi>the fore-knowledge of God.</hi> The Will
or Counsel of God, which he had fore-ordain'd, and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined,
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was, that Christ should
die an Expiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the world, which
was a work of such stupendious Wisdom, Goodness, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Justice, that nothing could more become God,
than such Counsels and Decrees. But then by his Infinite
Praescience and Foreknowledge he saw by what means
this would be done, if he thought fit to permit it; <hi>viz.</hi>
by the Treachery of <hi>Iudas,</hi> by the Malice of the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and by the Compliance of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Powers; and this he determined to permit, and to deliver
him up into their hands; the certain effect of which would
be, that they would take him, and with wicked hands cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify
him, and slay him. So that though God did decree,
that Christ should die, yet he did not decree, that <hi>Judas</hi>
should betray him, or that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises,</hi> and
<hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> should condemn and crucify him; but this
he foresaw, and this he decreed to permit, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
his own Wise Counsels for the Salvation of mankind
by such Wicked Instruments; and there is nothing in all
this unworthy of God, or unbecoming the Holiness of his
Providence. And thus it is with reference to all other Events,
which are decreed by God; He never decrees any thing but
what is holy and good; and though he many times accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishes
his Wise Decrees by the Wickedness and Sins of
men, yet he never decrees their Sins; but by his foresight
and wonderful Wisdom, so disposes and orders things, as to
make their Sins, which they freely and resolvedly commit,
and which nothing but an irresistible Power could hinder
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50615:96"/>
them from committing, serve the Wise and Gracious ends
of his Providence. This is Wisdom too wonderful for us; but
thus we know it may be, and thus the Scripture assure us it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Another pretence for charging God with the Sins
of men, is from some obscure expressions of Scripture;
which, when expounded to a strict literal sense, as some
men expound them, seem to attribute to God some kind of
Causality and Efficiency in the Sins of men.</p>
               <p>But unless we will make the Scripture contradict it self,
it is certain, that those few Texts, which seem to make
God the Author of Sin, are misunderstood: Because not
only some few particular Texts, but all the natural Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we have of God, the very nature and design of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and three parts of the Bible, either directly, or by
necessary consequence, prove the contrary. And suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
then, that we could give no tolerable account of such
Texts, is it not more reasonable to conclude, that it is only
our ignorance of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Language and Phrase, which
makes them obscure and difficult to us, than to expound
them to such a sense, as contradicts all the rest of the
Bible?</p>
               <p>But I do not intend this for an Answer, or as some will
call it an Evasion, but shall consider these Texts particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
And the first place relates to God's hardening
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, that he should not let the People of <hi>Israel</hi>
go, notwithstanding all the signs and wonders which
<hi>Moses</hi> wrought in <hi>Egypt: 4. Exod.</hi> 21. Where God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
tells <hi>Moses,</hi> that he would <hi>harden Pharaoh's heart;</hi>
and in the Story it self, it is several times expressed, that
<hi>God did harden Pharaoh's heart;</hi> and he who hardens the
heart, seems to be the efficient Cause of all those Sins, which
such a hard heart commits.</p>
               <p>Now rightly to understand this, which has given so
much trouble to Divines, there are many things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:50615:97"/>
Hardness of heart is a Metaphorical expression, and
signifies such a firmness and obstinacy of temper or resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as will yield to no motives or perswasions, that will
no more receive any impressions, than a hard and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
Rock. And therefore to harden the heart, is to give
it such a stiffness and obstinacy, as will not yield. But
then there are several ways of hardening mens hearts, and
some of them very Innocent and Holy, as well as Just;
and before we charge the Divine Providence upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
we must know in what way God hardens: imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to infuse into mens hearts an unrelenting hardness
and obstinacy in a sinful course, is inconsistent with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Providence, and would in the most proper sense
make God the Author of Sin; but though God says, he
would harden <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> he does not say, that he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
hardness into <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart.</p>
               <p>For we may observe, That men who have first hardened
themselves, take the most innocent occasions to grow
harder; nay, are hardened by such usage, as would either
break or soften other men: And those who treat them in
such a manner, as their wicked hearts abuse to harden
themselves, may be said to harden them; as in common
speech, we charge those with undoing and hardening
their Children and Servants, who have spoiled them by too
much indulgence, or by too great severity; and this is the
account that <hi>Origen</hi> gives of it. And indeed when men
are said to harden themselves, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is often said <hi>to
harden his own heart,</hi> and yet God is said to harden them;
there can be no other account given of it but this, that men
take occasion from what God does; take occasion, where
no occasion was given, to harden themselves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
observes the <hi>Iews</hi> did from God's patience and long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
2. <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5. Or despisest thou the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and forbearance, and long suffering; not knowing that
the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance;</hi> i.e. should
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50615:97"/>
lead thee to repentance, not harden thee in Sin, though it
have another effect through thy own wickedness. <hi>But
after thy hardness and impenitent heart,</hi> growest more hard
and impenitent by God's forbearance, <hi>and treasurest up unto
thy self wrath against the day of wrath and the revelation of
the righteous judgment of God.</hi> And thus God hardened
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> took occasion to harden himself,
from those Judgments which ought to have softened him;
and God foreseeing that this would be the effect of it, says,
I will harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart; not, I will infuse hardness
into him, but, I will do such things as I certainly know
his hard and wicked heart will improve into new occasions,
and new degrees of hardness. For it is no reason either
for God or men to forbear doing what Wisdom, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Goodness direct to be done, because hardened
Sinners will harden themselves the more by it. And that
this is the truth of the case appears from the whole Story.</p>
               <p>That which hardened <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and made him so resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to part with <hi>Israel,</hi> was the great advantage he
made of their Service and Bondage, which made him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to think of sending away a people, which were so
useful to him. To conquer this obstinate humour God
sends <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver <hi>Israel with a mighty arm, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched
hand. Moses</hi> wrought such mighty Wonders,
and inflicted such miraculous and terrible Judgments on
<hi>Egypt,</hi> as any one would have thought the most proper
means, not to have hardened, but to have broken and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
the most hardened hearts; but this had a contrary
effect upon a hardened <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and it is visible what it was
that hardened him.</p>
               <p>Some of these Signs and Wonders were imitated by the
Magicians, as turning their Rods into Serpents, and
Water into Blood, and bringing Frogs upon the Land;
and upon this he hardened his heart; though the Plague
of Frogs was so grievous, that it made him somewhat
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50615:98"/>
relent, and promise to let the People go, and Sacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, if the Frogs might be removed; but then
God's goodness in removing this Plague hardened him, as
it is expresly observed, That <hi>when Pharaoh saw there was
respite, he hardened his heart, 8. Exod.</hi> 15. And thus it was
in the succeeding Judgments; while any judgment was
upon him, he yielded, and promised fair to let the people
go; that had any one of those Judgments continued on
him till he had parted with <hi>Israel,</hi> he had certainly sent
them away long before; but when he saw one Judgment
removed after another, he thought there would be an end
of them at last, and it were better to endure a while than
to part with <hi>Israel;</hi> and thus God hardened his heart, and
he hardened his own heart; till the Death of all the First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
put him, and his Servants, and all the People into
such a terrible fright, that they were glad to get rid of <hi>Israel</hi>
to save their own Lives.</p>
               <p>And to compleat all, God still hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart
to pursue after <hi>Israel,</hi> that he might overthrow him and all
his Host in the Red Sea: And for that end, <hi>God led the
people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea,
that Pharaoh might say, They are intangled in the land, the
wilderness hath shut them in: and it was told the king of
Egypt, that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of
his servants was turned against the people; and they said, Why
have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
14. Exod.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. The report of their flying, and the
apprehension of their being intangled in the Wilderness,
made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Servants quickly forget what they
had suffered in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and think of nothing but the loss of
the Service of <hi>Israel,</hi> which hardened them to a new
pursuit, and was ordered by God to that end, that <hi>he might
be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his Host.</hi> This is
the account the Scripture gives us of God's hardening
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, which contains nothing that unbecomes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50615:98"/>
a Wise and a Holy Being. For though it can never become
a Holy God to infuse hardness into mens hearts; yet when
men have hardened themselves, and will abuse all the Wise
methods of Providence to harden themselves, and are now
ripe for destruction, it very much becomes a Just and
Righteous God, to exercise them with such Providences
as he knows will still harden them, till they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such infamous examples of Wickedness, as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a more glorious and exemplary Vengeance: Which
is another thing to be considered in the case of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
very necessary to the full understanding this difficult case of
God's hardening mens hearts.</p>
               <p>God had peremptorily decreed, not only to deliver <hi>Israel,</hi>
but to punish <hi>Egypt,</hi> both King and People for the cruel
oppression of <hi>Israel.</hi> And therefore he might without any
more solemnity have destroyed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his People, and
Land, and have carried <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a mighty
hand: But when they had deserved to be Punished and
Destroyed, and God had resolved to Punish them, the
manner of their Punishment was at the free disposal of the
Divine Wisdom; and therefore he chose to Punish them in
such a way, as might make the Glory and Power of the
God of <hi>Israel</hi> known to the World. And this is the very
account which God himself gives, why he took such a
course with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as he foresaw would harden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
him in his resolutions of not parting with <hi>Israel,</hi> when
he could have forced him at the expence of fewer Miracles
to have sent them away, if he had so pleased. <hi>I will harden
Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and wonders in the land
of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I
may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and
my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by
great judgments. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the
Lord, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out
the children of Israel from among them, 7. Exod.</hi> 3, 4, 5.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50615:99"/>
The same thing he tells <hi>Pharaoh. I will at this time send
all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and
upon thy people, that thou mayest know, that there is none like
me in all the earth. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I
may smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt be
cut off from the earth. And in very deed for this cause have I
raised thee up,</hi> have all this time preserved thee, and not cut
thee off, <hi>for to shew in thee my power, and that my name may
be declared throughout all the earth, 9. Exod.</hi> 14, 15, 16.
And this reason God gives why he hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart
to pursue <hi>Israel, I will be honoured upon Pharaoh and upon all
his host, that the Egyptians may know, that I am the Lord,
14. Exod.</hi> 4. This is diligently to be observed to vindicate
the Holiness and Justice of Providence. For though
God infuses no hardness into mens hearts, yet if he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
them with such Providences, as he foresees will harden
them, and does this with an intention and design to harden
them; this signifies his Will to harden them, and such a
moral Efficiency in using hardening Providences, as will
as certainly harden them, as if he had infused hardness into
them. And this makes little difference, whether God
hardens men by external Providences, or by an internal
Operation on their minds; when he intends such Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to harden them, and knows that they will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
do it.</p>
               <p>Now I readily grant, that tho God infused no hardness
into <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart, nor did any thing which unbecomes a
holy God to do; yet he did intend to harden him, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to harden him on purpose to multiply his Judgments
on <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to destroy him and all his Host in the <hi>Red
Sea;</hi> for this is so plainly expressed, that we cannot deny
it. Nay, I readily grant, that the Providence of God
would be justly chargeable with mens Sins, did he without
any respect to the merit and desert of the Persons, by such
insensible methods betray them into sin, with an intention
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50615:99"/>
to harden them: For what man is there of such a firm and
constant vertue, as to be able to resist all Temptations,
which a long series of Providences, chosen and directed
for that purpose by a Divine Wisdom, could bring him
into?</p>
               <p>But yet when men have sinned themselves into such a
hardened state, as to deserve to be destroyed; and when
God is so far provoked by their Sins, as to resolve to destroy
them, it becomes the Wisdom, and the Justice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any impeachment of his Holiness, to harden men by
external Events and Appearances; not in Sin, which can
never become a Holy God, but in such ruinous Courses as
their own wicked hearts betray them to, and as will bring
inevitable ruin on them. And this is the true resolution on
this Case;</p>
               <p>1. That God never hardens any men till they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and he is resolved to destroy them.</p>
               <p>2. That then he does not harden them in Sin, but in
such Ruinous Counsels as their own Sins betray them
to.</p>
               <p>3. That all this is done, not by the natural, or moral
efficacy, but by their own wicked abuse of the Divine
Providence.</p>
               <p>4. To compleat all, When God has thus determined to
destroy any Person, or People, he many times inflicts on
them a penal blindness and infatuation, not to see the things
which concern their peace.</p>
               <p>These four Particulars contain a full and easy account of
this perplext Doctrine of God's hardening mens hearts;
and therefore I shall speak distinctly, but briefly to them.</p>
               <p>1. That God never hardens men, till they have deserved,
and he is resolved, to destroy them. This must be laid as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50615:100"/>
the foundation of all; for by what means soever God
hardens men, how innocent soever they may appear, if he
intends to harden them, not because they deserve, and
he has determined to destroy them, but only that they may
deserve to be destroyed, and that he may with some fair
appearance of Justice destroy them; it would be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to satisfy equal and impartial Judges of the Justice and
Holiness of Providence: But if men have hardened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Sin beyond all the ordinary methods of recovery,
and have so provoked a good and merciful God, that he gives
them over to ruin and destruction; then by what means
soever they are hardened, which are not directly sinful,
there can be no just reason to question either the Justice, or
Goodness, or Holiness of God, upon this account. For
when men have sinned to that degree, as to deserve imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
destruction, and to provoke God to pass a final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
on them; God may either immediately destroy them,
or keep them in that hardened state, like condemned Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
reserved in Chains, for a more publick and solemn
Execution. And this is all that is meant by God's harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, and this all mankind must allow to be just and
holy.</p>
               <p>This was the case of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who
had so grievously oppressed <hi>Israel,</hi> that God was resolved
to punish them for it: And therefore he sent <hi>Moses</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
a great many Miraculous Judgments on them, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereby to convince <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who had hardened
himself against the power of Miracles to convince him, and
whom he had resolved to destroy; but only to lay <hi>Egypt</hi>
waste, and to take a signal Vengeance upon that Cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor,
by overthrowing him and his Host in the <hi>Red Sea:</hi>
And therefore he so ordered the execution of these Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that the hardened heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should grow
more hardened by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:50615:100"/>
Thus when God had determined to cut off <hi>Ahab,</hi> as his
grievous Sins had long before deserved, he intended to
harden him to go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> and fall there; and
for that purpose suffered a lying Spirit to enter into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to encourage the King in that Fatal Expedition; and
as God had foretold, they did prevail against <hi>Micaiah</hi> the
Prophet of the Lord, who plainly told him, that he should
fall in it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Thus when God was so provoked with the Sins of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
that he had resolved to deliver them into the hands of
the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who should destroy their City and Temple,
and carry them captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he pronounced this
hardening Sentence on them, <hi>Go, and tell this people, Hear
ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive
not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears
heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
convert, and be healed.</hi> What this means, ye shall hear
more hereafter; all that I observe at present, is, That this
Sentence was not pronounced against them, till God had
resolved to carry them into captivity, and to lay their City
and Countrey desolate, as the Prophet tells us in the next
Verse. <hi>Then, said I, Lord, how long? And he answered,
until the cities be wasted without Inhabitants, and the houses
without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</hi> 6. Isaiah 9,
10, 11.</p>
               <p>And this was the state of the <hi>Iews</hi> in our Saviour's days,
when God had determined the final destruction of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, their City, Temple and Polity, for their
great Sin in crucifying their <hi>Messias,</hi> as Christ tells us,
23. <hi>Matth. 37, 38, 39. O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, Thou that
killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee,
how often would I have gathered thy children together, even
as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
not? Behold your house is left unto you desolate. For I say</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:50615:101"/>
unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 41,
42, 43, 44. And when he came near he beheld the city, and
wept over it; saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, in this
thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they
are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee,
that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass
thee round, and keep thee in on every side; and shall lay thee
even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they
shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: Because thou
knowest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
               <p>Now with respect to this final Sentence which God had
pronounced against them, though he delayed the execution
of it for forty years, St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies to them the Case of a
hardened <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom God spared also a great while,
as he did them, though he had determined to destroy him
by a signal overthrow; <hi>to shew his power, and that his name
might be declared throughout all the earth.</hi> And there was
no reason to quarrel with God, though he delayed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them for some years after he had determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them, to make them also a more remarkable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a just Vengeance, and more glorious Power. <hi>What
if God willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known,
endureth with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted
for destruction?</hi> That is, delays for many years the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of those whom he has decreed to destroy for their
great sins, by an irreversible Sentence: For such only are
<hi>the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction,</hi> 9. Rom. 17, 22.
And for the same reason he applies to them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy
of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> concerning the judicial blindness and
deafness of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, when God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to deliver them into the hands of the King
of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was a Prophesy of them also, and
received its full accomplishment in the final destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> 28. Acts 26, 27. So that it is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50615:101"/>
plain from all these Examples, (and I know no Example in
all the Scripture to the contrary) that God never hardens
men, till he has first determined to punish or to destroy them:
And I shall only add; That this hardening, which is the
effect of God's Decree to punish, or to destroy, relates only
to some Temporal Evils and Calamities which God intends
to bring on them, not to the Eternal Miseries of the next
world. God is never said to harden any men, that he may
eternally damn them, that is wholly owing to their own
hard and impenitent hearts; but God does sometimes
harden men, in order to take a more exemplary Vengeance
on them in this world, which serves the wise Ends of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and makes his Power and Glory known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> This will more evidently appear, if we consider,
That God is never said to harden any men in sin, but he
only hardens and confirms them in such Ruinous Counsels
as will bring that destruction on them, which God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and determined for them. They harden themselves
in sin, and make it wise and just for God to punish or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them; and when God resolves to do so, then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he hardens them in such Courses as will bring a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Vengeance on them.</p>
               <p>I need instance only in the Case of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which is
the most express Text we have for God's hardening men.
Now what did God harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in? Did he harden
him against believing <hi>Moses,</hi> and those Miracles which he
wrought in the Name, and by the Power of the God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi>
No such matter; there is no such thing said; but he
hardened him not to let the People go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened himself against believing <hi>Moses,</hi> and
the Miracles he wrought, against owning and submitting
to the Power and Sovereign Authority of the God of <hi>Israel;</hi>
though when he felt the Judgments inflicted on him, they
were so uneasy, as to make him relent, and to promise to
send <hi>Israel</hi> away: But his great concernment was, how to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50615:102"/>
keep <hi>Israel,</hi> and to get rid of these Plagues; and his firm
Resolution was never to part with <hi>Israel,</hi> as long as he had
any hopes that he might keep them safely. Now though
it was indeed a very great evil to disbelieve <hi>Moses,</hi> and to
disobey God's Command, attested and confirmed by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
yet separated from this, it was no moral evil not to
part with <hi>Israel,</hi> who had now been the Subjects of <hi>Egypt</hi>
for above Two hundred years And therefore when the
Dispute was not about believing and obeying God and
<hi>Moses,</hi> which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had no regard to, but only whether
he should let <hi>Israel</hi> go to avoid these Plagues which he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their sake; though God did not harden him in his
infidelity and disobedience, yet he did harden him against
parting with <hi>Israel;</hi> that is, he hardened him not in sin,
for the infidelity and disobedience, which was the only sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of it, was wholly his own; but he hardened him in
the most Ruinous Counsel he could possibly have taken,
which would bring new Plagues on <hi>Egypt,</hi> and end in his
own final Ruin.</p>
               <p>This was the case of <hi>Ahab,</hi> God did resolve to send him
to <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> to fall there, and suffered a lying Spirit
to enter into the Mouths of his Prophets, and to harden
him in that expedition, against the Prophetick Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of <hi>Micaiah;</hi> that all things considered, it may be said,
that God perswaded, and that God hardened <hi>Ahab</hi> to go to
<hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi> Now suppose this, yet it is not to harden
him in Sin; for it was no Sin to go to Fight against
<hi>Ramoth Gilead;</hi> but it was only to harden him in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
attempt, and which God intended should be fatal to
him.</p>
               <p>A great many Instances of this nature may be given,
where God hardens men in such courses as shall, and are
intended by God to prove either a very sore punishment to
them, or their utter Ruin; but there is no one instance can
be given of Gods persuading, or tempting, or hardening
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50615:102"/>
men in any thing, which is in its own nature evil. And
were this well considered, it would answer and shame a
great many ignorant Objections against Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> But we must farther observe, That when God does
thus harden men in Ruinous Counsels, on purpose to
punish or destroy them, he does nothing which has either
any natural or moral efficacy to harden them; but by their
own wickedness they abuse the Providence of God to
harden themselves. This I have particularly shewn in the
Case of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Those Signs and Wonders which God
wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that undeniable Proof that they
were sent by God, in that they were inflicted and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the word of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Goodness of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
one Judgment after another at his request, would
have convinced and softned other men, but hardened
him.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, That the natural end and use of God's
Patience and Long-suffering is to lead us to repentance;
and therefore when it hardens some men in sinful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Courses, as we too often see it does, there is no
reason to charge this on the Patience of God, but on the
Wickedness of men.</p>
               <p>God permitted a lying Spirit to enter into <hi>Ahab's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to persuade him to go against <hi>Ramoth-Gilead;</hi> and
though God might very justly have left him in the hands
of those False Prophets of his own making and chusing, yet
he sends his own Prophet <hi>Micaiah,</hi> whom all <hi>Israel</hi> knew
to be the Lord's Prophet, to assure him, That if he went
against <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> he should perish there. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God did not deceive <hi>Ahab,</hi> but he deceived himself, by
preferring the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> before the Lord's Prophet,
which was owing to his own wicked Idolatrous heart.</p>
               <p>God never deceives or hardens any men by the external
Events and Appearances of Providence, but those, whose
own lusts and wicked hearts deceive and harden them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:50615:103"/>
There is always enough, even in those Providences,
which men abuse to harden themselves, to have reclaimed
and softened them, if they would have made a wise use of
it. And when men have sinned themselves into such a
hardened state as to forfeit the protection of Providence;
God may do what is wise, and just, and holy, though he
knows, that they will abuse it to their own ruin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to bring ruin on them by it. And it is a glorious
vindication of the Wisdom, and Goodness, and Holiness
of God, when all the world shall see, that such mens ruin
is wholly owing to themselves, to their wicked abuse of all
those wise and gracious Methods, which would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
and saved them, if they would have been reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and saved.</p>
               <p>4thly, <hi>To understand the full and comprehensive notion
of God's hardening men, we must observe farther, That
when God has been so far provoked, as to resolve the final
destruction of any Person, or People, he many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
on them a judicial blindness and infatuation, which
betrays them to such foolish Counsels, as must inevitably
prove their ruin. That God many times does this, the
Scripture witnesseth,</hi> He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,
and maketh the judges fools. He removeth away the speech
of the trusty <hi>(in whose Counsel men used to confide)</hi> and
taketh away the understanding of the aged. He taketh away
the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them
to wander in a wilderness, where there is no way. <hi>That is,
entangles and perplexes their Counsels.</hi> They grope in the
dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken
man: <hi>To reel from one Resolution to another, in great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
what to do;</hi> 12. Iob 17, 20, 24, 25. <hi>Thus</hi>
19. Isaiah 11, 12, 13, 14. Surely the princes of Zoan are fools,
the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become bruitish.
How say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son
of ancient kings? Where are they? where are thy wise men?
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50615:103"/>
and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the Lord of
Host hath purposed upon Egypt. The princes of Zoan are
become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also
seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.
The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof,
and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
drunken man staggereth in his vomit.</p>
               <p>We have a plain Example of this in <hi>Absalom,</hi> whom God
resolved to punish for his Rebellion against <hi>David,</hi> his King
and Father; <hi>David</hi> had prayed, that God would turn <hi>the
counsel of Ahitophel into foolishness;</hi> and accordingly God
so ordered it, as to defeat the good Counsel of <hi>Ahitophel</hi> by
the Advice of <hi>Hushai.</hi> And the reason of it is given; <hi>For
the Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahitophel,
to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom,</hi>
2 Sam. 17. 14.</p>
               <p>This makes men as hard as they are blind; they mistake
their true interest, flatter themselves with vain hopes, run
themselves into the most apparent and inevitable dangers,
without seeing them themselves, though every body else
sees them: And something of this nature we must own in
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Case: For without such an infatuation, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to conceive, that he should have persisted so long in
his Resolution not to part with <hi>Israel,</hi> though it were to
the utter ruin and desolation of his Countrey; much less,
that he should have pursued them into the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> whose
fluid Walls threatned him with immediate destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this I take to be that blindness which God threatens
against</hi> Iudah, 6. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 9, 10. Go and tell this people, Hear
ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive
not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears
heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and
hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
convert, and be healed. <hi>For here is a double blindness ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of in the Text; one which they brought upon
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50615:104"/>
themselves, another which God threatens to inflict on
them.</hi> They did hear, but not understand; they did see, but
not perceive: <hi>that is, They stopt their own ears, and shut
their own eyes, against all the Adomonitions and Reproofs
of God's Prophets: For thus our Saviour expounds it, as
their own act, and wilful voluntary blindness.</hi> 13. Matth.
14, 15. And in them is fulfilled the prophesy of Isaiah; <hi>(for a
Prophesy it was, as it concerned the</hi> Iews <hi>in our Saviour's
days, though it was a description of the actual deafness and
blindness of the</hi> Iews <hi>in the Prophet's days)</hi> which saith, By
hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall
see, and shall not perceive. For this peoples heart is waxed gross,
and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they
closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear
with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should
be converted, and I should heal them. <hi>And thus St.</hi> Paul <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
it,</hi> 28. Acts 26, 27.</p>
               <p>This is their sinful blindness and deafness, which is
wholly owing to themselves, and for the punishment of
which God threatens them with a penal and judicial blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For when God commands the Prophet <hi>to make their
heart fat, and their ears heavy, and to shut their eyes,</hi> it can
signify nothing else but his passping a final Decree and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Blindness and Deafness on them: Not such a Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as should betray them to, and harden them in sin;
God may leave men in such a state of Blindness, when they
have wilfully blinded and hardened themselves, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inflicts it: But such a Blindness, as would betray them
into that ruin and destruction whcih God had so justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
for them: For this Blindness and Deafness which was
inflicted on them in the Prophet's days, was in order to
their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the destruciton of their
City and Temple by the <hi>Chaldaeans;</hi> that in our Saviour's
days was in order to their final destruction by the <hi>Romans;</hi>
and our Saviour tells us what kind of Blindness was inflicted
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50615:104"/>
on them; that <hi>the things belonging to their peace,</hi> which
would preserve their Nation from being destroyed, <hi>were
now hid from their eyes,</hi> 19. Luke 42 And the Story veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
this: For certainly never was there a greater infatuation
upon any People, than upon the <hi>Iews</hi> at both times; who
forced both the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> to destroy them,
whether they would or no; and when they intended no
such thing. And many Examples there are of such a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Blindness and Infatuation in every Age of the world:
There are seldom any great and remarkable Calamities,
which befall any persons, especially Nations, but By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers
see, how they undo themselves by their own stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
wilfulness and folly: As has been long since observed.
<hi>Quos perdere vult Iupiter, Prius dementat.</hi> That God first
blinds and infatuates those, whom he intends to destroy.
And this is what the Scripture means by hardening mens
hearts, and blinding their eyes, as I hope appears from
what I have now discoursed; and no man has any reason
to quarrel either with the Justice or Holiness of God upon
this account. But we have all great reason to take warning
by these Examples, lest we provoke God so long by our
sins, by our own wilful blindness and hardness, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
this judicial Blindness on us, that he shut our eyes not
to see the things that belong to our peace; whcih we have
so many sad symptoms of already among us, that it is time
to take warning. Nothing can be more just, than for God
to harden those men to their own ruin, who harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against his fear: So to blind those, who will not see,
nor regard their Duty, as to mistake their Interest too.
And the only way to prevent such a judicial Hardness and
Infatuation, is to reverence God, to have respect to all
his Commandments; in the first place to take care of our
Duty, and then to commit our ways unto the Lord, in a
secure dependance on his Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:50615:105"/>
There are several other Texts of Scripture alledged to
this purpose, to charge God with the sins of men; but
they will receive a shorter Answer. As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Those Texts which ascribe what is done by the sins
of men to God's doing. But the Answer to this is plain;
for God can and does bring to pass a great many wise and
holy Designs by the sins of men, without being the Author
of their sins; and it is only the Event which is attributed to
God, not the Sin, whereby such Events are brought to pass.
This will appear at the first view by considering some of
these Texts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren sold him to the <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where God advanced him to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s
Throne. <hi>Ioseph</hi> tells his Brethren, That though they sold
him, it was God that sent him before them into <hi>Egypt</hi> to
preserve their lives: <hi>So now it was not you that sent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but God,</hi> 45. Gen. 5, 7, 8. <hi>Ioseph</hi> does not say,
That it was from God that his Brethren sold him; this was
their own Act, and all the wickedness of it was their own;
but it was God who sent him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
never thought of, nor intended, their only concern
being to get rid of him; and when God did that, which
they never intended to do, that may well be said to be God's
doings, who permitted their wickedness, and made use of
it to accomplish his own wise Counsels: as he tells his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
<hi>As for you, ye thought evil against me, but God
meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save
much people alive,</hi> 50. Gen. 20.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iob</hi> was plundered by the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi>
he attributes it to God. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath
taken away,</hi> 1. Job 21. And so must all men say, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Providence, that all the good or evil that happens to
us in this world, whoever be the immediate Instruments of
it, is ordered and disposed by God; but <hi>Iob</hi> does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50615:105"/>
attribute the wickedness of the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi>
to God: as if God could not govern and over-rule the
wickedness of Men, and Devils, without being the Author
of their wickdness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> David <hi>had committed that great sin, in defiling</hi>
Vriah<hi>'s Wife, and contriving his murther; God threatens
him by the Prophet</hi> Nathan: I will raise up evil against thee
out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
thy wives in the sight of this sun: For thou didst it secretly,
but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun,
2 <hi>Sam. 12. 11, 12. which we know</hi> Absalom <hi>accordingly
did by the Advice of</hi> Ahitophel, 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now that God did inflict this punishment upon <hi>David,</hi>
is plain from the Text; but that he either instigated <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi>
to give this Counsel, or <hi>Absolom</hi> to take it, is not
said: And if God could inflict this punishment on <hi>David</hi>
without having any hand in the sin, it is no reflection on
the Holiness of Providence. All that God expresly says he
would do in the case, was to put <hi>David</hi>'s Wives into <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>'s
power; <hi>I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and
give them unto thy neighbour;</hi> and then foretells what the
effect of this would be, and what he intended to permit
for his punishment; <hi>He shall lie with thy wives in the sight of
this sun.</hi> There was no evil in so ordering the matter, that
when <hi>David</hi> fled, he should leave his Wives behind him,
which put them into <hi>Absalom</hi>'s power; and then God
foresaw what Counsel <hi>Ahitophel</hi> would give, and how
ready <hi>Absalom</hi> would be to take it, unless he hindered it,
which he decreed not to do in punishment of <hi>David</hi>'s Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
And thus to order the permission for such an end,
though it has nothing of the guilt of the sin, yet entitles
God to the event, considered as a punishment; upon which
account, God may be said to <hi>do this before all Israel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:50615:106"/>
Thus when <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed <hi>David</hi> as he fled from <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;
David</hi> takes notice of God's hand in it; and would
no suffer <hi>Abishai</hi> to cut him off: <hi>Let him Curse, because the
Lord hath said unto him, curse David,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 10. But
evey one sees, that this must be a figurative expression,
for it is not true in the literal sense; God never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Shimei</hi> to curse <hi>David,</hi> nor did <hi>David</hi> believe in a literal
sense that he did; for then he would not have imputed the
guilt of it to him: Whereas we know, though he had
sworn to <hi>Shimei</hi> at his return, when he came to meet him,
that he would not put him to death, yet he left it in his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Charge to <hi>Solomon, not to hold him guiltless,</hi> 1 Kings 2.
8, 9. But when <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>The Lord hath bidden him
curse;</hi> all that he meant by it, or could mean by it, is no
more but this, That the sad Calamity which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God had brought on him by the Rebellion of his
Son <hi>Absalom,</hi> had given free scope to <hi>Shimei</hi>'s old and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
hatred of him, and as effectually let loose his revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Tongue, as if God had in express words commanded
him to curse <hi>David:</hi> And therefore he patiently submits to
this, as part of his punishment, and a very inconsiderable
part, when compared with the Rebellion of his Son <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi>
which gave this confidence to <hi>Shimei</hi> to curse his King.
<hi>Behold my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life;
how much more now may this Benjamite do it?</hi> 10. v. This
is no more than what <hi>David</hi> elsewhere complains of, That
God had made him the song of the Drunkards: For Bad
men will take all the advantages which the Providence of
God gives them, to reproach and scorn, and persecute the
Good; there needs no other command for this, but a fair
opportunity to do it.</p>
               <p>Some object God's giving power to <hi>Satan,</hi> first over the
Goods, and then over the Body of <hi>Iob,</hi> excepting his life:
And God's permitting a lying Spirit to enter into <hi>Ahab</hi>'s
Prophets to persuade him to go up to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead:</hi> But
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50615:106"/>
wherein the Objection lies, I cannot tell; for, I suppose,
they will not say, That God by permitting the Devil to
hurt, and to deceive, made him a malicious and lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Those are very unreasonable Objectors, who will not
allow God to make use of the Ministry of wicked Spirits to
wise and good ends, without charging him with their sins
too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But God himself tell us, That when a Prophet is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
he hath deceived him; now how is it reconcilable
with the Holiness of his Nature or Providence to deceive?
14. Ezek.</hi> 9. And if the prophet be deceived, when he hath
spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet, and I
will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the
midst of my people Israel.</p>
               <p>Now to this it is commonly answered, That God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
a Lying Spirit to possess such Prophets, as he did in
the Case of <hi>Ahab;</hi> for he only speaks here of the Prophets
of <hi>Baal</hi> such Prophets, as he would cut off for their Lying
Prophesies; and how does it unbecome God to give up the
Worshippers of Evil Spirits, their Priests and Prophets, to
be inspired and deceived by them? No true Worshipper
of God was under any temptation to be deceived by them,
because they were not the Prophets of God; and God had
always his own Prophets among them, to warn them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such lying Prophesies: Nay, it was the fault of
these Prophets, that they were deceived themselves; for
they did know, that they did not receive their Prophesies
from the Lord, but from the Heathen Idols, or that they
were their own Inventions; and when they chose to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
strange gods, and to consult their Oracles, or to divine
out of their own hearts, they chose to be deceived; and
therefore God threatens, <hi>They shall bear the punishment of
their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be even as
the punishment of him that seeketh unto him</hi> 10. v. We have
a large account of these Prophets, and severe Judgments
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50615:107"/>
denounced against them. 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> who are said <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy
out of their own hearts,</hi> and to <hi>follow their own spirits,</hi>
when they <hi>had seen nothing;</hi> to <hi>see a vain vision,</hi> and <hi>speak
a lying divination;</hi> and sometimes to attribute it to God too,
they say, <hi>The Lord saith it, albeit I have not spoken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Character the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> gives of these
Lying Prophets, inclines me to a very different sense of
these words, which seems plain and easy: Not that God
deceived them to prophesy Lies, but that God deceived
them in the event: They deceived themselves into <hi>vain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>
either by giving themselves over to Idolatry, which
betrayed them to the delusions of wicked Spirits, or by
heating their Imaginations into Enthusiastick Frensies, and
prophesying their own Hopes and Politick Guesses, which
is called, <hi>prophesying out of their own hearts,</hi> and <hi>following
their own spirits;</hi> and then God deceived all their Hopes
and Expectations, by bringing those evils on them, which
they with great assurance and confidence said, should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come. And the words plainly favour this sense: God
does not say, <hi>If a prophet be deceived to speak a thing, I the
Lord have deceived him:</hi> But <hi>if a prophet be deceived, when
he hath spoken a thing;</hi> that is, if the event does not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
his Prediction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I have deceived him,</hi> or confuted his
vain Lying Prophesy: And how would God deceive him?
that immediately follows, <hi>I will stretch out my hand upon
him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel;
and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity,</hi> both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and People. This did effectually deceive them, as
being a terrible confutation of their Prophesies, and what
God expresly threatened: <hi>Because they have seduced my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
saying, peace, and there was no peace,</hi> 13. Ezek. 8, 9, 10.
This is what God attributes to himself, as his peculiar
Prerogative and Glory, That it is <hi>He that frustrateth the
tokens of the seers, and maketh diviners mad;</hi> by deceiving
them in the events of things, and confuting their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50615:107"/>
by his Judgments. 44. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 25. as he expresly
threatned against these lying Prophets, and Diviners,
3. <hi>Micah</hi> 5, 6, 7. which is a plain Comment upon this
Text.</p>
               <p>As for what is objected about <hi>David</hi>'s numbering the
People, it is hardly worth naming, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> it is
said, <hi>The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and
he moved David against them, to say, Go, number the people.</hi>
But in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. it is expresly said, <hi>That Satan stood
up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</hi>
From whence we learn in what sense this is attributed to
God, when Satan was the immediate Tempter; only
because God, in anger against <hi>Israel,</hi> suffered Satan to
tempt <hi>David</hi> to number them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that is more considerable, that is objected from
St.</hi> Paul <hi>concerning the Heathens, whom God delivered
up to all manner of Wickedness in punishment of their
Idolatry.</hi> They changed the glory of the incorruptible God
into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
four-footed beasts, and creeping things; wherefore God also
gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own
hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves—
And for this cause God gave them up to vile affections—And
even as they did not like to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
things which are not convenient, being filled with all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
fornication, wickedness, covetousness, <hi>&amp;c.
Now is not this a Reflection on the Holiness of God, that
because Men are guilty of one Sin, he delivers them up
to all other Sins? For can a Holy God punish Sin with Sin?
Can he who hates all Wickedness, contribute any thing
to make Men more wicked than otherwise they would
be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in answer to this, we need only consider, what is
meant by God's <hi>giving them up to all uncleanness, and to a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50615:108"/>
reprobate mind;</hi> which signifies no positive Act of God,
but only his leaving them in the Power and Management
of those Evil Spirits whom they idolatrously worshipped:
For most of these Vices, to which God is said to give
them up, were the necessary Effects of their Idolatry;
were the sacred Rites and Mysteries of their Religious
Worship; and if they would worship such Gods, they
must worship them, as they would be worshipped: And
this corrupted the Lives and Manners of Men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
all the Notions of Good and Evil, and then they
were prepared for any Wickedness, which their own
vicious Inclinations, and the Circumstances of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Fortune, or those wicked Spirits could tempt
them to. This very Account we find in the Book of
<hi>Wisdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14. Wisdom 22, &amp;c.</note> where we have such another Catalogue of Vices,
as the Apostle here gives us, charged upon their Idolatry,
as the natural Effects of it.</p>
               <p>Now if Men will worship such Gods, as delight in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness
and Impurity, and all manner of Wickedness,
and who will be worshipped with the most infamous Vices,
to the utmost Reproach and Contempt of Human Nature,
there is no avoiding it, but that their Religion must cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their Lives; they give themselves up to the Worship
of Evil Spirits, and God leaves them in their Hands; for
who should have the Government of them, but the gods
they worship? They reproach the Divine Nature by vile
and sensible Representations, and God gives them up to
vile Affections, to dishonour their own Natures: They
corrupt the natural Notions they have of God, and God
gives them up to a Reprobate mind, not to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Good and Evil.</p>
               <p>The Devil had erected a Kingdom of Darkness in the
World, and God thought fit for some time to permit it,
till he sent his own Son <hi>to destroy the Works of the Devil;</hi>
and those who gave themselves up to Idolatry, became
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50615:108"/>
his Slaves and Vassals, for he is <hi>the Prince of the Power of
the Air, the Spirit that ruleth in the Children of Disobedience;</hi>
And this is God's giving them up to vile Affections, his
casting them out of his Protection, when they had first
renounced him, and giving them up to the Power of
wicked Spirits, to whom they had given themselves.</p>
               <p>So that here is no other Objection against the Holiness
of God, but that there is a Devil, who is a very impure
Spirit, and affects Divine Honour to be <hi>the god of this
World;</hi> and that God suffers him to govern those who
worship him, and to seduce them into all the Wickedness
of a Diabolical Nature: And yet that barbarous Tyranny,
which the Devil exercised over his Votaries; that impure,
flagitious Worship, which he instituted, and that Excess
of Wickedness, wherewith he corrupted the Lives of Men,
was the most effectual way to convince Mankind, what
sort of gods they worshipped; and did make the wiser
Heathens asham'd of their gods, and of their Worship;
and as Learning and Civility increased, they reformed
their Worship, and allegoriz'd away their gods, which
disposed them for the more ready Reception of that Holy
Religion, which the Son of God preach'd to the World.
Wickedness is its own Punishment, and many times proves
its own Cure; and God could not have inflicted a more
Just Punishment upon the Idolatrous World, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them up to the Tyranny of those wicked Spirits
whom they worshipped; and there was not a more likely
way to convince men of their fatal Error, than those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
and impious Rites of Worship, and that Excess
of Wickedness which their Idolatry betray'd them to,
which was enough to make Human Nature start and fly
back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The like objection is made from the Antichristian
State; the appearance</hi> of the Man of sin, whose coming is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the working of satan, with all power, and signs, and lying
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50615:109"/>
wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in
them that perish, because they received not the love of the
truth, that they might be saved: And for this cause God shall
send them strong delusions, that they shold believe a lie: That
they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Now what can be more just than this, for God to suffer
the Devil to blind those men who will not see? To deceive
those <hi>with signs and lying wonders, and all deceivableness of
unrighteousness;</hi> who <hi>do not love the trath, but have pleasure
in unrighteousness;</hi> who endeavour to deceive themselves,
and desire to be deceived? For this is all that is meant, <hi>by
sending them strong delusions to believe a lie;</hi> that God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<hi>the Man of sin</hi> to erect his Kingdom <hi>after the working of
Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders.</hi> When
men are in love with their Sins, and therefore do not love
the Truth, because it discovers and reproves their Sins, they
are out of the protection of Gods Grace, and are delivered
up to the Cheats and Impostures of Crafty Men, or of
Wicked Spirits. This is the rule and method of God's
Grace; he forces truth on no man; but those who love the
truth, shall find it. Those <hi>who cry after knowledge, aud lift
up their voice for understanding; who seek her as silver, and
search for her as for hid treasures; they shall understand the
fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God,</hi> 2. Prov. 2,
3, 4, 5. But if men wilfully shut their own eyes against
the light, God suffers <hi>the God of this world</hi> to blind them;
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3, 4. But if our gospel be hid,
it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the god of this world
hath blinded the minds of them which belive not, lest the light
of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should
shine unto them.</hi> Which should make us all afraid of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and the love of this world, which bar up the mind
against truth, and by degrees betray us to a judicial blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:50615:109"/>
There are some other Texts, which do indeed attribute
the supreme Disposal of all Human Actions to God, but
without charging his Providence with mens sins. 16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.
<hi>A mans heart deviseth his ways, but the Lord directeth his
steps. 19. 21. There are many devices in a mans heart, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.</hi> 20. 24.
<hi>Mans goings are of the Lord, how then can a man understand
his own ways?</hi> The meaning of which is, that men advise,
and deliberate, and choose freely, what they intend to do,
but when they come to action, they can do nothing, they
can bring nothing to pass, but what God will: God can
change their Counsels, or can disappoint them when they
are ripe for action, or can make what they do, serve quite
another end than what they intended. Now this only
proves what I have already observed, That the Issues and
Events of all things are in God's hands, as they must be,
if he governs the World: Men may choose what they
please, but they shall do only what God sees fit, and what
he orders for wise ends. God does not act immediately,
but makes use of Natural causes, or of the Ministries of
men, both good and bad men: Men choose and act freely,
and pursue their own Designs and Imaginations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the moral Good or Evil of the action is their own;
and God does as freely with unsearchable Wisdom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
all Events, which are therefore God's doing as well
as mens, being directed by him to serve the wise ends of
Providence, in rewarding or punishing Men or Nations as
they deserve.</p>
               <p>Thus I have, as briefly as I could, examined most of
those Texts, which have been thought to attribute to
God some kind of Causality and Efficiency in the Sins of
Men; and I hope have made it appear, that there is no such
thing intended in them; And for the conclusion of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
concerning the Holiness of Providence, I shall only
add some few Practical Inferences by way of Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:50615:110"/>
1. Not to attribute our own, or other Mens sins
to God. <hi>Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am
tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil,
neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted,
when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed,</hi> 1. James
13, 14. This is absolutely necessary to be observed; for
without it there is an end of all Religion. If God can
influence mens Minds to wicked Purposes and Counsels,
it is impossible he should hate Wickedness, or be so Holy
as many Holy men are, who would no more incline or
tempt other men to sin, than they would sin themselves:
And who will hate sin, or think that God will love him
ever the less for being a Sinner, who believes this? If God
want the Sins of Men to accomplish his own Counsels,
they must either be very unholy Counsels, which cannot
be accomplished without the Sins of Men, or he must be
a weak or unskilful Being, which is down-right Blasphemy;
for a wise and powerful Being can do whatever is Wise
and Holy without the Sins of Men. It is excellent Wisdom
indeed, when men do and will Sin, for God to accomplish
his own wise and gracious Counsels by their Sins; but to
incline, or tempt, or over-rule, or determine men to sin,
on purpose to serve himself by their Sins, this would be a
just Impeachment both of his Holiness, his Wisdom, and his
Power; and a God, who is neither Holy, Wise, nor Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
would be no very fit Object of Religious worship.</p>
               <p>To say that God decrees the Sins of men for his own
Glory, to magnifie his Mercy and Justice, in saving some
few, and in condemning the greatest part of Mankind to
eternal Miseries, is so sensless a Representation both of
the Glory, of the Mercy, and of the Justice of God, as
destroys the very Notion of all.</p>
               <p>For if Man be a meer Machine, who moves as he is
moved, how can he deserve either Well or Ill? Necessity
destroys the very Notion of Vertue or Vice, both which
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50615:110"/>
suppose a free Choise and Election; and if ther be no
Vertue nor Vice, there can be no Rewards nor Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and then there is no place neither for Justice nor
Mercy; and then God can neither glorify his Mercy,
nor his Justice, in forgiving Sins, or in punishing the
Sinner.</p>
               <p>How can any man, who believes that he is over-ruled
by God to do all the Evil he does, ever be a true Penitent,
or heartily beg God's Pardon, or reverence his Judgments,
or endeavour to do better? All Religion is founded in
this Persuasion, That God hates every thing that is
wicked; for if there be no Essential difference between
Good and Evil, there is no pretence for Religion; and if
God makes none, there is none; and if he can be the
Author of what is Evil, as well as of what is Good, he
makes no difference between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Holiness of Providence teacheth us never to
do any Evil to serve Providence, under pretext of doing
some great Good by it, which we think may be acceptable
to God. God never needs the Sins of men, and can never
approve them, whatever good ends they are intended to
serve. God indeed does many times bring Good out of
Evil, but he allows no Man <hi>to do evil, that good may
come:</hi> This St. <hi>Paul</hi> rejects with the greatest abhorrence,
and tells us, that such mens <hi>Damnation is just, 3. Rom.</hi> 8.
for it is the greatest contradiction in the World, to do evil
in order to do good; for how can a Man, who can for
any reason be persuaded to do evil, be a hearty and zealous
lover of Goodness? It is certain, that he who does any
evil, does not heartily love that goodness to which the
evil he does is opposed; and he who does not heartily
love all goodness, is a hearty lover of none: There is no
reconciling good and evil, no more than you can reconcile
contradictions; a good man will love and do that which
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50615:111"/>
is good, and an evil man will do that which is evil; and
though the Divine Wisdom can bring good out of evil,
yet evil is not, and cannot be the natural cause of good,
no more than Darkness can be the cause of Light;
and therefore a Good Design can never justify a Bad
Action: For that Bad Actions should do good, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the nature of Bad Actions; and whatever men
may intend, I'm sure no man can alter the nature of things,
and therefore can never justify himself in doing evil that
good may come.</p>
               <p>It is certain, a Wise and Holy God requires no such thing
of us; and though he very often brings about great and
admirable Designs by mens Sins, yet no man knows how
to do it, nor knows when God will do it; nor did ever any
man, who ventured upon sin in order to do some greater
good, ever do the good he intended, though many times
he runs himself into more and greater sins than ever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Nay, I dare boldly say, That no man ever deliberately
ventured upon a known sin to do some greater good by it,
but there was always some base worldly Interest at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
coloured over with a pretence of doing good, either to
deceive the world, or sometimes to deceive their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> among whom there are
those who teach and practise this Doctrine, are an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Example of it, and we have had too many sad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of it nearer home.</p>
               <p>This seems to me one reason, why those Prophesies
which concern future Ages, are generally so obscure, that
no man knows when, nor how they shall be fulfilled, that
no man may be tempted to any sin to serve Providence, and
to fulfil Prophesies. As obscure as these Prophesies are, yet
we see some heated Enthusiasts very forward to venture on
any thing to fulfil Prophesies, to pull down Antichrist, to set
up the Kingdom of Christ, especially when they hope to

set up themselves with him: But God conceals Times and
Seasons from us; and though he many times fulfils
Prophesies by the Sins of men, yet he allows no man
to sin to fulfil Prophesies. And therefore never lets us
know when, nor by what means Prohesies shall be
fulfilled. Let us lay down this as a certain Principle,
That God needs not our Sins; and that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
please him by doing evil, whatever the Event be:
He makes use of the Sins of men to serve his Providence,
but he will punish them for their Sins.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Goodness of Providence.</head>
               <p>3. THE next Inquiry is concerning the Goodness of
Providence: Though methinks it is a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Subject for our devout Meditations, than for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries;
for we need not look far to seek for proofs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of the Divine Goodness. <hi>The earth is full of
the goodness of the Lord:</hi> We see, and feel, and taste it
every day; we owe our being, our preservation, and all
the comforts of our lives to it. There is not so mean, nor
so miserable a Creature in this world, but can bear its testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the Divine Goodness: Nay, if you would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the harshness of the expression, I would venture to
say, That the Goodness of God is one of the greatest Plagues
and Torments of Hell; I mean, the remembrance of God's
Goodness, and their wicked and ungrateful abuse of it.
This is that Worm that never dieth, those sharp Reflections
men make on their Ingratitude and Folly, in making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
miserable by affronting that Goodness which would
have made them happy.</p>
               <p>Whatever other Objections fome wanton and sporting
Wits make against Providence, one would think it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any man who lives in this world, and feels what
he enjoys himself, and sees what a bountiful provision is
made for all Creatures, should question the Goodness of
Providence, by which <hi>he lives, moves, and has his being.</hi>
We should think him an extraordinary Benefactor, who
did the thousandth part for us of what God does, and should
not challenge his goodness, though he did some things
which we did not like, or did not understand; but Atheism
is founded in Ingratitude; and unless God humour them,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50615:112"/>
as well as do them good, he is no God for them. Nay, I
cannot but observe here, the perverse, as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Temper of Atheists; when they dispute against
the Justice of Providence, then God is much too good for
them; though he give us Examples enow of his Severity
against Sin, yet his Patience and Long-suffering to some
few Prosperous Sinners, is thought a sufficient Argument,
that God is not just, or that he does not govern the world:
When they dispute against the Goodness of Providence,
then God is not good enough for them: Though they see
innumerable Instances of Goodness in the government of the
world, yet this is not owing to a Good God, but to Good
Fortune, because they think they see some of the careless and
irregular Strokes of Chance and Fortune intermixt with it,
in the many Evils and Calamities of life. Now it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for God himself to answer these two Objections, to
the satisfaction of these men; and that, I think, is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
answer to them both. For should God vindicate his
Justice to the satisfaction of these men, by punishing in this
world every sin that is committed according to its desert,
there would be very little room for the exercise of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
If every man must suffer as much as he sins, the very
best men will be great Sufferers, much greater Sufferers than
any of them now are, tho their Sufferings are made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Objection against Providence; and there will be as
many formidable Examples of Misery, as there are Atheists
and Profligate Sinners, and this would be an unanswerable
Objection against the Goodness of Providence; for how
good soever God might be, if he must punish every sin, he
has no opportunity to shew his Goodness: And on the other
hand, should God be as good as these men would have him,
that is, that to prove himself good, he should not inflict any
Evils or Calamities on men, whatever their Sins or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
are; that whereas God planted Paradise only for
man in innocence, the whole world should be now a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50615:113"/>
though there is not an innocent man in it; this would
be as unanswerable an Objection against the Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
So that these men have taken care always to have
an Objection against Providence; for according to their
Notions of Justice and Goodness, God cannot be both;
which is a certain demonstration, that they mistake the true
Notion of Justice and Goodness; they are both great and
excellent Vertues; both are essential to the Idea of God;
both are necessary to the good government of the world;
and therefore both of them must be very consistent and
reconcilable with each other, both in Notion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
               <p>I have already vindicated the Justice of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and there is no great difficulty in vindicating his
Goodness, the Objections against which are founded in
plain and evident Mistakes, and therefore will receive an
easy Answer. And I shall first consider what the Mistakes
are, and then particularly answer the Objections.</p>
               <p>1. As for the first, The Mistakes either relate to
the nature of God's Goodness, or to the nature of
Good and Evil, or to the Goodness of Providence and
Government.</p>
               <p>1. The Mistakes concerning God's Goodness: And the
fundamental Mistake is this, That men consider the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God absolutely, without relation to the Nature,
Quality, or Desert of the Subjects, who are to receive
good. They contemplate Goodness in its abstracted Idea
and Notion; and whatever they conceive belongs to the
most Perfect Goodness, that they expect from God in the
Government of this world; and if they do not find it,
they conclude, that the world is not governed by a Good
Providence. As for instance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:50615:113"/>
It is certainly an Act of the most Perfect Goodness to
make all Creatures happy; not to suffer any Miseries to
enter into the world; that there be nothing to deface the
Beauty, or to disturb the Harmony of it: No lamentable
Sights, nor doleful Complaints, to move our pity, nor to
terrify us with the melancholy presages of our own Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
nor to make frightful impressions on us of a Severe
and Inexorable Deity. Could they see such a world as this,
they would thankfully own the Divine Goodness, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
rejoyce in it: But this world, wherein we live, gives
us a very different prospect; we see a great many Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
people, and feel a great many Miseries our selves, and
many times expect and fear a great many more; and how
unlike is this world, to what we should have imagined the
world to have been, had we never seen it, but only heard
of a world made and governed by Infinite and Perfect
Goodness? Indeed all the Objections against the Goodness of
Providence do ultimately resolve into this: That the world
is not so happy as a Good God can make it, and therefore a
Good Providence does not govern the world; and a plain
Answer to this will enable any man to answer all the
rest.</p>
               <p>And the Answer to this is short and plain; That Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and Perfect Goodness will do all the good which can
be wisely done, but not all the good which men may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from Infinite Goodness; for the external exercise of
Goodness must not bear proportion to the Infinite Fulness
of the Divine Nature, but to the State, Condition, and
Capacities of Creatures; and therefore we must not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Goodness of Providence merely by External
Events, which may sometimes be very calamitous; but
by that proportion such Events bear to the State and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
of Mankind, or of particular men in this world. The
best man in the world does not think himself bound to do
all the good he can to every one he meets; he will make a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50615:114"/>
difference between a Child and a Servant, between a Friend
and an Enemy, between a Good and a Bad man, and much
more must a Good Prince and a Good Magistrate do so;
and much more must God, who is the Supream and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Lord of the world.</p>
               <p>We shall better understand this, if we view Man in his
several States, and observe how the Divine Goodness suits
it self to those different States.</p>
               <p>The Divine Goodness made the World, and made Man;
and hence we may take our estimate what the Goodness of
God is, and what it can, and will do, when Goodness freely
exerts it self, without any external impediment to set
bounds to it.</p>
               <p>And if we believe the History of the Creation, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness displayed it self in a most beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Scene; the New-made World, and the new-created
Man, were as perfect and happy, as the perfect Ideas of
their Natures in the Divine Mind. This was the World
which God made; such a happy world, as it became Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Goodness to make; and hence we learn what the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God is, and what it would always do; for when
the Divine Goodness made the World, he made it what
he would have it be.</p>
               <p>But Man did not continue what God had made him: He
sinned, and by Sin brought Death and Misery into the
world. And therefore, though we do not now see such a
happy state of things, we must not hence conclude, that
the world is not governed by Perfect Goodness, but that a
perfect state of Ease and Happiness in this world does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
become the Providence of God, nor is good for Sinners;
and we have reason to conclude this, not only because God
made Innocent man happy, but because he has prepared a
much greater Happiness for Good men in the next world:
Which shews that the change is not in God, but in Men:
He made man happy at first, and he will make Good men
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50615:114"/>
perfectly happy hereafter; but though he be always the
same, as good now as he was when he at first made the
world, and as he will be, when he shall reward all Good
men in the Resurrection of the Just; yet the degenerate
state of Mankind requires such a mixture of Good and
Evil, as we now see, and feel, and complain of in this
world.</p>
               <p>For it is a very different case, to see Goodness acting
alone, and pursuing its own gracious Inclinations, and to
see it limited and confined by Justice, which must be the
case when Mankind are Sinners. For then Goodness can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do what is absolutely best, but what is best in such
Cases; and when Goodness and Justice are reconcilable,
as they are in a probation State, there Wisdom must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the temperament.</p>
               <p>Justice requires the punishment of Sinners, but Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is inclined to spare, and Wisdom judges when, and in
what manner, it is fit to punish, or to spare. An Incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sinner is the Object of strict and rigorous Justice; a
Corrigible Sinner is the Object both of Justice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
his Sin deserves correction and punishment; but
that he is corrigible, makes him the Object of Patience and
Discipline: And this we must suppose to be the difference
between the Case of Apostate Angels, and of Fallen Man,
and therefore Justice immediately seized on those Apostate
Spirits; but God in infinite goodness promised a Saviour
to Mankind.</p>
               <p>This makes the present state of Mankind in this world
to be a state of Trial and Discipline; to reclaim and reform
Sinners by the various methods of Grace and Providence;
and this changes both the very Notion and Exercise of
God's Goodness and Justice in this world; for we must
expect no more of either, than what a state of Trial and
Discipline will allow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:50615:115"/>
The not considering this distinction between Absolute
Goodness and Justice, and the goodness and justice of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
has been the occasion of all those Objections which
have been made both against the Goodness and Justice of
Providence.</p>
               <p>We must confess, that the World is not so happy, as
Perfect, and Absolute, and Unconfined Goodness could
make it; nor are all Sinners so miserable, as Strict and
Absolute Justice could make them; but this signifies no
more, than that Heaven and Hell are not in this world, as
no man ever pretended they were; and yet Strict and Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Justice, and Perfect and Absolute Goodness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are exercised, must make Hell and Heaven. But
this Life is a Middle-state between both; and as men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves here, so they shall have their Portions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven or Hell; and therefore the Goodness and
Justice of God in this world, is of a different nature from
that Goodness or Justice which is exercised in Heaven or
Hell, proportioned to the state of Discipline and Trial in
this Life.</p>
               <p>Goodness indeed has the predominant government, and
Justice is only the Minister of Goodness in this World, as
it must be in a state of Discipline, when Corrections as well
as Favours are intended for good. To put Man into a state
of Probation and Trial, to recover that Immortality he
had lost, was an Act of great Goodness; and whatever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Methods are used to reform Sinners, is as great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Goodness, as it is to force and to compel them
to be happy; as it is to cut off a Hand, or a Leg, to preserve
Life: And if we will but allow this World to be a state of
Trial and Discipline for another World, and wisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
not what pure, simple, and absolute Goodness, but
what the goodness of Discipline requires, it will give us
an easy answer to all the Objections against the Goodness of
Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:50615:115"/>
1. As first, The Goodness of God in a state of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
will not admit of a compleat and perfect Happiness in
this World; for that is no state of Discipline. Good men
themselves, were they as happy in this World as they could
wish, would not be very fond of another World, nor learn
those mortifying and self-denying Vertues which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to prepare them for a Spiritual Life: And Bad men
would grow more in love with this World, and sin on
without check and controul: The Miseries and Afflictions
of this Life wean Good men from this World, and lay
great restraints upon Bad men; which justifies both the
Wisdom and Goodness of God in those many Miseries
which Mankind suffer.</p>
               <p>2. But yet the goodness of God in a state of Discipline
requires, That this World should be so tolerable a place,
as to make Life desirable; his own glory is concerned in
this; for no man would believe, that the World was
made, or is governed by a good God, were there no visible
and sensible Testimonies of a kind and good Providence:
But though God cursed the Earth for the Sin of man, yet
he has not defaced the Characters of his own Wisdom and
Goodness, but still <hi>the invisible things of God from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi>
1. Rom. 20. and in the most Degenerate state of Mankind,
<hi>God left not himself without a witness, giving them rain
from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food
and gladness.</hi> What dreadful Apprehensions would this
give Mankind of God, were this World nothing else but
a Scene of Trouble and Misery? What encouragement
would this be to Sinners to repent and reform? What
hopes could they reasonably conceive of Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
had they no experience of God's goodness and
patience towards Sinners? What place would there be for
the exercise of Moral or Christian Vertues, of Faith, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50615:116"/>
Hope, and Trust in God, of Self-denial, and a Contempt
of this World, were not this World a very tolerably happy
place, though a changeable Scene? A state of Discipline
must neither be a state of perfect Happiness, nor Misery,
but an interchangeable Scene of very agreeable Pleasures,
and tolerable Evils, sufficient to exercise the Vertues, and
to correct the Vices of Mankind: And this I take the State
of this Life to be; so happy, that few men are so miserable,
as to be weary of it; and yet so intermixt with Troubles,
as to exercise the Vertues of Good men, and to correct the
wicked: And this is what becomes the Goodness of God to
do for us in a state of Discipline.</p>
               <p>3. The Goodness of God seems to require, That in such
a mixt and changeable Scene, there should be some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
difference made between the Good and the Bad;
for the design of Providence in a state of trial, is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
Vertue, and to deter men from Sin; and therefore
there ought to be such a visible difference made, as may be
sufficient, if men will wisely consider things, to encourage
good men, and to restrain the wicked.</p>
               <p>I do not mean, that all Good men should be Happy and
Prosperous, and all Bad men Miserable, as to their external
Fortune; for a state of Discipline will not allow this: All
good men cannot bear a prosperous Fortune, and some bad
men may grow better by it, or may be fit instruments of
Providence; and such a visible distinction between all
good and bad men, belongs to the Day of Judgment, not
to a state of trial, and therefore we see this is not done;
and bad men, who have the least reason to complain of it,
make it an objection against Providence.</p>
               <p>But though Providence many times seems to make little
difference between good and bad men, as to external
Events, yet God very often takes care to expound his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,
which makes a very visible difference between
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50615:116"/>
Natural Conscience is one of God's Interpreters of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which terrifies bad men with a sense of Guilt,
when they suffer, and threatens them with a more terrible
Vengeance, but supports good men under their Sufferings
with better hopes; that bad men suffer like Malefactors,
with Rage, and Fear, and Despair; good men with
Patience, and Submission, and joyful Expectations of a
reward.</p>
               <p>All the promises of Scripture are made to Good men;
and all the threatnings of it denounced against Bad men;
and this expounds Providence; for this assures good men,
that all the good they receive, is the Effect of God's care
and goodness to them; and that the Evils they suffer, are
either his fatherly Correction, or the trial and exercise of
their Vertues; but that the Prosperity of Bad men is only
the effect of God's Patience, or to make them Instruments
of his Providence; and that their Sufferings are the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Sins, and the Fore-runners of Future Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
except they repent. And when we know this,
it makes a vast difference between the Prosperity and the
Sufferings of Good and Bad men; and because this is not
always visible in external Events, God has taken care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
it to us.</p>
               <p>But God has made this very visible in most of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Calamities of life, which are the natural effects of Sin;
of Intemperance, Luxury, Lust, Pride, Passion, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Idleness and Prodigality; most of those Evils which
Bad men suffer, are owing to such Vices, and all these
Good men escape; and sometimes their Vertues advance
them to Riches and Honours; and when they don't, yet
they make them contented and pleased: But when Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
makes men great, it commonly makes them a mark
for Envy, and advances them to tumble them down.</p>
               <p>Nay, though the Divine Providence does not always
make a difference between Good and Bad men, as to their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50615:117"/>
external Fortunes, yet sometimes God makes a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
difference between them: Gives such signal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of his Anger against Bad men, and of his
Care and Protection of the Good, that it forces men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
<hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
he is a God that judgeth in the earth,</hi> 58. Psal. 11. And
a few such Examples as these (though both Sacred and
Prophane Story furnish us with very many) are sufficient
to make as visible a distinction between the Good and the
Bad, as the Providence of God in this World requires.</p>
               <p>4. But yet the Goodness of Providence, in a state of
Discipline, will not allow of greater Evils and Calamities
than are necessary to the good government of the World:
For this is a state of Discipline and Government, not of
Judgment. Good men must suffer no more than what
will encrease their Vertue, not prove a temptation to sin:
<hi>The rod of the wicked must not always rest on the lot of the
righteous, lest he also put forth his hand unto iniquity.</hi> The
Sufferings of Bad men, who are in a curable state, must
be only proportioned to their cure, unless the evil of the
Example requires a severer punishment to warn other Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
As for hardened and incorrigible Sinners, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God is not concerned for them, but he may serve
his Providence on them as he pleases; either by making
them the Ministers of his Justice, to execute such a terrible
Vengeance on the World, as none but such hardened Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
would execute; or by making them the lasting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of his own Vengeance, as he did a hardened and
incorrigible <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> for this is for the great good of the
World; and a state of Discipline requires such Examples.
And such Sinners are fit to be made Examples of: And
all such Severities as these are very reconcilable with the
Goodness of God in a state of Discipline.</p>
               <p>5. The Goodness of God in a state of Discipline, not only
allows, but requires great patience, long-suffering, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50615:117"/>
goodness to Sinners: For this is necessary to reclaim Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
to give them time for repentance, and to invite and
encourage them to repent by all the arts and methods of
Goodness, as well as to overawe them by Judgments and
Severities. Promises are as necessary to reform Sinners as
Threatnings; for Hope is as powerful a Principle as Fear;
and Love and Goodness work more kindly upon Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
minds, and melt those, whom Judgments cannot bow,
nor break. Thus a kind Parent deals with a Prodigal Son,
tries him with kindness as well as severity; and thus God
deals with Sinners. He is good to the Evil, and to the
Good; and maketh his Sun to shine, and his Rain to fall
upon the Just, and upon the Unjust: And this is such
goodness as is proper only for a state of Discipline.</p>
               <p>6. The Goodness of God, even in a state of Discipline
requires, that there should be a great deal more good than
evil in the world: For since Goodness governs the World,
even in this state, the Good must be predominant; that
notwithstanding all the Evils and Calamities there are, it
may still be very visible, that the World is governed by a
Good God. That this is so, I think, I need not prove,
for we all see, and feel it. The Evils that are in the
World bear no proportion at all to the Good: There are
some few Examples of miserable people, but the generality
of Mankind are very happy; and even these miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have great allays of their Miseries; and if we take an
estimate of their whole Lives, have a much greater share of
Good than Evil.</p>
               <p>The Judgments of God are sometimes very terrible, but
they come but seldom: For a years Plague or Famine, we
enjoy some Ages of Health and Plenty. And the Ruins and
Desolations of War are recompenced and forgot by a more
Lasting and Flourishing Peace. But the Goodness of God
moves in a constant and uniform round, visits all Parts and
Corners of the Earth, as the Sun does with its Light and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50615:118"/>
Heat: That considering how little Mankind deserves of
God in this Corrupt and Degenerate State; how highly
they provoke him every day, and how constantly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
he does good to them, instead of complaining of
the many Evils that are in the World, we have reason to
admire the Patience and Goodness of God to Sinners.</p>
               <p>This I take to be a true Account of the Nature and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of God's Goodness, as it respects a State of Discipline;
and so it must be considered in the government of this
World; and then all the Objections against the Goodness
of Providence vanish of themselves: Though this World
be not so happy, as Perfect and Absolute Goodness can
make it, yet God abounds in all the Expressions of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which a State of Trial and Discipline will allow,
which is all that we can reasonably expect, and all that God
can wisely do for us in this State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Especially if we consider in the next place, what
the true notion of Good and Evil is in a State of Discipline;
for this is another occasion of most Objections against the
Goodness of Providence; That men consider Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
absolutely, and appeal to their Senses for the Notions
and Differences of Good and Evil, without any regard to
the present State of Human Nature; that is, by Good and
Evil, they mean only Natural Good and Evil; such as
Pleasure or Pain, a State of Ease and Rest, or of Trouble,
and Labour, and Difficulty, Riches or Poverty, Honour
or Disgrace, and measure the Goodness of Providence by
the Natural Good or Evil that is in the World; if Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
and particular men be happy and prosperous, then
God does good, and they will acknowledge that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is good; if they be afflicted, this is very evil, and
therefore an Objection against the Goodness of Providence.
But does not every man know the difference between the
good of the End, and the good of the Means? The End is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50615:118"/>
Happiness, which is the good of Nature; and therefore
whatever is the Happiness, or any part of the Happiness of
Man, is the good of Nature; the good of the End is that
which is good to make men happy; and the more effectual
it is to promote our Happiness, the greater Good it is, tho
it may be a great Natural Evil; and whatever will hinder
or destroy our Happiness, is a great Evil, though it may
be a great Natural Good. In all such Cases things are good
or evil with respect to their End, or to their Natural or
Moral Consequences: When we are in health, that is good
Food which is pleasant and wholsome, and will preserve
health; but the same Diet may be very hurtful, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
when we are sick. Indulgence or Severity to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
is either good or evil, in proportion to their Tempers
and Inclinations, as it is apt either to corrupt their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or to train them up to Piety and Vertue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we speak of Discipline and Government, which
is the true notion of God's Providence in this World, we
must not consider so much what is naturally good and evil,
as what the state of those is, who are the Subjects of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and what is good for them in such a State; for how
many Natural Evils soever there are in the World, the
Evils of Afflictions and Judgments, of Plague, and Famine,
and Sword, if such Severities be good for Mankind, it is as
great an argument of the Goodness of Providence to inflict
them, as it is for a Parent, or a Prince, to reclaim and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Children, or his Subjects, by great Severities:
And an easy and prosperous State, when the Wickedness
of Mankind require severe Restraints, is no more an Act
of Kindness and Goodness, than the fond Indulgence of
Parents is to disobedient Children.</p>
               <p>So that this takes away the very foundation of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against the Goodness of Providence. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Objection is, That there are a great many Evils and
Miseries in the World; we grant it; but then we say, That
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50615:119"/>
God is very good in it, and that these Natural Evils, tho
they are grievous, are not Evils to us, because they are,
and are intended for our good: We can neither prove, nor
disprove the Goodness of Providence merely by external
Events, especially with respect to particular men: For
Prosperity is not always good for us, nor is Affliction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
for our hurt; God may make some men prosperous
in his Anger; and chastise others in great love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and this I take to be the meaning of the Wise-man,
9. Eccl. 1, 2. <hi>No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that
is before them. For all things come alike to all; there is one
event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good, and to
the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to
him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and
he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath:</hi> Which does
not signify that the Divine Providence makes no difference
between Good and Bad men; for God does love Good
men, and hate the Wicked; and his Providence makes a
great difference between them; though this difference is not
always visible in external Events: For when the same
Event happens to both, whether it be a Natural Good or
Evil, it may be an Act of Favour to Good men, and of
Judgment to the Wicked; For external Prosperity and
Adversity in a State of Discipline, may either be good or
evil; and may be good for one, when at the same time it is
evil to another; and therefore the Providence of God may
make a difference, when the external Event makes none.
The Wise-man confesses, <hi>This is an evil among all things that
are done under the Sun, that there is one event unto all:</hi> Bad
men, who look no farther than external Events, make a
very bad use of it; and conclude that God makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
when they see none made: And thus <hi>the heart of
the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
while they live, and after that they go to the dead,</hi> 3. v. But
those who consider wisely, see no reason from external
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50615:119"/>
Events, from such a promiscuous distribution of good and
evil, either to deny a Providence, or the Goodness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of Providence; since good and evil in this State are
not in the things themselves, but in the End for which they
are intended, and which they serve.</p>
               <p>It is of great consequence rightly to understand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to give us a firm persuasion of the Goodness of God,
even when he corrects and punishes, and to cure our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
at the Prosperity of the Wicked; and therefore I
shall briefly represent to you the State of Mankind in this
World, and what is good in such a State.</p>
               <p>Man has sinned, and Man must die; but God has in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
goodness to Mankind sent his own Son into the
World to save Sinners, who by death hath destroyed him
who had the power of Death, that is the Devil, and hath
brought Life and Immortality to light by the Gospel.
This removes the Scene of Happiness from this World to
the next, and makes this present Life only a State of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
for Eternity: If we obey the Laws of our Saviour,
and imitate his Example, he has promised to raise us again,
when our dead Bodies are putrified in the Grave, into Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Life; but has threatned all the Miseries of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Death against Incorrigible Sinners; so that the greatest
good that God or Man can do for us in this World, is by all
the wise methods of Discipline and Government, to prepare
us for the Happiness of the next; and to preserve us from
those Eternal Miseries, which will be the portion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Tho there are thousands of foolish Sinners who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
consider this, yet all Mankind agree, that that is best for
us in this World, which will make us eternally happy in the
next; and that is a very great Evil which will betray us to
Eternal Miseries. There are a great many Infidels who
believe neither a Heaven, nor a Hell, but yet these very
Infidels are not so void of common Sense, as to deny, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
there were a Heaven, and a Hell, that to be the best
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50615:120"/>
Condition for us in this World, whatever it be upon other
accounts, which will carry us to Heaven, and keep us out
of Hell.</p>
               <p>Now if this be the Case, there cannot be so great Evils
in this World, but what may be good for us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may be an expression of God's Goodness to us: For if
Pain and Sickness, Poverty and Disgrace, wean us from
this World, subdue our Lusts, make us Good men, and
qualify us for Eternal Rewards; though they are great
Afflictions, yet they are very good, as the way, though
a rough and difficult way, to Happiness.</p>
               <p>That prosperity does oftentimes corrupt mens Lives and
Manners, make them proud, and sensual, regardless of
God, and of Religion, and so fond of this World, that
they never care to think of another; and that Afflictions
and Adversity has many times a quite contrary effect to
make men serious and considerate, to possess them with an
awe and reverence of God, to correct and reform Bad men,
and to exercise the Graces and Vertues of the Good, both
the Reason of things, and the Experience of Mankind, may
satisfy us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That this is what God designs in those Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Sufferings he brings on Mankind, the Scripture
every where assures us; and the natural conclusion from
hence is, That Afflictions are not evil, nor any Objection
against the Goodness of Providence: If they prove evil to
us, it is our own fault, for God designs them for good. As
the Apostle expresly tells us,<note place="margin">8. Rom. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>That all things work together
for good to them that love God: And whom the Lord loveth, he
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth; if ye
endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what
son is he, whom the father chasteneth not? but if ye be without
chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards,
and not sons,</hi> 21. Hebr. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>This then must be our great care, to rectify our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Good and Evil, to withdraw our minds from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50615:120"/>
Sense, and not to call every thing good that is pleasant,
nor every thing evil that is afflicting; this distinction the
Heathen Poet long since observed, and gives it as a Reason,
and a very wise and good Reason it is, why we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
give up our selves to God, and leave him to chuse our
Condition for us. <hi>Nam pro jucundis aptissima quaeque da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt
Dii. That though God will not always give us those things
which are most pleasant, he will give us what is most profitable
for us.</hi> And if we judge of Good and Evil, not by Sense,
nor by external Appearances, but by that spiritual good
they do, or are intended to do us, in making us Good men
here, and happy hereafter; men may, if they so please, as
reasonably quarrel with the great Ease and Prosperity which
so many enjoy, as with the Afflictions which others suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
for Prosperity does oftner corrupt mens Manners, and
betray them to Sin and Folly, than Afflictions do; Good
men themselves can hardly bear a prosperous State, nor
resist the Temptations and Flatteries of Ease and Pleasure;
whereas Afflictions many times reform Bad men, and make
Good men better, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> himself owns; <hi>It is good
for me that I have been afflicted; for before I was afflicted, I
went astray, but since I have learned to keep thy laws.</hi> And
if both Prosperity and Adversity may be either for our good
or hurt, and when they are so, we cannot always tell, we
must leave this to God, and commit our selves to his Care
and Discipline, who knows us better than we know our
selves, and knows what is best for us.</p>
               <p>But this may seem to start a new and more difficult Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
That if we must not judge of Good and Evil by
external and sensible Events, we can have no sensible Proofs
of the Goodness or Justice of Providence. As we cannot
object the external Evils and Calamities that are in the
World against the Goodness of Providence; so neither can
we prove the Goodness of Providence from those external
and sensible Blessings which God bestows upon Mankind:
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50615:121"/>
So that Religion gains nothing by this; it silences indeed
the Objections against Providence, but it also destroys the
Proofs of a Good and Just Providence. The Answer to
this Objection will give us a truer notion and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goodness of Providence.</p>
               <p>For though we cannot know love or hatred merely by
external Events, yet this does not destroy the natural good
or evil of things, nor the Justice or Goodness of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in doing good, or in sending his Plagues and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on the World. Natural Good and Evil are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and Methods of Discipline; Good men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
and rewarded in this World by some external and
natural Blessings, and Bad men are restrained and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by some natural Evils; and the Goodness and Justice of
God in doing good, and in punishing, make these external
Blessings and Punishments the Methods of Discipline;
which could have no efficacy in them either to encourage
Good men, or to reform the Wicked, but as they are the
visible significations of God's Favour or displeasure; and
therefore such external Blessings and Punishments are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Proofs of the Goodness and Justice of Providence, or
else they could not be the Methods of Discipline, nor have
any moral efficacy upon Mankind.</p>
               <p>But yet when these Acts of Goodness or Justice are made
the Methods of Discipline, and not intended as the proper
Rewards or Punishments of Vertue or Vice, they are not
always confined to Good or Bad men, and therefore are
not certain and visible Marks of God's Love or Hatred.</p>
               <p>It is an Act of Goodness in God to do good to the Evil,
and to the Good: To the Good it is a mark of his Favour,
and an incitement to a more perfect Vertue; to the Evil,
an expression of his Patience, and an invitation to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but when he is good both to the Evil, and to the
Good, the mere external Event can make no difference.
The external Good may be the same, and God is good to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50615:121"/>
both, and intends good to both, but yet has not equal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to both.</p>
               <p>It is an Act of Justice in God to punish, and to correct
Sin, and both Good and Bad men many times feel the same
Severities; to correct and chastise the Follies, and to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and inflame the Devotions of Good men; and to over-awe
and terrify Bad men with the sense of God's Anger,
and the fears of Vengeance: This is to be just, and to be
good to both, as great Goodness and Justice as it is to reform
Bad men; and to make Good men better, tho the external
Events of Providence in such Cases make little distinction
between them: We see in all these Instances manifest Proofs
both of the Justice and Goodness of God, though Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is not always a Blessing, nor Afflictions always evil.
They are always indeed in themselves Natural Goods and
Evils, and therefore are the proper Exercise of a Natural
Goodness and Justice; but with respect to Moral Ends, to
that influence they have upon the direction and government
of our Lives, what is naturally good, may prove a great evil
to us; and what is naturally evil, may do us the greatest
good; and then we must confess, That the Goodness of
Providence must not be measured merely by the natural
good or evil of external Events, but by such a mixture and
temperament of good and evil, as is best fitted to govern
men in this World, and to make them happy in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> There is another Mistake about the Nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and what Goodness is required in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World. Now the Universal Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
of the World must not only take care of particular
Creatures, but of the good of the whole: And this in some
Cases may make the greatest and most terrible Acts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
such as are enough to afright and astonish the
World, Acts of the greatest Goodness and Mercy too;
which will vindicate the Goodness of Providence, when
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50615:122"/>
God seems to be most severe, and to have forgot all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Compassion. As to explain this in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The good government of the World requires the defence
and protection of Mankind from violent and unjust Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
and the most exemplary Vengeance executed
upon such private or publick Oppressors, is a great Act
of Goodness, and a great deliverance to the Oppressed.
136.</hi> Psalm, <hi>the</hi> Psalmist <hi>exhorts us,</hi> To give thanks to the
Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. <hi>And
among other Expressions of the Divine Goodness and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he mentions the Plagues of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Deliverance
of</hi> Israel <hi>by the overthrow of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>in the</hi> Red-Sea; To
him, that smote Egypt in their first-born; for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever. And brought out Israel from among them,
for his mercy endureth for ever. With a strong hand, and
with a stretched-out arm, for his mercy endureth for ever. To
him which divided the Red-sea into parts, for his mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and made Israel to pass through the midst of it—but over-threw
Pharaoh and his host in the Red-sea; for his mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
To him who smote great kings—and slew famous kings, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon
king of the Amorites—and Og the king of Bashan—
and gave their land for an heritage, even for an heritage to
Israel his servant; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>This ought to be well considered, before we object the
Evils and Calamities which befall Bad men, against the
Goodness of Providence. For there are few Bad men who
suffer any Remarkable Vengeance, but that their Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are a great kindness and deliverance to others, and it
may be, to the Publick, in breaking their Power, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them out of the World. And in all such Cases the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> has taught us a very proper Hymn; <hi>I will sing
of mercy and judgment, unto thee, O Lord, will I sing,
101.</hi> Psal. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:50615:122"/>
Thus the good government of the World requires some
great and lasting Examples of God's Justice and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
against Sin: And as terrible as such Examples are,
they are a great publick Good to the World.</p>
               <p>Some few such Examples as these will serve to warn an
Age, nay many succeeding Ages and Generations of men;
which prevents the more frequent Executions of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and justifies the Patience and Long-suffering of
God to Sinners.</p>
               <p>If such Examples in any measure reform the World, as
God intends they should, it makes this World a much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
place; for the better men are, the less hurt, and the
more good they will do; and the less evil there is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the World, the less Mankind will suffer; and the
greater Blessings God will bestow on them.</p>
               <p>And though there be a great deal of Wickedness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the World after such Terrible Warnings as these,
God may exercise great Patience and Forbearance towards
Sinners, without the least blemish to his Holiness or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
For such Frightful Executions convince the World
of God's Justice; and when God has publickly vindicated
the Honour of his Justice, he may try gentler Methods,
and glorify his Mercy and Patience towards Sinners: And
thus God punishes, that he may spare; is sometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
terrible in his Judgments, to prevent the necessity of
striking often, that Sinners may have sufficient warning,
and that he may be good to Sinners, without encouraging
them in sin.</p>
               <p>Thus the destruction of the Old World by a Deluge of
Water, when they were past being reformed, is a warning
to all Sinners as long as this World lasts, and is a publick
and standing Confutation of Atheism; of such <hi>Scoffers, as
say, where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning
of the creation:</hi> The constant and regular course of Nature,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50615:123"/>
without any Supernatural Changes and Revolutions,
tempts men to think that there is no God in the World,
who changes Times and Seasons; but this St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells
us, is visibly confuted by the destruction of the Old World;
for <hi>this they are willingly ignorant of, that by the word of God
the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in the water, whereby the world, that then was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overflowed with water, perished:</hi> And this is reason
enough to fear and expect what God has threatned, That
this present World shall be burnt by fire. <hi>But the heavens
and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ungodly men,</hi> 2 Peter 3. 5, 6, 7. Such Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as these can be attributed to no Natural Causes; but
the same Word which made the World, destroyed the Old
World by Water, and will destroy this by Fire, which
makes it a visible Demonstration of the Power and Justice
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The destruction of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>by Fire from
Heaven, is not only a general Warning to Sinners, but an
Example of a Divine Vengeance against all Uncleanness,
and Unnatural Lusts. As St.</hi> Iude <hi>tells us:</hi> Even as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, in like manner,
giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance
of eternal fire, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Thus the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which was attended with the most terrible Circumstances
that we ever meet with in Story, is a lasting Confutation
of Infidelity, and a glorious Testimony to Christ, and his
Religion: So that most of the terrible Examples of God's
Vengeance, how terrible soever they were to those who
suffered, are Acts of great Goodness to the World, and
therefore belong to the Goodness of Government; by
some severe Executions to protect and defend the Innocent,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50615:123"/>
and reclaim other Offenders, without the necessity of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
the World in every Age with such repeated Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
               <p>Nay we may observe farther, That when the World is
grown very corrupt and degenerate, and such Sinners, if
they be suffered to continue in it, will certainly propagate
their Atheism, Infidelity and Lewdness to all Posterity;
it is great Goodness to all succeeding Generations, to cleanse
the World of its impure Inhabitants by some great Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
by Sword, or Plague, or Famine, to lessen the
number of Sinners, and to possess those who escape, with a
greater awe and reverence of God's Judgments.</p>
               <p>Nay, to observe but one thing more; Many times these
terrible Shakings and Convulsions of the World are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God to open some new and more glorious Scene of
Providence. Thus it was in the Four Empires which
preyed upon each other, and were at last swallowed up by
the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers; though they made great Destructions
in the World, yet they carried Learning and Civility into
Barbarous Countreys, that the general State of the World
was much the better for it, and Mankind the better dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to receive the Gospel, which then began to be preached
by Christ, and his Apostles.</p>
               <p>But this is enough to satisfy us, what little reason there
is to impeach the Goodness of Providence, upon account of
those many Evils which Mankind suffer: If we consider
what the Goodness of God requires of him, and what is
good for us in a State of Discipline, and what is necessary
to the good government of the World, neither our own,
nor other mens Sufferings, will tempt us to question the
Goodness of Providence.</p>
               <p>I proceed now particularly to examine those Objections
which are made against the Goodness of Providence:
Which are reduced to these two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:50615:124"/>
1. The many Miseries which are in the World.</p>
               <p>2 God's Unequal Care of his Creatures, or the unequal
distribution of Good and Evil, both as to particular Men,
and publick Societies.</p>
               <p>What I have already said contains a sufficient Answer to
all this; but it will not be amiss for our more abundant
Satisfaction, to consider some things more largely and
particularly.</p>
               <p>1. I shall begin with the many Miseries of Human Life.
Now this Objection relates either to the being of any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
in the World, or to the number, nature, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them.</p>
               <p>1. As for the first; Some will not allow God to be
good, while there are any Miseries in the World: For,
say they, a good God should not suffer any Miseries to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the World: This I observed, and answered before;
That the Goodness of Providence must bear proportion to
the Nature, Qualities, and Deserts of Creatures; and since
Man, who was created innocent and happy, forfeited his
original Happiness by Sin, we must now consider, not
what Absolute, Unconfined Goodness would do; but
what becomes a State of Discipline; what is good for
Sinners, and for a Corrupt and Degenerate World; and
this will abundantly justify the Goodness of Providence
in all the Evils which Mankind suffer, as you have already
heard.</p>
               <p>But this will not satisfy some men; for their great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
is, That God made such a Creature, as could sin, and
be miserable; that is, That God created Angels and Men;
that he endowed them with Reason and Understanding,
and a liberty of Choice; for such Creatures as can chuse,
may chuse wrong. But this is not an Objection against the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50615:124"/>
Goodness of Providence, but against the goodness of the
Creation; and if it proves any thing, it proves, that God
ought not to have made the World; for if Goodness would
not allow him to make a Reasonable Creature, who might
make himself miserable; Wisdom would not allow him to
make a World without any Reasonable Creatures in it.</p>
               <p>I confess, I am at a great loss to know how they would
lay their Objection, so as to bear upon the Goodness of
God, and what they intend by it, when they have done:
For let us consider wherein Creating Goodness consists.</p>
               <p>Does the goodness of a Maker require any more of him,
than to make all things according to perfect and excellent
Ideas, and to make them as perfect as their Ideas are? What
is it then they find fault with in God's making Angels and
Men? Is not the Idea of a Reasonable Being, and a Free
Agent, the Idea of an Excellent and Happy Creature?
Are there any greater Perfections, than Knowledge, and
Wisdom, and Understanding, and Liberty of Choice?
Is there any Happiness like the Happiness of a Reasonable
Nature? Nay, is there any thing that deserves the name
of Happiness besides this? Will you call Senseless Matter,
nay, will you call Beasts happy? And is the only Idea of
a Happy Nature in the World, a reasonable Objection
against Creating Goodness?</p>
               <p>If then there be no fault to be found in the Idea of a
Reasonable Creature, was there any defect in the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship?
Did not God make Men and Angels as perfect
as their Ideas? and give them all the happiness which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to their Natures? If he did not, this would have
been a great fault in their Creation; if he did, Creating
Goodness has done all that belonged to it to do.</p>
               <p>But I would gladly know whence they have this Notion
of Creating Goodness, that it must make no Creature which
can make it self miserable? Justice is as essential to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a God, as Goodness; and yet it is impossible that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50615:125"/>
Justice should belong to the Idea of God, if it were irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
with the Divine Goodness to make such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
who may deserve well or ill: For Justice respects Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and consists in Rewards and Punishments; and if the
Goodness of God will not suffer him to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which shall deserve either to be rewarded or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Goodness and Justice cannot both of them belong to
the Idea of a God.</p>
               <p>But what pretence is there for any man to say, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Devil and his Angels fell from their first happy
State, therefore God was not good in creating the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Nature? or because so many men sin, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
miserable, therefore God is not good in creating
Man? when there are so many myriads of Blessed Angels
and Saints eternally happy in the vision and fruition of God;
and those who are not so, are miserable only by their own
fault. Not to have made a Happy Nature, had been a
just blemish to the Divine Goodness; to make Happy
Creatures, though they make themselves miserable, is
none; no more than it is to make a Free Agent, who alone
is capable of Happiness, and who alone can make himself
miserable. None but a Reasonable Nature is capable of
any great Happiness; and to make a Reasonable Creature
without liberty of Choice, and consequently without a
possibility of sinning, and being miserable, is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
For what does Reason serve for, but to direct our
Choice? And indeed all the Pleasures of Vertue, which
are the greatest Pleasures of Human Nature, result from
this Liberty, that we chuse well, when we might have
chose ill; and if it becomes a Good God to make a Happy
Nature, it becomes him to make a Reasonable and Free
Agent, though many such Creatures may make themselves
miserable.</p>
               <p>But suppose we could not answer this Objection, That
God has made such Creatures, as both could, and do make
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50615:125"/>
themselves miserable, what is it they intend by it? Would
they prove, that God did not make the World, because he
made Angels and Men, some of whom have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Devils? those who are Saints and Angels still shall
answer this Objection, when any man has confidence
enough seriously to make it. Or would they prove, That
God does not govern the World with Goodness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
because he has made such Creatures, as by the good
or ill use of their Liberty, make themselves the Subjects of
both? There is no other Answer necessary to that, but
only to ask, What place there could be for a Governing
Providence, were there no Creatures who could deserve
well or ill?</p>
               <p>But this is enough in answer to an Objection, which no
considering man would seriously make: The more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Objection relates to the many Evils and Miseries
that are in the World; and the only Objection which, if
it were true, could have any weight in it, is, That the
Miseries of this Life are so many, so great, and so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
that they overballance the Pleasures and Comforts of it;
that a wise man would rather chuse not to be, than to live
in this World. And though the generality of Mankind
are of another mind, and therefore need no answer to this,
yet they think they have the Scripture on their side. For
the Wise-man, 4. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2, 3. tells us; <hi>Wherefore I praised
the dead, which are already dead, more than the living, which
are yet alive: Yea better is he than both they, who hath not
yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under
the sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This at first view looks like a very sharp Satyr upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Life; that it is better to die than to live; and that not
to live at all, is better than either: And were this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
true, it were a vain thing to think of vindicating
the Goodness of Providence in the government of this
World, which has nothing good or desirable in it. That
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50615:126"/>
this is not the meaning of the words, we may certainly
conclude from those many Promises which are made to
Good men in this Life; and God would not promise
Good men what is worth nothing.</p>
               <p>But the Explication of this Text will contribute very
much to the understanding this whole matter; and
therefore I shall,</p>
               <p>1. Shew you, That this is not universally true, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be so understood by the <hi>Wise-man,</hi> That it is
better to die, or not to be, than it is to live.</p>
               <p>2. Shew you in what sense the <hi>Wise-man</hi> meant this,
<hi>viz.</hi> with respect to the many Miseries and Calamities,
which some Ages of the World, and which some men in
all Ages are exposed to: And how this also is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
               <p>1. That this is not universally true, That it is better
to die, or not to be born, than it is to live. This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
was taught by some of the Ancient Philosophers and
Poets in too general terms; That the first best thing is not
to be born; and the next, to die quickly; but no body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them; for most men felt it otherwise: That <hi>light
is sweet, and it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the
sun,</hi> 11. Eccl. 7. There is a sense indeed, wherein this may
be true. If we acknowledge, that this Life in its greatest
glory and perfection is the most imperfect state that a
Reasonable Soul can live in, as most certainly it is; then
those Philosophers who did believe that the Souls of men
lived and acted before they were born into this World, and
were thrust into these Bodies in punishment for what they
had done amiss in a former state, had reason to say, That the
best thing is not to be born; for upon this Supposition, it is
best for them to continue in that State of Happiness, and not
to come into this World; and if when they die, they return
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50615:126"/>
to their Original State of Happiness, the next best thing
for them is, to die quickly; and it is most probable that
this was their secret meaning in it. For if we only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Advantages and Disadvantages of Life, in ordinary
Cases Life is very desirable; so desirable, that it makes
Death the King of Terrors.</p>
               <p>It would be a great Reproach to the Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Providence, were this Life so contemptible, or so
calamitous a State, that it were more desirable not to be,
than to live in this World; but no man yet ever made Life
an objection against Providence, though we know they
do, the Miseries and Calamities of Life. Men may make
themselves miserable without any reproach to Providence;
and most of the Miseries that are in the World, are owing
to mens own fault or folly; but had God made Life it self
so contemptible or miserable a state, as to be worse than
not being, this had been an unanswerable Objection.</p>
               <p>I'm sure we are very ungrateful to Almighty God, if
we do not acknowledge that bountiful provision which he
has made for the Happiness of Mankind in this World.
For what is wanting on God's part to make Man as happy
as he can be here? We want no Sense which is useful to Life,
we want no Objects to gratify those Senses; and which is
very considerable, the most useful, and necessary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Objects, are most common, and such as Mankind
pretty equally share in. There is not such a mighty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as some men imagine, between the Poor and the
Rich: In pomp, and shew, and opinion, there is a great
deal, but little as to the true Pleasures and Satisfactions of
Life: They enjoy the same Earth, and Air, and Heavens;
hunger and thirst makes the Poor man's Meat and Drink
as pleasant and refreshing as all the Varieties which cover a
Rich man's Table; and the Labour of a Poor man is more
healthful, and many times more pleasant too, than the
Ease and Softness of the Rich; to be sure much more
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50615:127"/>
easy than the Cares and Solicitudes, the Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Discontents, and Envyings, and Emulations, which
commonly attend an Exalted Fortune.</p>
               <p>These indeed at best are but mean Pleasures, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Sense, which are the lowest Pleasures a Reasonable
Soul is capable of; but yet they are so entertaining, that
the generality of Mankind think it worth living to enjoy
them, nay most men know little of any other Pleasures but
these; and as philosophically as some may despise the Body
and all it's Pleasures in words; there are but a very few
who can live above the Body, and all its Pleasures, while
they live in it. But how mean soever these Pleasures be,
it is certain they make Mankind, notwithstanding all the
common allays they meet with, not only patient of living,
but desirous to live.</p>
               <p>And yet there are more Noble and Divine Pleasures
which men may enjoy in this World; such as gratify the
nobler Faculties of the Soul, the Pleasures of Wisdom
and Knowledg, of Vertue and Religion; to know and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, to contemplate the Art, and Beauty, and Perfection
of his Works; and to do good to men. These indeed are Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that do not make us very fond of this Body, nor of this
World; for they do not arise from the Body, nor are they
confined to this World. We have reason to hope, that
when we get loose from these Bodies, our Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
will be vastly improved; that we shall know God
after another manner than we now do; and discover new
and brighter Glories, which are concealed from Mortal
Eyes; but yet the Pleasures of Knowledge, and Wisdom,
and Religion in this World are very great and ravishing,
and therefore we either do, or may enjoy at present such
Pleasures, as make Life very desirable: Were there no
other, nor happier State after this, yet it were very desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to come into this World, and live as long as we can here,
to enjoy the Pleasures and Satisfactions which may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50615:127"/>
in this Life: And though we know there is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
Life after this, yet there is so much to be enjoyed in
this World, as generally makes even Good men very well
contented to stay here as long as God pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> But still we must confess, That though men may
live very happily in this World, yet there may be such a
state of things, as, if we only compare the sensible Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Disadvantages of Life, may make Death
much more desirable than life. <hi>I praised the dead, which
are already dead, more than the living, which are yet alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the understanding of which we must consider, That
this is one of those Sayings which must not be strictly and
Philosophically examined, nor stretched to the utmost
sense the words will bear; it has some truth, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Figure and Rhetorick in it, as many of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Proverbial Speeches have, which must be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a qualified sense.</p>
               <p>We must observe then, That the design of this whole
Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> is not to put us out of conceit with Life,
but to cure our vain Expectations of a compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Happiness in this World; to convince us, that there
is no such thing to be found in mere external Enjoyments,
which are nothing but <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi> And
the end of all this is, not to make us weary of Life, but to
teach us to moderate our love to present things, and to seek
for Happiness in the practise of Vertue, in the knowledge
and love of God, and in the hopes of a better Life: For this
is the application of all. <hi>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
matter; fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the
whole of man:</hi> Not only his Duty, but his Happiness too;
<hi>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil,</hi> 12. Eccl.
13, 14.</p>
               <p>Among other Arguments to prove how vain it is to expect
a compleat Happiness in this World, the <hi>Wise-man</hi> instances
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50615:128"/>
in the many Oppressions and Sufferings which men are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, and which sometimes befall them, which may be so
sore and grievous, and make Life so uneasy and troublesome,
as may tempt men, who only consult their own sensible sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
to prefer Death before Life: And this seems to
be all that the <hi>Wise-man</hi> means, That we may live in such a
troublesome and tempestuous state of things, that the mere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
external Enjoyments of this Life, cannot recompence the
Troubles of it; for this is all that his Design required him
to prove, The vanity of all external Enjoyments. And if
ever the Case be such, That a Wise-man would chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to leave this World, and to leave all these Enjoyments
behind him, than to endure the Troubles and Calamities
wherewith they are attended, they are vain indeed. But
this does not prove, That a Wise-man ought to despise Life
for the Troubles of it; that he should chuse to run out of
the World to be eased of its Troubles; or that a Wise-man,
notwithstanding all these Troubles, cannot make himself
easy and happy in it; and consequently it does not prove,
That a Wise-man in such Cases should prefer Death before
Life, though it may reasonably enough cure his fondness
for Life, and make him welcome Death, whenever
God pleases to send it. Let us then briefly consider these
things. And,</p>
               <p>1. Let us take a view of those Troubles and Disorders
which may make a Wise-man willing to part with all the
external Enjoyments and Pleasures of Life to be rid of the
Troubles of it, and make him think those men happy,
who are escaped out of this World, or are not yet come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Solomon</hi> the Preacher gives us two Accounts of
this; the first before, the second immediatly after this
Text. In the 1st Verse he tells us; <hi>So I returned, and
considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50615:128"/>
beheld the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no
comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power,
but they had no comforter.</hi> And hence he concludes, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I praised the dead, that are already dead, more than the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
who are yet alive.</hi> Which signifies the Publick Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
either of the Supream Power, or of Subordinate
Magistrates: The Second relates to Private Factions, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,
Emulations, which many times make Life as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
as the Publick Miscarriages of Government. <hi>Again,
I considered all travel, and every right work, that for this a man
is envied of his neighbour: This is also vanity, and vexation
of spirit,</hi> v. 4. These two contain most of those Evils in
them, which disturb and distract Human Life; but I shall
not discourse this matter according to Rules of Art and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
but shall beg leave to give you a short view of such
a state of things, as might make a man, who consults only
his own ease, very contented to slip out of the World, and
to leave foolish Mortals to end the scuffle as well as they
can.</p>
               <p>When a Kingdom is in a strong Convulsion, assaulted
by powerful Enemies abroad, and divided by busy and
restless Factions at home; when men live in perpetual fear
and suspence, know not what to call their own, nor how
long they shall enjoy it; when some men think themselves
bound in conscience to ruin themselves, their Countrey,
and their Religion; others will sacrifice their Countrey,
and consequently themselves too, to private Ambitions,
Resentments, or Revenge; and try their Fortune over
again in some new Changes and Revolutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
When such publick Disputes as these influence all
Inferior Societies, and as sometimes they have done, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Publick Justice, dissolve the most Intimate Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
make Conversation uneasy or dangerous, set every
man's Sword, or which is almost as fatal, every man's
Tongue against his Brother; when no man's Fame, no
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50615:129"/>
man's Life is secure; but a Slandering Tongue may blast
one, and a Perjured Tongue destroy the other: When Zeal
and Faction make Characters of men, disposes of Life, of
Honour, of Estates, and Religion it self serves for little
else but to inspire men with Zeal and Faction: When we
cannot live in the World without seeing, or hearing, or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ten thousand Villanies that are committed in it, what
should make any man fond of Life? why should we not come
to good Old <hi>Simeon</hi>'s <hi>Nunc dimittis, Lord, now lettest thou
thy servant depart in peace.</hi> Such a troublesome state of things
in this World must needs make all considering men think
of a better, and as glad to get out of this, as a Mariner is
to recover the Haven after a violent Storm at Sea. Thus
I say it must be, if we consider only the present Advantages
or Disadvantages of Life; for perpetual Fears and Cares,
Strife and Contention, Oppression, Injustice, Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> destroy the Ease and Security of Life, and the
Freedom and Pleasure of Conversation, without which all
the other Pleasures of Life are very tastless.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but bewail the Folly and Distraction of
Mankind, who are fond of Life, and impatiently thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Happiness, but will not suffer either themselves or
others to live, and to be happy. Who bite and devour each
other, and by their ungoverned Passions raise such Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes
in the World, that there is no Ease, or Rest, or
Happiness to be found, but in a Grave, or in a Charnel-house:
<hi>Where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the
weary be at rest, where the prisoners rest together; they hear
not the voice of the oppressor, the small and great are there,
and the servant is free from his master,</hi> 3. Job 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Did men consider what it is to live, and to be happy,
it would convince them, that there is nothing in this
World worth purchasing with Eternal Discontents, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,
Emulations, Jealousies, Fears, with doing all the
Mischiefs and Injuries we can, and with suffering all the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50615:129"/>
Injuries which others can do; nay, indeed it is wonderful
to me, that mens own sense and feeling, if they will not
be at the pains to reason the matter, does not convince
them of this. To live, is not merely to be, but to be
happy; and to be happy does not signify merely to have,
but to enjoy; and to enjoy, requires an easy, serene, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed
mind, which can relish what it has, and extract
its true pleasure and satisfaction. The security of Life, the
easiness and freedom of Conversation, when we fear no
Spies upon our Words and Actions, no Malicious Eye,
no Slandering Tongue; when our Lives are spent in the
exchange of good Offices, in the Endearments and Cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Friendship, or at least in mutual Civilities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects;
this is to live, and to be happy. A very little of
what is external, will make such a state as this happy,
which all the Power, and all the Riches of the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do; when to get, or keep it, divides the Hearts and
the Interests of men, ferments their Passions, destroys
Friendships, and all mutual Trust and Confidence, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
and crumbles Human Societies into Parties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and animates them with a bitter Zeal and Rage,
to reproach and vilify, supplant and undermine each other;
if this be to be happy, or the way to Happiness in this
World, it is time to seek for Happiness out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> And yet this is no reason for a wise and good man
to despise or abhor life, much less to force his passage out
of this World. There is no difficulty in persuading the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Mankind to live, notwithstanding all the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Calamities they meet with. The love of life is
natural and strong, and reconciles men to great Miseries
before they desire that death should ease them. Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is so unnatural a Sin, that it is now-a-days thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
enough to prove any man distracted; we have too
many sad Examples what a disturbed Imagination will do,
if that must pass for Natural Distraction; but we seldom
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50615:130"/>
or never hear, that mere external Sufferings, how severe
soever, tempt men to kill themselves. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whose Principle it was to break their Prison, when
they found themselves uneasy, very rarely put it into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise:
Nature was too strong for their Philosophy; and
though their Philosophy allowed them to die when they
pleased, Nature taught them to live as long as they could;
and we see that they seldom thought themselves miserable
enough to die.</p>
               <p>There is no danger then of frightning men out of this
World by the Troubles and Calamities of it; that I need
not concern my self with such fears; but yet, without
contradicting <hi>Solomon,</hi> to vindicate the Providence of God,
and to support and encourage Good men, I shall briefly
shew you, That it is very desirable for a Good man to live
on, and that a Wise and Good man may live very happily,
notwithstanding all the Troubles and Difficulties, which
he may, and sometimes must encounter in this World.
For Difficulties are a glorious Scene of Vertue, and such a
Vertue as can conquer Difficulties, has its Rewards, its
Pleasures and Satisfactions even in this Life.</p>
               <p>It is very necessary that good men should live in very
bad times, not only to reprieve a wicked World, that God
may not utterly destroy it, as he once did in the days of
<hi>Noah,</hi> when all Flesh had corrupted its ways; but also
to season Human Conversation, to give check to Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to revive the practice of Vertue by some great
and bright Examples, and to redress those Violences and
Injuries which are done under the Sun, at least to struggle
and contend with a Corrupt Age, which will put some
stop to the growing Evil, and scatter such Seeds of Vertue,
as will spring up in time. It is an Argument of God's care
of the World, that Antidotes grow in the neighbourhood
of Poisons; that the most Degenerate Ages have some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
men, who seem to be made on purpose for such a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50615:130"/>
time, to stem the torrent, and to give some ease to the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Mankind: And would it become such men, when
the World so much needs them, to get out of it, if they
could? to chuse the quiet and silent Retirements of Woods
and Deserts, or of the Grave, to avoid the trouble of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, or doing good to Men? Great Minds cannot do
this; Vertue is made for Difficulties, and grows stronger
and brighter for such Trials; it lays a mighty obligation
on Mankind to serve the Publick good with labour and
danger; to purchase the Ease, and Liberty, and Security
of their Countrey, at the price of their own Ease, and the
utmost hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; to oppose a
hardened, and laborious, and unwearied Vertue against
Zeal and Faction, and not like <hi>Issachar,</hi> to crouch between
two Burthens, and cry rest is good. And it is a mighty
pleasure to a Vertuous mind to feel its own strength, to
contend with Difficulties, as far as Vertue and Prudence
directs, with an unbroken mind; it is always pleasant to
do good, but yet it has the sweeter relish, the dearer we pay
for it. This is a Pleasure above all the Ease and Luxury of
the World; it not only sweetens all the Troubles of Life,
but turns them into Triumphs; to endeavour to bear up a
sinking World, though he should at last be crush'd in the
Ruins of it, will make the very Ruins he sinks under, an
Illustrious Monument of his Vertue: To do all that a
Wise and Good man ought to do, without regard to his
own Ease, to save a Sinking Church and State, will make
him fall with pleasure, and perpetuate his Memory with
Honour; for in spight of Envy and Detraction, Vertue
will always be honourable in the Grave. But I cannot
enlarge on these things, and therefore shall give you the
result of all I have said in two or three Observations.</p>
               <p>1. That though the Troubles and Calamities, which
we often meet with in this World, do not prove Life to be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50615:131"/>
a contemptible State, or worse than not being; yet they
do prove Life to be a very Imperfect State; that the mere
Sensible Pleasures and Advantages of Life, together with
these great allays, are but vanity, and vexation of spirit.
Wise men see, that there can be no compleat Happiness in
this World, and that it is vain to expect it; for how can
this World make us happy, which, though it has its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
has its Troubles, and Cares, and Disappointments
too; is an insecure and mutable State, exposed to Chance
and Accident, to the Lusts and Passions of men; is always
chequered with Prosperous and Adverse Events, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a mixture of Good and Evil, and many times the
Evil is the prevailing Ingredient? And therefore though
the natural love of Life, and the many Sweets and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of it reconcile very miserable people to living, yet a
wise man sees no reason to be fond of this State, much less
to dream of perfect and lasting Happiness in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The many Troubles we are exposed to, plainly
prove, That there is no Happiness to be had in this World,
but in the practice of Vertue. It was a vain brag of the
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> That Vertue alone could make a man happy; that
their Wise-man could be perfectly happy in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Bull;
for Vertue is not Meat, and Drink, and Clothes, can't cure
Bodily Pain and Sickness, nor satisfy the Appetites and
Desires of the Body; and while a Wise man lives in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Body, he must feel the wants and pains of it; and to be
in want and pain, is not happiness. But yet thus much is
certainly true, That nothing can make a man happy in
this World without the practise of Vertue; and that when
we must encounter with the Troubles and Difficulties of
Life, nothing can give us any degree of Ease and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
but the practice of Vertue. We may meet with
such Troubles as will sowre all our other Enjoyments, and
make them unable to bear up our spirits, which sink under
their own weight, under the disorders of their own Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50615:131"/>
Are tormented with Fears, with Disappointments,
with Envy, with Rage; and when they cannot bear
themselves, can bear nothing else, nor relish their wonted
Pleasures: But you have already heard, that Vertue has
its proper Pleasures in the greatest Difficulties; inspires us
with prudent Counsels to disintangle our selves; animates
us with courage and bravery to resist the Evil, or to bear
it; sweetens our Labours with the satisfaction of great and
generous Actions for the Publick Good; keeps our own
Passions under government, and triumphs over an adverse
Fortune, by raising the mind above it. By such helps as
these a Good man may enjoy some competent measure of
Ease and Satisfaction in the worst Condition; but when
such Troubles surprise a mind unarmed and unfortified
with Vertue, unable to resist, and unable to bear, we may
then with great truth and reason apply this Text to him;
<hi>I praised the dead, who are already dead, more than the living,
who are yet alive.</hi> Were the state of this World always easy
and prosperous, there would be little need of Passive Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
though Vertue in general is always necessary to make
men happy; but all men must be sensible how necessary
Passive and Suffering Vertues are for an inconstant, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and suffering state, which is always in some degree
the state of this World; and that will convince those who
will consider it, how necessary the practice of Vertue is to
make men happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Though the Troubles of this Life are no reason
why a Good man should hasten his escape out of this
World before his time, yet they are a very good reason to
make him contented to leave this World, whenever God
calls him out of it. For though Vertue will sweeten La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Difficulties, yet no man would chuse always to
live in a state of War. Ease and rest is very pleasant and
refreshing after labour; Though a Prince be glorious in
the Field, covered with dust and sweat, and sprinkled with
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50615:132"/>
the Bloud of his Enemies, yet the Triumphs of a secure
and quiet Throne are greater and more desirable. And
this makes the Grave too in some degree acceptable after the
toils and labours of Vertue, that <hi>there the weary are at rest;</hi>
especially since this Rest is not a state of insensibility; for
all the Labours and Difficulties of a Vertuous Life are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
to be preferred before the ease and rest of knowing,
and feeling, and being sensible of nothing, which is the
rest of a Stone, and of things without life, not the rest of
a Man. But <hi>they rest from their labours, and their works
follow them;</hi> they rest in a peaceful and secure enjoyment
of Endless Happiness; they rest from all the Labours of
Vertue, and enjoy its Rewards.</p>
               <p>This is a sufficient justification of Providence with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the present Evils and Calamities of Life; for it is
what exactly becomes the Goodness of Providence in this
World; such a mixt State of Good and Evil, as may wean
us from the tempting Vanities of this Life, and convince
us, that there is no perfect Happiness to be found here,
which is necessary to raise our hearts above this World, and
to set our Affections upon things above, which is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
State of perfect Ease and Rest: And since Religion and
Vertue is necessary to our Future Happiness, nothing can
be better for us than such a state of things as shall make Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
necessary to our present Happiness; and since we must
leave this World, and Death is the King of Terrors, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reconciles us to Death, and makes it easy, may be
reckoned one of the greatest pleasures and securities of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In answer to this Objection against the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Providence from those many Evils and Calamities
that are in the World, we must consider, That most of the
Evils of Human Life are owing to mens own wickedness
and folly, and it is very unreasonable to make those Evils
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50615:132"/>
an Objection against Providence, which men wilfully bring
upon themselves. Thus the <hi>Wise-man</hi> long since stated
this Question, <hi>The foolishness of man perverteth his ways,
and his heart fretteth against the Lord,</hi> 19. Prov. 3. Men
make themselves miserable, and then reproach the Divine
Providence with their Miseries: And therefore I shall
briefly shew you, that Mankind undo themselves; and
that the Evils which men bring upon themselves, are no
reasonable Objection against the Goodness of Providence.</p>
               <p>1. The first is a very proper Subject for a Satyr against
the Folly and Wickedness of Mankind, but needs no proof.
If we take a survey of the many Miseries of Human Life,
and resolve them into their immediate and natural Causes,
we shall find, that most men take great care to leave very
little for God to do in the punishment of Wickedness in
this World.</p>
               <p>There are but two visible Causes of all the Miseries that
are in the World; either the Disorders of Nature, or the
Wickedness of Men: By the Disorders of Nature, I mean
unseasonable Weather, Earthquakes, excessive Heat or
Cold, great Droughts, or immoderate Rains, Thunders,
Lightnings, Storms and Tempests, which occasion Famines
and Plagues, great Sickness, or a great Mortality; these
may very reasonably be attributed to the more immediate
Hand of God, who directs and governs Nature; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that in such Cases, the visible Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
justifies such Severities; how rarely do these happen,
and how few suffer by them, in comparison with those many
and constant Evils which the wickedness of men every day
bring upon themselves, and others. For most of the other
Evils and Calamities of life are visibly owing to mens Sins.
Bodily Sickness, sharp and painful Distempers, which
shorten mens lives, or make them miserable, are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
effects of Intemperance, Luxury, or Wantonness;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50615:133"/>
Children inherit the Diseases of their Parents, and come
into the World only to cry and die, or to struggle some few
years in the very Kingdom and Territories of Death; and
to languish under those mortal Wounds which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with the first beginnings of life.</p>
               <p>Another great evil is Poverty, which many men bring
upon themselves by Idleness, or Prodigality, and some
expensive Vices: It is not in every man's power by the
greatest Prudence and Industry to make himself rich; for
<hi>time and chance happeneth to them all;</hi> but in ordinary Cases
Prudence and Industry, joined with a religious regard for
God and his Providence, will preserve a man from the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Wants and Necessities of Poverty. Others, who do
not make themselves poor by their own Sins, are many
times reduced to great poverty by the Sins of other men;
by Injustice, and Oppression, and Violence; by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and Calamities of War, which brings a thousand
Evils with it; which makes many helpless Widows and
Orphans, deprives men of their Patrons and Benefactors,
drives others from their plentiful Fortunes, to seek their
Bread in a strange Land; plunders Poor and Rich; lays
a flourishing Countrey desolate; puts a stop to Trade;
makes Provisions dear, and leaves no work for the Poor.</p>
               <p>Some others are reduced to Poverty more immediately
by the Providence of God, without their own fault: Those
who have no other support but their daily labour, are
quickly pinched by a long and Expensive Sickness, or by
the Infirmities of Age, or by the loss of their Eyes, or
Hands, or Legs; others are undone by Fire, or Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks,
or the various Accidents of Trade, which the
most wary and cautious men cannot escape; but besides,
that there are few of these in comparison with the throngs
and crowds of Idle, Prodigal, Self-made Poor; God has
made provision for all such Cases, that no man shall suffer
extreme want, by commanding the Rich especially, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50615:133"/>
the want of such Poor, who are properly God's Poor,
or the Poor of God's making; and commanding this under
the penalty of their Eternal Salvation, and the forfeiture of
their own Estates, if they prove unjust and unfaithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:
So that though God makes some men poor, it is the
fault of other men if they suffer want. The poverty they
suffer is owing to the Providence of God; the wants and
miseries they suffer, are owing to the Sins, to the Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
of Men: For though the World be unequally
divided, of which more presently, yet there is enough to
supply the wants of all the Creatures that are in it; and
God never intended that any of his Creatures should want
necessaries; that one man's plenty and abundance should
cause another man to starve: And thus it is in most of the
other miseries of life; it is the sin and the folly of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
which makes them miserable, which is so obvious to
every one, who will consider it, that I need not expatiate on
every particular. I believe there is no man but will confess,
that were all men good and vertuous, this World would be a
very happy place; and if the practice of moral and sociable
Vertues would make Mankind happy, it is no hard matter
to guess, what it is that disturbs the Peace and Happiness of
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Let us now consider, how unreasonable it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Divine Providence with those Evils and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which Mankind bring upon themselves. And laying
down this as a Principle, that most men make themselves
miserable, it is very easy to defend and justify the Goodness
of Providence.</p>
               <p>For these Evils, which men complain of, are not
justly chargeable upon Providence; and therefore are
un unreasonable Objection against Providence. God
does not bring these Evils upon Mankind, but men
bring them upon themselves. Supposing the nature of
things, and the nature of man to be, what they now
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50615:134"/>
are, and that men lived just as they now do, there
must be the same Miseries in the World, that there now
are, though there were no Providence. Though God did
not interpose in the government of the World, yet Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
Luxury and Lust, would destroy mens health;
Sloth, and Prodigality, and expensive Vices, would make
men poor; Pride, Ambition and Revenge, would make
Quarrels, raise Wars, and bring all the Calamities of War
upon the World; if there were no Providence, thus it
must be; for excessive eating and drinking will oppress
Nature; and those who will take no honest pains to get
Money, or will spend what they have upon their lusts,
must be poor; and those who will quarrel and fight, must
take what follows; these evils are not owing to Providence,
because Providence does not bring them; no more than
Providence makes men wicked: Men make themselves
wicked, and wickedness makes them miserable; and we
may as well charge the Providence of God with all the
wickedness of men, as with those miseries which their own
wickedness brings upon them.</p>
               <p>Now since most of those evils which are in the World
are not justly chargeable upon Providence, the Goodness
of God is very visible in those very Evils and Calamities
which Mankind suffer. For,</p>
               <p>1. God has in ordinary Cases put it into every man's
power to preserve himself from most of the greatest evils and
miseries of life, even from all those which men bring upon
themselves by their own sins. What could be done more
than this for a reasonable Creature, to make it his own
choice, and to put it into his own power, whether he
will be happy or miserable? God has, not only in his
Laws, but in the nature of things, set before us life and
death, happiness and misery: All men see what the visible
and natural punishments of Sin are, and have a natural aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50615:134"/>
to those evils, and may avoid them if they will; this
is a plain proof, not only of the Holiness of Providence, as
I observed before, in deterring men from sin by those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
evils which attend it, but also of the Goodness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
by shewing men a plain and natural method, how
to avoid the miseries of life, and to make themselves easy
and happy. Let the most Sceptical Objector against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
consider with himself, what God could have done
more to prevent the miseries of Mankind, without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the nature of man, or the nature of things. To have
laid a necessity upon man, that he should never chuse, nor
do any thing which will bring these evils on him, had been
to change his nature, to destroy the free exercise of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the liberty of choice; and yet men cannot live as
they do, and escape these miseries, unless all Nature be
changed. We must have other kind of Bodies than we
have, or our Meat and Drink must have other vertues and
qualities, to bear the disorders and excesses of intemperance
and lust, without feeling the inconveniences of it. Fire
must not burn, nor Water drown, if Wine must not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame,
nor a flood of indigested Liquors extinguish the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
heat. The whole World must be a Paradise, and bring
forth fruit of it self, and all things must be possessed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or the idle, slothful, prodigal Sinners must be poor.
Our Bodies must be invulnerable and immortal, or there
must be no instruments of death in the World; or men,
who quarrel, will fight, and kill one another. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
as the World now is, to separate sin and misery;
but men may avoid misery, if they please: And that is a
very good World, and a good God that made such a World,
and a good Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which governs the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men may make themselves happy, if they will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Besides this, the Goodness of Providence is seen in
hindering and preventing a great many more evils and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
which the sins and lusts of men would bring upon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50615:135"/>
the World, were they not under the restraints and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Providence. No man doubts, but there might
be a great deal more evil and misery in the World than
there is, nor that many bad men are inclined to do a great
deal more hurt than they do; what is it then after all, that
makes the World so tolerable a place? If this be owing to
the Providence of God, it is a great argument of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that he will not suffer foolish Sinners to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others so miserable as they would; that as many
furious <hi>Phaetons</hi> as there are in the World, it is not yet all in
flames; but the Moral, as well as the Natural World, has its
Temperate, as well as Torrid Zones; and what shall we
attribute this to, if we do not attibute it to Providence?
To what else can we ascribe our deliverance from those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
Snares which were laid for us, and which we knew
nothing of, till we had escaped; nay, which, it may be,
we know nothing of to this day? how many wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
prove abortive? how many secret Plots are discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when ripe for execution? how often does God put a
hook into the nostrils of the proudest Tyrants, and by some
cross Accidents, or by weak and contemptible means,
breaks their Power, and humbles them to the dust? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and Profane Histories are full of such Examples, which
can be attributed to nothing else but a Divine Providence,
which sets bounds to the Waves of the Sea, and to the Rage
and Pride of men. The Scripture teaches us to ascribe our
deliverance from all the evils we escape, as well as all the
good we enjoy, to a Divine Providence; and then we must
acknowledge, that the Divine Providence prevents all that
evil which bad men would do, but can't; and who knows
how much this is? who knows how much evil bad men
would do, had they no restraint? that we have much more
reason to adore the Divine Goodness for restraining the
Lusts and Passions of men, which prevents an universal
deluge of misery, than complain that he suffers so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
to afflict the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:50615:135"/>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Especially if we consider in the next place, That
God permits bad men to do no more hurt and mischief,
than what he over-rules to wise and good purposes. For
God many times serves the wise ends of his Providence by
the wickedness of men, to punish the wicked, and to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
the good; to exercise the Graces and Vertues of good
men, or to give terrible Examples of his Vengeance on the
wicked; and all this, how severe soever it may be, proves
the Goodness of Providence, because it is for the general
good of the World, that bad men should be punished, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
destroyed, and that good men should be made
better, and become great and eminent Examples of Faith
and Patience. Whatever evils and miseries there are in the
World, if there be no more than the good government of
the World requires; if no man suffers any more than what
he deserves, or than what will do himself good, if he wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
improves it; or will do others good, if they will either
take warning by his Sufferings, or imitate his Vertues, all
this is not only reconcilable with the Goodness of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but is an eminent instance of it; for to do good is an
expression of Goodness, though the ways of doing it may
be very severe.</p>
               <p>This is a sufficient justification of Providence, even as
to those evils which God himself immediately inflicts upon
the World, that he inflicts no more, nor greater evils, than
what are for the good government of the World, as I have
observed before; but it is much more so with reference to
those evils which men bring upon themselves; for is it not
wonderful Goodness in God to defend us from our selves,
to qualify the malignity of our own sins, to suffer us to do
our selves no more hurt, than what he can turn into great
good to us, if we consider our ways, and learn wisdom by
the things which we suffer? So to restrain bad men, that
they shall hurt no body but those whom God thinks fit to
punish, or to correct, or to exercise with some severities;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50615:136"/>
and that they shall do no more hurt, nor hurt any longer
than the Divine Wisdom sees useful to these ends?</p>
               <p>Let us then briefly review this Objection and Answer;
and setting aside the consideration of God and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
let us suppose it to be the case of a Father. And,
I hope, what we our selves would allow to be a reasonable
defence of earthly Parents, will be thought a good justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of God and his Providence.</p>
               <p>Suppose then a Father has several Children, whom he
providees very bountifully for; and sends them abroad into
the World in such hopeful circumstances, that if they will
be frugal, diligent and vertuous, they may live happily,
and increase their Fortunes: Should such Children turn
Prodigals, and waste their Estates in rioting and luxury,
destroy their health, and suffer all the miseries of sickness
and poverty; would any man blame their good Father for
this; and would not such a good man think himself much
injured, should he be accused of unkindness and severity
to his Children, only because after all the kindness he could
show them, they have made themselves miserable? especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if we suppose this kind Father to keep such a watchful
eye over them, and to take such prudent and effectual care,
as not to suffer them utterly to undo themselves, to make
their condition hopeless and desperate, but only to let them
feel the smart of their own folly, to bring them to more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thoughts, not to perish under it, till there is no hope
left of reclaiming them. What could a kind Father do
more for Prodigals, unless you would have him maintain
them in their luxury and lewdness, which a wise and good
Father can't do? He brought none of these miseries upon
them, and it is kindness to let them smart under them, to
prevent their undoing as long as he can; he turns the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they bring upon themselves only into a state of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
he suffers them to injure one another to make them
all sensible of their folly; and those who are past recovery,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50615:136"/>
he makes Examples of greater Severities to reform the rest:
If this would be thought a kind, merciful, and wise Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in earthly Parents, apply it to the Providence of God,
and you have an answer to most of the miseries of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> In answer to this Objection against the Goodness
of Providence, from the many evils and miseries that are in
the World, we may consider further, That as most of these
evils are owing to our own, or to other mens sins, so it is
we our selves who give the sting to them all: As many
external Calamities as there are in the World, and as the
present state of this World requires there should be in it;
God has made abundant provision for the support of good
men under them. It is not always in our power to avoid
many of the Sufferings and Calamities of life, but it is our
own fault if we sink under them. Natural Courage and
strength of mind, the powers of Reason, and a wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the nature of things, the belief of a Good
Providence, which takes care of us, and orders all things
for our good, and the certain hopes of immortal life, will
support good men under their sufferings, and make them
light and easy: And if God enable us to bear our sufferings,
and to enjoy our selves under them, to possess our Souls
in patience, and to rejoyce in hope; though we may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
we are not miserable; and Sufferings without misery
are no formidable Objections against Providence; this is
like the Bush, that was on fire, but was not burnt, a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
token of the Divine Presence and Favour, and that can
be no objection against the Goodness of Providence. What
is merely external, may afflict a good man, but cannot
make him miserable; for no man is miserable, whose mind
is easy and chearful, full of great hopes, and supported
with Divine Joys. But the disorders of our Passions make
us miserable, and make us sink under external Sufferings.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50615:137"/>
An immoderate love of this World, Pride, Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
Anger, Hatred, Revenge, make every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
uneasy, and any great Sufferings intolerable. It is
this that makes Poverty and Disgrace, the loss of Estate and
Honours, the Frowns of Princes, and the Clamours of the
People, such unsufferable Evils, which a wise and good
man cannot only bear, but modestly despise. It is this
that terrifies us with the least approach of danger, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts
us with fear, and care, and solicitude, and with all
the imaginary evils, and frightful appearances, which a
scared fancy can raise in the dark. Especially when guilt
makes men afraid, and look upon every misfortune, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
affliction, as a token of the Divine Vengeance,
and a terrible presage of the endless miseries of the next
life.</p>
               <p>External Evils and Calamities, as far as they are good,
can be no objection against the Goodness of Providence;
and they are good, as far as the Providence of God is
concerned in them, for they are permitted and ordered by
God for wise and good ends; and if they do not prove
good to us, it is our own fault, who will not be made
better by them.</p>
               <p>Whatever men suffer, if their sufferings do not make
them miserable, this is no just reproach to Providence; for
God may be very good to his Creatures, whatever they
suffer, while they can suffer, and be happy; not perfectly
and compleatly happy, which admits of no sufferings,
but such a degree of self-enjoyment, as reconciles external
Sufferings with inward peace, contentment, patience,
hope; which is the happiness of a suffering state, and a
much greater happiness than the most prosperous Fortune
without it; and if we be not thus happy under all our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
it is our own fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:50615:137"/>
Thus the <hi>Wise-man</hi> tells us, That it is not so much exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sufferings (which is all that can be charged upon the
Divine Providence) which makes men miserable, but the
inward guilt and disorders of their own minds;<note place="margin">See Sermon before the Queen on that Text.</note> 18. <hi>Prov.
14. The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
spirit who can bear?</hi> And if all that God inflicts on us
may be born, our misery is owing to our selves. But I have
so particularly discoursed this upon another occasion, that
I shall enlarge no farther on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Another Objection against the Goodness of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
is God's partial and unequal care of his Creatures;
and I confess Partiality is a very great Objection, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Justice, and an Universal Goodness, and such the
Goodness of Providence must be.</p>
               <p>The foundation of the Objection is this: That there
are very different ranks and conditions of men in the World;
Rich and Poor, High and Low, Princes and Subjects, and
a great many degrees of Power, and Honour, and Riches,
and Poverty; and we cannot say, that God deals equally
by all these men, whose Fortunes are so very unequal:
But there is no great difficulty in answering this. For,</p>
               <p>1. The Goodness of Providence consists in consulting
the general good and happiness of Mankind, and of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men in subordination to the good of the whole; and
this fully answers the Objection: For though there are too
many who are not well satisfied with their own Station,
and never will be, unless they could be uppermost; yet I
dare appeal to any man of common sense, whether it be
not most for the good of Mankind, that there should be
very different Ranks and Orders of men in the World.</p>
               <p>There is not any one thing more necessary to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the World, than good Government; and yet there
could be no Government in an equality; and there is nothing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50615:138"/>
makes such an inequality like an unequal Fortune. Were
all men equally rich and great, there would be neither
Subjects, nor Servants; for no man will chuse to be a
Subject or a Servant, who has an equal title to be a Lord and
Master. And then no man could be rich and great, which
are only comparative terms; and which is worse than that,
no man could be safe. And if an inequality in mens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
be as necessary as Government, that is a sufficient
justification of Providence, for Humane Societies cannot
subsist without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> And yet it is a very great mistake to think, that
the Happiness of men differ as much as their Fortunes do;
that a Prince is as much happier, as he is greater than his
Subjects; for all the World knows, that Happiness is not
entailed on Riches, and Power, and Secular Honours; as
they have their advantages, so they have very troublesome
and sowre allays; and, it may be, upon a true estimate of
things, as different a show and appearance as men make in
the World, they are pretty equal as to true Enjoyments.
There is very little difference in eating and drinking, while
we have wherewithal to satisfy Nature; for Appetite
makes every thing delicious; and the hard Labour of a
Poor man is much more tolerable than Gout and Stone,
and those sharp or languishing Diseases, which so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attend the Softness and Luxury of the Rich; and as
for Opinion and Fancy it self, which creates the greatest
difference, every Rank of men make a Scene among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and every man finds something to value himself
upon: That it may be, there is nothing wherein all
Mankind are so equal, as in Self-love, and Self-flattery,
and a value for themselves; that though there are many
men who would change Fortunes with others, there are
few that would change themselves; and the difference of
Fortunes is very inconsiderable, while every man is so
well satisfied with himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:50615:138"/>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> This inequality of Fortunes is for the great good
of all Ranks of men, and serves a great many wise Ends
of Providence. It makes some men industrious to provide
for themselves and Families; it inspires others with emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to raise their Fortunes; it gives life and spirit to the
World, and makes it a busy Scene of Action, to keep
what they have, and to make new acquisitions; to excel
their Equals, and rival those above them; And though
through the folly and wickedness of men, this occasions a
great deal of mischief, yet the World would be a very dull
place without it, there would be no encouragement, no
reward for Vertue; Providence it self would have very
little to do; for the visible Rewards of Vertue, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Wickedness, is in the change of mens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
when Industry, Prudence, and Vertue, advance
men of a low Condition to the greatest Places of Trust and
Honour, or at least to a plentiful and splendid Station;
and Prodigality, Luxury, and Impiety, bring Misery,
Poverty, and Contempt, upon Rich and Noble Families;
Such Revolutions as these are great Examples of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Justice of Providence; and therefore the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of mens Fortunes is so far from being an Objection
against Providence, that there could be little visible Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
either of the Goodness or Justice of Providence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
               <p>I cannot without some indignation reflect upon the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ingratitude of Mankind, who live, and move, and
have their being in God; who know how little they deserve
of him, and feel every day how many blessings they receive
from him, and yet seem never better pleased, than when
they can find, or ignorantly invent, some plausible Pretence
to reproach his Goodness; the Sense of all Mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
such Objections; and I should not have thought it
worth the while to answer them, were it not a great
satisfaction, and of great use, to contemplate the Divine
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50615:139"/>
Goodness even on the darkest side of Providence: Which
will teach us a patient and thankful submission to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all our Sufferings, inable us to bear them, and direct us
how to prevent, or remove them; and give us a more
transporting admiration of the Divine Goodness, when we
see it, like the Sun, break through the blackest Clouds.
If the Goodness of God conquer the Sins, the Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mankind, and shines through all those Miseries
which foolish Sinners every day bring upon themselves;
how good is God, when his Goodness flows with an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed,
uninterrupted Current!</p>

               <head type="sub">The Wisdom of Providence.</head>
               <p>THE Unsearchableness of the Divine Wisdom, as I
observed above,<note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> is a very good reason, why we
should not judge or censure such mysterious Passages of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
as we cannot comprehend; but yet it becomes us
to take notice of, and to admire that wonderful Wisdom
which is visible in the government of Mankind. <hi>We cannot
by searching find out God, we cannot find out the Almighty to
perfection: it is as high as heaven, what canst thou do? deeper
than hell, what canst thou know? the measure thereof is longer
than the earth, and broader than the sea,</hi> 11. Job 7, 8, 9. But
though we cannot discover all the Wisdom of Providence,
no more than we can the Wisdom of the Creation, yet we
may discover enough to satisfy us, that the World is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
as well as made with Infinite Wisdom: When we
contemplate God, it is like losing our selves in a boundless
prospect, where we see a great many Glories and Beauties,
but cannot see to the end of it. We may discover admirable
and surprizing Wisdom in that little we see of Providence,
as I have already briefly observed upon several Occasions;
but we know so little of what has been done in the World,
and by what means it was done, and what ends it served, that
it is no wonder if we have as imperfect a view of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Providence, as we have of the History of the World.
But yet whoever diligently applies his mind to the study of
Providence, will see reason to admire a great many Events,
which careless Observers make objections against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
which will be of such great use to confirm us in the
belief of a Providence, and to give us a profound venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine Wisdom, that I shall venture to make
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50615:140"/>
some little Essay of this nature, which though I am sensible
must fall infinitely short of the dignity of the Subject, yet
will suggest some very useful thoughts, and shew us the
most delightful and profitable way of studying Histories,
and Providence. And to do this in the best manner I can,
I shall</p>
               <p>1. Consider some great Events recorded in Scripture,
which are as it it were the Hinges of Providence, whereon
the various Scenes of Providence turned.</p>
               <p>2. I shall take notice of some other visible Marks and
Characters of Wisdom in the more common Events of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
especially such as are made objections against
Providence.</p>
               <p>1. Some great Events recorded in Scripture, which gave
a new face of things to the World, and opened new Scenes
of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The state of Innocence, wherein man was created, was a
state of perfect Happiness. There was no death, no sickness,
no labour, or sorrow; but the fall of man made a very great
change in this visible Creation: Man himself became mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and was condemned to an industrious and laborious
life; according to that Sentence;</hi> Cursed is the ground for
thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
shalt eat the herb of the field: In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it
wast thou taken: For dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>This was a very severe Sentence, which deprived man
of Immortality, and of the easy and happy life of Paradise;
condemned him to labour and sorrow while he lived, and
then to return unto dust; and yet the Wisdom as well as
Justice of Providence is very visible in it; it was not fit
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50615:140"/>
that when man had sinned,<note place="margin">Discourse of Death, <hi>ch. 2. sect.</hi> 1.</note> he should be immortal in this
World; and an industrious and laborious life is the best and
happiest state for fallen man,<note place="margin">Discourse of Judgm. <hi>ch. 1. sect.</hi> 8.</note> as I have elsewhere shown at
large.</p>
               <p>We know little more than this of the Antediluvian
World, till we hear of the general corruption of Mankind,
<hi>That the earth was filled with violence, for all flesh had corrupted
his way upon the earth;</hi> insomuch, <hi>that it repented the Lord
that he had made man upon the earth, and it grieved him at
his heart,</hi> 6. Gen. This was so universal a Corruption, that
there was but one righteous Family left, only <hi>Noah,</hi> and
his three Sons; and therefore God resolved to sweep them
all away with an universal Deluge, excepting that one
righteous Family, whom he preserved in the Ark, which
he appointed <hi>Noah</hi> to prepare for that purpose.</p>
               <p>The justice of this no man can dispute; for if all Flesh
corrupt its ways, God may as justly destroy a whole world
of Sinners, as he can punish, or cut off any one single Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
But that which I am now concerned for, is to shew
the wonderful Wisdom of Providence in the destruction of
the Old World by a deluge of Water; and rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this, we must consider the several Circumstances
of the Story, and what God intended by it.</p>
               <p>Now though that wicked Generation of men deserved
to be destroyed, yet God did not intend to put a final end
to this World, nor to cut off the whole Race of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
but to raise a new Generation of men from a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Seed; and to make the destruction of the Old World a
standing Warning, and a visible Lesson of Righteousness
to the New: And a few Observations will satisfy us, that
nothing could be more wisely designed for this purpose:</p>
               <p>1. Let us consider the Wisdom of Providence in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Old World without the utter destruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
It was too soon to put a final end to the World
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50615:141"/>
which he had so lately made, without reproaching his own
Wisdom in making it. There had been very little of the
Wisdom of Government yet seen, but one Act, and that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluding
in all disorder and confusion; and had God left off
here, and put a final end to the Race of Mankind, it had
been but a very ill spectacle to the Angelical World, to see
a whole Species of Reasonable Beings so soon destroyed.
The Old Serpent, who deceived our first Parents, would
have gloried in his Voctory, that he had utterly spoiled and
ruined the best part of this visible Creation, and even forced
God to destroy the most excellent Creature he had made on
Earth. But God had threatned the Serpent, that the Seed
of the Woman should break his head, and therefore the
whole Posterity of <hi>Eve</hi> must not be destroyed, but a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Seed must be preserved to new-people the World.</p>
               <p>But besides this, The destruction of the Old World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intended as a warning to the New, it was necessary
there should be some living Witnesses, both of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and the resurrection of the World, to assure their
Posterity of what they had seen, and to preserve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of it to all Generations. Of which more presently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Wisdom of God was very visible in delaying
so terrible an Execution till there was no remedy. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
a World carries great horror with it, and makes a
frightful representation of God, if it be not qualified with
all the most tender and softning Circumstances. And
I cannot think of any thing that can justify Providence in
it (excepting the last Judgment, when the Divine Wisdom
thinks fit to put a final end to this World) but the irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
state of Mankind, and the absolute necessity of some
new methods of reforming the World.</p>
               <p>And therefore God delayed the destruction of the Old
World, till all Flesh had corrupted his ways, and there
was but one Righteous Family left, which must be in
danger of being corrupted too by the universal wickedness
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50615:141"/>
of the Age. However, it is certain, That though <hi>Noah</hi>
might have preserved his own Integrity, and have taught
his own Family that Fear and Worship of God, yet he
could do no good upon the rest of the World; he was a
Preacher of Righteousness, but his Sermons had no effect:
It is generally concluded by the Ancients, that he was an
hundred years in building the Ark, and all this while he
gave visible warning to them of the approaching Deluge:
Now when it was impossible by any ordinary means to put
a stop to the wickedness of Mankind, what remained but to
destroy that corrupt and incurable Generation, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
righteous <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, to propagate a new
Generation of men, and to train them up in the fear and
worship of God? Had he delayed a little longer, the
whole World might have been corrupt, without one
righteous man in it; and then he must either have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
or preserved a World of Atheists and profligate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or must have destroyed them all: But it more became
the Divine Wisdom, when Religion was reduced to one
Family, to defer Vengeance no longer, while he had one
righteous Family to save, to preserve the Race of Mankind,
and to restore lost Piety and Vertue to the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The Wisdom of Providence in destroying the Old
World is very visible in the manner of doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> For first it was a Miraculous and Supernatural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and therefore an undeniable evidence of the
Power and Providence of God. There are no visible Causes
in Nature to do this, and therefore it must be done by a
Power Superior to Nature.</p>
               <p>Some men think it sufficient to disparage the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
Account of the Deluge, if they can prove the natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of it; and others, who profess to believe the
Story, think themselves much concerned to give a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Account of it, without having recourse to Miracles,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50615:142"/>
and a Supernatural Power, which they say unbecomes
Philosophers: But if it unbecomes Philosophers to believe
Miracles, I doubt they will think it very much below
them to be Christians, which no man can be, who does
not believe Miracles; and if they will allow of Miracles
in any case, methinks they should make no scruple to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the destruction of the World to a Miraculous and
Supernatural Power.</p>
               <p>The comfort is, the truth of the Story does not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Philosophical Hypothesis; we do not believe, that the
whole World was drowned, because we can tell by what
Natural Causes it might be drowned, but because <hi>Moses</hi>
has recorded it in his Writings, who, we know, was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired: And we know also, that there has been
no satisfactory account given yet from the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Philosophy, how the whole World could be
drowned; at least none that will agree with the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
History, either of the Creation, or of the Deluge; and it
is better to have no Account, than such an Account as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
<hi>Moses,</hi> could any such be given; for this confutes, or
at least discredits the Story it self, for which we have no
Authentick Authority, when the Authority of <hi>Moses</hi> is
lost. But indeed it is no service to Religion to seek after
Natural Causes for the destruction of the World, any more
than it is to resolve the making of the World into Natural
Causes; for it is great good nature in men to own a God,
if they can make and destroy a World without him; there
can be no such thing as natural Causes, till the World is
made, and every thing endowed with its Natural Vertues
and Powers, and united into a regular frame, with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
dependance and connexion; and therefore it is a vain
thing to talk of making the World by Natural Causes,
when it is demonstrable, that there can be no Natural
Causes till the World is made: And it is as certain, that
Nature must move unnaturally, and be put into an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50615:142"/>
disorder, before the World can be destroyed; for while
Natural Causes keep their Natural Course, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
not destroy the World; and therefore the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the World is not owing to Natural Causes, but to
praeternatural Disorders; and what Philosophy can give an
account of that? What can put Nature into such an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
disorder, but the same Divine Power which put it
into order, and gave Laws to it?</p>
               <p>And this is what God intended in the destruction of the
Old World, to give a visible and lasting proof of his Being
and Providence to the New, by such a Miraculous Deluge,
as could be attributed to no other Cause, but a Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p>That universal Corruption of Mankind would persuade
us, that the very belief and notion of a God was lost
among them; or if it be hard to conceive how that should
be, when the World by computation was not Seventeen
hundred years old, and <hi>Lamech, Noah</hi>'s Father, lived fifty
years with <hi>Adam</hi> himself, that it seems impossible that the
Tradition of God's creating the World should have been
lost in so short a time; yet at least they could have no sense
of God's Justice and Providence; they could not believe
that God took any notice of their Actions, or would exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
such a terrible Vengeance on them for their sins. We
do not read of any one Act of Judgment which God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
before the Flood; and it is not improbable, that his
sparing <hi>Cain,</hi> when he had killed his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> might
encourage them with hopes of impunity, whatever wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
they committed; and therefore the Divine Wisdom
saw it necessary to put an end to the Old, and to begin the
New World with a visible demonstration of his Power and
Justice, to teach men the fear, and reverence, and worship of
that God, who not only made the World, but has once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
it, and therefore can destroy it again, with all its
wicked Inhabitants, whenever he pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:50615:143"/>
Now to make this a lasting proof of God's Power and
Justice, it must be evident beyond all contradiction, that it
was God's doing, and therefore it was necessary that God
should destroy the world in so miraculous a manner, as
could be attributed to no other Cause; for it is the true Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Atheism and Infidelity to attribute nothing to God,
which they can ascribe to any visible Cause.</p>
               <p>Had all Mankind, excepting <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, been
destroyed by Plague, or Famine, or Wild Beasts, though
such a general destruction would have convinced Wise and
Reasonable men, that the Hand, and the Vengeance of God
was in it; yet if we may judge of the rest of Mankind by
the wonderful improvements in Wit and Philosophy which
our Modern Atheists have made, they would think scorn
to attribute Plague, or Famine, or such like evil Accidents
to God, though all Mankind were destroyed by them. But
when they hear of a World drowned, and know not where
to find water to drown it, without a miraculous dissolution
of Nature; they must either laugh at the Story, which
men in their wits can't well do, or they must believe a God
and a Providence. But whatever shift the Infidels of our Age
may make to disbelieve the Universal Deluge, it must be
confessed, that it was a very wise and most effectual means
to convince that new Generation of men, while the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Tradition of the Deluge was preserved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Wisdom of the Divine Providence was seen in
destroying that wicked Generation of men, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the Earth. God did not intend to put a final end
to the Race of Mankind, but the Earth was to be again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by a new Generation; and a Deluge of Waters was
best fitted to this purpose, which did no hurt to the Earth,
when it was dried up again, but rather moistened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
it with new Seeds and Principles of life.</p>
               <p>There are but two ways we know of to destroy this
Earth, either by Water or Fire; it has already been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50615:143"/>
by Water, and will be destroyed by Fire; and it is
enough to satisfy any man, that this is not Accident, but a
Wise Design, to consider, that a Deluge of Water was made
use of to purge and reform the World, but Fire is reserved
for the final destruction of it. Whereas, had this Order
been inverted, as it might have been, had it been mere
Chance, it is evident that the Earth could neither have
been preserved from Fire, nor utterly destroyed by Water,
without a perpetual Deluge. A Deluge of Water does not
destroy the Earth, nor make it uninhabitable after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
ceases; but Fire destroys the Frame and Constitution
of it, and melts all into one confused mass; there is some
defence against a Deluge, <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons were preserved
in the Ark, to people the New World; but there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against Flames; the whole Earth, and all the wicked
Inhabitants of it, must burn together: And this is one
wise Reason, why God chose to drown the World, not to
burn it, because the end of all things was not yet come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> There is great variety of Wisdom to be observed
in God's preserving <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons in the Ark from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
by Water.</p>
               <p>For <hi>first,</hi> as I observed before, this was very necessary
to preserve the Race of Mankind to new-people the World,
which much more became the Divine Wisdom, than to
have created man a-new. When <hi>all flesh had corrupted his
ways,</hi> it became God to try new Methods of reforming the
World; for this opens new and surprizing Scenes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and displays such a multifarious Wisdom in the
government of Mankind, as is much more wonderful than
the Creation of a New World would be: But had God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the whole Race of men, and created a new Man
to inhabit the New World, this would have argued some
defect in the first Creation; for there can be no pretence
for destroying Man to make him again, but a design to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50615:144"/>
make him better; to correct that in a second trial, which
Experience had discovered to be faulty in the first: But
though the wisdom of Government will admit of various
Trials and Experiments, the Wisdom of Creation wont:
The Government of free Agents must be accommodated to
their Natures, and Dispositions, not only to what God
made them, but to what they make themselves; and
therefore the Methods of Government must change, as
men change themselves; but the Natures of all things are
made only by God, and if there be any fault in them, it is
chargeable upon the Divine Wisdom; and to make Man,
and destroy him, and make him again, would argue a
great fault somewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> I observed also before, That to make the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Old World of any use to propagate Religion
and Piety in the New, it was necessary that some Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Old World should survive the Deluge, to be
Witnesses of that Terrible Destruction.</p>
               <p>Had no man survived, though God should have created
man a-new, that new Generation of men could have known
nothing of the Deluge, but by Revelation; whereas God
intended a sensible proof of his Power and Providence,
which Mankind wanted.</p>
               <p>Besides that Revelation, which we may suppose God
made to <hi>Adam</hi> of the Creation of the World, and his own
sense, that he himself was but just then made, and was
the first and the only man upon Earth, there are such visible
Marks of a Divine Wisdom and Power in the frame of the
World, as one would think should be sufficient to convince
men, that the World was made, and is preserved, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by God; and yet because no man saw the World
made, neither Reason, nor Revelation can persuade some
men that God made the World. And is it reasonable then
to think, that when there are no remaining signs of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
left, the belief of a Deluge should for any long time
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50615:144"/>
have prevailed in the world without any living Witnesses,
who saw the Deluge, though we should suppose God to
have revealed it to new-created man? No man could see
the Creation of the world, because the world must be made
before man was made to live in it; but though no man saw
the world made, there were some who saw the destruction
which the Deluge made, which was as visible a proof of
the Divine Power, and a much greater proof of a Just and
Righteous Providence. No man who believes that God
destroyed the Old World with a Deluge of Water, can
doubt whether God made the world, and governs it; and
for this the New World had the testimony of Eye-witnesses,
which is as sensible a proof of a God, and a Providence, as
we can possibly have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The preservation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons in the Ark,
was an evident proof, that this Deluge was sent by God:
God fore-warned <hi>Noah</hi> of it an hundred years before it
came, and commanded him to prepare an Ark, and gave
him directions how to make it. Thus much is certain,
That <hi>Noah</hi> did know of it before-hand, and prepared an
Ark, which remained as a visible Testimony of the Flood
to future Generations. Now there being no Natural
Causes of the Flood, there could be no Natural Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
of it. Our Saviour himself observes, That there
were not the least Symptoms of any such thing, till <hi>Noah</hi>
entred into the Ark; and therefore <hi>Noah</hi> had no other way
of knowing this, but by Revelation; and it was so incredible
a thing in it self, that the rest of Mankind would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, though he warned them of it, and they saw that
he believed it himself, by his preparing an Ark for his own
safety. And if we believe the Account that <hi>Moses</hi> gives
of it, that some of all sorts of Living Creatures, both the
Beasts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air, were preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark (as we must believe, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Universal Deluge, unless we will say, that God
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50615:145"/>
new-made all Living Creatures after the Flood) what
account can be given of this, that some of all sorts, in
such numbers as God had appointed, and had prepared
reception for, should come of their own accord to <hi>Noah,</hi>
when he was ready to enter into the Ark, had they not
been led thither by a Divine Hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> The preservation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons in the Ark
did not only prove, that the Deluge was sent by God, but
was a plain Evidence for what reason God sent such a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Judgment; <hi>viz.</hi> To put an end to that wicked Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of men, and to new-people the world with a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Seed. This Reason God gave to <hi>Noah,</hi> and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing speaks it. For when all the wicked Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the world were destroyed, and not one escaped
the Deluge, but only that one Righteous Family, which
had escaped the Corruptions of the Age too, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the peculiar Order and Direction of God, this is
a visible Judgment upon all the wicked of the Earth, and
makes a visible distinction between Good and Bad men.
When such Evils and Calamities befall the world, as may
be resolved into Natural or Moral Causes, as Plagues, and
Famines, and Wars, Fires, and Earthquakes; and it may
be Good and Bad men share pretty equally in the publick
Misfortunes; Atheists and Infidels will not allow these
Evils to be inflicted by God, much less to be the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sin, when they make no visible distinction between
the good and the bad; but the Universal Deluge was both
a Supernatural and a distinguishing Judgment; none but
God could thus destroy the Earth, and none but the wicked
were destroyed; and therefore this is an undiable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Justice and Righteousness of God, that he
hates wickedness, and will punish wicked men.</p>
               <p>There are some other Marks of Excellent Wisdom in the
Universal Deluge, which I shall only name, because, tho
they are worth observing, yet they are of less moment as
to my present Design.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:50615:145"/>
As the Deluge was to be a lasting proof of a Just Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the New World; and as you have heard, was
upon all accounts admirably fitted to that purpose; so we
may reasonably suppose, that when it came, it convinced
that wicked Generation of men, and brought them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which it gave them some time for; and though
it could not save them in this world, who knows, but that
a sudden repentance upon such a sudden conviction might
obtain mercy for them in the next. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher
of Righteousness; he had often reproved them for their
sins, and threatned them with a Deluge, but they would
not believe him, though they saw him preparing the Ark;
but when they saw the Flood come, they knew then the
meaning of it, from what <hi>Noah</hi> had often told them; and
this must needs convince them of the terrible Justice and
Vengeance of God: And the gradual increase of the Flood
gave them some time to repent in, and to beg God's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
and I'm sure this makes a glorious representation
both of the Goodness and Wisdom of God in the most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judgment that ever was executed upon the world, if
we had sufficient reason to believe, as there want not some
fair appearances of it, that God intended the Deluge as well
to convince and save all that could be brought to repentance
in the Old World, as to reform the New.</p>
               <p>Thus since God had determined to destroy that wicked
Generation of men, and to preserve only <hi>Noah</hi> and his
three Sons; to destroy the Earth by a Deluge, and to shut
up <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, was as great, or a greater mercy to
<hi>Noah,</hi> than his preservation was: Let us suppose, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of drowning the world, God had at once destroyed all
Mankind by Plague, or Thunder from Heaven, or some
other sudden stroke, excepting <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, who
should be Eye-witnesses of this Terrible Execution, and
live to see the Earth covered with dead Bodies, and none
left to bury them; and their Cities lie waste and desolate
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50615:146"/>
without Inhabitants; who can conceive, what the horror
of such a sight would have been? who would have been
contented to live in such a world, to converse only with the
Images of Death, and with noisome Carkasses? But God
in great mercy shut up <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, that he should
not see the Terror and Consternation of Sinners when the
Flood came; and he washed away all their dead Bodies
into the Caverns of the Earth, with all the marks and signs
of their Old Habitations, that when <hi>Noah</hi> came out of the
Ark, he saw nothing but a new and a beautiful World; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to disturb his imagination, no marks or remains of
that Terrible Vengeance.</p>
               <p>This indeed destroyed all other living Creatures, as well
as Sinners, excepting those that were in the Ark with <hi>Noah;</hi>
but this, I suppose, is no great objection against Providence,
that the Creatures, which were made for man's use, were
destroyed with man, since God preserved some of each
Kind for a new increase; and yet the Wisdom of God was
very visible in this; for had the World been full of Beasts,
when there were but four men in it, the whole Earth
would quickly have been possessed by Wild and Savage
Creatures, which would have made it a very unsafe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for men.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Argument, the sum of it in short is
this: When the wickedness of Mankind was grown uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
and incurable, it became the Wisdom of God to put
an end to that Corrupt State, and to propagate a new Race
of men from a Righteous Stock; and to take the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
course to possess them with a lasting belief of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Providence, and with a religious awe of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Power: To this end he destroyed the Old World
with a Deluge of Water, and preserved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons
in the Ark; which had all the advantages imaginable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
men from sin, which brought a Deluge upon the Old
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50615:146"/>
World; and to encourage the practise of true Piety and
Vertue, which preserved <hi>Noah</hi> from the Common Ruin.</p>
               <p>We see in this Example, that numbers are no defence
against the Divine Justice, and therefore no security to
Sinners; when <hi>all flesh had corrupted his ways,</hi> God destroyed
them all; nay we see, that the more wickedness prevails in
the world, the nearer it is to destruction; that the great
multitude of Sinners is so far from being a reasonable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
and encouragement to sin, that it is a fair warning
to considering men, to separate and distinguish themselves
from a wicked world by an exemplary Vertue, that God
may distinguish them also, when he comes to Judgment,
which an universal corruption of manners shews to be very
near; and it is a dangerous thing to sin with a multitude,
when the multitude of Sinners will hasten Vengeance.</p>
               <p>Here we see, that though Sinners may be very secure,
they are never safe; as our Saviour observes, it was <hi>in the
days of Noah, they were eating and drinking; marrying, and
giving in marriages, until the day that Noah went into the
Ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away,</hi>
24. Matth. 37, 38, 39. God may delay punishment a great
while, and seem to take no notice of what is done below,
till Sinners begin to think,<note place="margin">50. Psal. 21.</note> that he is <hi>such a one as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
but their Judgment all this while <hi>neither slumbers,
nor sleeps;</hi> there may be the greatest Calm, and the serenest
days, before the most terrible Earthquakes; and the longer
God has kept silence, the more reason have we to expect a
severe and surprizing Vengeance; which makes the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>'s
Advice in such Cases very seasonable:<note place="margin">v. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Now consider
this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there
be none to deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And who would be afraid, or be ashamed of <hi>Noah</hi>'s sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
to be good alone, and to be the single Example of
Piety and Vertue, that remembers, that he alone with his
three Sons, were saved from the Deluge? and he that would
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50615:147"/>
be a <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, must be a <hi>Noah</hi> in a wicked
World.</p>
               <p>But this is sufficient to justify the Wisdom of Providence
as to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, which put an end to the Old World;
and now let us take a view of the New.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that late terrible Example of God's
Power and Justice in the destruction of the Old World, that
new Generation of men began to grow very corrupt; as
God foresaw they would, but resolved to try some new
methods, and not to drown the world any more:
When <hi>Noah</hi> had offered a Burnt-offering to the Lord,
<hi>of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl,</hi> after his
coming out of the Ark, <hi>The Lord smelled a sweet savour;
and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground
any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is
evil from his youth: Neither will I again smite any more every
living thing, as I have done,</hi> 8. Gen. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>The first Exploit we hear of them, was their building
the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> which Story is so briefly related by
<hi>Moses,</hi> that we cannot give a perfect account of the Reasons
and Circumstances of it. The most probable Account seems
to be this; that <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Cush,</hi> and Grandson
of <hi>Ham,</hi> in which Line True Religion and Piety first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
affecting an Universal Empire, to prevent the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
of the People, persuaded them to build a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Seat for his Empire, which should be a center of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them, at what distance soever they should be forced
to remove: That the whole Earth should be but one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and <hi>Babel</hi> the Royal Palace. Had this Design suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
the whole world would have been but one People,
and the Universal Monarchy in the Line of <hi>Ham,</hi> which
would quickly have endangered as general a corruption of
Mankind, as there was before the Flood.</p>
               <p>Let us then consider what Course God took to prevent
this, and the excellent wisdom of it, which we have
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50615:147"/>
an account of, 11. <hi>Genes.</hi> 7, 8. That <hi>God confounded
their language, so that they could not understand one another's
speech;</hi> and by this means, <hi>scattered them abroad from thence
upon the face of all the earth, and they left off to build the city.</hi>
Now not to take notice, that this was the most ready
way to people the whole Earth, even the remotest Corners
of it, which was for the great good of Mankind; found
them work to do, forced them upon the invention of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Arts, and by the benefit of Trade and Commerce,
made every Country, which was not wanting to it self, a
little World, and every part to enjoy all the pleasures and
advantages of the whole: I say, besides this, it was the
most likely way that could be used at that time, to prevent
the Universal Corruption of Mankind. For,</p>
               <p>1. This separated the Families of <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> from
the Family of <hi>Ham,</hi> where the Infection was already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun;
and would have spread apace by the advantage of
Power and Empire. When <hi>Cain</hi> had slain his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi>
God sent him away out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family, that his presence
and Example might do no hurt; and if by <hi>the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of men</hi> in 6. <hi>Genes.</hi> we understand, as some good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
do, those who descended of <hi>Cain;</hi> and by <hi>the sons
of God,</hi> the Posterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> in whose Family the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the True God was preserved, we may observe, that
<hi>Moses</hi> dates the general Corruption of Mankind from the
union of these two Families; When <hi>the sons of God saw the
daughters of men, that they were fair, and took them wives of
all which they chose.</hi> And had the Universal Empire been
established in the Family of <hi>Ham,</hi> and the Posterity of
<hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> been brought into subjection to them, as
they must in a short time have been, what less could have
been expected from such a Union and Government, but
another Antediluvian corruption of all Flesh?</p>
               <p>This dispersion then was necessary to prevent a general
Corruption; but we see in the Example of <hi>Cain,</hi> that a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50615:148"/>
meer local separation is no security, for they may come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again, as the Sons of God, and the Daughters of men
in process of time did. And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The most lasting dispersion and separation is by a
confusion of Languages, which hinders all intercourse and
communication; at least till there be a remedy found
against it by learning each other's Language, which was a
work of time, and was never likely to be so general, as to
be the means of a common intercourse. This effectually
divided them at first, and would always keep Nations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
till Foreign Arms should give new Laws, and a
new Language to a Conquered People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> I observe farther, That the more divisions of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
were made, and the greater the dispersion was, the
greater security was it against a general Corruption; which
is a reason not only for separating the Family of <hi>Ham</hi> from
the Families of <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> but for separating them
from each other, and dividing them into smaller Bodies:
For the more Divisions there are, whatever part were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the less could the Corruption spread, when there
was no communication between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> This also divided Mankind into several little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Monarchies, under the government of the
Heads of their several Families; which kept all Mankind
under a stricter government, than if the whole world had
been one great Empire, which would have proved a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Domination, but could have taken little care of
the Manners of Subjects; especially if the Government it
self was corrupt, the whole world must be corrupt with it.
But when so many distinct Societies were formed, this gave
them distinct Interests, and made their Laws and Customs,
the very humour and genius of the People, so different from
each other, as would keep them distinct: And this would
necessarily occasion mutual Emulations and Jealousies to
rival their Neighbours in Riches and Power; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50615:148"/>
be done without wise Laws, and a strict Discipline, and
the encouragement of Labour and Industry, of liberal Arts,
and all social Vertues, and the suppression of such Vices, as
weaken Government, and emasculate mens Spirits: This
effect we know in a great measure it had, as we learn from
the most early Accounts of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Commonwealths,
where we meet with so many excellent Laws, and such
great Examples of Frugality, Temperance, Fortitude, and
a generous love of their Country, which may in a great
measure be attributed to their mutual Emulations, which
taught them prudence and justice at home and abroad, and
forced on them the exercise of many Civil and Military
Vertues.</p>
               <p>It had indeed been more for the peace and quiet of the
world, that all Mankind had been but one People, and one
Kingdom, without divided Interests and Governments;
but such a profound state of ease is apt to loosen the Rains
of Government, and to corrupt mens minds with sloth and
luxury; and therefore is no more fit for a corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
State, than it would have been, that the Earth
should have brought forth Fruit of it self without Humane
Labour and Industry. But Jealousies and Emulations, the
necessity of defending themselves against Potent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
or the ambition to equal, or to outdo them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
publick Vices, and is a spur to Verture. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>It is true, this is the occasion of many Miseries to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
of all the Calamities and Desolations of War, and
therefore we must consider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly.</hi> That this is so far from being an Objection against
Providence, while God keeps the Sword in his own hand,
that it is an admirable Instrument of Government, and a
signal demonstration of the Divine Wisdom.</p>
               <p>God had promised, that <hi>he would not again any more smite
every living thing, as he had done,</hi> 8. Genes. 21. And yet
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50615:149"/>
Mankind could not be governed without some restraints
and punishments; and it did not become God to punish
Men and Nations, as often as they deserved it, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
hand; and what then could be more wisely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
than so to order it, that if Men and Nations were
wicked, they should scourge and punish one another?</p>
               <p>By this means God can chastise two wicked Nations by
each other's Swords, without destroying either: He can
so lessen their Numbers, and exhaust their Treasures, and
impoverish their Countries, as to force them to peace, and
to reduce them to a laborious and frugal life, which will
cure the wantonness and luxury of Plenty and Ease.</p>
               <p>If a Nation be grown incurably wicked, he can by this
means destroy them, without embroiling the rest of the
world; he can carry them captive into Foreign Countries,
or make them Slaves at home, and subject them to the
Yoke of a Conqueror, who shall correct them, and teach
them better.</p>
               <p>In a word, The dispersion of Mankind by the confusion
of Languages, which divided them into distinct Societies,
Kingdoms, and Commonweals, opened a new Scene of
Providence, with all the variety of Wisdom in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world. The Judgment it self was miraculous,
and as plain an evidence of the Divine Power, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
it self; for to new form a mind, to erace all its old
Ideas of words and sounds, and to imprint new ones on it
in an instant, shews such a superior Power over Nature, as
none but the Author of Nature has; and they must have
been very stupid, if this did not renew and fix the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Divine Power and Providence. But the dispersion
which this confusion of Languages occasioned, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of Mankind into distinct Societies, made the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of many Moral, Civil, and Military Vertues as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
as their own Prosperity and Preservation: And if this
had not so universal an effect as might have been expected,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50615:149"/>
yet it prevented an Universal Corruption, and had a good
effect in many Countries, and by turns in most; that the
world never wanted Examples of States and Kingdoms
which increased and flourished under a prudent and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Government, nor of the ruin of flourishing States by
Idleness, Luxury, Injustice, Oppression, which weakened
and divided them at home, and made them an easy prey to
their provoked, or to their ambitious Neighbours.</p>
               <p>But though the state of the world, as to some moral
Vertues, and good Order and Government, was much
bettered by this means, yet Mankind generally declined to
Idolatry; that the Knowledge and Worship of the one
Supream God was in danger of being utterly lost, and the
lives of men to be corrupted by the impure and filthy Rites
and Mysteries of their Religion. This required a new and
more effectual remedy, and brings me to consider a new
and wonderful Design of the Divine Wisdom for reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World: I mean his chusing <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to be his peculiar People, whom he would govern in so
visible a manner, that all the world might know and fear
the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a large Argument, and full of Mysterious Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but my principal intention at present is to consider
it with relation to the rest of Mankind, and how wisely it
was designed by God to give some check to Idolatry, to
preserve the Worship of the True God, at least in <hi>Israel,</hi>
from whence in time it might be restored again, when lost
in the rest of the world.</p>
               <p>It has, I confess, a very strange appearance at first,
that God should reject, or at least neglect all the rest of
Mankind, and chuse but one Family out of all the world
to place his name among them: <hi>Is God the God of the Iews
only, is he not also of the Gentiles?</hi> 3. Rom. 29. This the
Vainglorious <hi>Iew</hi> imagined, who despised the rest of the
world, as reprobated by God; but the Apostle abhors the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50615:150"/>
thoughts of it, <hi>yes, of the Gentiles also;</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> was
at length convinced by a Vision, That <hi>God was no respecter
of persons; but in every nation, he that feareth him, and
worketh righteousness, is accepted with him,</hi> 10. Acts 34, 35.
Thus it was from the beginning, though the <hi>Iews</hi> did not
think so; and the Apostles themselves at first could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be persuaded of it; and yet how could any man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
honourable thoughts of God, who could conceive
him so partial in his Favours, as to confine the peculiar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of his Love to one Nation, without any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concernment what became of the rest of Mankind?
But if this was, and was intended by God, for the general
good of the world, and was admirably fitted to cure Idolatry,
and to restore the Worship of the one Supream God, it gives
us a new and more glorious prospect of the Wisdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
And to represent this as advantagiously as I can, I
shall first give you a general view of this admirable Design
of the Divine Wisdom, which will enable us the better to
understand, and to give a more intelligible and sensible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the various Providences of God towards <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now we must consider the world at that time as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
with Idolatry, as we may easily conclude, when</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<hi>'s
Family is charged with it; as</hi> Ioshua <hi>told the People of</hi>
Israel <hi>at</hi> Shechem; Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your
fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even
Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor, and
they served other Gods, 24. <hi>Joshua</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Now all men must confess, That it became the Divine
Wisdom to restore and preserve the Faith and Worship of
the One Supreme God, and to keep it alive in the world,
that it might in time, though by slow degrees, prevail over
Idolatry, and the Kingdom of Darkness, and reduce Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to their natural obedience and subjection to God. and
since Experience had proved, that neither the Creation of
the World, nor the Universal Deluge, nor the Confusion
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50615:150"/>
of Languages, could preserve the belief of one Supream
God, the Maker and Governour of the World; but the
New World was as universally over-run with Polytheism
and Idolatry, as the Old World was with Violence; and
that the very dispersion of Mankind, and their division in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
distinct Kingdoms and Societies, which was a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against some other Immoralities, had probably oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
a multiplicity of Gods, while every Nation desired
a God, as well as a King of their own, to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them; I say, this shews what absolute necessity there
was, that the Divine Wisdom should find out some more
effectual and lasting means to convince the world of the
Power and Providence of one Supream God: What other
effectual means God might have chose for this purpose,
does not belong to us to inquire; but it becomes us very
much, to contemplate the Divine Wisdom in hat method
which he did take to reclaim the world.</p>
               <p>Now the way God took was this. He chose <hi>Abraham</hi>
and his Posterity for his peculiar People, whom he govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in as visible a manner, as any Temporal Prince governs
his Subjects: He forbad them to own any other God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
himself, and separated them from the rest of the world
by peculiar Laws and Ceremonies of Worship, to secure
them from the Idolatrous Practises of their Neighbours:
He made himself known, and distinguished himself from all
other Country Gods, by the name of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the
God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> not that he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the God of that Nation, as other Nations had their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Gods, but the God of the whole world, though he was
known and worshipped only in <hi>Israel;</hi> and by this Name
he triumphed over all the Heathen Gods, and wrought
such Signs and Wonders, as might have convinced all men,
if they would have been convinced, that there was no God
but the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> none like him, none that could be
compared to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:50615:151"/>
Consider then, what more sensible proof the world could
possibly have of one Supream God, and of a Sovereign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
than to see a whole Nation worshipping this one
Supream God; which at least would not suffer them to be
wholly ignorant of such a Being, but was a just reason to
examine their natural Notions of a Deity, and the Pretences
of their several Gods. Especially when they see this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
planted in a particular Countrey allotted them by their
God; and the old wicked Inhabitants destroyed, and driven
out from before them, by such a series of Miracles, as were
an undeniable Evidence of such a Divine Power, as all the
Gods of these Countries were not able to oppose. And
that this Nation received their Laws both for Worship, and
Polity, and Conversation, immediately from God, were
govern'd by men appointed by God, and directed in all great
Affairs by Divine Oracles and Prophets, with such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of event, as never failed: That while they adhered
to the Worship of this One Supream God, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
prosperous, as he promised they should be; but when
they declined to Idolatry, and worshipped the Gods of the
Countries round about them, then they were either op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by their Enemies at home, or carried captive into
Foreign Countries. This was a visible proof, that there
was a God in <hi>Israel,</hi> and such a God as would admit of no
other Gods, nor allow them to worship any other, but
punished them severely whenever they did; and all their
other Gods could not help them, nor deliver them out of
his hands.</p>
               <p>This gave sufficient notice to the World of the Glory
and Power of the God <hi>Israel;</hi> but some will still be apt to
ask, Why God did not as sensibly manifest himself to all
the rest of the World, as he did to <hi>Israel?</hi> why he had not
his Oracles and Prophets in other Nations? and they may,
if they please, as reasonably ask, why he does not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inspire every particular man with a Supernatural
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50615:151"/>
Knowledge, and force the Belief of his Being and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon their Minds? Or why he did not by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Power convert the old wicked World, but destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them all, and preserved only that one Righteous Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which had escaped the general Corruption?</p>
               <p>For much like this was the state of mankind with respect
to Idolatry, when God called <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Vr</hi> of the
<hi>Chaldees:</hi> there was not one Nation left, that worshipped
the One Supreme God, and him only; nay, not one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;<note place="margin">24. Josh. 2.</note>
for <hi>Terah, Abraham</hi>'s Father, was an Idolater, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
all the rest of the Family, excepting <hi>Abraham;</hi> for
tho he be not expresly excepted in the Text, yet neither is
he necessarily included; and God's commanding him to
leave his Countrey,<note place="margin">12. Gen.</note> and his Kindred, and his Father's
House, and his ready Compliance with this Command, is
reason to believe that he was the only person in the Family
who had preserved himself from all Idolatrous Worship:
However, it appears, that he was a man of that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Piety and Virtue, and so easily curable if he had been
an Idolater, that God thought him the fittest Person to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
himself to, and to begin a new Reformation of the
World. And therefore as in the days of <hi>Noah</hi> God destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all that wicked Generation of men by the Flood, and
only preserved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons to new people the earth,
and to instil the Seeds and Principles of Piety and Virtue
into their Posterity; so the New world being now univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
corrupted by Idolatry, and God having promised
<hi>Noah</hi> never again to destroy every living thing, as he had
done, he takes another course, and in a manner creates a
new People to be the Worshippers of the One Supreme
God, and in them to make his own Glory and Power
known to the World; and chose <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Faith and Piety, to be the Father of this new peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which should descend from his loins in his Old Age,
not by the mere Powers of Nature, but by Faith in God's
Promise, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:50615:152"/>
The plain state then of the Case is this; When that new
Generation of men had universally corrupted themselves
with Idolatry, notwithstanding all the means God had used
to possess them with a lasting sense of his Being and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
God gives them up to their wilful Blindness, and
leaves them to the Cheats and Impostures of those wicked
Spirits whom they had made their Gods, till he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them from this Apostacy by such Methods as were
agreeable to Human Nature, and became the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
The most effectual way to do this, was to establish
his Worship in some one Nation, which should be a visible
Proof both of the Unity of the Godhead, and of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence; and because there was no such Nation
then in the World, he made a Nation on purpose, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
them a Countrey to dwell in, and signalized them
by extraordinary Providences, as the Worshippers of the
One Supreme God. This was a kind of a new beginning
of the world, which did not put an end to the Idolatrous
World, as <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood put an end to that wicked Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but yet did propagate a new Generation of men in
it, who should in time put an end to that Universal Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and make a new World of it.</p>
               <p>And this is a new Advance the Divine Wisdom made
towards the Recovery of Mankind. When <hi>Adam</hi> had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he and his whole Posterity became mortal, and were
condemned to a laborious life, that in the sweat of their
brows they should eat their bread; which was the best Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative
against the Temptations of Ease, and Sloth, and
Luxury: When notwithstanding this, <hi>all flesh had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his ways,</hi> God destroyed that wicked Generation with an
Universal Deluge, and thereby gave a signal demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Power and Justice to the New World: When
this new Generation of men grew corrupt, God confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Language, and dispersed them over the face of
the whole earth, and formed them into distinct Bodies
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50615:152"/>
and Societies, which prevented a general corruption of
Manners, taught them Civil Justice and many Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which were necessary to the Support and Defence of
Human Societies; but when they all declined to Idolatry,
which would endanger a new and universal Corruption of
Manners, by those impure Ceremonies with which wicked
Spirits would chuse to be worshipped, some new and more
effectual means were to be used to cure this evil. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge, and the Confusion of Languages, had so
abundantly convinced them of a Divine Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that there was no such Creature as an Atheist
known among them, till their ridiculous Idolatries in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
the meanest Creatures, and Viler men, with lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous
or abominable Rites, tempted some men of Wit
and Thought rather to own no God, than such Gods as
the Heathens worshipped: but tho these extraordinary
Events were a manifest Proof of a Divine Power and
Providence, yet it seems they were not thought so express
and direct a Proof of the Unity of the Godhead, at least
not a sufficient Argument against the Worship of Inferior
Deities, whom they supposed intrusted with the immediate
Care of particular Countries. And how could God give
a more sensible demonstration to the world, That he would
not allow the paying Divine Honours to any but himself,
than by raising up a new People, distinguished and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from all the rest of the world, by the sole Worship
of the One Supreme God, and owned by him for his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
People, by as distinguishing Providences; for this not
only proves a Divine Power and Providence, but that there
is but One God whom we ought to worship.</p>
               <p>And this may satisfy us, That God is not so partial in
his Favours, as to prefer one Nation before all the rest of
Mankind; for they were no Nation nor People when God
chose them; for God entred into Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>
and his Seed, when there was none but himself; but when
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50615:153"/>
all the rest of the world were Idolaters, God promised to
multiply <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed into a great Nation, and to make
them his own peculiar People; that is, he made a New
People and Nation, in great kindness to mankind, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Knowledge and Worship of the One Supreme
God, and by degrees to extirpate Idolatry out of the
World.</p>
               <p>But besides this, it was one of the peculiar Privileges
of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Rom. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That to them were committed the Oracles of
God;</hi> and it is certain, it was for the great good of the
world, that these Divine Oracles, a System of Laws both
for Religious Worship, and Civil Conversation, should be
deposited somewhere; for their Idolatry did every day
corrupt the Manners of men, and was likely in time to
destroy all the Natural Notions of Good and Evil; which
made a Written Law necessary, from whence men might
learn their Duty whenever they pleased; and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
these Laws could be given to no other People but the
<hi>Iews,</hi> who alone acknowledged and worshipped the One
Supreme God: For it is not to be conceived, That God
should give Laws to Idolaters, who did not own and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him for their God, or that they should receive Laws
from him. And tho these Laws were immediately given
only to the <hi>Iews,</hi> because there was no other Nation at that
time which owned and worshipped the One Supreme God,
yet as the Knowledge and Worship of God prevailed in
the world, so these Laws would be of more universal use;
as we see it is even to this day: Nay, even while Idolatry
prevailed, the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets very
much reformed the Pagan Philosophy, gave them better
Notions of God, and of Religious Worship, and more
Divine Rules of Life, as is visible in the Philosophy of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
and <hi>Plato,</hi> who are generally thought to have
learnt some of their best Notions from their Conversation
with <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests. But yet the Question is not, What
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50615:153"/>
use the World did make of this? But, What use they
might have made of it? And whether, as the state of the
world then was, any thing could be more wisely designed,
than to preserve the Knowledge and Worship of the One
True God, and a System of Divine Laws, in a Nation
raised up on purpose to season the world, and to preserve
it from an universal Apostacy.</p>
               <p>But God had a more glorious Design than all this, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and chusing his Seed
for his peculiar People: He had promised, That <hi>the seed
of the woman should break the serpents head;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Promise of the Messias, who in the fulness of
time was to appear in the world, to destroy the works of
the Devil: And this is the Covenant which God made
with <hi>Abraham, That in his seed all the nations of the earth
should be blessed.</hi> It was not fitting, that the Messias and
Saviour of the World should descend from Idolaters; and
that when he came into the world, he should find no Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of the One Supreme God in it; and therefore God
entred into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who seems to have
been the only Man of that Age who was free from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and promises to multiply his Seed, and to preserve
his Name and Worship among them; and that the Messias
should descend from his Loins.</p>
               <p>And if we consider what necessary Preparations were
required for the coming of the Messias, and for his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world when he should appear, it will satisfy us
how wisely this was designed by God. The Appearance of
the Son of God in the world was very surprizing, and it
could not be thought that any one who made such Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
should find credit, unless the world had before-hand
been prepared to expect him, and had some Infallible
Marks and Characters whereby to know him when he
came. And this was the principal end of all the Types,
and Figures, and Prophesies of the Law, to contain the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50615:154"/>
Promises and Predictions of the Messias, and the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
whereby to know him.</p>
               <p>The Temple it self, and the whole Temple-Worship,
was little more than Types and Figures of Christ, of his
Incarnation, or living among men in an Earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
of his Priesthood and Sacrifice, his Death, and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and Ascension into Heaven, there to intercede for
us at God's Right Hand, as the High-Priest entred once
a Year into the Holy of Holies. Now this could not have
been done, had not the One Supreme God had a Temple,
and Priesthood, and Sacrifices on earth, that is, a People
peculiarly devoted to his Worship and Service; for the
Temples, and Priests, and Sacrifices of Idols, could not be
Types of the Son of God, who came to confound all the
Pagan Gods, and their Idolatrous Worship. Thus there
could have been no Prophesies of Christ, had there been
no Prophets of the True God; and these Prophecies
would have met with little Credit, had they been found in
Idols Temples. So that God's chusing the Posterity of
<hi>Abraham</hi> for his peculiar People, was not only necessary
to preserve the Knowledge and Worship of the One True
God in the world, but also to receive and to convey down
to Future Ages with an unquestionable Authority, all the
Types and Prophecies of the Messias.</p>
               <p>This gives us a general View of the Divine Wisdom,
in that Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and this will enable us to discover the wonderful
Wisdom of all the various Dispensations of the Divine
Providence towards the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation; which will be
both so useful and entertaining a Meditation, that I cannot
pass it over without some short Remarks.</p>
               <p>Now God having chosen the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> to
be his peculiar People, on purpose to make them a visible
Confutation of Idolatry, and to establish and propagate
the Knowledge and Worship of the One Supreme God in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50615:154"/>
the world, in order to effect this, Four things were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
necessary.</p>
               <p>1. That it should be visible to all that knew them, that
God had chosen <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People.</p>
               <p>2. That it should be as visible, That the God of <hi>Israel</hi>
is the One Supreme God, the Maker and Sovereign Lord
of the whole World.</p>
               <p>3. That the Worship of the One Supreme God should
be preserved entire among them; or that if they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to Idolatry, they should be visibly punished for it.</p>
               <p>4. That the Fame of this People, and of their God,
should by degrees be known over all the earth.</p>
               <p>Now not to take notice of the Mystical Reasons of God's
Providences towards <hi>Israel,</hi> which is a very large and nice
Argument, and not so proper to my present Design; if most
of the Remarkable Providences wherewith they were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
did manifestly serve some one or more of these ends,
we have a visible Reason of them, not only sufficient to
justify Providence, but to give us a ravishing Prospect of
the Divine Wisdom.</p>
               <p>I shall begin with the Removal of <hi>Iacob</hi> and his Family
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Occasion of which is well known, but the
Reason of it is not so well considered. For it may seem
strange, that when God had promised <hi>Abraham</hi> to bestow
the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> on his Posterity for an Inheritance, he
should remove them out of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
there to continue many years under grievous Oppression,
before he thought fit to deliver them, and to give them
Possession of the Promised Land.</p>
               <p>But to understand the wise Design of this, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
That God was to give a visible Demonstration to
the world, that he had chosen <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People,
and given them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for their Inheritance;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50615:155"/>
and it was not so agreeable to this Design, that they should
increase insensibly in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by degrees dispossess the
old Inhabitants; for there had been nothing singular and
remarkable in this; and therefore they were to be a great
Nation, before God so publickly and visibly owned them
for his People, and visibly bestowed an Inheritance on
them; and it was necessary they should have some place to
encrease and multiply in, till God thought fit to transplant
them into the Promised Land: For this purpose God chose
the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and sent <hi>Ioseph</hi> before-hand thither,
and advanced him to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Throne, to prepare a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
for them: And a very quiet and easy Retreat they
found there for many years, till <hi>Ioseph</hi> was dead, and all
the good offices he had done both for King and People for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
and the prodigious encrease of <hi>Israel</hi> made the Kings
of <hi>Egypt</hi> jealous of their Numbers and Power; and then
they began to oppress that People with hard labour and
cruel bondage, till the time appointed for their Deliverance
was come.</p>
               <p>This Oppression of <hi>Israel</hi> may seem a very severe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
but there were some very Wise Ends it served.</p>
               <p>1. To make the People willing to leave <hi>Egypt,</hi> where
they suffered such hard Bondage; for whoever observes
how ready they were upon all occasions to talk of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> how they longed after the Onions, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> notwithstanding all the
hardships they suffered there, will be apt to think, that
had they enjoyed Ease and Prosperity, all the Miracles
which <hi>Moses</hi> wrought would no more have persuaded <hi>Israel</hi>
to have left <hi>Egypt,</hi> than they could persuade <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let
them go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Advantage <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made of the Service of
<hi>Israel,</hi> made him obstinately resolve not to part with them;
and his cruel Oppression made it very just for God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50615:155"/>
him, and all <hi>Egypt</hi> with him; and this occasioned all
those Signs and Wonders which God wrought in <hi>Egypt</hi> by
the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> whereby he visibly owned <hi>Israel</hi> for his
People, and made his own Power and Glory known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> The great proneness of <hi>Israel</hi> to Idolatry, even
when God had delivered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is too plain a
proof, that they had learnt the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idolatries while
they lived there; the Golden Calf being, as some Learned
Men, not without reason, conclude, an imitation of the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Apis: And this made it very just for God to
punish their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idolatry with an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage;
especially considering, that this was the most likely way to
give check to their Idolatry, and to make them hate the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Gods like their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-masters, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the God of their Fathers, and his Promise and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to bestow the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> The Oppression of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> was an effectual
means to keep them a distinct and separate People. This
was absolutely necessary, when God had chosen them for
his peculiar People, that they should be preserved from
incorporating with any other People; and this God took
early care of, by placing them by themselves in the Land
of <hi>Goshen;</hi> where they grew up into a distinct Body from
<hi>Egypt,</hi> which made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> so jealous of them, when
they began to multiply;<note place="margin">1. Exod. 9, 10.</note> and that made him oppress them,
and that oppression preserved the distinction, which a kind
and friendly usage might in time have destroyed; for it is
rarely seen that two People can live amicably together in
the same Countrey, and under the same Prince, without
mingling and incorporating with each other, till they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all distinction between Nations and Families.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These are wise Reasons why God suffered the hard Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of</hi> Israel <hi>in</hi> Egypt; <hi>and those mighty Signs and Wonders
which God wrought in</hi> Egypt, <hi>were the most effectual means
both to convince the</hi> Israelites <hi>of God's peculiar care of them,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50615:156"/>
and to convince the world, that</hi> Israel <hi>was God's peculiar
People, and that the God of</hi> Israel <hi>was the Supream Lord
and Governor of the World. This account God himself
gives of it,</hi> 6. Exod. 6, 7, 8. Wherefore say unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from
under the burthens of the Egyptians—And I will take you
to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: And ye shall
know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out
from under the burthens of the Egyptians. <hi>And as for the</hi>
Egyptians, <hi>God tells</hi> Moses, I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and
multiply my signs and my wonders in the Land of Egypt. But
Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the
children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I
stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel from among them, 7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>This is the first time we read of such Signs and Wonders
as these; and probably they are the first Miracles of this
nature that ever were wrought; and it becomes us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the Wisdom of Providence in it; for the wisdom
of Miracles, and the surprize and wonder of them, are two
very different things. Miracles offer violence to the order
of Nature, and would be no commendation of the Wisdom
of Providence, should we consider them as Causes, not as
Signs: It would be a reproach to the Wisdom of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to say, that God wrought all those Miracles in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
because he could not have punished the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> nor have
delivered <hi>Israel</hi> without them; for it would argue a great
defect in the ordinary methods of Government, if God
could not at any time save good men, and punish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the wicked without a Miracle. God can do whatever
he pleases by the wise direction and government of natural
and moral Causes, and therefore does not work Miracles
because he needs them to supply the defects of natural
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50615:156"/>
Powers, but to bear testimony to his own Being and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to give authority to his Ministers and Prophets;
and we must learn the wisdom of this from the state and
condition of the world at that time.</p>
               <p>Mankind at that time were so far from being Atheists,
that they would worship any thing, the meanest and most
contemptible Creatures, rather than have no God; and
they were so sensible how much they stood in need of a
Divine Providence, that one God would not serve them,
but they wanted as many Gods, not only as there were
Nations, but as they had wants to supply. This was a
great corruption of the Light of Nature, and those Notions
of One Supream God imprinted on our minds, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
by the whole visible Creation; but yet was so
universal and so prevailing, that their wisest Philosophers,
who had better notions of the Deity, were not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Torrent, and durst not openly oppose the Worship
of those Countrey Gods, for fear of a popular Rage and
Fury.</p>
               <p>Now when neither the Light of Nature, nor the Works
of Creation, and of a common Providence, could secure
the belief and worship of the One Supream God; what
remained but for God to make some more sensible manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of himself to the world? and let any man consider,
what more effectual way could have been taken to convince
men of the Divine Power and Providence, than by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
especially such Miracles as are for the deliverance and
protection of good men, and the punishment and overthrow
of the wicked.</p>
               <p>When the Corruption of Mankind is such, that they
will not learn from Nature; there is no way of teaching
them, but by something which is supernatural; and when
the beautiful, and regular, and uniform Order of Nature
will not convince men that there is a God, at least not that
there is One Supream God, who made, and who governs
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50615:157"/>
this World, Miracles will. Those who will not believe
that the World was made, or had any Wise and Intelligent
Cause, must confess, that Miracles have a Cause, because
they see them produced; and that that Cause is not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because they see them produced without any Natural
Cause, or against the Laws of Nature; nor Chance and
Accident, because they are done at the command of a Free
Agent, at the word of a man; as all the Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in <hi>Egypt</hi> were wrought at the word of <hi>Moses,</hi> whose
word had no natural vertue and efficacy in it to work
Wonders. And therefore Miracles certainly prove, that
there is an Invisible, Intelligent Cause, who, if he did not
make the World, could have made it, if he had pleased;
for whoever can in any one instance act without, or against
Nature, can create Nature too; For to do any thing which
Nature cannot do, is in that particular to make Nature;
and he who can make Nature in one instance, can do so in
all; and this is a good reason to believe, that the World
was made, when we know that there is a Cause that can
make the World: And that Superior Power he exercises
over Nature, proves that he both can, and does govern the
World; for he has the supream and absolute Government
of Nature, who can, when he pleases, give new powers to
it, or suspend and reverse its Laws.</p>
               <p>So that Miracles are a Supernatural Proof of a Divine
Power and Providence; and no man who believes that
there ever was a true Miracle wrought, can be an Atheist;
and therefore it is no wonder that Atheists are such profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Enemies to the belief of Miracles; but it is a great
wonder that they can persuade themselves to reject all those
Authentick Relations we have of Miracles, both from the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and from the Gospel of Christ, which are
the most credible Histories in the world, [if we look upon
them as no more than Histories] and have obtained the most
universal belief. Especially this is very unaccountable in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50615:157"/>
those men who pretend to Deism, to acknowledge a God
who made the World; for cannot that God who made the
World, and made Nature, act without, or above, or
against Nature, when he pleases? And may it not become
the Divine Wisdom and Goodness to do this, when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the more abundant conviction of Mankind, who
are sunk into Atheism or Idolatry? when Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are necessary to awaken men into the sense and belief
of God, and his Providence, which was the case in the days
of <hi>Moses;</hi> or to give Authority to Prophets to declare and
reveal the Will of God to men, which was a reason for
Miracles as long as God thought fit to make any new and
publick Revelations of his Will; when it is as reasonable
and credible, that God, who can, when he pleases, should
some times work Miracles; as it is that he should take care
to preserve the knowledge of himself, and his Will, and to
restore it when it is lost; or to make such new discoveries
of his Grace, as the fallen state of Mankind requires; when,
I say, the thing it self is so credible, and so worthy of God,
what reasonable pretence can there be for rejecting Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
for which we have the Authority of the best attested
History in the World?</p>
               <p>But Atheism was not the Disease of that Age, which
had run into the other Extreme of Polytheism and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and therefore though Miracles do prove the Being and
Providence of God, the Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> were principally
intended to prove the Glory and Power of the God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> is the One Supream God, and
that he had chosen <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People; and this he
did by doing such things as no other God could do; such as
made the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians confess,<note place="margin">8. Exod. 1.</note> that it was <hi>the Finger
of God;</hi> and what more effectual way could be taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the world of One Supream God, than such visible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of an Absolute and Soveraign Power superior
to all? Those who worshipped a plurality of Gods, either
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50615:158"/>
had no notion of One Supream God, whose Power ruleth
over all; or if they had, yet they believed that this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God had committed the care and government of
Mankind to inferior Deities, whom they therefore worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with Divine Honours, as the Disposers of their Lives
and Fortunes; and either paid no worship to the Supream
God, which was the more general practice; or worshipped
their Country-gods together with him, and that with the
most frequent, most solemn and pompous Worship. Now
such great and wonderful Works as these, which none of
their Country-gods could do, was an evident proof, that
there was a Power, and therefore a God above them all,
whom all Mankind ought to fear and worship. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> of the Power of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
when he had delivered <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abed-nego</hi>
from the fiery Furnace;<note place="margin">3. Dan. 29.</note> he made a Decree, <hi>That every
people, nation and langage which spake amiss against the God
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces,
and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no
other God that can deliver after this sort.</hi> Thus when God
had delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lion's Den, <hi>Darius</hi> made a
Decree,<note place="margin">6. Dan. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>That in every dominion of his kingdom men should
tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: For he is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which
shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the
end. He delivereth and rescueth, and worketh signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in heaven, and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from
ihe power of the lions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these Kings were convinced by these great and
wonderful Works, that the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was the Supream
God; but <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Decree only forbids men to
blaspheme God, <hi>Darius</hi> seems to command all People to
worship him; for <hi>to tremble and fear before him,</hi> signifies a
religious veneration; but neither of them appointed any
solemn Worship to be paid him, much less did they forbid
the Worship of any other Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:50615:158"/>
But a little consideration would have carried them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for those mighty Works which proved a Power su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to all Gods, proved a Sovereign Providence too; that
this Supream God had not so committed the Government
of the world to any Ministers, or inferior Deities, but that
he reserved the supream disposal of all things in his own
hands;<note place="margin">4. Dan. 34, 35</note> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was convinced, that <hi>His dominion
is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to generation; and all the inhabitants of the earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
as nothing; and he doth according to his will in the army
of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none
can stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou?</hi> This cut
off all reasonable Pretences of paying Divine Worship to
their Country-goods; for if there be a Superior Power and
Providence over them, at most they could be only Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Divine Will, and therefore could have no title
to Divine Honours, no more than Ministers of State have
to the Royal Dignity: And it was very reasonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this, when they saw that this Supream God would
not suffer <hi>Israel,</hi> whom he had chosen for his peculiar
People, to worship any other God besides himself: This
was not unknown to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but was more manifest
in After-ages, when God so severely punished them for
their Idolatry; and was made evident to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and
<hi>Darius,</hi> when God delivered <hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego,</hi>
out of the fiery Furnace, who refused to worship the
Golden Image which he had set up; and delivered <hi>Daniel</hi>
from the power of the Lions, when he was cast into the
Lions Den for praying to his God. This shews the strange
power of Prejudice and Custom; but yet we must confess,
that this was wisely designed by God for the cure of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism
and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Having thus vindicated and explained the Wisdom of
Providence, both with respect to the removal of <hi>Israel</hi> out
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50615:159"/>
of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the hard bondage
they suffered there; and their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with
a mighty hand, and out-stretched arm, with Signs, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Miracles; let us now follow them into the
Wilderness.</p>
               <p>God having chose <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> before he shewed them openly
to the world under such a peculiar Character, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
first to form their Manners; to take care that
they should own him for their God, and behave themselves
as it became so glorious a Relation: this could not be done
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they were oppressed by hard bondage;
and therefore God first leads them into the Wilderness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the conversation of all other People, and upon
all accounts a fit place both to instruct and try them. I do
not intend, as I said before, to inquire into the Mystical
Reasons of those various Providences with which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
them in the Wilderness, to which our Saviour and
his Apostles so often refer, and which they apply to the
Gospel-state; but shall only consider the Wisdom of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as to the external and visible conduct of that People,
to make them fit to be owned before all the World for his
peculiar People.</p>
               <p>They had lived two hundred years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were
tinctur'd with the Idolatries, and had learnt the corrupt
Manners of that People, and had all that meanness and
stupidity, and perverseness of humour, that a state of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
and Bondage is apt to create; of which we have too
many visible Instances in their behaviour towards <hi>Moses.</hi>
All this was to be corrected before their entrance into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
which will give us the reasons of some very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Providences.</p>
               <p>The first remarkable thing to this purpose to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is God's delivering the Law to them with all the
most formidable Solemnities, in an audible Voice from
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50615:159"/>
Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> Which <hi>Moses</hi> tells them was such a thing
as was never known before,<note place="margin">4. Deut. 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>since the day that God created
man upon the earth: Did ever people hear the voice of God
speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and
live?</hi> And the use <hi>Moses</hi> makes of it is very natural, to
confirm them in the Belief and Worship of the One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God.<note place="margin">35.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know
that the Lord he is God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">36.</note> 
                  <hi>there is none else besides him. Out of
heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct
thee; and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire, and thou
heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.<note place="margin">39.</note>—Know
therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the Lord
is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath; there is
none else.</hi> For what can convince men that there is One
Supream God, if such a terrible Appearance as that on
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Law delivered in an audible Voice
from Heaven, will not convince them? <hi>Numa</hi> pretended
to receive his Laws from the Goddess <hi>Aegeria,</hi> as some
other Lawgivers pretended to do the like, but no man
knew any thing of it but themselves; but here a whole
Nation heard God speak to them, and saw such an Awful
Appearance upon the Mount, as made <hi>Moses</hi> himself fear
and tremble. I desire any man to tell me, how God, who
is a Pure Invisible Mind, could possibly give a more visible
Demonstration of his Presence and Power? I desire the
Wittiest and most Philosophical Atheists, only for Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
sake, to suppose the Truth of that Relation which
<hi>Moses</hi> gives us of this matter; and that they themselves
had been present at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> had seen the Smoke and
Fire cover the Mountain, had heard the Thunder and the
Trumpet, and at last a Voice delivering the Law with an
unimitable Terror and Majesty, what would they then
have thought of this? Or what farther evidence would
they have desired, that it was God who spoke to them?
This could be no Dream, nor melancholy Apparition, or
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50615:160"/>
disturbed Fancy, for they had timely notice of it three
days before, and were commanded to sanctify themselves
to meet their God; and if a whole Nation had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on after such fair Warning, it had been as great a
Prodigy and Miracle, as the Appearance on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and would have argued some Divine and Supernatural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation,
and that would have proved a God.</p>
               <p>This then was as visible a Demonstration as could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Presence, and Power, and Majesty of God,
who rejected all other gods from any share in his Worship,
and declares himself to be the Maker of Heaven and
Earth; for I'm sure the Wit of man cannot invent a more
effectual Conviction than this.</p>
               <p>Let us then consider the Wisdom of Providence in this,
both with respect to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he
is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> And therefore
when God intended to restore his own Worship again in
the world, and to make <hi>Israel</hi> a Pattern and Example of it
to the rest of Mankind, it was necessary to give them as
visible and ocular a demonstration of the Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, as it was possible for Creatures to have. When
the whole World was over-run with Idolatry, and the
<hi>Israelites</hi> themselves so strongly inclined to it, nothing less
than such an Appearance from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was likely to
establish the Faith and Worship of the One Supreme God;
and we see that this it self could very hardly do it; for
immediately after they had heard God speak to them,
while <hi>Moses</hi> was in the Mount, they made them a Golden
Calf, and worshipped it; and as soon as they mingled
with any other people, they joined in their Idolatrous
Worship; a sad Example of which we have in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Baal. Peor, 25. Numb.</hi> But this was the highest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
God could then give them of his Power and Glory;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50615:160"/>
and it did in time prevail; and in them all Mankind who
know their Story, have a visible demonstration of One
Supreme God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But not to insist on every Particular, which would be
endless; it may seem strange, that when God brought</hi>
Israel <hi>out of</hi> Egypt <hi>to give them Possession of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Land, he should make them wander in the Wilderness
forty years, till all that generation of men which came out of</hi>
Egypt <hi>were dead, excepting</hi> Ioshua <hi>and</hi> Caleb. <hi>The Apostle
to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>gives us the general Account of this matter,</hi>
3. Heb. 7. to the end; <hi>which resolves it into their Idolatry and
Infidelity.</hi> Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will
hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in
the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers
tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
err in their heart, and they have not known my ways; so I
sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest. <hi>Which
he makes an admonition to Christians,</hi> Take heed, brethren,
lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the living God; <hi>that is, in forsaking the True
God, and declining to Idolatry, as the</hi> Israelites <hi>in the
Wilderness did.</hi> And to whom sware he, that they should not
enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? So we see,
that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</p>
               <p>The plain state of the Case is this; That Generation of
men which came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and remembred the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
and Practices of that People, were so strangely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Idolatry, that all the Signs and Wonders they
saw in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and in the Wilderness,
could not perfectly cure them; but whenever they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
they joined themselves to the Heathen gods, ate
of their Sacrifices, and bowed themselves before them;
that had these men gone into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was then a
Land of Idolaters, they would certainly have worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50615:161"/>
their gods, instead of destroying them, and have
mingled themselves with the People of the Land, and have
learnt their Manners: for they who so often tempted God,
and disobeyed <hi>Moses,</hi> while they were in the Wilderness,
in expectation of the Promised Land, what would they
have done, had they been once possessed of it? So that to
have given that Generation of men Possession of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
would not have answered God's orginal Design in chusing
<hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People; for in all likelihood they
would have proved a Nation of Idolaters, like the other
Nations round about them: And therefore God deferred
the final Accomplishment of his Promise, till that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was all dead, and a new Generation sprung up
which knew not <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor had conversed with Idolatrous
Nations, but had seen the Wonders of God in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and had learnt his Statutes and Judgments, and were
sufficiently warned by the Example of their Fathers,
whose Carcasses fell in the Wilderness, to fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Lord <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and to make him their Trust.
This is the very Account the Scripture gives of it; and
thus accordingly it proved; for that new Generation of
men were never charged with Idolatry; but we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
told, That <hi>Israel served the Lord all the days of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,
and all the days of the Elders that overlived Ioshua, and
which had known all the works of the Lord that he had done for
Israel,</hi> 24. Josh. 31.</p>
               <p>All this, we see, was designed by God with admirable
Wisdom, to make his own Glory and Power known, and
to publish his Choice of <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People, and
to prepare them for himself, and to establish his Name and
Worship among them: And now God had made them fit
Inhabitants of the Land of Promise, without any longer
delay he gives them the actual Possession of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us now follow them into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:50615:161"/>
The History of the Wars of <hi>Canaan</hi> is sufficiently known;
which presents us with new Wonders and Miracles, not
inferior to those which God wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the
<hi>Red Sea;</hi> for God so visibly fought the Battels of <hi>Israel,</hi>
that they and all the world might know, that it was he that
gave them possession of that good Land, and drove out
those wicked Inhabitants before them; which declared his
Glory, and made his Power known: And what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
discoursed concerning the Wonders and Miracles in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> is equally applicable to this, and I need add no
more. Let us then consider <hi>Israel</hi> in possession of the
Land of Promise: And there are but two things more I
shall observe in the <hi>Iewish</hi> History till the coming of our
Saviour.</p>
               <p>1. Their frequent Relapses into Idolatry, for which
they were as frequently and severely punished.</p>
               <p>2. Their Captivities and Dispersions among the Nations,
whereby God made himself and his Laws more universally
known in the world.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>As for the first, nothing could be more directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God's original Intention, in chusing the Posterity
of</hi> Abraham <hi>for his peculiar People, than their falling into
Idolatry; and yet God foresaw, that this they would do,
and threatens to punish them severely when they did;
which is the subject of</hi> Moses <hi>his Prophetick Song,</hi> 32. Deut.
<hi>and the whole History of the</hi> Iewish <hi>Nation may satisfy us,
that though God many times spared them when they were
guilty of other great Sins, yet they never fell into Idolatry,
but Vengeance soon pursued them; and they were either
oppressed by their Enemies at home, or carried Captive
into Foreign Countries. When</hi> Ioshua <hi>was dead, and all
that Generation which</hi> Ioshua <hi>led into</hi> Canaan; There arose
another generation after them that knew not the Lord, nor yet
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50615:162"/>
the works which he had done for Israel: <hi>And they soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to Idolatry,</hi> and served Baalim; they forsook the Lord,
and served Baal and Ashtaroth, 2. <hi>Judges</hi> 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.
<hi>And what follows gives us a summary account of God's
dealings with them all the time of the Judges.</hi> And the
anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered
them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold
them into the hands of their enemies round about them: Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever
they went out, the hand of the Lord was against
them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn
unto them; and they were greatly distressed. Nevertheless
the Lord raised up Iudges, which delivered them out of the hand
of those that spoiled them. And yet they would not hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Iudges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and
bowed themselves unto them: They turned quickly out of the
way that their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of
the Lord; but they did not so. And when the Lord raised
them up Iudges, then the Lord was with the Iudge, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them out of the hands of their enemies all the days of the
Iudge. (For it repented the Lord because of their groanings, by
reason of them that oppressed them, and vexed them). And it
came to pass when the Iudge was dead, that they returned, and
corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other
gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased
not from their own doings, and from their stubborn way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For this reason, as it follows in the Text, God resolved</hi>
not to drive out any from before them of the nations which Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua
left when he died. <hi>God had promised</hi> to put out those
nations by little and little, not consume them at once, lest the
beast of the field should increase upon them, 7. <hi>Deut 22. But
withal,</hi> Ioshua <hi>assured them, That</hi> if they did in any-wise
go back, <hi>that is, relapse into Idolatry,</hi> and cleave unto the
remnant of those nations, even those which remain among you,
<hi>which</hi> Ioshua <hi>had not driven out;</hi> know for a certainty that
the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50615:162"/>
from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you,
and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given
you, 23. <hi>Joshua 12, 13. And thus accordingly God dealt
with them; for he left</hi> the five lords of the Philistines, and
all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites, that
dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-Hermon, unto the
entring in of Hamath; and they were to prove Israel by them,
to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of
the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of
Moses, 3. <hi>Judges</hi> 1,—4.</p>
               <p>This was a wise provision God made to correct and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>Israel,</hi> whenever they should decline to Idolatry; for
these Idolatrous Nations, who still lived among them, or
round about them, were not more ready to tempt them to
Idolatry, than they were to oppress and afflict them, when
God thought fit to chastise <hi>Israel:</hi> The whole Book of
<hi>Iudges</hi> is a manifest proof of this; and the Story is so well
known, that I need not insist on Particulars: Let us then
briefly contemplate the Wisdom of Providence in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Judgments God executed on <hi>Israel</hi> for their frequent
Idolatries. God had chosen <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People,
to be the Worshippers of the One Supream God, and a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
confutation of the Heathen Idolatries; but their great
propensity to Idolatry, after all the Signs and Wonders
which God wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and in
the Wilderness, and in giving them possession of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Land, did threaten the final Apostacy of <hi>Israel,</hi> which
would have defeated God's wise and gracious Design in
chusing them for his peculiar People. For had they turned
Idolaters like the rest of the Nations, the Worship of the
One Supream God had been totally lost in the world.</p>
               <p>To prevent this, God never suffered their Idolatries for
any long time to escape unpunished; and if we would
understand the true reason of this, we must not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50615:163"/>
these Judgments merely as the punishment of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
but as the wise Methods of Providence to preserve
his own Worship among them notwithstanding their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Inclinations, and to make his Name, and Power,
and Glory, known to the world.</p>
               <p>The whole world were Idolaters; but God did not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
other Nations for their Idolatry, as he did <hi>Israel;</hi>
which shews, that the punishment of <hi>Israel</hi> was not merely
for the punishment of Idolatry, but for the cure of it. For
God having chosen <hi>Israel</hi> for his peculiar People, the world
was to learn from them, from their Examples, and from
their Rewards and Punishments, the knowledge and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the One Supream God. And could there be a more
sensible confutation of Idolatry, than to see a Nation which
had been visibly consecrated to the Worship of the One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God, as visibly punished, whenever they declined
to Idolatry?</p>
               <p>That new generation which sprung up after the days of
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> who had not seen God's Wonders in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in
the Wilderness, nor known the Wars of <hi>Canaan,</hi> soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the God of their Fathers, and wanted some new expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
of God's Power and Presence among them; and
whenever they declined to Idolatry, God took care they
should not want them, though they paid very dear for
them; for he delivered them into the hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and brought many evils on them, till they should
remember the God of their Fathers: This account God
himself gives of it, 31. <hi>Deut. 16, 17. And the Lord said
unto Moses, Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this
people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
whither they go to be amongst them, and will forsake me,
and break my covenant which I have made with them. Then
my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall
be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befal them, so that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50615:163"/>
they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because
the Lord our God is not amongst us?</hi> This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells
us was the effect of such Judgments, though not always so
lasting as it ought to have been. <hi>When he slew them, then
they sought him, and returned and enquired early after God;
and they remembred that God was their rock, and the high God
their redeemer,</hi> 78. Psal. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>By these means God made them sensible of his Justice
and Power, and reclaim'd them from their Idolatries, and
restored his own Worship among them; for they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew by the threatnings of their own Law, for what
reasons they were thus punish'd; and indeed their own
experience was sufficient to satisfie them in this; for they
no sooner forsook the God of their Fathers, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
others gods, but they were Oppressed by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and when they repented of their Idolatries, and
returned to God, he raised up Saviours and Deliverers who
vanquished their Enemies, and restored them to Liberty
and Peace: Especially since those wonderful Deliverances
which God wrought for them by the hands of their Judges,
gave that Generation of men, which knew not the Wars
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> new and visible proofs of God's Power and
Presence among them. And we know what effect this
Discipline had: It did not wholly prevent their Idolatries,
which they were very prone to, when the memory of such
Judgments was worn out by a long Peace and Prosperity;
but then the repetition of such Judgments, as they repeated
their Provocations, joined with the admonitions of their
Prophets, whom God raised up in several Ages, did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bring them to Repentance, and restore the Worship
of God amongst them; till at last the Ten Tribes grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
and were therefore utterly rejected by God, and
carried into a perpetual Captivity, never to return more
into their own Land; and <hi>Iudah,</hi> who would not take
warning by the Punishment of <hi>Israel,</hi> was carried Captive
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50615:164"/>
into <hi>Babylon</hi> for Seventy years; which so perfectly cured
their Idolatry, that we hear no more complaints of that
after their return from Captivity.</p>
               <p>And this answered God's design with respect to the rest
of the World, as much as if they had never been guilty of
Idolatry: For notwithstanding their several relapses into
Idolatry, it was well known that <hi>Israel</hi> was Consecrated
to the Worship of the Lord <hi>Iehovah;</hi> and when the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
round about were witnesses of God's Judgments against
<hi>Israel</hi> when they forsook the Lord their God, and of their
Happy and Prosperous State while they kept his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
it was a convincing proof of the Power and Justice
of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> especially when they should see the
Ten Tribes utterly rooted out for their Idolatry, and
<hi>Iudah</hi> carried Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the City and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> destroyed, and the Land laid waste and
desolate without Inhabitants; the Justice and Power of
God in driving them out of their Land, would then be as
much taken notice of, as his wonderful Providence in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and placing them in that good
Land, was; as God himself tells <hi>Solomon</hi> in answer to his
Prayer at the Dedication of the Temple: 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 19,
20, 21, 22. But if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and
my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go
and serve other gods and worship them: Then will I pluck them
up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and
this house which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of
my sight, and will make it to be a proverb, and a by-word among
all nations: And this house which is high, shall be an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why
hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of
their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
served them; therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:50615:164"/>
For we must observe, That God had as well chose the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be the Seat of his Worship, as <hi>Israel</hi>
to be his Worshippers; and the Inheritance of the Land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> was bestowed on them, in vertue of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to be their God, and they to be his People; that is,
that they should worship no other Gods besides him: And
the breach of Covenant on their part by declining to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was a Forfeiture of their Right to the Promised Land;
and the proper Punishment of it was, either Oppression
at home, which made them servants and strangers in their
own Land, or Captivity in Foreign Countries; and this
was so publickly known, that when any such evils befel
<hi>Israel,</hi> the Nations round about were able to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it, <hi>Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers.</hi>
So that the very Oppression and Captivity of <hi>Israel,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
the Supreme Power and Glory of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
who is a Jealous God, and will admit of no Partners in
Worship; but when his own People <hi>forsake him, and serve
strange gods in the land</hi> which he had given them, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
to his own Worship, he makes them <hi>serve stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in a land which is not theirs,</hi> 5. Jer. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> These Captivities and Dispersions of <hi>Israel,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the long Captivity of <hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> served other
ends besides the Punishment and the Cure of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
for into what Country soever they were carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
they carried the Knowledg of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> along
with them.</p>
               <p>While they lived at home in their own Countrey, and
had little Commerce with any other people, the very
Name of <hi>Israel</hi> was known only to their Neighbours;
and the God of <hi>Israel</hi> could be known no farther than
<hi>Israel</hi> was: But when they were carried Captive to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and dispersed through all the Provinces of that vast
Empire; this spread the Knowledge of God too, who
by many wonderful Providences owned these Captives for
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50615:165"/>
his People, and made the Heathens see and confess his
Glory and Power.</p>
               <p>But the better to understand this, we must consider that
wise Preparation God made for it in those great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of States and Empires which began about this
time.</p>
               <p>To prevent the general Corruption of Mankind, as I
observed before, God confounded their Languages, and
thereby separated them from each other, and formed them
into several distinct Independent Societies and Kingdoms;
which was an effectual means to prevent the spreading of
the Infection, and to force them to the practice of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Moral and Political Virtues: But when the whole world
was corrupted by Idolatry, and God saw a proper season to
begin a Reformation, to make the Cure more easy and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
it was necessary to establish a more general Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
among mankind, which is the most effectual means
to spread a Wholesome as well as a Pestilential Contagion:
And since Commerce and Traffick was not so general in
those days, as it is now, there was no such ready way to
do this, as by Force of Arms, which united a great many
Kingdoms and Nations into one; which besides all other
advantages, conveyed the knowledge of all memorable
Actions into all parts of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Now in the beginning of these great Empires (for tho
the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy began long before, yet <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
was <hi>the Golden Head</hi> of that Image which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Four Monarchies) God carried <hi>Iudah</hi> Captive
into <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Dan. 38.</note> and thereby made himself known to be the
Supreme and Sovereign Lord of the world, over all the
<hi>Babylonish</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>The first occasion God took to make himself known in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream, which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got;
and none of the Magicians, or Astrologers, or Sorcerers,
of <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> could shew the King his Dream, much less
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50615:165"/>
tell him the Interpretation of it; but <hi>Daniel</hi> did both;
which made <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> acknowledge to <hi>Daniel, Of
a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of
kings, and a revealer of secrets, since thou couldst reveal this
secret,</hi> 2. Dan. 47. And this advanced <hi>Daniel</hi> to great
Authority: for the King <hi>made him ruler over the whole
province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the
Wise men of Babylon.</hi> And we need not doubt but he used
his Authority, especially among the Wise-men of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
who had the greatest influence upon others, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the knowledge of the One Supreme God among
them.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of the same King, God magnified his
Power in the Preservation of <hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego,</hi>
from the Fiery Furnace; which occasioned a Decree
that gave great advantage to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and disposed all men
to think very honourably of their God; <hi>That every people,
nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the
God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and their houses shall be made a dunghil, because there is
no other God that can deliver after this sort,</hi> 3. Dan. 28, 29.
And that experience <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had of the Power and
Justice of God in his own person, extorted from him as
devout Praises of God, and as Orthodox a Confession of
his Faith in him, as any <hi>Iew</hi> could have made, 4 <hi>Dan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus in the Reign of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> who with his Princes,
his Wives, and Concubines, drank Wine out of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Vessels of the Temple, God gave a Glorious Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to himself by a Hand-writing on the Wall, which as
<hi>Daniel</hi> expounded it, and the Event that very Night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
foretold the immediate Overthrow of his Empire
by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians:</hi> This was a very sudden Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
for their Idolatrous Revels, and the Profanation of
the Holy Vessels of the Temple, as <hi>Daniel</hi> very freely
acquainted the King, 5 <hi>Dan.</hi> And tho his Advancement
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50615:166"/>
by <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> who made him the Third Ruler in the
Kingdom, was but of a very short continuance, the King
being slain that Night; yet it so recommended him to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
who began the Second Monarchy of the <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Persians,</hi> that he advanced <hi>Daniel</hi> to the same or greater
Honour and Power, he being made the first of the Three
Presidents who had the Government of the Hundred and
Twenty Princes whom <hi>Darius</hi> set over the whole
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this New Monarchy, God gave a
fresh Demonstration of his Power, in delivering <hi>Daniel</hi>
from the Lyons Den; for which reason <hi>Darius</hi> made a
Decree, <hi>That in every dominion of his kingdom, men fear
and tremble before the God of Daniel,</hi> 6. Dan. 25, 26, 27.
So that by the Captivity of <hi>Iudah,</hi> God made himself
known over all the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy; and
this disposed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Seventy Years of their Captivity
being accomplished, to give them liberty to return into
their own Country, and to publish a Decree for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building
the City and Temple of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But still to preserve the knowledge of God among them,
the Divine Providence so ordered it, that when all had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to return, great numbers stayed behind in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
where they freely professed and exercised their Religion;
which together with the Civil Dependance of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
State on the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, preserved a constant Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
and Intercourse between them; and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the knowledge of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and of their God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, which put an end to the <hi>Persian,</hi>
made the God of the <hi>Iews</hi> still more known to the world:
<hi>Alexander the Great</hi> came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> treated the <hi>Iews</hi>
with great kindness, consulted the Records of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
offered Sacrifices to God, and not only confirmed
their old, but granted new Privileges to them: And thus
God became known, not only to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:50615:166"/>
but to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy: And when after
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death the Empire was divided, this caused a
new dispersion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> especially into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt:
Ptolomy</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> having surprized <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
great Numbers of them into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a kind opinion of them there, employed them in his
Armies and Garisons, and made them Citizens of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi>
his Son <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus</hi> procured the Translation
of their Law into <hi>Greek,</hi> which was a new Publication of
their Religion; and after this, <hi>Onias</hi> Built a Temple in
<hi>Egypt</hi> in all things like to that of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where they
Worshipped God according to the Rites of the Jewish
Law; that God was now as much known in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as he
was in <hi>Iudaea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to let pass a great many other things which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
very much to propagate the knowledge of the God
of <hi>Israel</hi> in the World: To compleat all, the Power and
Oppressions of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchs forced the <hi>Iews</hi> to
pray the Alliance and Assistance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which
ended, as such powerfull Alliances very often do, in their
Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers, who first Governed them
by Kings and Tetrarchs, and at last reduced them into a
<hi>Roman</hi> Province. And thus the <hi>Iews,</hi> and their God,
and their Religion, became known over all the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
These Four successive Monarchies, did gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
encrease and spread the knowledge of One
Supream God over all the World, and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the way for the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias,</hi> that
Kingdom which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, <hi>the God
of heaven would set up, which should never be destroyed,</hi>
2. Dan. 44.</p>
               <p>For the better to understand this, we must observe, that
though the knowledge of God made no publick Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatries, yet it greatly disposed men
to receive the Gospel, when it should be Preached to them:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50615:167"/>
it visibly reformed their Philosophy, and gave them the
Notion of One Supreme Being, as is evident from the
Poets and Philosophers of those Ages, though they still
Worshipped their Countrey gods; it gave them some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
knowledge of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Prophecies concerning the
Kingdom of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and raised an expectation even
among the <hi>Romans</hi> of some great Prince who was to rise in
the <hi>East,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes. And though the knowledge
of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> did not reform Nations, yet we have
reason to believe, that it made a great many private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
who secretly forsook the Idolatries of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and Worshipped the only True God. It is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to think it should do so; and we must confess it was
wisely designed by God for that purpose, and some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this kind, which we know, may satisfie us, that
there were many more.</p>
               <p>On the Famous Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when the Holy Ghost
descended on the Apostles in a Visible appearance of <hi>cloven
tongues like as of fire,</hi> there were at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
not only of <hi>Iews,</hi> but of Proselytes out of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in Mesopotamia, and in Iudaea, and Cappadocia, in Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphilia, in Egypt, and in the
parts of Lybia about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Iews and
Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians,</hi> 2. Acts 9, 10, 11. Whether
these were Circumcised or Uncircumcised Proselites, is not
said; but Proselites they were out of all these Nations,
who came up at the Feast to Worship at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> from
whence we learn, that the dispersion of the <hi>Iews</hi> into all
Nations made great Numbers of Proselites, who either
undertook the observation of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
and became <hi>Iews,</hi> or at least renounced all the
Heathen Idolatries, and worshipped no other God but the
God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The number of these last seems to have been much
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50615:167"/>
greater than that of Circumcised Proselites; and if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
some Learned men, there is frequent mention made
of them in Scripture under the names of <hi>worshipping Greeks,
and devout men, and those which feared God.</hi> When Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> there consorted with <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Silas of the devout Greeks a great multitude,</hi> 17. Acts
24. The very name of <hi>Greeks</hi> proves them to be <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
not <hi>Iews,</hi> who are always distinguished from each other;
and that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, devout or worshipping <hi>Greeks,</hi>
proves that they were the Worshippers of the God of <hi>Israel;</hi>
for that Title is never given in Scripture to Idolaters, and
their frequenting the <hi>Iewish</hi> Synagogue sufficiently proves
it; for no <hi>Gentiles</hi> resorted thither, but those who worshipped
the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Of this number was <hi>Lydia, 16. Acts</hi> 14.
and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Centurion, who was not only <hi>a
devout man,</hi> and one <hi>who feared God</hi> himself, but all his
Family were so too, 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and the Eunuch, 8. <hi>Acts</hi>
27. and almost in every place where St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached the
Gospel, we find great numbers of these worshipping <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> and <hi>Philippi,</hi> as you have seen, at <hi>Corinth,
18. Acts</hi> 4. at <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Pisidia,</hi> 13. Acts 43. and we
have reason to conclude, that thus it was in other places;
which shews what a great effect the dispersion of the <hi>Iews</hi>
into all these Countries had in making Proselites, some to
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion, but many more to the Worship of the
God of <hi>Israel;</hi> which prepared them to receive the Gospel
when is was preached to them: For they were the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of the True God, and were instructed in the Law
and the Prophets, as appears from their frequenting the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Synagogues, and therefore were in expectation of the
<hi>Messias,</hi> and were capable of understanding the Scripture
Proofs of the Christian Faith. It is certain the first <hi>Gentile</hi>
Converts were of this sort of men, who more readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Faith, than the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves; for they had all
the preparations for Christianity which the <hi>Iews</hi> had, but
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50615:168"/>
none of their Prejudices: neither a fondness for their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Worship, nor for the Temporal Kingdom of the
<hi>Messias.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Joseph Mede<hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course 3. on</hi> 17. Acts 4.</note> And therefore a very Learned man expounds that
Text, 13. <hi>Acts 48. As many as were ordained to eternal life,
believed,</hi> of these devout and worshipping <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that
they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ready disposed and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Doctrine of Eternal Life by Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>And thus we are come to the days of Christ, whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the world was the last and most effectual means
God used for the recovery of Mankind; to consider the
Divine Wisdom in the Redemption of the world by Jesus
Christ, relates to the wisdom of the Christian Religion,
not of Providence, and therefore does not concern my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Argument; but if we take a brief review of what I
have said, we may the better understand in what sense Christ
is said to come in <hi>the fulness of time;</hi> for he came as soon as
the world was prepared to receive him. For I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
any man, who complains that the coming of Christ was
too long delayed, to tell me in what sooner period it had
been proper for him to appear?</p>
               <p>In every Age, as I have already shewn, God took the
wisest methods that the Condition of Mankind would at
that time allow to reform the world; and if Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at such a time, as the Divine Wisdom saw most fit
and proper for his appearance, he appeared as soon as he
could, if we will allow God to dispense his Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
wisely. That he did so, no man can doubt who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
the Wisdom and Goodness of God: But my business
at present is to give you a fair representation of all those
wise Advances God made to this last compleating and
stupendious Act of Grace and Love.</p>
               <p>God had promised our first Parents immediately upon
the Fall, That <hi>the seed of the woman should break the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's
head;</hi> and by vertue of this Promise all truly good
men were saved by Christ from the beginning of the world:
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50615:168"/>
But the more to recommend the Love of God in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Death of our Saviour, it seems very congruous
to the Divine Wisdom, that all other Methods should be
first tried for the reforming of Mankind, before the coming
of Christ; and that he should come in such a time when the
world was best prepared to receive Him; and as little as we
understand of the unsearchable Counsels of God, it may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
us, that upon both these accounts Christ appeared in
<hi>the fulness of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>all flesh had corrupted his ways,</hi> and there was but
one Righteous Family left, the only probable means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
Piety and Vertue to the world, was to destroy all
that Wicked Generation of Men, and to preserve that
Righteous Family to new-people the world.</p>
               <p>When that New Generation began to corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
God separated them from each other by confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Languages; and formed them into distinct Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Kingdoms, which was the most effectual way to
stop the Infection, and to force on them the practise of
many Moral and Civil Vertues.</p>
               <p>When notwithstanding this, they all declined to Idolatry,
God chose <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity to be his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to preserve the Faith and Worship of the One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
God in the world; he gave them his Laws, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them the Types and Prophecies of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
and punished them very severely when they worshipped
any other Gods; sent them into captivity, and by various
Providences scattered them almost over the face of the
whole Earth, and thereby propagated the knowledge of
himself, and of his Laws; and the Prophecies of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
made numerous Proselites to the Worship of the One
Supream God, and <hi>made ready a people prepared for the
Lord,</hi> and then Christ came: And what sooner time you
fix on for the appearance of Christ, you will find it, either
before God had tried all other Methods for the reforming
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50615:169"/>
the world, or before the world was prepared for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of Christ.</p>
               <p>And having thus, in the best manner I could, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to you the wonderful Wisdom of Providence from
the beginning of the World to the appearance of Christ in
the Flesh, in some of the most remarkable Events which
have happened, I shall here break off; for though the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Providence is not less wonderful in those various
Events which have happened to the Christian Church, yet
that is so large a Subject, and the Accounts of many things
so imperfect or doubtful, that I shall leave it to men of
greater leisure, and better skill and judgment in Secular and
Ecclesiastical Story. But, I hope, that imperfect Account
I have now given, will teach you to reverence, not to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Wisdom of Providence; for if we, who understand
so little of God's ways, can see such Excellent Wisdom in
them, what unsearchable depths and mysteries of Wisdom
are there which we can't discover!</p>
               <p>But yet to compleat the <hi>Iewish</hi> History, as far as the
Scripture-account goes, it will be necessary to take notice
of the final Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> which
put an end to their State and Government, and dispersed
them into so many different Countries; for it seems very
surprizing, that God should cast off his People, who were
in Covenant with him, and to whom the Promises of the
<hi>Messias</hi> were peculiarly made, so soon after the appearance
of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>And therefore to vindicate both the truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God's Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Wisdom of his
Providence in the final overthrow and dispersion of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, we must distinguish, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does, especially in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. between the Carnal and the
Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the Children of the Flesh, and
the Children of the Promise: Those who descended from
<hi>Abraham</hi> by Carnal Generation, and those who were the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50615:169"/>
Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith in Christ Jesus, 3. <hi>Galat.</hi>
26, 29.</p>
               <p>The Carnal Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were chosen by God
for his peculiar People, to preserve his own Name and
Worship among them; and for this purpose they were to
be a distinct Nation, separated from the rest of the world,
and had the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> given them to live in; and
they were to continue so till the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Prophesy, <hi>The scepter shall not depart
from Iudah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, until
Shiloh come, and to him shall the gathering of the people be,</hi>
49. Genes. 10.</p>
               <p>But the Blessings of the <hi>Messias</hi> were promised only to
the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves, 9. <hi>Rom.
3. Gal.</hi> That is to all those, whether <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
who believe in Christ Jesus; for Christ was the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
Seed, and in Christ are all the Promises of God, Yea
and Amen; and therefore nothing but faith in Christ can
entitle us to the Promise of <hi>Abraham;</hi> as the Apostle in
these places confirms by several Arguments, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now insist on.</p>
               <p>Now if we thus distinguish between <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Carnal
and Spiritual Seed, and those Promises which belong to
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Carnal Posterity, and those which peculiarly
belong to his Spiritual Seed, there will appear no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in God's destroying the City and Temple of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and dispersing the <hi>Iews</hi> into all parts of the Earth.</p>
               <p>God had accomplished what he intended by the Carnal
Posterity of <hi>Abraham;</hi> that is, he had preserved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
the knowledge of the One True God in the
world, and prepared men to receive Christ, when he
should be preached to them; and now Christ was come,
the Spiritual Covenant took place; which was not confined
to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Carnal Posterity, but extended to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in Christ all the world over: So that God had no
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50615:170"/>
longer any one Nation for his peculiar People, but those
only were his peculiar People, whatever Nation they were
of, who believe in Jesus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> then considered as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Carnal Posterity,
were God's peculiar People no longer; nor did God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
oblige him to preserve them a distinct Nation any
longer; and therefore the Divine Providence might now
as justly destroy them as any other Nation, if they deserved
it; and certainly the Crucifixion of their <hi>Messias,</hi> and their
obstinate Infidelity did deserve it. And when they had
thus justly deserved a final Excision, the Divine Wisdom
had admirable Ends to serve by it.</p>
               <p>This gave a glorious Testimony to Christ and his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in that terrible Vengeance which befel his Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
which Christ himself had so expresly and punctually
foretold, That no man, who knew what he had foretold
with so many particular circumstances, could be ignorant,
why <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed.</p>
               <p>The obstinate Infidelity of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who blasphemed
the Name, and persecuted the Disciples of Christ, did in
some degree hinder the progress of the Gospel among the
<hi>Gentiles;</hi> but the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Preservation of the Christians, was so visible a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to Christianity, and delivered the Christian Church
from such bitter and implacable Enemies, that the Gospel
had a freer passage, and prevailed mightily in the world.</p>
               <p>And the Dispersion of the <hi>Iews</hi> into all Countries, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it spread the Knowledge of the One True God, so
now it made them unwilling Witnesses to Christianity, as
being the visible triumph of the Crucified Jesus.</p>
               <p>In a word, When all Mankind were Idolaters, God
chose the Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and multiplied them into
a great Nation, to preserve and propagate the Knowledge
and Worship of the One Supreme God, and to prepare
men to receive the Gospel, which would in time extirpate
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50615:170"/>
all <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatries. Wen Christ was come, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
preached to the world, God rejected that Nation for
their Infidelity, and by that means gave a freer passage to
the Gospel among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates,
That the time will come, when the Sincere Faith, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Piety of the Christian Church shall contribute as
much to the Conversion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as they formerly did
to the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for this seems to be the
sum of the Apostle's reasoning, with which I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Argument. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 30, &amp;c. <hi>For as ye in times
past have not believed God, yet now have obtained mercy through
their unbelief; Even so have these also now not believed,
that through your mercy, they also may obtain mercy; for
God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
mercy upon all. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past finding out!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us now consider the Wisdom of Providence
in some more common and ordinary Events, especially such
as are made Objections against Providence. I have already
upon other Occasions taken notice of several things of this
nature; but it will give us a more transporting sense of the
Divine Wisdom, to see as much of it as we can in one
view.</p>
               <p>In general, whoever considers what it is to govern a
World, and to take care of all the Creatures that are in it,
must confess it to be a work of Infinite and Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
Wisdom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epicureans</hi> for this reason rejected a Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they thought it too much trouble for their gods, full
of care, solicitude, and distraction, to observe all that is
done in the World; and to over-rule and determine all
Events, as Wisdom, Justice, and Goodness, should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect;
and indeed nothing less than an Infinite Mind can do
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50615:171"/>
this, which sees all things at one view, judges infallibly at
first sight, and orders all things with a powerful thought.</p>
               <p>But my chief design at present is, to shew you the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Providence in some particular Cases, which either
are not sufficiently observed, or not rightly understood.</p>
               <p>Some of the great Objections against Providence are the
troublesome and tempestuous state of this world; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of all Events; the fickleness and inconstancy of
Human Affairs; the promiscuous dispensation of the good
and evil things of this life both to good and to bad men:
And I have already vindicated, not only the Justice and
Goodness, but the Wisdom of God upon these accounts;
by shewing what wise ends God serves by them, and what
a wise use we may make of such Providences. And therefore
the principal thing I shall now insist on, shall be some of
those wise Methods God uses in Rewards and Punishments;
wherein the great Wisdom of Government consists: And
I shall briefly mention some few.</p>
               <p>1. That God rewards and punishes men in their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
This is so plainly taught in Scripture, that it will
admit of no dispute; though some men venture to dispute
the Justice, at least of one part of it, that God should
<hi>visit the sins of the Fathers upon the Children;</hi> which the
<hi>Iews</hi> objected against God in that Prophane Proverb, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have eaten sower grapes, and the Childrens teeth are set
an edge,</hi> 18. Ezek. and by the answer God there makes,
we may learn in what sence God threatens to punish the
Posterity of Bad men, and to reward the Posterity of
Good men, for their Fathers sakes; which does not extend
to the other World, where every man shall be Judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own Works, and <hi>the soul that sinneth, it shall
dye;</hi> and as to this World, where we may allow more to
the Sovereignty of Providence without impeaching the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50615:171"/>
Divine Justice; yet God assures us, that a Righteous Son
shall not be punished merely because he had a Wicked
Father; nor a Wicked Son be rewarded, merely because
he had a Righteous Father; for thus much the words must
signifie, if they relate to this Life, as they certainly do, as
well as to a Future State.</p>
               <p>Now if neither a Righteous Son shall suffer for the
Wickedness of his Father, nor a Wicked Son receive the
rewards of his Father's Vertue; this can afford no pretence
to impeach the Justice of Providence; but it gives occasion
to inquire in what sence God is said to visit the Sins of the
Fathers upon their Children, and to Bless and Prosper the
Posterity of Good men for their sakes.</p>
               <p>1. As for the First: If God does not punish a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Son for the sins of his Father, then <hi>to visit the iniquities
of the Father upon the Children,</hi> must be confined only to
such Children as inherit the Vices, and imitate the
Wickedness of their Parents: That is, God has threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to punish the Wicked Children of Wicked Parents.</p>
               <p>This, you'll say, has nothing extraordinary in it; for
God has threatned to punish all Wicked men, whatever
their Parents are; and if they are punished only because
they are Wicked, How is this <hi>to visit the iniquities of their
Fathers on them?</hi> But the Answer of this seems as obvious
as the Objection; that the Wicked Children of Wicked
Parents shall be more certainly, and more severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than other Bad men ordinarily are.</p>
               <p>1. As for the certainty of their punishment: We know
a great many Bad men very often escape the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
in this world; for all Wicked men are not punished
here as their Wickedness deserves: The Justice of the
Divine Providence, as I have already observed, does not
require a sudden and hasty Execution: Bad men may be
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50615:172"/>
prosperous many years, and be severely punished at last;
or may be prosperous all their Lives, and go down to their
Graves in peace, and only Answer for their Wickedness in
the next World: But then God threatens that a more
speedy Vengeance shall overtake their Posterity, if they
are Wicked; that God will then remember, that they are
the wicked Children of wicked Parents, and not exercise
the same Patience and Long-suffering to them: And this is
in a proper sence to <hi>visit the iniquities of their Fathers on
them;</hi> for though they are punished only for their own
sins, yet the iniquities of their Fathers are the reason why
God punishes them in this world for their sins, and makes
them the Examples of his Justice, while other men as
wicked as themselves escape.</p>
               <p>2. As for the severity of their punishments: No man
shall be punished more than his own sins deserve; but yet
the wicked Children of wicked Parents may be, and very
often are, punished more severely than other Wicked men.</p>
               <p>God does not punish all Bad men alike: For the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this life are more properly acts of Discipline,
than acts of Judgment; and therefore are not proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to the nature of the Crime, but to the circumstances
and condition of the Person, and to the Wise ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and if the wicked Children of wicked Parents
are punished, though for their own sins, yet the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
for their Fathers sake; this is to bear the iniquity of
their Fathers. To understand this, we must observe
that the Scripture takes notice of a certain <hi>measure of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
which is filling up from one Generation to another,
till a last it makes a Nation, or Family, ripe for destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and although those persons on whom this final Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
falls, suffer no more than their own personal Sins
deserved; yet because the sins of former Generations,
which they equal or out do, make it time for God utterly
to destroy them; the punishments due to the sins of many
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50615:172"/>
Ages and Generations, are all said to fall upon them. This
account our Saviour gives of the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,
23. Matt. 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36. Wo unto you Scribes
and Pharisees, Hypocrites; because ye build the tombs of the
prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say,
if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have
been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye be witnesses unto your selves, that ye are the children of
them which killed the prophets; fill ye up then the measure of
your fathers sins.—Wherefore behold, I send unto you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and wise men, and scribes, and some of them shall ye
kill and crucifie, and some of them shall ye scourge in your syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
and persecute them from city to city. That upon you
may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the
blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias Son of Barachias,
whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</hi> God may
wait with patience upon a wicked Nation, or a wicked
Family, but when they sin on from one Generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it all aggravates the account; and when God sees it
time to punish, makes the punishment very severe, or
final.</p>
               <p>2dly. <hi>The Righteous Posterity of good men are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also for their Fathers sake; for</hi> he sheweth mercy to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of them that love him, and keep his commandments.</p>
               <p>A Wicked Son may receive a great many Temporal
Blessings from God, for the sake of a Righteous Father;
for it is evident from Scripture, that God shews great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and exercises great Patience to bad men, for the sake
of the good; but the Promise is made only to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Seed of Good men; for tho it does not unbecome the
Divine Goodness to shew favour to bad men, especially
when it is for the sake of the righteous, which makes it
the reward and encouragement of Vertue; yet it does not
seem fitting to make any general Promise of favour to
them, which would be an Encouragement of Vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:50615:173"/>
The Righteous Seed then of Good men shall be blessed;
but so shall the Righteous Seed of Wicked men be, and
what peculiar Priviledge is this to the Good? I answer;
When God promises to bless the Righteous Posterity of
Good men, if it contain any thing peculiar, which God has
not so expresly promised to other good men, it must signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
a more certain and a more lasting Prosperity in this
world. All good men are not prosperous in this world, nor
has God any where promised that they shall be so, no more
than all wicked men are visibly punished here; but as God
visits the Iniquities of the Fathers upon their Children, by
executing a more speedy Vengeance on the Wicked Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Wicked Parents; so the Righteous Children of
Righteous Parents shall be more certainly prosperous than
other good men; and the more uninterrupted successions
there are of such Righteous Parents and Righteous Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the deeper root they shall take, and be <hi>like a tree plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the rivers of waters, that bringeth forth his fruit in his
season; his leaf also shall not wither, and what soever he doth
shall prosper,</hi> 1. Psal. 3.</p>
               <p>This may suffice for a short Representation of this case;
and as it is thus stated, it is manifest, That there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
in it; let us then consider what Wise Ends it serves,
both with respect to Parents and to Children, and to the
Justification of Providence.</p>
               <p>1. As to Parents: If they have any Natural Affection
to their Children, this is a very powerful Argument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them from Vice, and to excite them to Virtue. Most
of the Labour and Toil which men undergo, is for the sake
of their Children, to provide for them while they live, and
to leave them in easy and happy Circumstances when they
dye; to raise and perpetuate a Family, and to secure them,
as far as it is possible, from all adverse events. But how
successful soever Bad men may be in raising an Estate, they
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50615:173"/>
build upon a Sandy Foundation, and leave a very perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inheritance to their Children; especially if they raise
an Estate by Injustice and Oppression, by defrauding God
and the Poor of their Portion, which many times makes it
moulder away in the hands even of a Righteous Heir. The
more prosperous a wicked man is, the more likely is his
Posterity to be miserable, if he propagate his Vices to
them; for God will at one time or other reckon with wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Families, as well as men; and that will be a Terrible
Account, when <hi>the wickedness of his father shall be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
before the Lord, and the sin of his mother shall not be
blotted out,</hi> 109. Psal. 14.</p>
               <p>And what an Encouragement is this to Good men, tho
they themselves should be unfortunate in the world, to
know, That their Posterity shall reap the Rewards of
their Virtue; that if their Children should be wicked,
there is some reason to hope, that they may be more gently
used, and it may be receive many Temporal Blessings for
their sakes; but if they be Righteous, they shall then take
root, and flourish in the earth; that the little which the
Righteous man hath righteously got, shall prove a better,
a more lasting and increasing Inheritance, than the Riches
of many wicked; and that a Liberal Charity, which some
men think is to defraud their Children, shall prove like
Seed sown in the earth, which repays all with a plentiful
Harvest.</p>
               <p>It is certain, were this firmly believed, and well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it would lay the greatest obligation in the world,
both on Bad and Good men to take care of the Religious
and Vertuous Education of their Children: The only
way wicked men have to cut off the intail of Misery from
their Families, and to secure their Children from that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
which their own sins have deserved, is to train
them up in Piety and Vertue; and the only way Good men
have to intitle their Children to those Temporal Blessings,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50615:174"/>
wherewith God thinks fit to reward their Vertues upon
their Posterity, which is the best Inheritance they can leave
them, is to make them Good. The wicked Children of
wicked Parents, have their own and their Fathers sins to
hasten and increase their punishments; and the Righteous
Children of Righteous Parents, have their own and
their Fathers Vertues to secure and to augment their
rewards.</p>
               <p>2. As for Children: What greater obligation than this
could be laid on them to avoid the evil Examples, and to
imitate the Vertues of their Parents? The Wickedness of
their Fathers makes it more dangerous for them to
be wicked; for when wickedness is intail'd, the
punishment of wickedness is intail'd too; and the longer
Judgment has been delayed, the nearer it is, and the
more severe it is like to be. The wicked Son of
a wicked Father, cannot promise himself to escape so well
as his Father did, because his Father's sins, which
he imitates, calls for a more speedy Vengeance on him;
either to put a stop to wickedness, or to root out a wicked
Family, and to pull down the Leprous house: But what an
encouragement is it to the Children of Righteous Parents
to imitate their Vertues, that they may inherit all the
Blessings of their Fathers? We think it a great advantage
for Children to inherit the fruits of their Parents In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
but to inherit the rewards of their Vertues is
much greater: And this none but vertuous Children can
do. A Prodigal Son may inherit the Estate of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Father, but can't keep it; but a wicked Son of
a vertuous Father forfeits his Inheritance.</p>
               <p>And though some Good men meet with very little, or
with no reward in this world, nay suffer very severely
for their Vertue; this is no discouragement to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but gives them reasonoble hopes to expect the more:
For an exemplary Vertue shall have its reward at one time
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:50615:174"/>
or other, even in this world; and if the Father had it not,
the Son, and the Son's Son through all the Line of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Succession shall; when Good men suffer, or miss of
the rewards of Vertue in this world, they have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rewards in Heaven, and their Children on Earth.</p>
               <p>3. To reward Good men, and to punish the Wicked in
their Posterity, better answers the Wise ends of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this world, than the Personal rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of every particular Good and Bad man. I have
already observed, that there are very wise Reasons why
some Bad men should be Prosperous, and some Good men
Afflicted in this world; and since this world is not the
place of Judgment, the Divine Wisdom does not require
that every Good or Bad man should be rewarded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his works; but yet the Wisdom and Justice of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
does require, that Vertue should be rewarded,
and Vice punished, and that in such degrees, and in such
a manner, as shall lay all reasonable restraints on the Lusts
and Vices of men, and encourage their Vertues. Now
Vertue is rewarded, and Vice punished, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
or punished, if not in the Persons, yet in the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Good or Bad men; which leaves room for the
tryal of the Faith and Patience of Good men, and for
the exercise of God's Goodness and Patience to sinners,
and for the Ministries of Bad men in the service of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and yet very effectually discourages Wickedness,
and encourages Vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Another instance of the Wisdom of Providence
is, That God very often punishes sin with sin, and many
times with sins of the same kind. Our daily observation
may furnish us with examples enow of it, which are
visible and publickly known; and it may be, there are
few Sinners but know some which concern themselves,
which the rest of the world does not know: Thus God
punished the Murther and Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> with the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:50615:175"/>
Incest and Rebellion of his Son <hi>Absolom;</hi> and thus Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is often punished with Oppression, Adultery with
Adultery, Murther with Murther, and Wicked men are
made Plagues and Scourges to each other.</p>
               <p>And God thinks it no dishonour to the Holiness of his
Providence to attribute all such retributions to himself;
for God can serve the Wise ends of his Providence by the
sins of men, without contributing to their sins; and it is
certain, there is not a fitter Punishment in the world for
Sinners, than to suffer the Evils they do; that is, to be
punished by the very sins which they commit.</p>
               <p>Nothing more sensibly convinces them of a Just Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
than this; nothing can give them a more just abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their sins, than to feel the evils and mischiefs of
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing can more awaken and rouse their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
than to suffer the Evils which they have done.
And one would reasonably think, nothing should make
them more afraid to do any Evil, which they are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to suffer: So that nothing could better serve the Wise
ends of Providence to convince men of a Divine <hi>Nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
and Vengeance, to give them an abhorrence of their
sins, and to make them afraid to commit them.</p>
               <p>3. Another instance of the Wisdom of Providence, is in
so often disappointing both our hopes and fears. When we
are in the greatest expectation of some great good, either
we are disappointed in what we expected, or if we have
what we wished for, it does not answer our expectations;
we find our selves deceived in our enjoyments, and that it
had been better for us if we had been without them. And
when we are terrified with the apprehensions of some great
evil which is just ready to fall on us, either the evil does
not come as we feared, or it proves no Evil, but a very
great Good to us. This is so often every man's case, that
I need only appeal to your own Observations for the proof
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:50615:175"/>
Now what more effectual way could God take to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, that we live in the dark, and know not what is
good for our selves; that we disturb our minds with vain
hopes, and with as vain fears; that it becomes us to leave
all to God, and to depend securely on his Providence, who
over-rules all things with a Sovereign Will: That this is
the only way to be easy and safe; to chuse nothing for our
selves, not to prescribe to Providence, but to do our duty,
and then quietly expect what God will do.</p>
               <p>Is it possible there should be a happier temper of mind
than this? more honourable for God, or more secure for
our selves? Does any thing more become Creatures? Is
there any more perfect act of Religion, than to depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
on God, without hopes or fears, in a perfect resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Will, with a full assurance of his protection?
And could Providence more effectually convince us of this,
than to let us see by every days experience, how apt we are
to be mistaken, and to chuse ill for our selves; that our
wishes and desires, were they answered, would very often
undo us; and that we are saved and made happy by what
we feared? and why then should we desire, why should
we fear any longer? let us do our duty, and mind our own
business, and leave God to take care of the world, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
our portion in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> We may observe also, that God very often defers
the deliverance of Good men, and the punishment of the
Wicked to the utmost extremity.</p>
               <p>When Wicked Tyrants and Oppressors are at the
heighth of their Pride and Glory, and Good men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a hopeless state, beyond the visible relief of any
Human Power. This was the case of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when
God sent <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver them with a Mighty Hand, and
an outstretched Arm. This was several times their case in the
days of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> when they were oppressed by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and God raised up Saviours and Deliverers for them:
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:50615:176"/>
Thus it was in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when God in one
night destroyed the mighty Army of the <hi>Assyrians:</hi> Thus
it was in Queen <hi>Hester</hi>'s days, when that Wicked <hi>Haman</hi>
had conspired the destruction of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: And
there want not Examples of it in Christian Story: Never
was there a fiercer Persecution of Christians, than when
God advanced <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Throne, and not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
Peace to the Christian Church, but made Christianity
the Religion of the Empire. And if the Wisdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
consists in giving us wise Instructions, I am sure
this furnishes us with many.</p>
               <p>When things are reduced to that extremity, as to be past
Human relief, it makes it visible to all the world, that it
is God's doing. Where there is Force against Force, and
Counsels against Counsels, though Providence determines
the Event, Human Power and Counsels very often mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize
the Glory, and leave God out; but when God does
that, which men are so far from being able to do, that they
can't think it possible to be done, this awakens a sense of an
Invisible Power, and makes the Divine Glory and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
known to the world.</p>
               <p>When God exposes his own Church and People to such
a suffering state, and threatens them with Final Ruin, it
is a severe Summons to repentance, and warns them not to
trust in vain words, crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the
Temple of the Lord;</hi> for God will purge his own House,
and no External Relation or Priviledges shall secure us
from Vengeance, if we walk not <hi>worthy of that holy voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherewith we are called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But such Deliverances as these give us great reason ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to despair; they teach us, That no case is desperate,
when God will save; and therefore the less expectation we
at any time have of Human Succors, the more earnestly
ought we to implore the Divine Protection, and learn to
live upon Faith, and Trust in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:50615:176"/>
When Good men are reduced to such Extremities, it
makes them more fervent and importunate in their Prayers,
more serious in their Repentance, more sensible how much
they stand in need of God; and such surprizing and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Deliverances inflame their Devotions, make their
Praises and Thanksgivings more hearty and sincere;
which gives great glory to God, and betters their own
minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> The sudden Revolutions of the world, and the
various and unexpected Changes of mens Fortunes, which
is thought one great Calamity of Human Life, is intended
by God to instruct us in some necessary and excellent parts
of Wisdom.</p>
               <p>Some Crafty Politicians, like Mariners, steer their course
as the Wind blows, and change as it changes. They have
no other Rule for their Actions, but to guess, as well as
they can, where their advantage or safety lies; but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
very often disappoints them in this, by such hasty
changes, and short turns, as make them giddy; and this
teaches us to act by Rule, not by a politick foresight of
Events; our Rule can never deceive us; what is just, and
right, and true, is always safe; but our Politicks may,
for things may not go as we expect.</p>
               <p>The various changes of mens Fortunes teach us to treat
all men with great humanity; not to be insolent when we
are prosperous; nor to despise our Inferiors, for we know
not what they, nor we may be, before we die. Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and modesty of conversation is always safe, but pride
and insolence may create us Enemies, who may in time,
how mean soever they are at present, be able to return our
insolence.</p>
               <p>The Divine Providence so orders Human Affairs, as to
teach us most of the wisest Rules of Human Life, both for
our Religious and Civil Conversation; and this I take to
be a manifest proof of the Wisdom of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:50615:177"/>
6thly, <hi>The Wisdom of Providence is often seen in the
wise mixture and temperament of Mercy and Judgment;
when he corrects, but not destroys; humbles, but does
not cast down; when he makes us sensible of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and gives us just reason to fear, but without despair;
when, as the</hi> Psalmist <hi>speaks,</hi> He lifts up, and casts down;
<hi>keeps us under the discipline of hopes and fears, and tries
our Faith and Patience, and Submission, and both threatens
and invites us to repentance, by the interchangeable Scenes
of prosperous and adverse Events. Thus the</hi> Psalmist <hi>tells
us it is with good men.</hi> The steps of a good man are ordered
by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way; though he fall, he
shall not utterly be cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him with
his hand, 37. <hi>Psal. 23, 24. Thus</hi> 94. Psal 14, 15. For the
Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
but judgment shall return unto righteousness, and
all the upright in heart shall follow it. <hi>And he proves this
by his own Experience.</hi> Vnless the Lord had been my help,
my soul had almost dwelt in silence. When I said, my feet slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,
thy mercy, O Lord, held me up, 17, 18, <hi>Verses. An
Example of this ye have</hi> 27. Isaiah. Hath he smitten them,
<hi>that is</hi> Israel, as he smote those that smote him? <hi>He smote</hi>
Israel, <hi>but not as he smote the Enemies of</hi> Israel; Or is he
slain, according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
In measure when it shooteth forth wilt thou debate with it? He
stayeth his rough wind, in the day of his east wind. <hi>This is
to sing to God of Mercy, and of Judgment; to learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
by the things which we suffer, but still to trust
in his help.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">Concerning those Duties which we owe to Providence.</head>
               <p>I Have now finished what I intended with relation to the
Nature and Justification of Providence; and all that
remains is to explain and enforce those Duties which we
owe to Providence.</p>
               <p>Natural Religion is founded on the belief of a God, and
a Providence; for if there be no God, there is no Object of
our Worship; if there be no Providence, there is no Reason
for our Worship. But a God, that made the world, and
takes care of all the Creatures that are in it, deserves the
Praises and Adorations of all. A God, who neither made
the world, nor governs it, is nothing to us; we have no
relation to him, he has nothing to do with us, nor we with
him; but a God in whom <hi>we live, and move, and have
our being,</hi> is the Supream Object of our love, and fear,
and reverence, and hope and trust, and of all those religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and devout Affections, which are due to our Maker and
Soveraign Lord.</p>
               <p>This is so plain, that it is enough to name it; but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and extent of those Duties which we owe to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
deserves a more particular consideration.</p>
               <p>As to instance in some of the chief.</p>
               <p>1. To take notice of the Hand of God in every thing
that befalls us; to attribute all the Evils we suffer, and all
the good things we enjoy, to his Soveraign Will and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:
This is the foundation of all the other Duties
which we owe to Providence; and the general neglect of
this makes us defective in all the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:50615:178"/>
Now if the Divine Providence has the absolute govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Events, you must confess it your duty to
take notice of Providence, and to acknowledge God in
every thing; for this is only applying the general Doctrine
of Providence to particular Events; without which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application the general belief of a Providence will
and can have no effect upon us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Psalmist</hi> complains of those wicked men, <hi>who regard
not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands,
28. Psal.</hi> 5. And a great many such there are, who have
a general notion and belief of a Providence, but take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what God does, or take no notice of God in what
is done. Most men are too apt to attribute all Events to the
immediate and visible Causes; and though at other times
they will own a God and a Providence, yet as to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Events, take as little notice of God, as if he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do in it. Such a belief of Providence as this, is of
no use at all in Religion; it neither gives glory to God,
nor has any influence upon the government of our lives.</p>
               <p>But if we will own Providence to the true ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of Religion, we must not content our selves with a
general belief of God's governing the world, but whatever
our state and condition be, or whatever extraordinary
good or evil happens to us, we must receive all as from the
Hand of God. If we are poor, we must own this to be
God's will and appointment that we should be poor; if
we be rich, we must consider, that it is God's Blessing
which maketh rich; if we lose our Estates by Injustice
and Oppression, we must acknowledge, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>The
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away:</hi> And whatever
Evils and Miseries befall us, we must say with good old
<hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</hi> Or
with <hi>David, I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because
it is thy doings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:50615:178"/>
Without believing God's government of all Events, we
deny a particular Providence; and unless at the very time,
when any good or evil befals us, we see and acknowledge
God's hand in it, we can have no present affecting sense of
his Providence: All such Acts of Providence are lost, as
far as our taking no notice of them can lose them; God
loses the glory of his Goodness, Mercy, Patience, or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and we lose those Divine Comforts and Supports, or
those Spiritual Instructions and Admonitions, which a due
sense and acknowledgment of Providence would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
us with.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us accustom our selves in all Events,
in the first place to take notice of God, and his Providence;
which will teach us how to behave our selves in all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and how to make the best and wisest use of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
happens; and it was necessary to premise this; for it is
in vain to teach men their duty to Providence, till they
have learnt to attribute all particular Events to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God; and to live under a constant sense and regard
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> When we have thus affected our minds with a just
sense of the Divine Providence in every thing that befalls
us, we must in the next place take care to compose our
Souls to a quiet and humble submission to the Sovereign
Will and Pleasure of God in all things.</p>
               <p>All men confess, that it is our duty to submit to the Will
of God; and if all the Events of Providence are God's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and what God does is his Will, as the Scripture as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us it is, and Reason tells us it must be, unless God
does any thing against his own Will, then we must submit
to the Providential Will of God in all Events, as well as to
the Commanding Will of God in obeying his Laws.</p>
               <p>The Soveraign Authority and Dominion of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
this of us; for we are his, and he may dispose of
our Condition and Fortune in the world, as he pleases. The
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50615:179"/>
Absolute Power of God makes it both prudent and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;<note place="margin">9. Job 4.</note>
                  <hi>For who hath hardened himself against him, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered;</hi>
that is, against his Providential Will; for that
whole Dispute is about Providence: And the Wisdom and
Goodness of God makes it both reasonable, and our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
to submit to him; for all his Providences, how severe
soever they may appear, are ordered for the good of those
who do submit to him. So that it is our duty to submit,
because he is our Soveraign Lord; whether we will submit
or no, we must suffer his Will, because we cannot resist
his Power; and there is no danger in submitting to God,
for he will consult our present and future Happiness, and do
better for us, than we could chuse for our selves.</p>
               <p>This is plain enough; but that which I principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
is to consider the nature and various acts of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
which we owe to Providence, or to the Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Will of God; and I shall distinctly inquire, what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
we owe to Providence under all the Evils, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Calamities of life, and in those several states,
conditions, and relations of life, which the Providence of
God placeth us in.</p>
               <p>1. What submission we owe to Providence under all the
Sufferings and Afflictions which we meet with in this
world. I do not mention a happy and prosperous Fortune,
for it requires no great submission to be prosperous, this is
what all men desire and chuse; but to submit, is to make
our own Wills, and Desires, and Fears, and Aversions,
and natural Passions and Affections, stoop and yield to
the Will of God, which there is no occasion for, but in
a suffering and afflicted state.</p>
               <p>Now when we suffer such things as are very grievous to
flesh and blood, submission to the Will of God does not
require that we should not feel our Sufferings, that we
should not be afflicted with them, that we should not
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50615:179"/>
complain of them; for to submit to God is not to put off
the sense and passions of human Nature; it does not alter
the nature of things, nor our opinions about them: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are afflictions still, and will be felt, and though
we must bear them in submission to God, yet we must
bear them as Afflictions can be born, and as human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can bear them; with pain, and grief, and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
with sighs, and groans, and complaints, with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and importunate desires and Prayers to God and man
to help and deliver us.</p>
               <p>We have frequent examples of this in Scripture: The
Psalms of <hi>David</hi> as they abound with all dutifull Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Reverence and Submission to the Will of God; so
they are very full of complaints and of the most passionate
sense of Sufferings represented so as to be felt, in such a
strain of moving Eloquence, as not Art, but Afflicted
Nature teaches. But we have one Example above all
others, and that is the Example of our Saviour Christ,
who suffered with Fear and Reluctancy, and with earnest
Prayers to his Father, <hi>If it be possible, let this cup pass
from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, the greater our fears, and sorrows, and
aversions are, the greater is our submission to God: it
may be thought a great weakness of Nature to be so
much afraid of our Sufferings; but it argues the greater
strength of Faith, and is a more glorious Victory over self,
to make our very fears and aversions submit to the Divine
Will; for the more what we suffer is against our own
will, the greater is our submission to the Will of God.
Submission to God does not consist in courage and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of mind to bear Sufferings, which men may have
without any sense of God; and which the profoundest
Reverence for God will not always teach us; but he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
who receives the Bitter Cup and drinks it, though
with a Trembling heart and hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:50615:180"/>
This ought to be observed for the comfort of those who
have a very Devout sense of God, and Reverence for his
Judgments, but betray great weakness of Mind, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of Passions under their Sufferings; who are very
impatient of Pain, and have such soft and tender Passions,
that every Affliction galls them, and when they reflect
upon these Disorders, this creates new and greater Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to them; for they conclude, that all this is want of a
due Submission to the Will of God: But Religion was
never intended to extinguish the Sense and Affections of
Nature, to reconcile us to Pain, or to make all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to us; and while there is any thing that we
love, it will be grievous to part with it; and while there
is any thing that we fear, it will be grievous to suffer it.
Religion will rectify our Opinions of things, and cure
our fondnesses, and set bounds to our Passions; but when
all these flattering, or frightful disguises are removed,
which magnified the Good or Evil that is in things, yet
Good and Evil they are, and will excite in us either trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
or delightful Passions; and this will exercise our
Submission to God, to part with what we love, and to
suffer what we fear; and were not this the case, there
were no use of Submission.</p>
               <p>To explain this in a few words, let us consider how
that man must suffer, who suffers with Submission to
God; and that is the Submission which we owe to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Now a man who suffers with Submission, must
not reproach and censure the Divine Providence, but
think and speak honourably of God, how hardly soever
he deals with him; he may complain of what he suffers
both to God and men, but he must not complain of God:
This was <hi>Iob</hi>'s Behaviour; <hi>Naked came I out of my mother's
womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and
the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord:
in all this Iob sinned not, nor charged God foolishly,</hi> I Job 21,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50615:180"/>
22. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was an Example of the like
Submission; <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou
didst it,</hi> 39. Psalm 9. He submitted silently and patiently
as to God's hand, opened not his mouth against God,
though he complains of the Wickedness of men, and of
the severity of his Sufferings; <hi>Deliver me from all my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
make me not the reproach of the foolish: remove
thy stroke away from me; I am consumed by the blow of thine
hand,</hi> 8, 10.</p>
               <p>To reproach and revile Providence, to fret against
God, or as <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wife advised him, to curse God, to be
weary of his Government, and impatient to think that
we cannot resist, and cast off so uneasy a yoke; this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to Submission. Such men suffer God's
Will because they cannot help it; but they would Rebel if
they could; those who are so outragious against what God
does, and so impatiently angry with God for doing it, only
want power to stay his hand, and to pull him from his
Throne.</p>
               <p>Submission to God, is the Submission of our Wills
to the Will of God: Now though no man can absolutely
chuse sufferings; for suffering is a natural Evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not the object of a free choice; yet men may chuse
suffering against the natural byass and inclination of their
own wills in Subjection to the will of God: Of this our
Saviour is a great Example, who express'd a great aversion
against suffering, Prayed earnestly, <hi>Father, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
let this cup pass from me, nevertheless, not my will, but
thy will be done,</hi> Our own wills will draw back and recoil
at suffering; <hi>For no affliction is for the present joyous but
grievous;</hi> but yet a will that is subject to God, will deny
it self, and chuse that God's will should take place; And
this is our Submission to the Will of God in suffering; yet how
uneasie soever it be to us, we are so far from complaining
against God, that we would not have it otherwise when
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50615:181"/>
God sees fit it should be so; that though we do not, and
cannot chuse sufferings, yet we chuse that the Will of God
should be done, though it be to suffer.</p>
               <p>Another act of Submission to God, is when we wait
patiently on God, till he think fit to deliver us; when
notwithstanding all we suffer, our hope, and trust, and
dependance is still on God. To submit to God, is to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in Faith and Hope, to submit as to the Corrections
and Discipline of a Father; for it is impossible for any
man to submit without Hope, as impossible as it is to be
contented with final Ruin. When we cast off our Hope
in God, there is an end of our Submission, then we shall
come to that desperate conclusion, <hi>Behold, this evil is of
the Lord, why should I wait on the Lord any longer,</hi> 2 Kings
6. 33. But never was there a greater expression of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
than that of <hi>Iob, Though he slay me, yet will I trust
in him:—he also shall be my salvation, for a hypocrite shall
not come before him,</hi> 13. Job 15, 16. This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> has
fully express'd 27. <hi>Psalm 13, 14. I had fainted unless I had
believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of living.
Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
thine heart: wait I say on the Lord.</hi> To Hope in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Goodness of God, even when he strikes, to wait
Patiently till he will be Gracious, to make our complaints
to him, and to expect our Deliverance and Salvation only
from him; this is to Submit to the Will of God, to make
his Will our Will, to attend all the motions of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as patiently and diligently as a Servant does the
commands of his Lord, as it is elegantly represented,
123. <hi>Psalm 1, 2. Vnto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that
dwellest in the heavens! Behold! as the eyes of servants look
upon the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden
unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord
our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:50615:181"/>
This is that Submission which we owe to Providence,
under all the Evils and Calamities of Life; and if we
would make this Submission easy and chearful, we must
possess our Souls with a firm perswasion of the Wisdom and
Goodness of God: We must not look upon him a meer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
and Arbitrary Lord; for to submit to meer Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Will and Power, is, and will be, very grievous; but we
must represent God to our minds under a more lovely and
charming Character, as the Universal Parent, who has a
tender and compassionate regard for all his Creatures; <hi>Who
does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men; who
corrects us for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and proportions the severity of his Discipline, either
to the ends of Publick Government, or to our Spiritual
wants: Such an Idea of Providence as this, will reconcile
us even to Sufferings, when we know they are good for us,
and intended for our good: When we know that it is a
kind hand which strikes, we shall kiss the Rod, and submit
to Correction with as equal a mind, as we do to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of a Physician, how severe the methods of cure
are. Were our minds thoroughly possessed with this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
how easy would it make us under some of the most
severest trials. Nothing indeed can make pain easy, for
that is matter of sense; but a good perswasion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, will fortify our minds to bear it; and that
is much the same thing, whether our pains be less, or our
minds stronger. But as for other Afflictions, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
very much upon Opinion, and afflict us more or less,
as we apprehend them, a firm belief of the Wisdom and
Goodness of God, who inflicts them on us, will in a great
measure cure the pain and trouble of them.</p>
               <p>We have, it may be, lost some part of our Estates, a
dear Friend, or near Relation; a Child, it may be an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Child, but all these are uncertain Comforts; and when
the case is doubtful, whether it be good for us, or not; we
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:50615:182"/>
ought in all reason to acquiesce in the Divine Will, and
conclude, that is best for us which God does; because he is
infinitely wiser than we are, and more concerned for our
happiness, if we will make a wise use of his Providence,
than we our selves are.</p>
               <p>Nay, this will teach us an implicit faith in God beyond
our own prospect of things; though we can no more guess
the reasons of our Sufferings, than <hi>Iob</hi> could; yet while
we believe God to be wise and good, we are secure; a
wise God can never mistake, and a good God will consult
our happiness, and that is reason enough in the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and perplext cases to submit patiently to Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a submission also due to the Will of God,
with respect to the several states, conditions, and relations
of life, which the Divine Providence hath placed us in. We
can no more chuse our own state and condition of life, than
we can chuse, when and where to be born, what our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
shall be, how they shall educate us, and dispose of
us in the world, what success we shall have, what Friends,
or what Enemies we shall meet with, what Changes and
Revolutions we shall see, either in our private Fortunes,
or in publick Affairs. Nothing of all this is at our own
choice, and therefore whatever our Circumstances are, any
farther than it is our own fault, they are not imputable
to us.</p>
               <p>Now since we cannot chuse our own Fortune, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Events as we please, the only submission we can owe to
God in such cases, is humbly to acquiesce in what God
does, and faithfully to discharge the duties which belong
to that state, and condition, and circumstances of life,
which the Providence of God has placed us in.</p>
               <p>This is to submit to the Providential Will of God, to
submit to the disposals of Providence; and to submit to
God's disposal, is to act in that sphere and station which
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50615:182"/>
Providence assigns us, and to comply with the Laws of it.
And thus the Providence of God, though it be not the rule
of our Actions, yet may change our duty, and must do so,
as it changes our condition; for every condition and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
having peculiar duties belonging to it, our duty must
change, as our condition does. The duties of Princes and
Subjects, of Magistrates and private Men, of a low and
mean, and of an exalted and plentiful Fortune, of Parents
and Children, of Masters and Servants, are of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature; and as these relations change, our duty
must change with them; and when we conform our selves
to our condition, we submit to Providence, which gives us
no new rules of life; but may impose new duties on us, by
putting us into a new state.</p>
               <p>This ought to be carefully considered, because there are
dangerous extreams on both sides. Some think the visible
appearances of Providence are sufficient to alter our duty
without changing our state and relations; that the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Providence will justify such Actions, as neither the
Laws of God nor men will justify; and that to serve Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
when a fair opportunity is put into their hands,
they may dispence with the most known and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
duties: Others have such a just abhorrence of this, which
overturns all Divine and Human Laws, that they run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the contrary extream; and for fear of allowing that
Providence can change our duty, and alter the nature of
good and evil, they will not allow, that Providence can so
much as change our relations and state of life, and with such
a change of our condition, change our duty: For no man
can deny, but that if our condition and relations are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
our duty must change too.</p>
               <p>To give a plain Example of this. When <hi>Saul</hi> pursued
<hi>David,</hi> and God delivered <hi>Saul</hi> into <hi>David</hi>'s hands while
he was asleep in the Cave; <hi>The men of David said unto
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50615:183"/>
him, behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold
I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayst do
to him, as it shall seem good to thee.</hi> Here is an Argument
from Providence to justify <hi>David</hi>'s killing <hi>Saul,</hi> whom God
had so wonderfully delivered into his hands; but <hi>David</hi>
did not think that Providence would justify him against a
Divine Law; Providence gave him an opportunity to kill
<hi>Saul,</hi> but the Divine Law forbad him to take it; for <hi>Saul</hi>
was his King still, and he was his Subject. And therefore
<hi>He said unto his men, the Lord forbid that I should do this thing
unto my Master, the Lords anointed, to stretch forth my hand
against him, seeing he is the Lord's anointed,</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 4, 6.
The same Answer <hi>David</hi> gave to <hi>Abishai,</hi> when he found
<hi>Saul</hi> the second time sleeping in the Trench, <hi>And Abishai
said to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine
hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee,
with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite
him the second time. And David said to Abishai, destroy him
not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's
anointed, and be guiltless?</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 8, 9. Providence
had not unkinged <hi>Saul,</hi> nor made <hi>David</hi> King; that is, it
had not altered the relation, and therefore could not absolve
him from the duties of his relation, from those duties which
a Subject owes to his Prince, and therefore could not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the killing him.</p>
               <p>This shews, that the Divine Providence can't alter the
Rules of Action, without altering our Condition, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and Circumstances of Life; and where it does so,
it must of necessity change our Duty; for different Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Conditions require different Duties: When a
man of a Servant becomes a Master, or of a Subject a Prince,
his Duties and Obligations must change with his Relations,
for such relative Duties are annexed to Relations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to particular persons, only as invested with such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
and as the person changes his Relations, so the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:50615:183"/>
Duties he owes, and the Duties which are owing to him,
must change likewise.</p>
               <p>It is a vain pretence in this case to set up the Laws of
God against our submission to Providence; for we do not
oppofe the Providence of God against his Laws. The Laws
of God prescribe us the Rules of our Duty in all Conditions
and Circumstances of Life; the Providence of God chuses
our condition for us, and that directs us what Laws we
are to observe, what Duties we owe, and to whom: So
that there is and can be no dispute about the Rules of Duty;
the Duties of all Conditions and Relations are fixt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
the only dispute that can be, is this, Whether, when
our Condition and Relations are changed, they are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by God? and whether we must submit to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God in such a Change, by what means soever such
a Change is brought about? If all the private and publick
changes of mens state and condition are directed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by God, and are his Will and Doings, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved; if we must submit to Providence, we must
submit to that state and condition which Providence places
us in: For there is no other way of submitting to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>And since we cannot chuse our own Fortune, much less
govern Kingdoms and Empires; since God keeps all these
Events in his own hands, it would be very hard, if we must
not submit to the condition which Providence chuses for
us; that when God allots us our condition, it should be
unlawful for us to do what our condition requires to be
done: For if our present condition and circumstances of
life do not determine our duty, it is impossible ever to know
what our duty is.</p>
               <p>But there are some material Questions concerning
our submission to Providence, with respect to our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
states and conditions of life, which deserve to be
considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:50615:184"/>
1. As first, Whether it be consistent with our submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Providence, to endeavour to better our Fortune, and
to change our state of life. Now this there can be no doubt
of in general, though I fear many men are to blame in it.
Submission to Providence does not forbid a poor man to
enrich himself, when he can do it by honest and prudent
Arts; for though God allots every man his portion in the
world, yet he has reserved to himself a liberty of changing
mens Fortunes, as they deserve, and as he sees fit. That it
often is so, experience tells us; we see men rise from low
and mean beginnings to great riches, and honour, and
power; and since God has not forbid any man to advance
his Fortune by honest means, submission to Providence
does not stake a man down to the low and mean beginnings
of life. This is the present reward and encouragement of
diligence, prudence, and vertue; That <hi>the diligent hand
maketh rich; that a man who is diligent in his business, shall
stand before princes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Prov. 14, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and shall not stand before mean men. That
the merchandise of wisdom is better than the merchandise of
silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold: That length of days
is in her right hand, and in her left riches and honours.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
gives us many Examples of this nature to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
all mens Industry and Vertue, which, whether it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their Fortunes or no, will make their lives easy and
happy, and better their minds, and make them useful to
the world, and a credit to a low Fortune; which may be
better for them than to change their station: Nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we see men of a noble and sprightly genius come into
the world in such mean circumstances, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
peep above the Horizon; but by degrees they ascend,
and grow brighter, and shine with a Meridian luster, as if
their obscure beginnings were intended on purpose to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirit
the lower end of the world, and to shew what Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Vertue can do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:50615:184"/>
But though submission to Providence does not hinder us
from using all honest endeavours to better our Fortune;
yet it makes us easy and contented in a low Fortune, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of disappointments, and not envious at the better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
and greater Prosperity of others, especially of those
who were our equals. All which signifies no more, than
quietly and submissively to suffer God to dispose of our own
and of other mens Fortunes, as he pleases. We may like
some other condition better than our own, but submission
to Providence will make us easy and contented with what
we have; because it is God's Will, and what he orders for
us; and if we believe well of God, we must believe that it
is good for us. We may endeavour to increase our Estate,
and get a little higher in the world; but if our endeavours
want success, we must take it patiently, and wait God's
time, and be contented to tarry where we are, if he does
not think fit to advance us; and not repine if he advance
others before and above us; for it is God's will to advance
them, and it is not his will to advance us, and he has wise
Reasons for both, and we ought to acquiesce in his Will
with an implicit faith.</p>
               <p>We may endeavour to better our Fortune, but we must
not force our selves upwards, must not be restless or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our desires; must use no base or wicked Arts to
make our selves great. This is not to submit to God, but
to carve out our own Fortune, without any reverence to the
Laws, and to the Providence of God. Nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
such men, but to be rich and great, and they will bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
at nothing that will make them so; God sometimes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
such men to prosper, but they do not prosper in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Providence; but if I may so speak, they commit
a rape upon Providence; and Providence deals with them
accordingly, and makes them the sport of Fortune: When
they have taken a great leap, it tosses them up, and keeps
them hovering a-while in the Air, and then flings them
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:50615:185"/>
down into irrecoverable and unpitied Ruin. Though no
men can advance themselves whether God will or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Events are in God's hands; yet when men advance
themselves by sin, the means of their advancement is their
own, not the Will of God; but submission to Providence
requires us quietly and contentedly to keep our station, till
God sees fit to advance us, at his own time, and in his own
way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> What submission is due to God in the changes of
our Fortune and Condition, and that whether it be from
low to high, or from high to low.</p>
               <p>As for the first, There are few men who find any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in submitting to Providence, when it advances them
to a higher station; but some few such there are, who love
their ease and retirement, and the conversation of their
Friends, and the security of a private life, before noisy
greatness, and the endless Fatigues of Publick Ministries;
who had rather enjoy themselves, and be Masters of their
own time, and thoughts, and actions, than to be admired
and flattered Slaves, to be envied by some, to be courted by
others, to be Servants to all; to be exposed to Censorious
Tongues, to the Frowns of Princes, to the Emulations of
their Equals, and to all the changes and vicissitudes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
It is not often that men of this temper are in any
great danger of such troublesome Honours; there are enow
that snatch at them before they are offered, to secure those
who have no mind to have them; but sometimes this does
happen, and then it is matter of duty and conscience for
men to sacrifice their own ease and private satisfactions, to
the Service of God, and of their Countrey: And it would
be as great a fault obstinately to decline such Services, as
the Providence of God call them to, as it is vanity and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to affect them; for God has a right to the Services of
all his Creatures, and may imploy them in what station
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50615:185"/>
he pleases; then we may certainly conclude, that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
chuses our station for us, when it is what we did not,
and would not chuse for our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> But the greater and more common difficulty is in
submitting to the other Change, from a high to a low
Fortune. There are many who suffer such a change as
this, though most of them may thank their own Lusts and
Vices for it; but there are very few who submit to it. I do
not only mean, that they do not bear such a change of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with that patience and submission, which is due to the
Divine Will, when this change is manifestly owing to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and not to their own fault; but that they will not
submit to their condition, that they will not submit to be
poor, when the Providence of God has made them so.
Some men, if they meet with misfortunes, will be sure to
make their Creditors pay for it, and be their own Carvers
too, and raise an Estate out of forced and Knavish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
Others, though they are very poor, will not
submit to the state of Poverty, will not bring their minds
to their condition; they cannot stoop to the mean and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
and industrious life of Poverty: They have always li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
well and easily, and they expect to live still as they
have lived, and to be maintained according to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the figure they have formerly made in the world;
they cannot work, but to beg they are not ashamed, though
a truly great mind would prefer the meanest employment
before it; for that is no dishonour to any man, to live by
his own industry, when the Providence of God has brought
him low. All that I have now to say, is only this, that
when men are reduced to poverty, submission to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
requires that they should submit to their condition,
imitate the humility, and modesty, frugality, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of poor men, and not expect to live still, as rich men
do; for charity was never intended for the rich, nor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the industry of the poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:50615:186"/>
There is indeed great regard to be had to the honour of
mens birth and character: Those who have any humanity
must needs be very tenderly and compassionately affected
to see men of great honour reduced to want, or forced to
mean and servile Employments to supply their wants; and
we owe so much to the modesty of Human Nature, and to
a sense of Honour, to be as ready to defend some men from
meanness, as others from want; but yet submission to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
requires all men to comply with their condition, as
far as their rank and character, and the rules of decency will
permit: That a man has been once rich, is no reason why
he should not work, or find out some honest, though mean
way of living, when he grows poor. This is certain, Those
who do not submit to the condition which Providence has
put them into, and behave themselves as that conditon
requires, do not submit to Providence; and therefore
if Providence make us poor, we must consider not how
we lived when we were rich, but how it becomes a poor
man to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> There is another very material question, How far
we must submit to Providence; but the answer is very plain,
We must submit as far as the condition Providence puts us
into requires our submission. Providence creates no new
duty, but by putting us into new circumstances; and what
the circumstances we are in make our duty, that is our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Providence, and we owe no other submission.</p>
               <p>As for instance; If a Thief breaks open my House, or
robs me upon the Road, submission to Providence does not
hinder me from pursuing and taking him, and recovering
my own of him, and bringing him to punishment, if I
can; for my being robbed, lays no obligation upon me pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to lose what is unjustly taken away, if I have any
honest way left of recovering it; nor of suffering such a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
to escape, if I can bring him to punishment. And thus
it is in all the Injuries we receive from men; though we
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50615:186"/>
must own the Divine Providence in whatever we suffer,
yet submission to Providence requires no more of us, than
what the Laws of God and men require in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and therefore allows us to right our selves, as far
as the Laws of God, and the Laws of men, if they be just
and equal, will allow us. But if the Providence of God
should put us into the hands of our Enemies, and make it
necessary to contract with them for our Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we must humbly submit to Providence, which brought
us into this necessity, and religiously observe our Contracts,
how disadvantageous soever they are; because Providence
has now altered our condition, and brought us under new
obligations.</p>
               <p>This is the usual way whereby God brings about the
great Changes and Revolutions of the world, by such
Power as forces a compliance, and translates Kingdoms
and Empires; and though nothing is more grievous than
unjust force, yet Nature teaches men to submit, when they
cannot resist; and Power will absolve us from all former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
unless in such cases as we are expresly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God not to submit to Power, though we sacrifice our
lives for it; and I know no such case, but the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, and the Profession of our Faith in Christ. We
may defend our selves against private Injuries, as far as Law
and Justice will defend us; we may resist unjust and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Powers, as long as we can resist; but the Providence
of God which governs the world, makes it lawful to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
when we cannot resist; and when by such submissions
new Kingdoms are erected, and we are become the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of new Powers, then Providence has changed our
Relations, and made it our duty to submit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> There is another Inquiry also of great moment,
how our submission to Providence under all our Sufferings
and Changes of Fortune, requires us to behave our selves
towards men, who are the Causes and Instruments of such
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50615:187"/>
Misfortunes. For if it be the will of God that we should
suffer such things, why should we be angry with the men
who do them? why should we punish them? why should
we revenge our selves of them? when they only execute
the Divine Counsels, and do what God saw fit that we
should suffer. Does not <hi>Ioseph</hi> thus excuse his Brethren
for selling him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that it was God who sent him
thither: And does not <hi>David</hi> for this reason forbear his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
on <hi>Shimei, Let him curse, for God hath said unto
him, Curse David?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the answer to this is short and plain, that God's
over-ruling mens wickedness to serve wise and good ends,
does not excuse their wickedness, nor excuse them from the
just punishments of their wickedness; the sin is their own,
though it be wisely ordered by God for our trial or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
but the wise Government of God makes no change
in the nature of mens Actions, nor in their Deserts: God
himself will punish their wickedness, though he serves
wise ends by it, and has commanded men to do so; for no
man sins by the will of God, though no man suffers any
thing but by God's will.</p>
               <p>But yet Submission to Providence will greatly mitigate
our Resentments, and calm our Passions, and keep them
within the bounds of Reason and Religion. When we
consider, that whatever we suffer is appointed for us by
God; that how wicked soever men are, we can suffer
nothing by their wickedness, but what God for wise Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
sees fit we should suffer; this will satisfy us that we
are more concerned with God than with men; that tho
Men be the Rod wherewith we are scourged, it is God
that strikes; and a Reverence for the Divine Judgments
will make us take less notice of the Instruments of our
sufferings.</p>
               <p>In short, Submission to Providence leaves us nothing to
be angry with men for, but their own wickedness; that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50615:187"/>
we suffer, tho we suffer by their wickedness, yet it is not so
much their doings as God's, who orders these sufferings for
us, and without whose Order and Appointment no man
can hurt us; and therefore we must not be angry with
men for our sufferings, but reverence God: Whatever
their Personal Hatred, or Malice, or Revenge be, how
much soever they intend or desire to do us hurt, we may
securely despise them, as out of their reach, for we are in
the hands of God: And if our Sufferings are not owing
to men, any otherwise than as Instruments in God's hands,
why should we be angry with men for what we suffer?
Why should we revenge our Sufferings on them, when
we suffer by the Will of God? We may be angry at their
Wickedness, and at their ill will to us, but humbly submit
to our Sufferings, as the Will of God.</p>
               <p>Now I need not say, how this will calm and temper our
Passions, because it leaves so little of self in our Anger and
Resentments; let men be as angry with Wickedness as
they please, and punish it as it deserves, this is a Virtuous
Anger, and never transports men to excess; it is self-love
which inflames our Anger, and sharpens our Revenge;
not that such Wickedness is committed, but that we are
the Sufferers by it; for men are never so angry in another
man's Cause, as they are in their own, tho the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Affront, the Injury is the same; but Personal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Affronts are most provoking; that is, we love
our Selves more than we hate Wickedness, when our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is excessive.</p>
               <p>But now if men have nothing to do with us, nor we
with them, as to the case of Suffering; if all this be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and appointed by God, here is little room for Personal
Resentments; for that we suffer by their Wickedness, is
God's doings, and therefore we have nothing to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with them for, but that they are wicked; and then
tho our own Sufferings will give us a greater sense and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50615:188"/>
of their Wickedness, and make us more personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned to punish it; yet our Passions will be more
gentle and easy, the more we attribute our Sufferings to
God, and the less to Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Duty we owe to Providence is, An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Trust and Dependance on God. The state of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is all Dependance; and Faith, and Hope, and Trust,
are the Virtues of a dependant state, and can in reason have
no other Object but that Being on whom we depend, the
great Creator and Governor of the world, <hi>in whom we live,
move, and have our being.</hi> All other Dependancies are vain,
because none else can help us; but God has all Events in
his hands, he can help us, if he pleases; and he will help
us, if we trust in him.</p>
               <p>The Scripture abounds with Exhortations to trust in
God, with promises to those who do trust in him,
with Examples of God's Care and Protection of those
good men, who make him their only Hope and Trust;
but yet the Duty it self needs some Explication, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall consider the Nature of this Hope and Trust,
and what are the various Acts of it, or wherein the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of it consists.</p>
               <p>1. The Nature of this Faith, and Hope, and Trust in
the Divine Providence. What it is to hope, and trust, and
depend on God or Men, we all know and feel; but the
Question is, What it is we must trust God for, and how
far we must depend on him? For must we believe, That
God will do every thing for us, which we trust in him to
do? If, suppose, we have a Child or a Friend dangerously
sick, must we firmly believe that God will spare their lives,
and restore their health, if we trust in him to do it? Must
a Merchant confidently expect a safe and advantageous
Voyage, if he trust in God for it? Has God any where
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:50615:188"/>
promised to give us whatever we trust in him for? Or does
the Nature and Reason of Providence infer any such thing?
And yet what does Trust in God signify, if we must not
depend on him for those good things which we want, and
desire, and trust him for? What do all the Promises made
to Hope and Trust in God signify, if they give us no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
that we shall obtain our Desires of God? Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
how can any man hope and trust in God, when he
has no assurance that he shall obtain what he hopes for?
I doubt not but such thoughts as these make most men so
distrustful of Providence, that tho they talk of trusting in
God, they trust in him without hope, or any comfortable
expectations, unless they have some more visible assurances
to rely on. This makes most mens hopes ebb and flow, as
their external circumstances change; if they are prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and have great numbers of Friends, and have their
Enemies at their feet, then they are full of hope, and can
trust securely in God, when they have the means of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves in their own hands, and see no body that
can hurt them; but if their condition be perplext and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous,
and they see no prospect of human relief, their
spirits sink, and as much as they talk of Providence, and
Trusting in God, they find no support in it.</p>
               <p>To understand this aright, wherein the Glory of God,
and our own Peace and Security is so nearly concerned, we
must consider, That our Faith, and Hope, and Trust in
God, must either rely on the Word and Promise of God;
or on the general Belief and Assurance of his Care of us, and
of the Goodness and Justice of his Providence; as to trust
in men, is either to trust their Promise or their Friendship.</p>
               <p>1. As for the first, we may and ought securely to rely
on the Promises of God, as far as they reach, for <hi>he who
hath promised, is able also to perform.</hi> But then we must
have a care of expounding Temporal Promises to a larger
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:50615:189"/>
sense than God intended, or than Providence ordinarily
makes good, which calls the Truth of God, or his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
into question, and discourages our Faith and Trust
in God; when we see Events not to answer God's Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
nor our Expectations.</p>
               <p>To state this matter plainly, we must proceed by
degrees, and distinguish between the Promises made to
States and Kingdoms, and to Private and Single Men, or
rather to men in their private and single capacities.</p>
               <p>Most of the Temporal Promises under the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
concerned the Publick State of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and
Nation; that if they walked in the Laws and Statutes of
God, he would bless them with great Plenty and Peace, or
give them Victory over their Enemies: That he would
have respect unto them, and make them fruitful and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
them, and establish his Covenant with them, 26. <hi>Lev.</hi>
which are Publick and National Blessings: And tho there
is a great difference between the <hi>Iewish</hi> and Christian
Church, with respect to Temporal Promises, yet there does
not seem to be any great difference between a Christian
Nation, and the <hi>Iewish</hi> State. When a Nation has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
Christianity, and the Church is incorporated into
the State, and true Religion and Vertue is encouraged, and
Vice suppressed; such a Religious Nation has a title to all
the National Blessings which God promised to the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation, if they observed his Laws; for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is universally true, <hi>That righteousness exalteth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but sin is the reproach of any people:</hi> And excepting
what was typical in the <hi>Iewish</hi> State, there is much the
same reason for God to protect and bless a Religious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Nation; <hi>viz.</hi> for the publick encouragement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and for the reward of a National Piety and Vertue;
and therefore as the Christian Church inherits all those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Blessings which were typified in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church;
so a Christian Nation succeeds to all those Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50615:189"/>
which were made to the <hi>Iewish</hi> State, or else all these
Promises of the Law would be of no use to us now.</p>
               <p>So that these National Promises we may securely rely on
as to their utmost extent and signification; and I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
there cannot be one Example given, wherein these
Promises have failed: God has oftentimes suffered a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nation to be prosperous to scourge their wicked Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but he never suffers a truly righteous and religious
Nation to be oppressed.</p>
               <p>Now the largest and most comprehensive Promises in
Scripture are of this nature, such as concern the publick
state of Kingdoms and Nations; but even in the most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
state of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church the case of particular
men was very different; some bad men were prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and good men afflicted; and therefore those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
which concern good men in their private and single
capacities, must be more cautiously expounded to a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
and limited sense, accommodated to the different
states and conditions of good men in this world; and to
their different attainments in Vertue. As for example.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of Wisdom, <hi>Length of days is in
her right hand, and in her left riches and honour,</hi> 3. Prov. 16.
Will any man expound this to signify, That all wise men,
who are truly religious and prudent, shall live till old age,
and attain to riches and honours? Did God then intend
that there should be no different ranks and degrees of men
in the world? that there should be no poor men as well as
rich? or did he intend that no poor men should be wise?
Wisdom indeed will advance a Prince to great riches and
honour, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us his Father <hi>David</hi> instructed
him; <hi>He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart
retain my words, keep my commandments, and live. Get
wisdom, get understanding: Forget her not, neither decline
from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall
preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50615:190"/>
the principal thing, therefore get wisdom; and with all thy
getting get understanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote
thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her;
she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace, a crown of
glory shall she deliver to thee,</hi> 4. Prov. 4—9. This was the
best Advice that could be given to a young Prince to make
him rich and great; for religious Wisdom will certainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
him beyond all the Politicks of <hi>Machiavel;</hi> and if
<hi>Solomon,</hi> in imitation of his Father <hi>David,</hi> directs his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to his Children, and particularly to that Son who
was to inherit his Throne, as he himself seems to intimate,
1, 2, 3. Verses, we must not conclude, that because he tells
his Son, that Wisdom will make him a glorious Prince, that
therefore Wisdom will advance all men to riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
Wisdom will give a lustre even to poverty it self,
and sometimes advances the poor to riches and honours,
and encreases the riches and honours of the Rich and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;
but we must not always expect this, much less
pretend a promise for it; for there always were, and always
will be, poor wise men.</p>
               <p>Thus when the <hi>Wiseman</hi> tells us, That <hi>the hand of the
diligent maketh rich,</hi> 10. Prov. 4. And <hi>seest thou a man dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in his business, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand
before mean men,</hi> 22. Prov. 29. No man can think, that the
meaning is, that every diligent man shall be rich; for
there are such mean Employments, as can never raise an
Estate by the greatest industry; much less can we think,
that diligence in such mean Employments shall make men
known to Princes; or that all diligent men, whatever their
Employment or Profession be, shall serve Kings: This is
impossible in the nature of the thing, and therefore cannot
be the meaning of these Promises. And yet such kind of
Promises as these, signify a great deal for the encouragement
of Wisdom, and Industry, and Vertue; not that every
wise, and prudent, and diligent man shall be rich and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50615:190"/>
but that every man shall find the rewards of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Vertue proportioned to his capacities and state
of life; and that this is God's way of promoting men,
when he advances them in favour, and good-will to them;
and therefore this is the only way wherein we must expect
the blessing and protection of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But then there are some Promises which are equally
made to all good men, and they are a sure foundation of
our hope and trust, if we be truly good men, in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As that God</hi> will never leave them, nor forsake
them, 13. <hi>Hebr. 5. That he will always take care of them,
as a Father takes care of his Children. That tho he may
not think fit to advance them in the world, yet he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Food and Raiment for them; as our Saviour proves
by many Arguments,</hi> 6. Matth. 25—34. Take no thought
for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet
for your bodies, what ye shall put on; is not the life more than
meat, and the body than raiment? <hi>and will not that God,
who has given us our Lives, and our Bodies, give us what
is absolutely necessary for their support?</hi> Behold the fowls
of the air, they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
barns, yet your heavenly father feedeth them; are ye not much
better than they?—Therefore take no thought, saying,
what shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we
be cloathed? (for after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for
your heavenly father knoweth ye have need of all these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
               <p>This is an absolute Promise, and gives absolute security
to good men; that if they take care to serve God, God will
take care to feed and cloath them, either by blessing their
ordinary prudence and industry, or when that fails, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Providences, by providing for them without
their care or labour, as he feeds the Fowls of the Air, who
neither sow, nor reap: And to name but one Promise more,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:50615:191"/>
which is our security in all conditions; St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us,
<hi>That all things work together for good to them that love God,
8. Rom.</hi> 28. which is such a general security, as is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for an universal hope in God: That though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know in every particular case, what God will do for us,
yet we certainly know, that he will order all things for our
good.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have the Promises of God to trust to; That
God will always take care of us, and in particular, that he
will provide Food and Raiment for us, which is all that he
has absolutely promised to good men, and is all that our
Saviour allows us absolutely to pray for; <hi>Give us this day
our daily bread:</hi> And this, good men, whose faith does not
fail, but against all discouragements trust securely in God's
provision, may ordinarily expect from God, even in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and persecuted state, where Famine it self is not the
persecution; for I dare not extend this so far as to say, that
no good man shall ever die of want; for some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cases are always excepted out of the most general and
absolute Promises relating to this life, and reserved to the
government of the Divine Wisdom. But good men may
have Food and Raiment, and yet be exposed to many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
and sufferings; and therefore for our farther
security we are assured, <hi>That all things shall work together
for good to them that love God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And this brings me to consider, what it is to trust in
God in particular cases, when we have no particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
what God will do for us in such cases, but only a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
assurance of God's care of us, and of the Wisdom,
Justice and Goodness of his Providence. We must particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
trust in God for our daily Provisions, for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
from any present evils which threaten us; for the
success of our undertakings in all the particular Actions and
Concernments of our lives; but what can such a particular
trust mean, or what foundation is there for it, when we
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:50615:191"/>
have no particular promises, that God will protect or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
us in such particular cases? and notwithstanding
God's care of us, and the Justice and Goodness of his
Providence, he may not answer our expectations in
such cases, but may order things quite otherwise than we
desire?</p>
               <p>Now this, I confess, were an unanswerable difficulty,
did a particular trust in God signify a firm belief and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
that God will do that particular thing which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and depend on him for; for no man can have any
reason to believe this, or in this sense to trust in God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an express Promise, or some private Revelation: Now
it is certain, there are no such particular Promises, which
we can with any reason apply to our selves, contained in
Scripture; and private Enthusiasms are a dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
the dreams of Self-love, and the Visions of an heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Imagination.</p>
               <p>I grant, that under the Law there were such particular
Promises, and particular Revelations made to good men,
which were a sure foundation for a particular faith and trust
in God, as to some particular Events; especially as to the
Events of War; which were commonly undertaken by
God's express Command, managed by his Direction, with
a certain promise of success; as is evident in the Wars of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the <hi>Iudges;</hi> and in After-ages God
did the same thing, either by his Oracle of <hi>Vrim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim,</hi> or by his Prophets.</p>
               <p>But there is no such thing among us now; and therefore
such a faith and trust in God we cannot have, nor does God
expect it from us; we have nothing to depend on as to the
certainty of Events, but must trust to that assurance we
have of God's care of us, and of the Wisdom and Goodness
of his Providence, and therefore must consider what trust
and dependence that is which we owe to Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:50615:192"/>
Now to trust Providence, is not to trust in God, that
he will do that particular thing for us which we desire; but
to trust our selves and all our concernments with God, to
do for us in every particular case which we recommend
to his care, what he sees best and fittest for us in such
cases.</p>
               <p>The difference between these two is very plain; and I
think every one will confess, that such a general trust and
affiance in God is a much more excellent vertue, and does
much more honour to the Divine Nature, than merely to
trust his Promise, which secures us of the Event. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on God for the performance of his Promise, does honour
to his Truth and Faithfulness; but to trust God to chuse
our condition for us, to do for us either what we desire, or
what he likes better; argues such an entire dependence on
God, and an absolute resignation to his Will, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
assurance of his Wisdom and Goodness, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
a Creature can express a greater veneration for the
Divine Perfections. I am sure, we do not think, that any
man does us so much honour by taking our word for what
we expresly promise to do for him, as that man does, who
commits all his Concernments with a secure confidence to
our disposal, without knowing what we intend to do.</p>
               <p>But for a more particular explication of this, let us
consider, what this trust in God signifies, and what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
it gives us.</p>
               <p>1. What this trust in God signifies: since it does not
signify an assurance, that God will do what we desire, what
is the meaning of it? Now this signifies,</p>
               <p>1. That all the Good we hope for, or expect, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from God alone; that we have no other reliances and
dependences but only on God: though we justly value the
kindness of our Friends, and the Patronage and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50615:192"/>
of Princes and powerful Favourites, and thank God
when he raises up such Friends and Patrons to us, yet our
entire trust and hope is in God: That since we know that
all Events are in God's hands, we are sure none can help
us but by God's appointment, and we desire to be at the
disposal of none but God; and therefore in Scripture our
trust in God is always opposed to our trust in men, in
Princes, in Human Counsels, Policy, or strength; <hi>It is
better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man; it
is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes,
118.</hi> Psalm 8, 9 <hi>Now know I, that the Lord saveth his
anointed, he will hear him from his holy heaven, with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
strength of his right hand. Some trust in chariots, and
some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord
our God: they are brought down and fallen, but we are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and stand upright,</hi> 20. Psalm 6, 7, 8. All wise men
are greatly satisfied and pleased to see the probable means
and instruments of their safety and defence, because God
ordinarily works by means; but Good men know that
they are but instruments in God's hands, and no Wise man
puts his trust in the instruments, be they never so good,
but in the Workman. Thus much our trust in God must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
signifie, that we have no reliance but only on God,
who is the Supreme Disposer of all things; that we depend
as entirely on him, as if there were no second and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Causes, which are to be employed and used, but
not to be the final Objects of our trust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Our trust in God signifies our absolute dependence
on the Wisdom, Power, and Goodness of God to take
care of us: It is a committing our selves to God, putting
our selves absolutely into his hands, with a full persuasion
that he will do what we desire, or do what shall be better
for us; that he will answer our requests, or deny them
with greater Wisdom and Goodness than he could grant
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:50615:193"/>
All men must grant that this is a perfect trust in God,
and such a trust and dependence as we owe to Providence;
for if God Govern the World, and take care of all his
Creatures with infinite Wisdom and Goodness, does it not
become all reasonable Creatures to give up themselves se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
to the Government of Providence? If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that infinite Wisdom and Goodness takes care of us,
what need we know any more? Would we desire any
thing else, or can we wish for any thing better than what
infinite Wisdom and Goodness can do for us? or would we
have any thing which infinite Wisdom and Goodness does
not think fit to give us?</p>
               <p>This indeed does not give us that security which some
men desire, that we shall never suffer those particular
evils which we fear, and which we see coming upon us;
or that we shall obtain some other blessings which we are
passionately fond of; but it gives us a much better security
than this, that we shall have always what is good for us;
which is more than we can promise our selves, should God
always grant our own desires.</p>
               <p>This gives us a most profound rest and peace of mind,
delivers us from all careful and solicitous thoughts for times
to come, which are many times more terrible than the
evils we fear; it teaches us to do our Duty with the best
prudence and industry we can, but to leave all Events to
God's disposal; to make known our requests to God, and
<hi>to cast all our care upon him, for he careth for us.</hi> It will not
make us wholly unconcerned and indifferent whatever
happens, because the natures of things are not equal or
alike indifferent; Riches and Poverty, Health or Sickness,
Honour or Disgrace, War or Peace, Plenty or Famine,
cannot be alike indifferent to any man who has his senses
about him; but it will make us quiet and patient under all
Events, and help us to bear the most adverse Fortune with
such an unbroken greatness of mind, as is natural to a firm
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:50615:193"/>
and stedfast Trust and Hope in God. This is properly to
trust Providence, not to trust that God will do every thing
for us which we desire, which is to command and govern,
or at least to direct Providence, not to trust it; but to live
securely under the Care and Protection of God, without
disturbing our selves with unknown and future events, in
a confident assurance that we are safe and happy in God's
hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Tho our Trust in God does not signify an absolute
security what God will do for us, yet it is the most certain
way to obtain whatever we wisely and reasonably desire
of God: When we trust in God, he reserves to himself a
liberty to judge whether it be good for us; but if what we
desire be good for us, our trust and dependence on God
will engage Providence on our side.</p>
               <p>Trust in God refers our Causes to him to judge for us,
and to do what he sees fit; and we have God's Word and
Promise for it, That if we do trust in him, he will take
care of us, that we shall want nothing that is good, and
shall be delivered from all evil; 31. <hi>Psal. 21, 22. O how
plentiful is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that
fear thee, and that thou hast prepared for them that put their
trust in thee before the sons of men; thou shalt hide them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
by thy own presence, from the provoking of all men; thou
shalt keep them secretly in thy Tabernacle from the strife of
tongues.</hi> Thus 37. Psal. 40, 41. <hi>The salvation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
cometh of the Lord, who is also their strength in the
time of trouble. And the Lord shall stand by them and save
them, he shall deliver them from the ungodly, and shall save
them because they put their trust in him.</hi> The whole 91 <hi>st.
Psalm</hi> is so plain and full a proof of this, that I need
name no more: To trust in God, is called <hi>dwelling in the
secret place of the most high,</hi> or under the <hi>defence</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of <hi>the most high;</hi> that is, such a man puts himself
under God's protection, and he that does so, <hi>shall abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50615:194"/>
the shadow of the Almighty;</hi> that is, <hi>he shall defend thee
under his wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers; his
faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler:</hi> And the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> particularly reckons up most of the evils which
are incident to human life, and promises security against
them all; <hi>Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,
even the most high, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall
thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</hi> This
Psalm indeed is a Prophecy of our Saviour, and in the
height and latitude of the expressions is applicable only to
him, but yet it gives a general security to all who trust in
God, of Protection from all evil. This no man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himself, who does not trust in God; for how is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
concerned for them who expect nothing from it?
Nay, this is a reason why such men should be disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fall into misery, to convince them that God does
govern the world, and that no human Strength or Policy
can save them: But Trust in God makes us the Subjects
and the Care of Providence; for if God does govern the
world, none so much deserve his Protection, as those who
commit themselves to his Care. A Good Man will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or forsake those who depend on him, much less will
a Good God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another Duty we own to Providence, is Prayer;
to ask of God all those Blessings and Mercies which we
need. The universal practice of all Nations who owned
a God, and that Natural Impulse all men find to seek to God
in their distress, shews what the sense of Nature is; but
yet some of the Ancient Philosophers were much puzzled
how to reconcile Prayer with their Notions of Necessity
and Fate: and indeed, were Providence nothing else but
a Necessary Chain of Causes, or Fixt and Immutable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
there would be no great Encouragement to Pray to
God, who upon this supposition cannot help us, no more
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:50615:194"/>
than he can alter Destiny and Fate: but if God governs
the world with as great Liberty and Freedom as a wise
and good man governs his Family, or a Prince governs
his Kingdoms, there is as much reason to pray to God, as
to offer up our Petitions to our Parents, or to our Prince;
for if we must receive all from God, what imaginable
reason is there, that we should not ask every thing of
him.</p>
               <p>But it will be necessary to discourse this matter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;
for we live in an Age wherein men are very
apt to reason themselves out of all Religion, and to form
such Notions of God and his Providence, as make it
needless, nay, absurd, to worship him.</p>
               <p>The Apostle tells us, That <hi>he that cometh to God, must
believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
seek him, 11. Heb.</hi> 6. No man can be a devout
Worshipper of God, who does not believe that there is a
God to worship, and that this God does take care of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and that he has a peculiar Favour for those who
worship him; that he is <hi>a Rewarder of them that diligently
seek him:</hi> For if God neither take any care of us, or take
no more care of those who worship him, than of those
who do not, there is no just reason can be given, why any
man should worship him. But the Apostle in this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
That to believe there is a God, and that he governs
the world, and that we shall be the better for worshipping,
is a reasonable Foundation for Religious Worship; and
therefore such Notions of God and his Providence, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no peculiar Rewards and Benefits to Worshippers,
are certainly False, how Philosophical soever they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and Impious too, because they shut all Religious
Worship out of the world.</p>
               <p>And yet some men can by no means understand
for what reason they should pray to God: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the Superstitious Customs of the Countrey,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:50615:195"/>
to avoid Scandal and Publick Censure, but think they
might as well let it alone, as for any advantage they hope
for by their Prayers: And I am very much of their mind,
that they had as good not be present at Prayers, as not to
pray; for no man can pray to any advantage, who despises
Prayer: It will therefore be highly necessary plainly to
state this matter, and to shew you,</p>
               <p>That the belief of the Divine Providence lays the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Obligation on us to pray to God.</p>
               <p>The Scripture-Proofs of this are so plain, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be avoided; and so well known, that I need not at
large repeat them. There is no Duty we are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded, none we are more earnestly exhorted to,
than to pray to God; we have the Examples of all good
men for it, and of Christ himself, who spent whole nights
in Prayer; and we have the encouragement of as express
Promises as any in Scripture, That if we pray to God, he
will hear and answer us; which is all the Encouragement
we can desire for our Prayers. As the Psalmist speaks; <hi>O
thou that hearest prayers, unto thee shall all flesh come,</hi> 65. Psal. 2.
To thee they shall pray, because thou hearest Prayers.
<hi>For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous
in mercy to all them that call upon thee. In the day of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will I call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me,</hi> 86. Psal. 5, 7.
<hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of them that
fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them,
145. Psal.</hi> 18, 19. But nothing can be more express than
our Saviour's Promise; <hi>Ask, and it shall be given unto you;
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened, 7. Matt.
7,</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And what great things are attributed in Scripture to the
Power of Prayer? St. <hi>Iames</hi> assures us, That <hi>the effectual
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50615:195"/>
fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much;</hi> and
proves it from the Example of <hi>Elias,</hi> who <hi>was a man subject
to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might
not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the space of three
years and six months; and he prayed again, and the heavens
gave rain, and the earth brought forth fruit,</hi> 5. James 17, 18.
And all those Wonders which the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
attributes to Faith, belong to this Prayer of Faith, 11. <hi>Heb.
32,</hi> 33, 34. For this reason <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Name was changed into
<hi>Israel,</hi> when he wrestled all night with the Angel, and
would not let him go, till he had blessed him; <hi>Thy name
shall be called no more Iacob, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou
power with God and men, and hast prevailed,</hi> 32. Gen. 28.</p>
               <p>One would think that this were abundantly sufficient to
convince all men of the Duty, Necessity, and Advantages
of Prayer; for if God govern the world, and we must
expect his Blessing and Protection only in answer to our
Prayers; if he himself makes Prayer the necessary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our receiving, it is in vain to dispute the Philosophy
of it, for we must ask, if we will receive. We can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of none but God, and he has promised to give to none
but those who ask; and therefore tho we may receive many
good things without asking, as God does good both to the
evil and to the good, yet we can never be secure that we
shall receive; and the good things we do receive without
asking, seldom prove Blessings to us, and as seldom lasting.</p>
               <p>But to satisfy these men, if it be possible, in the Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
and Necessity of this Duty, and to give them a
true Notion of Prayer, let us briefly consider their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against it. And the sum of all is this, That they
cannot conceive how our Prayers should signify any thing
with God, or obtain any Blessings for us, which he would
not have bestowed on us without our asking. To be good
and vertuous, they will allow is necessary to entitle us to
the Favour and Protection of Providence; and there is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:50615:196"/>
reason to believe, that God will do good to good men,
whether they ask or not; but they cannot see for what
wise ends Prayer serves, or how it should be any reason
for God to give. Does not God know our wants before
we ask? Or does he need to be informed by our Prayers,
what we would have him do for us? Are not our Wants,
and his own Essential Goodness, a sufficient Motive for
him to give? Or does he want to be intreated and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned?
Which would argue a want of Goodness. In
short, Can God be moved and changed by our Prayers, to
alter his Counsels, to do that good for us which otherwise
he would not have done, or to divert those evils which he
intended to have brought on us? Which represents God as
changeable as man, and derogates from the Immutability
of his Nature and Counsels.</p>
               <p>Now in answer to this, let us consider in the first place,
Whether these Objections do not prove too much? That
is, Whether they do not equally destroy the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of making any Prayers or Petitions to Men, as well as
to God?</p>
               <p>There is a great difference indeed upon this account,
that good men may be ignorant of our wants, and may
need to be informed; but is this the only reason of asking,
to inform men of our wants? Does any good man think
himself bound, tho he know our wants, to supply them
without our asking? Do we think it any diminution to
any man's goodness, that he will not give, unless he be
asked? Good men, indeed, do a great many good offices
without being asked, and so does a good God; but in
most cases they think it very reasonable to be asked, and
that it is Pride and Stomach not to ask, and that is reason
enough not to give. It does not become some men to ask,
when it may become others to give; for it requires some
Interest, and some pretence to Favour and Kindness, to
have a right to ask; but all men expect, that those who
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50615:196"/>
depend on them, and know that they may have for asking,
should ask for what they want: Parents expect this from
their Children, and a Prince from his Subjects; and will
see their wants, and let them want on, till they think fit
to ask: And if wise and good men expect this from their
dependants, a Wise and Good God may as reasonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
this from his Creatures, who have their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on him: For let any man shew me the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
if it be consistent with Wisdom and Goodness to
expect to be asked, why may not a Wise and Good God
expect this, as well as a Wise and Good Man?</p>
               <p>Thus as changeable as men are in their Wills, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and Passions, Do we use to charge any man with
fickleness and inconstancy, only because he gives when he
is ask'd, and will not give when he is not asked? That is,
does it prove any man to be mutable, to change only as a
Wise and Immutable Rule requires him to change? Such
uniform and regular changes as these, prove an Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Counsels; and if this be the standing Rule of
Providence, it argues no more change in God to give when
we ask, and not to give when we do not ask, than it is to
punish a man when he is wicked, and to reward him when
he is good.</p>
               <p>The Passions and Affections of Human Nature are the
most fickle and inconstant things; and when they move
mechanically by external and sensible impressions, either
against Reason, or at least without it, they betray men to
that uneveness and uncertainty in all their actions, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages
both their Wisdom and Goodness; for when they
do good by such blind Impulses, and strong and heady Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
they do good by Chance; and another Torrent of
different Passions may do as much hurt.</p>
               <p>But yet it is no disparagement to the Immutability of
Wisdom and Goodness, to be moved by Passions, when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and not mere sense moves them; for Reason is an even
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:50615:197"/>
and steddy Mover. To say that a man's Passions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are moved by Reason to do that which he never
intended to have done without that Reason, does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become
the wisest and best man in the world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to say, that a good man is moved by Prayers, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
and Complaints, to pity and compassion, and to
do good, contrary to his former intentions and inclinations,
is no Reproach to him.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any Reproach to the Divine Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
to say, That God is moved by our Prayers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
to do that for us, which otherwise he would not
have done; for it neither unbecomes God nor men to be
moved by Reason. We live in a Critical Age, which will
not allow us to speak intelligibly of God, because we want
words sufficiently to distinguish between the Motions and
Actings of the Divine Mind, and the Passions of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Our Conceptions of the Divine Nature are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and so must our words necessarily be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless you will venture the Censure of some men,
who conceal their Atheism under a Religious Silence and
Veneration, and will not allow any thing to be said or
thought of God, for fear of thinking and speaking disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
of him; you must not say that God hears or sees,
because he has no bodily ears or eyes; or that there are any
such Affections in God as Love or Hatred, Joy or Sorrow,
Anger or Repentance, Pity and Compassion, because those
sensible Commotions which accompany these Passions in
men, are not incident to the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>But if the Scripture be a good Rule both of believing
and speaking, we may very honourably say that of God,
which God says of himself, and believe that all these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are in God, in such a perfect and excellent manner
as becomes an Infinite and Eternal Mind. Some men
think, that the Scripture's attributing Love, and Joy, and
Delight, Hatred, Sorrow, and Compassion, to God, is
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50615:197"/>
no better reason to ascribe such affections to him, than it
is to say, that God has bodily Eyes, and Ears, and Feet,
and Hands, because the Scripture attributes them also to
God: But there is a wide difference between these two;
for the Scripture has taken sufficient care to inform us,
that God is an infinite and unbodied Spirit, without Shape
or Figure, and that is reason to believe, that these are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allusive and metaphorical Expressions, which represent
the Powers by the Instruments of the Action; seeing by
Eyes, and hearing by Ears; but these affections, which
are attributed to God, are not Instruments, but Powers,
and are as essential to a Mind, as Wisdom and Knowledge.
A pure Mind must have pure and intellectual Affections,
which move with greater strength and certainty, though
without the disturbance of humane Passions. It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to conceive a Mind without Wisdom and Knowledge,
or to conceive Wisdom and Knowledge without an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Approbation and Abhorrence; for perfect Wisdom
must approve and disapprove; and the several ways of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
or disapproving, constitute the several Passions
and Affections of the Soul, and therefore these must be as
perfect in God as Wisdom is, though as void of sensible
passions, as a pure Spirit is.</p>
               <p>Now, if God have such Affections as these, which may
be moved in a manner suitable to the Divine Perfections,
then Prayer may move him, and prevail with him to
shew Mercy and Kindness: Thus the Scripture represents
it; and without such a representation as this, there can be
no reason, nor foundation for Prayer.</p>
               <p>Not to shew you this in particular, how God has been
moved by the Intercessions of Good men to change his
Counsels, and to spare those whom he had threatned to
destroy, of which we have a famous Example in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of <hi>Moses</hi> for <hi>Israel,</hi> when they had made the
Golden Calf, and worshipped it, <hi>32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exod.</hi> 9, 10, &amp;c.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50615:198"/>
Of which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>He said he would destroy
them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,
to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</hi> 106. Psal.
23. I say, not to insist on such Examples now, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe, that most of our Saviour's Arguments and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
whereby he encourageth our Faith in Prayer, are
resolved into this principle, That God is moved by our
Prayers in some Analogy and Proportion as men are; that
whatever effect of our Prayers we may reasonably expect
from Wise, and Kind, and Good men, that we may more
certainly expect from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Saviour promises, 7. Matth.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. Ask, and
it shall be given unto you: seek, and ye shall find: knock, and
it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth:
and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it shall be opened. <hi>This is as full a promise as can be
made; and yet for their greater security, he proves to their
own sense and feeling, that it needs must be so: We
know and feel what the natural Kindness and Tenderness
of Earthly Parents is for their Children, how ready they
are to answer all their reasonable requests, especially when
it is for the supply of their necessary wants; and thus he
assures us it is with God, and much more, because there
is no comparison between the Kindness and Tenderness of
Earthly Parents, and the Goodness of God.</hi> What man
is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him
a stone? Or if he ask fish, will he give him a serpent? If
you then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven,
give good things to them that ask him?</p>
               <p>Thus our Saviour represents the power of importunity
by the parable of a man, who came to his Friends to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
some Bread of him when he was a bed, which was
so unseasonable a time, as made it troublesome and uneasy;
but tho meer Friendship could not prevail with him to do
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50615:198"/>
it, importunity did, 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. &amp;c. and by the parable of
the importunate Widow, and the unjust Judge, who tho
he had no regard to Justice, yet was conquered by her
importunity, to avenge her of her Enemy; <hi>And shall not
God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him,
tho he bear long with them?</hi> 18. Luke 2. &amp;c. If impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
will prevail, where neither Friendship, nor the
love of Justice will prevail, how much more will
it prevail with a Good, and Merciful, and Righteous
God?</p>
               <p>Indeed most of our Saviour's Parables proceed upon
that likeness and resemblance which is between Human
Passions, and the Affections of the Divine Nature, that
we may certainly expect that from God, which we can
reasonably expect from Wise and Good men in the like
cases; what either Friendship, or a love of Virtue, or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Affections, or Interest; and Relation, and Private
Concernment will do, that God will do for us, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the Parables of the Lost Sheep, and Lost Groat,
and Prodigal Son, which could have no foundation, were
not God in some analogy moved as men are: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our Saviour intended we should understand it so,
when he makes it the reason of our Faith and Hope in
Prayer: And if it be thus, we see the reason and necessity
of Prayer, and know how to pray to God, so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail;
to pray to God, as we would in the like cases ask of
men, with the same Importunity, Ardour, Vehemence,
Sorrow and Contrition, Trust and Dependence; for what
will prevail with men, will much more prevail with
God.</p>
               <p>And indeed, there are very wise reasons, why God
should make Prayer the necessary Condition of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving:
as, that his Power and Providence may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
owned and acknowledged by Mankind; That we
may live in a constant dependence on him, and be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50615:199"/>
that all we receive is his gift; to lay restraints upon
mens ungoverned Lusts and Appetites, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expect success without Prayer; and therefore may
never dare attempt any thing for which they dare not
pray.</p>
               <p>These are wise Reasons, why God should not give, unless
we ask; and therefore if we believe that God governs
the World, it is our Interest as well as our Duty to pray
to him; for we have no Title to his Protection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. Let us then in all Conditions make our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and hearty Prayers and Supplications to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
our Selves, and all our Concernments to him.
I say, in all Conditions, because God has the Supreme
and Soveraign disposal of all. There are too many who
think, that when all things are prosperous, when they
have Goods laid up for many years, when they have
Powerful Friends, and their Enemies at their feet, that
there is no great need then to pray to God, because they
do not want Him. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> himself was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a prosperous Fortune to great security; <hi>In my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
I said, I shall never be moved.</hi> But God quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced him, that his security did not consist in
External Supports, but in the Divine Favour; <hi>Lord,
by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong;
thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> 30. Psalm
6, 7. No man is safe but in God's Protection; there
are a thousand unseen Accidents, and surprising Events,
which may disappoint all other hope and confidence;
but <hi>they that trust in the Lord, shall be as Mount Zion,
which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever: as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are round about Ierusalem, so the Lord is round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his people, henceforth for ever and ever,</hi> 125. Psalm
1, 2.</p>
               <p>Others think it to as little purpose to pray, when their
Condition is desperate and hopeless; when they can't see
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:50615:199"/>
how God can save them without a Miracle, and Miracles
they must not hope for. But what is it that God can't do,
who has all Nature at his command? We must not indeed
expect Miracles; but he who has the Absolute Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Natural and Moral World, can do what he
pleases, without Miracles: Nothing is impossible to God,
and nothing is impossible to him that believes, who prays
to God in Faith and Hope.</p>
               <p>Nay, the Example of our Saviour teacheth us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than this; That tho we were as certain that
God would not deliver us from what we fear, as he was
that it was appointed for him by God's Immutable Decree
and Counsel, to dye upon the Cross; yet it is not in vain
to pray as he did, <hi>O my father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
And the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, That tho God did
not deliver him from death, yet he heard and answered his
Prayers: <hi>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up
prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, unto
him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in
that he feared,</hi> 5. Heb. 7. That is, tho God did not deliver
him from Death, he delivered him from his Fears, sent an
Angel to comfort him, and enabled him to endure the
Pain, and to despise the Shame of the Cross. And tho
God should in like manner afflict us, or we should have
great reason to believe he will do so; yet, if in answer to
our Prayers and Cries he should pull out the Sting of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and sweeten them with Divine Comforts, and
some unexpected Allays, and give us Courage and Patience
to bear them, it is equivalent to a Deliveranee, and usually
better for us than to have been delivered; for when God
inflicts such Punishments on us, even when he mercifully
hears our Prayers and Cries, we may be sure that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it for some great good to us; and to reap the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Afflictions, without feeling the Sting of them,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:50615:200"/>
is better than to be delivered from them; this is to be
<hi>heard in what we fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may satisfy us as to the Necessity and Obligation
of this Duty of Prayer; and what great Reason and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
we have in all conditions to pray to God. But
we must remember, That Praise and Thanksgiving is as
essential a part of the Divine Worship, and as much due
to God's Care and Providence over us, as Prayer is.</p>
               <p>I need not enlarge on this, because all Mankind acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it a duty to praise our Benefactors, which is only to
acknowledg from whom we have received the good things
we have: And if God be the Giver of all good things to
us, Can we do less than acknowledge that we receive all
from God? The whole Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> is full of Examples
of this kind; and there is so little need to prove this to be a
Duty, that every man who is sensible of any Kindness
that is done him, can no more avoid thanking his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
than rejoicing in the benefit he has received. It is
not only matter of Duty, but of Necessity to do it, till
men have put off Human Nature, and lost the sensations
of it.</p>
               <p>We must not indeed conceive so meanly of God, as if
he were charmed with the Praises of his Creatures, as some
vain men are with Popular Applause: A Wise man is
above this; much more God: A man who knows himself,
thinks neither the better nor worse of himself for Popular
Praise, or Reproach: Praise is due to Vertue; but if it
miss of it, the World may suffer by it, not the Vertuous
man, if he have that command of his Passions and Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as a Wise and Good man ought to have. Praise is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the good opinion of other men concerning
us; and Reproach their ill opinion; and if they be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in their opinions, they make us neither better nor
worse, unless we make our selves so; but the World may
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:50615:200"/>
suffer by it; for a Good man when he is unjustly reproached,
tho he may support himself with a sense of his Innocence
and Vertue, yet he loses the Pleasure and Freedom of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
the Authority of his Example and Counsels,
and many Advantages and Opportunities of doing good.</p>
               <p>To apply this to God: I need not prove, that so Glorious
and Perfect a Being is infinitely above our Praises; that
we can add nothing to Him by our most Triumphant
Hymns and Hallelujahs, any otherwise than as He sees it
infinitely reasonable and congruous for the happiness of
Creatures, and a great instrument of Providence that they
should Praise him: God suffers nothing by it, if we refuse
to Praise him; but we do, and the World does; and he
has no other satisfaction in it, than to see his Creatures
do what becomes them, and what will make them happy.</p>
               <p>All the Blessings we receive from God, especially such
as concern this Life, lose their true Taste and Relish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Praise. To Contemplate and Adore the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness, which encompasses the whole Creation,
and Dispenses His Favours with a liberal hand, is a more
transporting pleasure than all the enjoyments of the World
can give us. Here is a noble exercise of Love, and Joy, and
Admiration, which are the most delightful Passions of the
Soul, and as far above the pleasures of Sense, as a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
a Beast. This makes us feel our selves happy, not
only in what we at present have, which, if we look no
farther than intermediate Causes, is very uncertain; but
in a secure prospect of Happiness while we adhere to God.
A Soul which is ravish'd with the Praises of God, and
possessed with a lively Sense of his Goodness, can fear no
Evil, is out of the reach of solicitous cares; is contented
in every condition as allotted him by God; nay, is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
under Sufferings themselves, which are the Corrections
or Discipline of a kind Father: He considers how much
good he receives from God, and how far it exceeds all the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:50615:201"/>
Evils he suffers; and therefore he has reason to bless God
still, as <hi>Iob</hi> did; for <hi>shall we receive good from the hand of
God, and shall we not receive evil?</hi> especially when the good
we receive, proves the very evils we suffer to be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are inflicted by a good God.</p>
               <p>All these Graces and Vertues are owing to the belief of
a Divine Providence, and cannot be had without it; they
belong to that Submission to God, and trust in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which I have already explained; but it is Praise
and Thanksgiving which awakens that vigorous Sense of
God, which exercises all these Vertues, and gives us the ease
and satisfaction of them.</p>
               <p>Thus when God loses his Praise, we lose the ease and
security of our Lives: But this is not all; for the World
also in a great measure loses the benefit and advantage of
God's Government, which as much disappoints the wise
designs of Providence.</p>
               <p>Not to own our Benefactor, is to lose the sense of our
dependence, which makes all the Goodness of God lost on
Sinners; for the Goodness of God cannot affect any man,
cannot lead him to repentance, can be no reason, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Vertue, if it be not owned.</p>
               <p>This spoils the very Blessings, which God bestows on
us, which we shall never use to our own happiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
owning and praising the Giver of them. He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
that he receives all from God, and is affected
with the Divine Goodness and Bounty in giving, will use
the good things he receives, according to the mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Giver; and this is the only way to enjoy the
benefit of the gift.</p>
               <p>God does not give men riches meerly to look on, or to
imprison, or to spend on their Lusts; nor advance them
to Honours, to make them proud and insolent; nor give
them a large Portion of This World to make them forget
the Next; he who is thankful to God for all his Blessings,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:50615:201"/>
cannot do this; for this is the highest ingratitude to
affront and provoke God with the abuse of what he gives;
and he who does thus, loses the Blessing, though he has the
Gift. A Covetous man is never the better for his Riches,
because he cannot use them; and a Voluptuous man is
much the worse, because he uses them to his own hurt.
When high Places and Dignities make men Proud and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,
it forfeits the Honour of them; and he who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
and by forgetting loses the next World, has a very
hard purchase of this.</p>
               <p>Nay, such men do not only disappoint God's Goodness
to themselves, but frustrate the gracious designs of his
Providence in making them the Instruments and Ministers
of his Goodness to others. For those who take no notice
of the Divine Providence, but are very unthankful to
God for what they have, are so far from doing any good,
that they generally do great mischief to others, as well as
to themselves.</p>
               <p>Those who are sensible that they receive all from God,
and are thankful for it, remember that they are but God's
Stewards; which is a great Honour, but a great Trust
too, and requires Faithfulness; in thankfulness to God
who has so liberally provided for them, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to imitate his Goodness, to supply the Wants,
and undertake the Patronage of those who want their
help, and in the judgment of Prudence and Charity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it.</p>
               <p>But an unthankful man has no more regard to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creatures then he has to God; a Covetous man,
who will not supply his own wants, to be sure will not
relieve the wants of others; and if a Voluptuous man
does any kindness, the receivers pay dear for it; for he
makes them the partners or instruments of his lusts. A
Rich Sinner helps to Debauch a whole Neighbourhood,
and a powerful Sinner to Oppress them; and the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:50615:202"/>
of the World tells us, what mischief Riches, and
Honour, and Power, do in the hands of Wicked and
Unthankful men.</p>
               <p>This I think may satisfie any considering man in the
absolute necessity of Praise and Thanksgiving, which is
not only such an acknowledgment of the Divine Glory
as becomes Creatures, but is necessary to our own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to our wise improvement of the Blessings of God,
and to the good Government of the World; and all men
must confess, that this is a Wise and Just reason for God
to recal his Gifts, to take away what he had given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
men, and to give them no more, not only because
they disown their Benefactor, but because they abuse all
that he gives them to their own, and to other mens hurt:
All that he gives is lost on them; He loses the Praise, and
they themselves, and every body else the comfort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it.</p>
               <p>And thus I have finished this Discourse of Providence;
whereby I hope it will appear, that there are great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to believe a Providence, that the Objections against it
are Ignorant Mistakes; and that nothing tends so much
to the Ease and Comfort, and good Government of our
Lives, as to acknowledge God to be the Supreme and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord of the World.</p>
