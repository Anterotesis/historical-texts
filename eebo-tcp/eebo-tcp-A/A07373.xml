            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2839:6"/>
compared to their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes in the Sunne; For, as the bodies shadow is at Morning before vs, at Noone beside vs, and at Night behinde vs; so is earthly glory, at Morning or in the prime before vs, in a goodly lustre; at Noone or in the full, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides vs, in a violent heat; at Night or in the wane, behinde vs, in a neglected pitty. The difference is amongst some, that at Noone, or in the Meridian of their greatnes, in stead of hauing their glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side them, they are beside their glory. But such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2839:6"/>
are rather strangers to the bloud of Vertue, then any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the spirit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Noblenes. But so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled are the grounds of frailties courses, as here is yet not the totall sum of being miserable. If men could as well frame their mindes to their change of fortunes, as their change of misfortunes doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their mindes, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse would as truely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come calamitie, as the base doe reioyce in being great. Heereunto not the outward actions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the inward remper
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2839:7"/>
of the minde must be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, since the first are but hand-maides to the latter. Euen as one lying in the bed of visitation &amp; death, doth not therefore die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is sicke, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he liues (for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation of life is death, not sicknesse) so the minde of man diuided by the consumption and disease of humor, being touched with affliction, is not therefore miserable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it suffers misery, but because it hath once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted (and bin lifted vp to) happinesse.</p>

               <hi>The Golden Meane,</hi> so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2839:7"/>
aunciently commended, is onely there perfectly obserued, where true Wisedome and true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie are the speciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of a prepared minde: In which, if those two meet, is figuratiuely included an allusion to the Sea: which, though clouds raine downe into it waters from aboue, and waters send flouds here beneath, yet doth it retayne all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without Iosse of salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or any shew of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing: The minde of a Wise and Noble man is such, that what or how many gusts and tides of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2839:8"/>
aduersity assault him, they may at all times rather arme, then at any time op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse him, since his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution cannot ouerflow with the rudenesse of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for that his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and refyned tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature will euer retaine the salt of iudgement and moderation; the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a <hi>Wise,</hi> the other a <hi>Noble</hi> man.</p>
            <p>In sorrowes or aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities nothing is so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as feare it selfe; which pashion of weakenesse is so below the heart of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that a minde trained vp in the exercises of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2839:8"/>
cannot as much as let fall one looke to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. If it be inquired what it is, or to what vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ende, either of ease or pollicy, it may be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? in the first will be found little lesse then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate basenesse; in the latter nothing more then an vngrounded desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. A man in the float of prosperitie to feare that he may fall, argues both the distrust of his owne merite, or the danger of his disposition. A man in the ebbe of his plenty, to feare a worse mischiefe then that of being poore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2839:9"/>
or despised, argues both his vnworthinesse in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, &amp; his impatiencie in bearing his fortune.</p>
            <p>Feare with hope, is the readie witnesse of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senesse: Feare without hope, the proclaimer of folly. And if there can be any miserie superlatiue, or if it were possible that there could be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame in measure, it is in the feare of those twaine; yet doubtlesse the heauiest of the two torments is to feare without hope. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which, to a minde Noble &amp; vertuous, are so much a stranger, as there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2839:9"/>
cannot be found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretor, who to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable resolution can inforce either the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or vnderstanding thereof For it is as meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible for a great and excellent spirit to conceiue thoughts ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to basenesse, as for the base to apprehend the singular designes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Noble minded. Soone then it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued; that the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene a worthy and a seruile person, must be rather sound out in the qualitie of their mindes, then the command of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2839:10"/>
and complement. In which it is also further to be obserued, that in the composition of their mindes, there is as great and exquisite choise to be made, aswel how as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the excellency of such a composition must bee remarked. The seruile weakenes of such, whose education, nature, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and wisedome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claime any prioritie in desert, is so great, as it onely shewes that it dista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not calamitie, so long as it is full fed with the happinesse of plenty and ease.

            <p>Another effectuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to the building of this excellent worke of a resolued and prepared minde, is euen in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to be thought on. For if there be no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in VVealth, in Honour, in Soueraignty (in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whom, chiefely, if not onely, resteth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice of an earthly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) much lesse assurance may be dream't of in any inferiour pleasures: for which a wiseman (who is the true Nobleman) ought
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2839:14"/>
thus to resolue, that he is not lord of his owne mind who is vndaunted, as long as his fortunes are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to his will: but when he is cast downe, or rather cast away in his hopes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in his expectation, set below his owne heart, vnfriended, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of vncomforting pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Hee then who now witnesseth by his modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in those sadnesses, the courage of his Noblenesse, by the Noblenesse of his VVisedome, is both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wise in being so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and as perfectly couragious in beeing so

noble. It was well said of one, that <hi>A calme Sea and a faire VVinde proues not a Sailers skill.</hi> A sure Pilot is proued in a doubtfull storme, and a wise noble minde is truely tried in the storme of aduersitie, not in the calme of felicitie. Fortune enuies nothing more then a setled and well gouerned resolution; and such a Marriner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues remembrance to posteritie, who in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke dies, imbracing the Maste, rather then hee who faintly for feare of drowning leapes into the Sea.</p>

Lastly, if neither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the instabilitie of humane endowments, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the regard of honor, being prone to fall, nor the vnstaidnesse of Kingdomes (the Scepter beeing the highest flight of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) cannot imprint in the minde an abandoning of itselfe, by reputing earthly delights and acquisitions to be in their owne nature, as in their owne nature they are, passable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine; yet may the sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of paying a debt (which cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) to death, be a mayne and singular motiue to a

noble and wise man, for sufferance of all changes of conditions and estates, with the sweetely-vnited blessings, <hi>Iudgement</hi> and <hi>content.</hi> He that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that hee liues a life, cannot but forethinke that hee must dye a death: If hee looke into what life it selfe is, hee shall finde (by experience of the past, and proofe of the present age) that it is none other but a iourney to death. If a man examine the scope of his owne desires, they will fall out to be a desiring to hasten to his graue Death and the graue (two tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

of the Philosopher, who hearing of his Sonnes death said: <hi>When I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him I well knew hee should dye:</hi> and who would be so ignorant as not to confesse that whosoeuer is brought out of the wombe is destined also to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of the earth?

            </p>
            <p>It is many times seene that those who leade their liues according to the measure of their will and power, doe not measure their will and power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the frailtie of their liues; yet certainely they lead an euill life who are still beginning to liue, for that life is euer vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which hath learned but the first onely rule to goodnesse: certaine other,

then chiefly begin to liue when they are certaine to end the race of so liuing by death; and some also there are, who end their liues before they can well be said to haue begunne to liue.</p>
            <p>Most men subiect to those vnhappinesses, like things floating on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe not goe, but are carried; not the counsell of prouidence directs their steps to goe by the staffe of discretion, but they are wholly rather carried by the violent streame of opinion and conceit, precisely termed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2839:24"/>
Humour. To vnmaske the vizour that hides the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of this customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vilenesse, much guilt is to be laid on the change of the times, or indeed on the change of men in the times. For, whiles the World was yet in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, neither was such plenty of temptation to inuite, neither was vanity so plentifull to tempt the happinesse of that age to the miseries of this: But as dayes grow more num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berles in number, so men in those dayes waxed more irregular in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: which irregularitie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2839:25"/>
of manners, increased by the deprauation of reason in men of all conditions; in fooles euer, in the wise often; for euen the wise do themselues, not seldom suffer an eclipse of reason.</p>
            <p>The difference that is, is for that such a defect proceeds rather out of the firmitie of Nature, then out of any subiection of the minde: for, where the minde is subiected to the grossenes of errour, there doth the man so for the time (so subiected) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the course of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which like a fixed Starre should (how soeuer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2839:25"/>
the heauens moue) be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, and vnmoued in the Center of his place; and such as so is, is truely said to be true <hi>Noblenesse,</hi> true <hi>Vertue,</hi> true <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Euen as one that is to frame a goodly building on a delightfull plot of ground, doth first proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently forecast aswell of the hazards and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that may come, as the charge which daily must come. Amongst which must principally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, the title of the right, and what claime may belayd thereto, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2839:26"/>
what meanes may be vsed to remoue that claime. Then the necessitie of prouision, the casuall change of weather, the wearinesse of working; for all which, if interaccidents of extremity should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen remedies for the same must be thought on. So a man in his minde wisely resolued to the building of this excellent frame of the <hi>Golden Meane,</hi> on the plot of a prepared resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must endeuour to prouide cures against the fates of extremitie.

            <p>Hath this secret mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe displaced any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertfull fauorite of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the fauour royall? assuredly hee hath little cause to distaste it any thing, or to be moued from the commendation of a resolued minde, that as hee shall by tempering his disgrace vvith suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

            <p>It is better to be enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then pittied: pitty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out of a cold cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: enuie out of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of qualitie against the vertuous: If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected that the losse of a Princes fauour, through the instigation of some enuious opposite, hath

most cause to afflict a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde, in that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie hath preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may be answered with the same reason. That such an enemy cannot be said to preuaile, who fights with the weapons of a dishonourable treachery; and what greater triumph or conquest can a Wise or a Noble man wish to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, then to torment his aduersary with the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his vertue?

but <hi>enuy.</hi> But the Princes fauour is by this meanes lost? So is a Noble mans selfe-worthinesse by the same meanes found: and it is a greater blemish to the iudgement of a Prince so traduced, not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the particulars why he doth reiect a worthy subiect, then to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects worthinesse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from his Prince to be reiected.

            <p>Of all other things, free spirits &amp; wise men should least respect the losse of temporall wealth, which is no part of a man.</p>

            <p>A good man, if of his owne industrie and merit, hee hath purchased vnto himselfe wealth, hath little
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2839:44"/>
reason to grieue at the losse of them, since he remaines still as perfect in the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of gayning as when he first began: but another of more aboundance, whose possessions come to him by inheritance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care of his owne, he hath no reason at all to distaste the seizure of his estate, since he doth forgo but that which hee neuer laboured for. Truly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of this it behoueth euery resolued minde to beare the courage of the wise man of GREECE, that said, he at all times carried all what was his with him

goodnesse and resolution to warme him in all win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of aduersitie, needes wealth but as a thinne sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Cloake vpon a furred Gowne, rather to shew the vanitie of his disposition, then any vsefull imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the sustenance of life.</p>
            <p>If nature be prouided for against hunger with meate; against frosts with apparell; against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with comelinesse, the desire of money or large Lordships, argues but the base filthinesse of an vnsatisfied couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:2839:45"/>
There may be obiected, that ô my estate being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, mine Heires are beggard, and the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my ancestors house made the spectacle of ruine.</p>
            <p>This being admitted, it is soone answered, that the houses of most conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and personages of Noblest births account that antiquitie of best esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which is deriued from the longest discent, in which they shall finde, that the first of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors were gotten by him, who was in as low an ebbe of fulnesse, as hee is now
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2839:46"/>
at the present: for all greatnes had a beginning, and the beginning of that greatnesse is desert. Am I Noble, let me know that this noblenesse is the least part of mine; for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wonne it by their vertue, they had the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but I enioy the Titles. Haue I robd mine Heires of those Titles, Honours, or Possessions? let them striue to haue more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in deseruing more, that their Successors may asmuch remember their vertues, as I haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the vertues of my Ancestors. Questionlesse
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2839:46"/>
howsoeuer the reputation of a continued Family in ancient Honours, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred aboue any men of latter greatnesse, of some whose worth hath raised his house to a noble stile, yet is it in the lawes of reason most reasonable; that hee should deserue more respect, that by his owne atchiuements hath purchased dignitie, then others that onely haue it by the priuiledge of bloud, since the one weares but the shaddowes of his Predecessors tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, the other the substance of his owne</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:2839:47"/>
Pouerty is no burthen to them as can susteine it, is no enemy to such as will imbrace it: He is only miserable that knowes not to be content with his Fortune, especially if his fall be procured by his owne errours. Then the surest, the Noblest, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes to redeeme publike calamitie, is by a publike (and yet inward profession of sufferance; for in all persons and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages, reformation of folly is a worke of more praise then the working of folly is a cause of disgrace.</p>
            <p>What misery can it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2839:47"/>
then be to be eased of that care, which onely brings care in the possession. Of all mischiefes, the greatest mischiefe is to be a rich man, with a rich mans minde. There is no more reason why a meerely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man should loue Gold, but for that it is yellow or faire; Pastures, because they are greene; and so hath the enuious much more reason to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uer abundance of wealth, because other men should want it. A couetous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, is rightly a malicious consumer, for in heaping for himselfe, he consumes
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2839:48"/>
the maintenance of the needy: yet it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that plenty is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be dispraised, if the hauing of it doe no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> procure a scarcitie. But what losse is so great in a worldly estate (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how weake it is more then in opinion) which a wise man should not beare with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</p>
            <p>It is a misery to want, but a greater misery to haue too much: but for a good man to hugge the loue of abundance, that he should imagine the losse of it, should make him misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2839:48"/>
I must conclude this point that he hath neither goodnes nor resolution: if goodnesse, his content should be his best estate; if resolution, his want can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be esteemed the worst pouertie, since extremity is a singular teacher to learne vs that we are men, and that there is both a diuine power and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence aboue vs; the one consisting in being a God, the other in hauing a God-head.</p>
            <p>The difference between <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of</hi> Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> a wise man, reformed by counsell and instruction, and an ignorant man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2839:49"/>
in will and folly, is, that the wife will make good vse of all aduersity, when the ignorant thinks all aduersitie intollerable. This is proued in the greatnes of a Noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, when it is enforced to forsake (either vpon publike disgrace, or some priuate causes) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his friends and Countrie, which men of low hearts) doe account a misery of mischiefes, and reckon that <hi>banishment</hi> is a bad kinde of torture.</p>

            <p>The end of all sorrowes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2839:64"/>
is <hi>Death,</hi> if the party to die be truely reconciled to his God and to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>The old Poets did fitly faine <hi>Death</hi> to be the childe of the Night, and Sleepe to be the Sister of <hi>Death;</hi> wisely including, that as Night and Sleepe wrap vp all in stilnesse, so should <hi>Death</hi> more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly finish the course of euils, by burying them in a graue, neuer to arise.</p>
            <p>And no doubt, but heerein <hi>Death</hi> and Night haue much affinitie, that as the Night is fearefull,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2839:65"/>
because darke; but sweet, because giuing rest: So is <hi>Death</hi> in his shaddowe (which is the night of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) before it, comes full of horrour, but in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance (which is the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to a better life) when it comes, full of ioyes.</p>
            <p>It may be here obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that to die for some supposed offence by an enforced death, is scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and therefore mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>But it may be answered, that such an obiection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens but the feare of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2839:65"/>
frailty. For if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, we must consesse that the houre of <hi>death</hi>

            <p>Men, appointed to die,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2839:66"/>
knowing the time certain, haue reason, and no doubt, doe accordingly fit themselues to forsake and cast off all those parts and thoughts that might make them mortall, then others who onely dreame of a dying time, but not resoluing that they draw neerer to the time, are many times suddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the fulnesse of their filthinesse, and in the high tide of acting vnlawfull pleasures or abuses: and here surely betweene the manner of dying, the last is most fearefull, since the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2839:66"/>
former, knowing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute in which they are to depart from the World, doe by the stroake of Iustice enioy that benefit which wise and good men doe in mercy sigh and hope for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death</hi> is a happy Hauen, and men shipwrackt in the Sea of this earth cannot but couet it: It is a safe Inne, and men poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in the iourneyes of wearinesse, cannot but seeke it: It is a path to blessednesse, and such as are good will finde it: It is a banquet of all goodnes,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2839:67"/>
and such as be blessed haue found it.</p>
            <p>Hee is vnworthy to liue that is not worthy inough to dye, and hee is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to dye that hath liued worthily. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that demaunded of <hi>Iupiter</hi> that hee would giue to her two sonnes the greatest happinesse that could bee bestowed from heauen on men, had the same night her sonnes both dead, as if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test humane felicitie were to bee freed from beeing humane.</p>

To conclude (for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath beene said of this before) he which will wisely and nobly practise the obseruation of the <hi>Golden Meane,</hi> and shew the greatnesse of Vertue in extreames, must keepe truce with his passions, &amp; prepare his courage with this resolution, that Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is no Misery; for that is onely a misery which is lasting, and thought so: and reputed misery is not lasting, because <hi>death</hi> out vveares it; is not thought so because <hi>death</hi> vvill finish it: in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2839:68"/>
on the one Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will proue a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde, in the other Noblenesse will patterne out a wiseman: for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in extreames make perfect both.</p>
            <p>In the view of vvhat hath beene said, vnder the titles of a wise and a Noble man, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all men, of all degrees and fortunes, whose Vertues doe make them wise; as their wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth make them Noble.
