            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that RICHARD the third of that name, King in fact onely, but Tyrant both in Title and Regiment, and so commonly termed and reputed in all times since, was by the <hi>Diuine Reuenge,</hi> fauouring the designe of an Exilde man, ouerthrowne and slaine at <hi>Bosworth-</hi>field: There succeeded in the Kingdome the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> thence-forth stiled HENRY the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth. The King immediately after the Victorie, as one that had beene bred vnder a deuout Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was in his nature, a great Obseruer of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious formes, caused <hi>Te Deum Laudamus</hi> to be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely sung in the presence of the whole Armie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, and was himselfe with generall applause, and great Cries of Ioy, in a kind of <hi>Militar Election,</hi> or <hi>Recognition,</hi> saluted King. Meane-while the body
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7276:4"/>
of RICHARD after many indignities and reproches (the <hi>Dirigies</hi> and <hi>Obsequies</hi> of the common people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tyrants)</hi> was obscurely buried. For though the King of his noblenesse gaue charge vnto the <hi>Friers</hi> of <hi>Leicester</hi> to see an honourable interrment to be giuen to it, yet the <hi>Religious People</hi> themselues (being not free from the humors of the <hi>Vulgar)</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it; wherein neuerthelesse they did not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre any mans blame or censure. No man thinking any ignominie or contumely vnworthy of him, that had beene the Executioner of King HENRY the Sixth (that innocent Prince) with his owne hands; the Contriuer of the death of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> his Brother; the Murderer of his two <hi>Nephewes</hi> (one of them his lawfull King in the Present, and the other in the Future, fayling of him) and vehemently suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to haue beene the Impoisoner of his wife, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make vacant his Bed, for a Marriage within the <hi>Degrees forbidden.</hi> And although he were a Prince in Militar vertue approued, iealous of the honour of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> and likewise a good <hi>Law-maker,</hi> for the ease and solace of the common people: yet his Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Parricides in the opinion of all men, weighed downe his Vertues and merits; and in the opinion of wise men, euen those Vertues themselues were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to bee rather fained, and <hi>Affected</hi> things to serue his Ambition, then true <hi>Qualities</hi> ingenerate in his Iudgement or Nature. And therfore it was noted by men of great vnderstanding (who seeing his after Acts, looked backe vpon his former Proceedings) that euen in the time of King EDWARD his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was not without secret <hi>Traines</hi> and <hi>Mines</hi> to turne Enuie and Hatred vpon his Brothers Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as hauing an Expectation and a kind of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that the King, by reason of his many disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, could not be of long life, but was like to leaue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7276:4"/>
his Sonnes of tender yeares; and then hee knew well, how easie a step it was, from the place of a <hi>Protector,</hi> and first <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> to the Crowne. And that out of this deepe root of Ambition it sprang, that aswell at the Treatie of peace that pussed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene EDWARD the Fourth, and LEWIS the Eleuenth of <hi>France,</hi> concluded by Enteruiew of both Kings at <hi>Piqueny,</hi> as vpon all other Occasions, RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD then Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> stood euer vpon the side of Honour, raising his owne Reputation to the disaduantage of the King his Brother, and drawing the eyes of all (especially of the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Souldiours)</hi> vpon himselfe; as if the King by his voluptuous life and meane marriage, were become effeminate and lesse sensible of honour, and Reason of State, then was fit for a King, Andras for the Politique and wholesome <hi>Lawes</hi> which were enacted in his time, they were interpreted to be but the Brocage of an <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,</hi> therby to wooe, and winne the hearts of the people, as being conscious to himselfe that the true obligations of <hi>Soueraigntie</hi> in him failed, and were wanting. But King HENRY in the very entrance of his Reigne, and the instant of time, when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was cast into his Armes, met with a Point of great difficultie, and knotty to solue, able to trouble and confound the wisest King in the newnesse of his Estate; and so much the more, because it could not endure a <hi>Deliberation,</hi> but must be at once delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and determined. There were fallen to his lot, and concurrent in his person, three seuerall <hi>Titles</hi> to the Imperiall Crowne. The first, the title of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with whom, by precedent Pact with the Partie that brought him in, he was to marry. The second, the ancient and long disputed Title (both by <hi>Plea,</hi> and <hi>Armes)</hi> of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to which he was Inheritour in his owne Person. The third, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7276:5"/>
Title of the <hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Conquest,</hi> for that he came in by victorie of Battaile, and that the King in possession was slaine in the field. The first of these was fairest, and most like to giue contentment to the people, who by two and twentie yeares Reigne of King ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD the Fourth, had beene fully made capable of the clearnesse of the Title of the <hi>White-Rose</hi> or House of <hi>Yorke;</hi> and by the milde and plausible Reigue of the same king toward his Latter time, were become affectionate to that <hi>Line.</hi> But then it lay plaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes, that if he relied vpon that <hi>Title,</hi> he could be but a <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Curtesie,</hi> and haue rather a <hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall</hi> then a <hi>Regall</hi> power: the right remaining in his <hi>Queene,</hi> vpon whose decease, either with Issue, or without Issue, he was to giue place, and bee remoued. And though he should obtaine by <hi>Parliament</hi> to bee continued, yet hee knew there was a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a King that holdeth his Crowne by a cicuill act of <hi>Estates,</hi> and one that holdeth it original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and descent of Bloud. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted there euen at that time secret Rumors and whisperings (which afterwards gathered strength and turned to great troubles) that the two young Sonnes of King EDWARD the Fourth, or one of them (which were said to be destroyed in the Tower) were not indeed murthered, but conueyed secretly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and were yet liuing: which if it had beene true, had preuented the Title of the Lady ELIZABETH. On the other side, if he stood vpon his owne Title of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> inherent in his Person; hee knew it was a Title condemned by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and generally preiudged in the common opinion of the Realme, and that it tended directly to the disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Line of <hi>Yorke,</hi> held then the indubiate Heires of the crowne. So that if he should haue no Issue by the Lady ELIZABETH, which should bee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7276:5"/>
Descendents of the <hi>Double-Line,</hi> when the ancient flames of Discord and intestine Warres vpon the Competition of both Houses, would againe returne and reuiue.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Conquest</hi> notwithstanding, Sir WILLIAM STANLEY, after some acclamations of the Souldiers in the Field, had put a Crowne of ornament (which RICHARD wore in the Battaile, and was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Spoiles) vpon King HENRIES head, as if there were his chiefe Title; yet he remembred well vpon what Conditions and Agreements hee was brought in, and that to claime as <hi>Conquerour,</hi> was to put as well his owne Partie, as the rest, into Terror and Feare; as that which gaue him power of disanulling of Lawes, and disposing of Mens Fortunes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and the like points of absolute power, being in themselues so harsh and odious, as that WILLIAM himselfe, commonly called the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> howsoeuer he vsed and exercised the power of a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his <hi>Normans,</hi> yet he sorbare to vse that Claime in the beginning, but mixed it with a Titularie pretence grounded vpon the <hi>Will</hi> and designation of ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD the <hi>Confessor.</hi> But the King out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his owne minde, presently cast the Die, and the inconueniences appearing vnto him on all parts; and knowing there could not be any <hi>Interreigne</hi> or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension of Title; and preferring his affection to his owne Line and Bloud, and liking that Title best which made him independent; and being in his Nature and constitution of minde not very apprehensiue or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casting of future Euents a-farre off, but an Intertainer of Fortune by the Day; resolued to rest vpon the Title of <hi>Lancaster</hi> as the <hi>Maine,</hi> and to vse the other two, that of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and that of <hi>Battaile,</hi> but as <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters,</hi> the one to appease secret Discontents, and the other to beat downe open murmur and dispute: not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7276:6"/>
forgetting that the same Title of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained a possession of three Descents in the Crowne, and might haue proued a <hi>Perpetuitie,</hi> had it not ended in the weaknesse and inabilitie of the last Prince. Whereupon the King presently that very day, being the two and twentieth of August, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Stile of King in his owne name, without mention of the Lady ELIZABETH at all, or any relation therunto. In which course hee euer after persisted, which did spin him a threed of many sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and troubles. The King full of these thoughts, before his departure from <hi>Leicester,</hi> dispatched Sir RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT WILLOVGHBY to the Castle of <hi>Sheriffe-Hutton</hi> in <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> where were kept in safe custodie by King RICHARDS commandement, both the Lady ELIZABETH daughter of king EDWARD, and EDWARD PLANTAGENET, Sonne and Heire to GEORGE Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> This ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD was by the Kings warrant deliuered from the Constable of the Castle to the hand of Sir RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT WILLOVGHBY; and by him with all safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diligence conueyed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he was shut vp <hi>Close-prisoner.</hi> Which Act of the Kings (being an Act meerely of Policie and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) proceeded not so much from any apprehension he had of Doctor <hi>Shawes</hi> tale at <hi>Pauls Crosse,</hi> for the bastarding of EDWARD the fourths Issues, in which case this young Gentleman was to succeed (for that Fable was euer exploded) but vpon a serled dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to depresse all Eminent persons of the Line of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Wherin still the King out of strength of Will, or weaknesse of Iudgement, did vse to shew a little more of the <hi>Partie,</hi> then of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Lady ELIZABETH shee receiued also a direction to repaire with all conuenient speed to <hi>London,</hi> and there to remaine with the Queene <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wager</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7276:6"/>
her Mother; which accordingly she soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did, accompanied with many <hi>Noble-men</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of Honour. In the meane season the King set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by easie iourneys to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Acclamations and Applauses of the People as he went, which indeed were true and vnfained, as might well appeare in the very Demonstrations and Fulnesse of the Crie. For they thought generally that hee was a <hi>Prince</hi> as ordayned and sent downe from Heauen, to vnite and put to an end the long dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the two Houses; which although they had had in the times of HENRY the Fourth, HENRY the Fifth, and a part of HENRY the Sixth on the one side, and the times of EDWARD the Fourth on the other, <hi>Lucide-interuals</hi> and happy Pauses; yet they did euer hang ouer the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> readie to breake forth into new Perturbations and Calamities. And as his victorie gaue him the <hi>Knee,</hi> so his purpose of marriage with the Lady ELIZABETH, gaue him the <hi>Heart;</hi> so that both <hi>Knee</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> did truely bow before him.</p>
            <p>Hee on the other side with great wisedome (not ignorant of the affections and feares of the people) to disperse the conceit and terrour of a <hi>Conquest,</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen order that there should be nothing in his iourney like vnto a warlike March, or manner: but rather like vnto the <hi>Progresse</hi> of a King in full peace and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</p>
            <p>Hee entred the Citie vpon a <hi>Saturday,</hi> as hee had also obtained the Victorie vpon a <hi>Saturday,</hi> which day of the Weeke first vpon an Obseruation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon Memorie and Fancie, hee accounted and chose as a day prosperous vnto him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Companies</hi> of the Citie receiued him at <hi>Shore-ditch:</hi> whence, with great and Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attendance and troups of Noble-men, and Persons
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7276:7"/>
of Qualitie hee entred the Citie; himselfe not being on Horse-backe, or in any open <hi>Chaire,</hi> or <hi>Throne,</hi> but in a close <hi>Chariot,</hi> as one that hauing beene somtimes an Enemie to the whole State, and a Proscribed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, chose rather to keepe State, and strike a Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence into the people then to fawne vpon them.</p>
            <p>He went first into Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Church, where not meaning that the people should forget too soone that hee came in by Battaile, hee made Offertorie of his <hi>Standards,</hi> and had Orizons and <hi>Te Deum</hi> againe sung, and went to his Lodging prepared in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Londons Palace,</hi> where he stayed for a time.</p>
            <p>During his abode there, he assembled his <hi>Counsell,</hi> and other principall persons, in presence of whom, he did renew againe his promise to marrie with the <hi>Lady</hi> ELIZABETH. This hee did the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hauing at his comming out of <hi>Britaine</hi> giuen artificially, for seruing of his owne turne some hopes, in cale he obtained the Kingdome, to marrie ANNE Inheritresse to the Duchie of <hi>Britaine,</hi> whom CHARLES the Eight of <hi>France</hi> soone after married; It bred some doubt and suspicion amongst diuers, that he was not sincere, or at least not fixed in going on with the match of <hi>England</hi> so much desired: which Conceit also though it were but Talke and Discourse did much afflict the poore <hi>Lady</hi> ELIZABETH her selfe. But howsoeuer he both truly intended it, and desired also it should be so beleeued, (the better to extinguish Enuie and Contradiction to his other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses) yet was he resolued in himselfe not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Consummation thereof till his <hi>Coronation</hi> and a <hi>Parliament</hi> were past. The one, least a ioynt Coronation of himselfe and his <hi>Queene</hi> might giue any countenance of participation of Title; The other, least in the intayling of the <hi>Crowne</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which he hoped to obtaine by <hi>Parliament,</hi> the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7276:7"/>
Votes of the <hi>Parliament</hi> might any wayes reflect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.</p>
            <p>About this time in <hi>Autumne,</hi> towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> there began and reigned in the Citie and other parts of the Kingdome a <hi>Disease</hi> then new: which of the Accidents and manner thereof, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sweating Sicknesse.</hi> This Disease had a swift course both in the <hi>Sicke-Body</hi> and in the <hi>Time</hi> and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the lasting therof: for they that were taken with it, vpon foure and twentie houres escaping were thought almost assured. And as to the <hi>Time</hi> of the malice and reigne of the Disease ere it ceased; It began about the one and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> and cleared vp before the end of <hi>October,</hi> insomuch as it was no hinderance to the Kings <hi>Coronation,</hi> which was the last of <hi>October:</hi> nor (which was more) to the holding of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which began but seuen dayes after. It was a <hi>Pestilent-Feuer,</hi> but as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not seated in the Veynes or Humors, for that there followed no <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> no purple or liuide Spots, or the like, the Masse of the Bodie being not tainted: onely a maligne <hi>Vapour</hi> flew to the Heart and seased the vitall <hi>Spirits;</hi> which stirred Nature to striue to send it forth by an extreme sweat. And it appeared by experience that this Disease was rather a Surprise of Nature, than obstinate to remedies, if it were in time looked vnto. For if the <hi>Patient</hi> were kept in an equall temper, both for Clothes, Fire, and Drinke, moderately warme, with temperate <hi>Cordials,</hi> wherby Natures worke were neither irritated by <hi>Heat,</hi> nor turned backe by <hi>Cold,</hi> hee commonly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. But infinite Persons died sodainly of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the manner of the Cure and attendance was knowne. It was conceiued not to bee an <hi>Epidemicke</hi> Disease, but to proceed from a malignitie in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Aire, gathered by the predispositions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7276:8"/>
of Seasons: and the speedie cessation declared as much.</p>
            <p>On SIMON and IVDES Euen the King dined with THOMAS BOVRCHIER, <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall:</hi> and from <hi>Lambeth</hi> went by Land ouer the Bridge to the Tower, where the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after hee made twelue <hi>Knights-Bannerets.</hi> But for <hi>Creations</hi> hee dispensed them with a sparing hand. For notwithstanding a Field so lately fought, and a <hi>Coronation</hi> so neere at hand, hee onely created three: IASPER Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (the Kings Vncle) was created Duke of <hi>Bedford;</hi> THOMAS the Lord STANLEY (the Kings Father-in-law Earle of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie;</hi> and EDWARD COVRTNEY Earle of <hi>Deuon;</hi> though the King had then neuerthelesse a purpose in himselfe to make more in time of <hi>Parliament;</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a wise and decent respect to distribute his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> some to honour his <hi>Coronation,</hi> and some his <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Coronation</hi> followed two dayes after vpon the thirtieth day of <hi>October</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1485. At which time INNOCENT the Eight was <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> FREDERICKE the Third, <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine;</hi> and MAXIMILIAN his sonne newly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> CHARLES the Eight, King of <hi>France;</hi> FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> and IAMES the Third, King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> with all which Kings and States, the King was at that time in good peace and amitie. At which day also (as if the Crowne vpon his head, had put perils into his thoughts) he did institute for the better securitie of his person a Band of fiftie <hi>Archers</hi> vnder a <hi>Captaine</hi> to attend him, by the name of <hi>Yeomen-</hi>of-his-<hi>Guard:</hi> and yet that it might be thought to be rather a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Dignitie,</hi> after the imitation of that hee had knowne abroad, then any matter of <hi>Diffidence</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7276:8"/>
to his owne Case, hee made it to be vnderstood for an <hi>Ordinance</hi> not temporarie, but to hold in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for euer after.</p>
            <p>The seuenth of <hi>Nouember</hi> the King held his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which hee had summoned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his comming to <hi>London.</hi> His Ends in calling a <hi>Parliament</hi> (and that so speedily) were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three; <hi>First,</hi> to procure the Crowne to bee entay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon himselfe. <hi>Next,</hi> to haue the Attaindors of all of his Partie (which were in no small number) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed, and all Acts of hostilitie by them done in his quarrell, remitted and discharged: and on the other side to attaine by <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Principals</hi> of his Enemies. The <hi>Third,</hi> to calme and quiet the feares of the rest of that Partie by a <hi>Generall-Pardon:</hi> not being ignorant in how great danger a King stands from his Subiects, when most of his Subiects are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious in themselues, that they stand in his danger. Vnto these three speciall Motiues of a <hi>Parliament</hi> was added, that hee as a prudent and moderate <hi>Prince,</hi> made this iudgement; that it was fit for him to hasten to let his people see, that hee meant to gouerne by <hi>Law,</hi> howsoeuer hee came in by the <hi>Sword:</hi> and fit also to reclaime them to know him for their <hi>King,</hi> whom they had so lately talked of as an <hi>Enemie</hi> or <hi>Banished-man,</hi> For that which concerned the Entay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Crowne;</hi> (more then that he was true to his owne Will, that hee would not endure any mention of the Lady ELIZABETH: no not in the nature of <hi>Speciall-Intaile,)</hi> he carried it otherwise with great wisdome and measure. For he did not presse to haue the <hi>Act</hi> penned by way of <hi>Declaration</hi> or <hi>Recognition</hi> of right: as on the other side, he auoyded to haue it by new <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Ordinance;</hi> but chose rather a kind of middle-way, by way of <hi>Establishment,</hi> and that vnder couert and indifferent words; <hi>That the inheritance</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:7276:9"/>
               <hi>of the Crowne should rest, remaine, and abide in the King, &amp;c.</hi> which words might equally be applied; That the Crowne should continue to him: but whether as hauing former right to it, (which was doubtfull) or hauing it then in Fact and possession (which no man denied) was left faire to interpretation eyther way. And againe for the limitation of the <hi>Entaile,</hi> he did not presse it to goe further then to himselfe and to the <hi>Heires</hi> of his body, not speaking of his <hi>right Heires;</hi> but leauing that to the Law to decide: so as the Entaile might seeme rather a personall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to him, and his children, then a totall Dis-inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to the House of <hi>Yorke.</hi> And in this forme, was the Law drawne and passed. Which <hi>Statute</hi> hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to be confirmed by the <hi>Popes Bull</hi> the yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, with mention neuerthelesse (by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall) of his other Titles; both of <hi>Descent</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi> So as now the wreath of <hi>Three</hi> was made a wreath of <hi>Fiue,</hi> for to the three first Titles of the two Houses, or Lines, and Conquest, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two more; the Authorities <hi>Parliamentarie</hi> and <hi>Papall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King likewise in the <hi>Reuersall</hi> of the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of his <hi>Partakers,</hi> and discharging them of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences incident to his seruice and succour, had his Will: and Acts did passe accordingly. In the passage whereof, exception was taken to diuers Persons in the house of <hi>Commons</hi> for that they were attainted, and therby not legall, nor habilitate to serue in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> being disabled in the highest degree; And that it should bee a great incongruitie to haue them to make <hi>Lawes,</hi> who themselues were not <hi>Inlawed.</hi> The truth was, that diuers of those which had in the time of King RICHARD beene strongest and most declared for the Kings Partie, were returned <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> for the <hi>Parliament;</hi> whether by care or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7276:9"/>
recommendation from the <hi>State,</hi> or the voluntarie inclination of the <hi>People:</hi> many of which had beene by RICHARD the third attainted by <hi>Outlawries,</hi> or otherwise. The King was somewhat troubled with this. For though it had a graue and specious Shew, yet it reflected vpon his Partie. But wisely not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe at all moued therewith, hee would not vnderstand it but as a <hi>Case</hi> in Law; and wished the <hi>Iudges</hi> to be aduised therupon: who for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose were forthwith assembled in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber</hi> (which is the <hi>Councell-Chamber</hi> of the <hi>Iudges)</hi> and vpon deliberation they gaue a graue and safe <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Aduice,</hi> mixed with <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Conuenience;</hi> which was, that the <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> attainted by the course of Law, should forbeare to come into the House, till a Law were passed for the reuersall of their <hi>Attaindors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was at that time incidently moued amongst the <hi>Iudges</hi> in their Consultation, what should be done for the King himselfe, who likewise was attainted? But it was with vnanimous consent resolued, <hi>That the Crowne takes away all defects and stops in bloud: and that from the time the King did assume the Crowne, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was cleared, and all Attaindors and Corruption of bloud discharged.</hi> But neuerthelesse for <hi>Honours</hi> sake it was ordained by <hi>Parliament,</hi> that all <hi>Records</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was any memorie, or mention of the Kings <hi>Attaindor,</hi> should be defaced, cancelled, and taken off the <hi>File.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the part of the Kings <hi>Enemies</hi> there were by <hi>Parliament</hi> attainted; the late Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> calling himselfe RICHARD the Third, The Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> Viscount LOVEL, the Lord FERRERS, the Lord ZOVCH, RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD RATCLIFFE, WILLIAM CATESBY, and many others of degree and qualitie. In which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7276:10"/>
Bills of <hi>Attaindors,</hi> neuerthelesse there were contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many iust and temperate <hi>Clauses, Sauings,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisoes,</hi> well shewing and fore-tokening the wisdome, stay, and moderation of the Kings spirit of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for the <hi>Pardon</hi> of the rest, that had stood against the King; the King, vpon a second aduice, thought it not fit it should passe by <hi>Parliament,</hi> the better (being matter of Grace) to impropriate the thankes to himselfe: vsing onely the opportunitie of a <hi>Parliament</hi> time, the better to disperse it into the <hi>Veines</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Therfore during the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hee published his <hi>Royall Proclamation,</hi> offering <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of restitution, to all such as had taken <hi>Armes,</hi> or beene participant of any Attempts against him; so as, they submitted themselues to his mercie by a Day, and tooke the Oath of <hi>Allegeance</hi> and Fidelitie to him. Whereupon many came out of <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and many more came out of <hi>Feare,</hi> no lesse guiltie then those that had taken <hi>Sanctuarie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Treasure,</hi> the King thought it not seasonable, or fit to demand any of his <hi>Subiects</hi> at this <hi>Parliament:</hi> both because he had receiued satisfaction from them in matters of so great importance: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee could not remunerate them with any <hi>Generall Pardon,</hi> being preuented therin by the <hi>Coronation Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> passed immediatly before: but chiefly, for that it was in euery mans eye, what great <hi>Forfeitures</hi> and <hi>Confiscations</hi> he had at that present to helpe himselfe: Wherby those <hi>Casualties</hi> of the Crowne might in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son spare the <hi>Purses</hi> of the Subiect; especially in a time when he was in peace with all his Neighbours. Some few <hi>Lawes</hi> passed at that <hi>Parliament,</hi> almost for forme sake: amongst which there was <hi>One,</hi> to reduce Aliens, being made Denizens, to pay strangers Customes; and <hi>another,</hi> to draw to himselfe the <hi>Seisures</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> of <hi>Italians Goods,</hi> for not imployment being
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7276:10"/>
Points of Profit to his Coffers, whereof from the very Beginning he was not forgetfull; and had beene more happie at the Latter End, if his early prouidence (which kept him from all necessitie of exacting vpon his people) could likewise haue attemp'red his nature therin. He added during <hi>Parliament,</hi> to his former <hi>Creations,</hi> the <hi>Innoblement</hi> or aduancement in <hi>Nobilitie</hi> of a few others: The Lord CHANDOS of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> was made Earle of <hi>Bathe;</hi> and Sir GILES DAWBENY was made Lord <hi>Dawbeny;</hi> and Sir ROBERT WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVGHBY Lord <hi>Brooke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King did also with great Noblenesse and Bountie (which Vertues at that time had their turnes in his Nature) restore EDWARD STAFFORD (el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne to HENRY, Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> attainted in the time of King RICHARD) not onely to his <hi>Dignities,</hi> but to his <hi>Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Possessions,</hi> which were great: to which he was moued also by a kind of gratitude, for that the Duke was the man that moued the first Stone against the Tyrannie of King RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD, and indeed madethe King a bridge to the Crowne vpon his owne Ruines. Thus the <hi>Parliament</hi> brake vp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> being dissolued, the King sent forthwith Money to redeeme the Marquesse <hi>Dorset,</hi> and Sir IOHN BOVRCHIER, whom hee had left as his <hi>Pledges</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> for Money which hee had borrowed, when he made his Expedition for <hi>England.</hi> And thereupon hee tooke a fit occasion to send the <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> BRAY (whom hee vsed as Councellor) to the Lord <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> requiring of the Citie a <hi>Prest</hi> of six thousand Markes: But after many <hi>Parlees,</hi> hee could obtaine but two thousand pounds. Which neuerthelesse the King tooke in good part; as Men vse to doe, that practise to borrow Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when they haue no need. About this time, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7276:11"/>
King called vnto his <hi>Priuie-Councell,</hi> IOHN MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, and RICHARD FOX, the one <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Elie,</hi> the other <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Excester,</hi> vigilant men, and secret, and such as kept watch with him almost vpon al men else. They had beene both versed in his Affaires, before hee came to the Crowne, and were partakers of his aduerse Fortune. This MORTON soone after vpon the death of BOVRCHIER, he made <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And for FOX, hee made him Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> of his <hi>Priuie-Seale,</hi> and afterwards aduanced him by Degrees, from <hi>Excester</hi> to <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> thence to <hi>Durham,</hi> and last, to <hi>Winchester.</hi> For although the King loued to imploy and aduance <hi>Bishops,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hauing rich <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> they carried their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vpon themselues: yet he did vse to raise them by steps; that hee might not lose the profit of the <hi>First-fruits,</hi> which by that course of Gradation was multiplied.</p>
            <p>At last, vpon the eighteenth of <hi>Ianuarie</hi> was solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the so long expected and so much desired Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, betweene the King &amp; the Lady ELIZABETH: Which Day of Marriage was celebrated with greater Triumph, and Demonstrations (especially on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples part) of Ioy and Gladnesse, than the dayes eyther of his Entrie, or Coronation; which the King rather noted, than liked. And it is true, that all his life time, while the Lady ELIZABETH liued with him, (for she died before him) hee shewed himselfe no very indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Husband towards her, though shee was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, gentle, and fruitfull. But his auersion towards the House of YORKE was so predominant in him, as it found place, not only in his <hi>Warres</hi> and <hi>Counsells,</hi> but in his <hi>Chamber</hi> and <hi>Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the middle of the <hi>Spring,</hi> the King, full of confidence and assurance, as a <hi>Prince</hi> that had beene victorious in <hi>Battaile,</hi> and had preuailed with his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:7276:11"/>
in all that hee desired, and had the <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations</hi> fresh in his eares, thought the rest of his Raigne should bee but Play, and the enioying of a <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Yet as a wise and watchfull King, hee would not neglect any thing for his safetie; thinking neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse to performe all things now, rather as an <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi> then as a <hi>Labour.</hi> So hee being truly informed, that the <hi>Northerne parts</hi> were not onely affectionate to the House of YORKE, but particularly had beene deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King RICHARD the third; thought it would bee a Summer well spent to visit those <hi>Parts,</hi> and by his presence and application of himselfe, to reclaime and rectifie those humors. But the King, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Calmes,</hi> did much ouer-cast his Fortunes, which proued for many yeares together full of <hi>Broken Seas, Tides,</hi> and <hi>Tempests.</hi> For he was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come to <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where he kept his <hi>Easter,</hi> but he receiued newes, that the <hi>Lord</hi> LOVEL, HVMPHREY STAFFORD, and THOMAS STAFFORD (who had formerly taken <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> at <hi>Colchester)</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> but to what place, no man could tell. Which aduertisement, the King despised, and continued his Iourney to <hi>Yorke.</hi> At <hi>Yorke</hi> there came fresh and more certaine aduertisement, that the <hi>Lord</hi> LOVEL was at band with a great power of men, and that the STAFFORDS were in Armes in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi> and had made their approaches to the Citie of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to assaile it. The King, as a Prince of great and profound iudgement, was not much moued with it; for that hee thought it was but a Ragge or Remnant of <hi>Bosworth-Field,</hi> and had nothing in it of the maine Partie of the house of YORKE. But hee was more doubtfull of the raysing of Forces to resist the <hi>Rebels,</hi> then of the Resistance it selfe; for that hee was in a <hi>Core</hi> of People, whose affections he suspected. But the Action enduring no delay, hee did speedily
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7276:12"/>
leuie and send against the <hi>Lord</hi> LOVEL to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three thousand men, ill armed, but well assured (being taken some few out of his owne Traine, and the rest out of the Tenants and Followers of such as were safe to bee trusted) vnder the Conduct of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bedford.</hi> And as his manner was to send his Pardons rather before the Sword then after, hee gaue <hi>Commission</hi> to the <hi>Duke,</hi> to proclaime pardon to all that would come in: Which the <hi>Duke,</hi> vpon his approach to the <hi>Lord</hi> LOVELS Campe, did performe. And it fell out as the King expected; the <hi>Heralds</hi> were the <hi>Great-Ordnance.</hi> For the <hi>Lord</hi> LOVEL, vpon <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> of pardon, mistrusting his men, fled into <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and lurking for a time with Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON, after sailed ouer into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the <hi>Ladie</hi> MARGARET. And his men, forsaken of their <hi>Captaine,</hi> did presently submit themselues to the <hi>Duke.</hi> The STAFFORDS likewise, and their Forces, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what had happened to the <hi>Lord</hi> LOVEL (in whose successe their chiefe trust was) despaired, and dispersed. The two Brothers, taking <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> at <hi>Colnham,</hi> a Village neare <hi>Abington;</hi> which Place, vpon view of their <hi>Priuiledge</hi> in the Kings Bench, being iudged no sufficient <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> for Traitors, HVM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHREY was executed at <hi>Tiburne;</hi> and THOMAS, as being led by his elder brother, was pardoned. So this <hi>Rebellion</hi> proued but a Blast, and the King hauing by this Iourney purged a little the Dregs and Leauen of the <hi>Northerne People,</hi> that were before in no good affection towards him, returned to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>September</hi> following, the <hi>Queene</hi> was deliuered of her first sonne, whom the King (in honour of the <hi>Brittish-Race,</hi> of which himselfe was) named AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THVH, according to the Name of that ancient wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie King of the <hi>Britaines;</hi> in whose Acts there is truth enough to make him Famous, besides that which is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7276:12"/>
Fabulous. The <hi>Childe</hi> was strong and able, though hee was borne in the <hi>eight Moneth,</hi> which the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians doe preiudge.</p>
            <p>THere followed this yeare, being the <hi>Second</hi> of the Kings Reigne, a strange Accident of <hi>State,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Relations which wee haue, are so naked, as they leaue it scarce credible; not for the nature of it (for it hath fallen out oft) but for the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, especially in the beginnings. Therfore wee shall make our Iudgement vpon the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as they giue light one to another, and (as wee can) digge <hi>Truth</hi> out of the <hi>Mine.</hi> The King was greene in his estate; and contrarie to his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and desert both, was not without much hatred throughout the <hi>Realme.</hi> The root of all, was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing of the House of YORKE, which the generall Bodie of the <hi>Realme</hi> still affected. This did alienate the hearts of the <hi>Subiects</hi> from him daily more and more, especially when they saw, that after his Marriage, and after a Sonne borne, the King did neuerthelesse not so much as proceed to the <hi>Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Queene,</hi> not vouchsafing her the honour of a <hi>Matrimoniall Crowne;</hi> for the <hi>Coronation</hi> of her was not till almost two yeares after, when Danger had taught him what to doe. But much more, when it was spread abroad (whether by <hi>Errour,</hi> or the cunning of <hi>Male-Contents)</hi> that the King had a purpose to put to death EDWARD PLANTAGENET closely in the <hi>Tower:</hi> Whose case was so neerly paralleld with that of EDWARD the Fourths Children, in respect of the Bloud, like Age, and the very place of the <hi>Tower,</hi> as it did refresh and reflect vpon the King a most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resemblance, as if hee would bee another King RICHARD. And all this time it was still whispered euery where, that at least one of the Children of ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7276:13"/>
the Fourth was liuing. Which Bruit was cunningly fomented by such as desired <hi>Innouation.</hi> Neither was the Kings nature and customes greatly fit to disperse these <hi>Mists;</hi> but contrariwise hee had a fashion rather to create Doubts, then Assurance. Thus was <hi>Fuell</hi> prepared for the <hi>Sparke:</hi> the <hi>Sparke</hi> that afterwards kindled such a fire, and combustion, was at the first contemptible.</p>
            <p>There was a subtill <hi>Priest</hi> called RICHARD SIMON, that liued in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and had to his Pupill a <hi>Bakers</hi> sonne named LAMBERT SIMNELL, of the age of some fifteene yeares; a comely Youth, and weli fauoured, not without some extraordinarie dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and grace of aspect. It came into this <hi>Priests</hi> fancie (hearing what men talked, and in hope to raise himselfe to some great <hi>Bishopricke)</hi> to cause this <hi>Lad</hi> to counterseit and personate the second sonne of EDWARD the Fourth, supposed to be murdered; and afterward (for he changed his intention in the manage) the Lord EDWARD PLANTAGENET then prisoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and accordingly to frame him and instruct him in the <hi>Part</hi> hee was to play. This is that which (as was touched before) seemeth scarcely credible; Not that a <hi>False person</hi> should be assumed to gaine a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> for it hath beene seene in ancient and late times; nor that it should come into the mind of such an abiect Fellow, to enterprise so great a matter; for high Conceits doe sometimes come strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Imaginations of base persons, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they are drunke with <hi>Newes,</hi> and <hi>talke</hi> of the people. But heere is that which hath no apparance; That this <hi>Priest</hi> being vtterly vnacquainted with the true <hi>Person,</hi> according to whose patterne hee should shape his <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> should thinke it possible for him to instruct his <hi>Player,</hi> either in gesture and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, or in recounting past matters of his life and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7276:13"/>
education; or in fit answers to questions, or the like, any wayes to come neare the resemblance of him whom hee was to represent. For this <hi>Lad</hi> was not to personate one, that had beene long before taken out of his Cradle, or conueighed away in his infancie, knowne to few; but a <hi>Youth</hi> that till the age almost of ten yeares had beene brought vp in a <hi>Court</hi> where infinite eyes had beene vpon him. For King ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD touched with remorse of his brother the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarences</hi> death, would not indeed restore his sonne, (of whom wee speake) to bee <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> but yet created him <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his honour on the mothers side, and vsed him honourably during his time, though RICHARD the Third afterwards confined him. So that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee, but that some great <hi>Person,</hi> that knew particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and familiarly EDWARD PLANTAGENET, had a hand in the businesse, from whom the <hi>Priest</hi> might take his ayme. That which is most probable, out of the precedent and subsequent Acts, is, that it was the <hi>Queene Dowager,</hi> from whom this action had the principall source and motion. For certaine it is, shee was a busie negotiating woman, and in her <hi>withdrawing Chamber</hi> had the fortunate <hi>Conspiracie</hi> for the King against King RICHARD the Third, beene hatched; which the King knew, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred perhaps but too well; and was at this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely discontent with the King, thinking her daughter (as the King handled the matter) not aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but depressed: and none could hold the <hi>Booke</hi> so well to prompt and instruct this <hi>Stage-Play,</hi> as she could. Neuerthelesse it was not her meaning, nor no more was it the meaning of any of the better and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort that fauoured this Enterprise and knew the Secret, that this disguised <hi>Idoll</hi> should possesse the <hi>Crowne;</hi> but at his perill to make way to the Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7276:14"/>
of the King: and that done, they had their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Waies.</hi> That which doth chiefly fortifie this Coniecture, is, that as soone as the matter brake forth in any strength, it was one of the Kings first Acts to cloister the <hi>Queene Dowager</hi> in the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery</hi> of <hi>Bermondsey,</hi> and to take away all her lands and estate; and this by close <hi>Councell</hi> without any legall proceeding, vpon farre-fetcht Pretences; <hi>That shee had deliuered her two daughters out of Sanctuarie to King</hi> RICHARD <hi>contrarie to promise.</hi> Which Proceeding being euen at that time taxed for rigorous and vndue, both in matter and maner; makes it very probable there was some greater matter against her, which the King vpon reason of <hi>Policie,</hi> and to auoid enuy would not publish. It is likewise no small argument that there was some secret in it, and some suppressing of Examinations; for that the <hi>Priest</hi> SIMON himselfe, after hee was taken was neuer brought to execution; no not so much as to publike <hi>Triall</hi> (as many <hi>Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> were vpon lesse Treasons) but was only shut vp close in a <hi>Dungeon.</hi> Adde to this that the after Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> (a principall Person of the House of YORKE) was slaine in <hi>Stoke-field,</hi> the King opened himselfe to some of his <hi>Councell,</hi> that he was sorie for the <hi>Earles</hi> death, because by him (hee said) hee might haue knowne the bottome of his danger.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the <hi>Narration</hi> it selfe; SIMON did first instruct his <hi>Scholler</hi> for the part of RICHARD <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> second sonne to King EDWARD the Fourth, and this was at such time as it was voiced that the King purposed to put to death EDWARD PLANTAGENET prisoner in the Tower, whereat there was great murmur. But hearing soone after a generall bruit that PLANTAGENET had escaped out of the Tower, and thereby finding him so much beloued amongst the people, and such reioycing at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7276:14"/>
his Escape, the cunning <hi>Priest</hi> changed his Copie, and chose now PLANTAGENET to bee the Subiect his <hi>Pupill</hi> should personate, because hee was more in the present speech, and votes of the people; and it pieced better, and followed more close and handsomley vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bruit of PLANTAGENETS escape. But yet doubting that there would bee too neare looking and too much <hi>Perspectiue</hi> into his Disguise, if hee should shew it here in <hi>England,</hi> hee thought good (after the manner of <hi>Scenes</hi> in <hi>Stage-Playes</hi> and <hi>Maskes)</hi> to shew it a farre of; and therfore sailed with his Scholler into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Affection to the House of YORKE was most in height. The King had beene a little improuident in the matters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had not remoued <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Councellors,</hi> and put in their places, or at least intermingled persons, of whom hee stood assured, as he should haue done, since hee knew the strong Bent of that Countrey towards the House of YORKE; and that it was a ticklish and vnsetled State, more easie to receiue distempers and mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then <hi>England</hi> was. But trusting to the reputation of his Victories and Successes in <hi>England,</hi> hee thought hee should haue time enough to extend his Cares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to that second Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Wherefore through this neglect, vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of SIMON with his pretended PLANTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENET into <hi>Ireland,</hi> all things were prepared for Reuolt and Sedition, almost as if they had beene set and plotted before hand. SIMONS first addresse was to the <hi>Lord</hi> THOMAS FITZ-GERARD, <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and Deputie of <hi>Ireland:</hi> before whose Eyes hee did cast such a Mist (by his owne insinuation, and by the carriage of his Youth, that expressed a naturall Princely behauiour) as ioyned perhaps with some inward Vapours of Ambition and Affection in the <hi>Earles</hi> owne minde, left him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7276:15"/>
fully possessed, that it was the true PLANTAGENET. The <hi>Earle</hi> presently communicated the matter with some of the <hi>Nobles</hi> and others there, at the first secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But finding them of like affection to himselfe, hee suffered it of purpose to vent and passe abroad; because they thought it not safe to resolue, till they had a taste of the <hi>Peoples</hi> inclination. But if the <hi>Great</hi> ones were in forwardnesse, the <hi>People</hi> were in furie, entertayning this <hi>Airie bodie</hi> or <hi>Phantasme</hi> with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible affection; partly out of their great deuotion to the House of YORKE; partly out of a proud humour in the Nation, to giue a <hi>King</hi> to the Realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Partie</hi> in this heat of affection much trouble themselues with the Attaindor of GEORGE <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarence;</hi> hauing newly learned by the Kings example, that <hi>Attaindors</hi> doe not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the conueighing of <hi>Title</hi> to the Crowne. And as for the daughters of King EDWARD the Fourth, they thought King RICHARD had said enough for them: and tooke them to bee but as of the Kings <hi>Partie,</hi> because they were in his power and at his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing. So that with maruellous consent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, this Counterfeit PLANTAGENET was brought with great solemnitie to the Castle of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi> and there saluted, serued, and honoured as King; the <hi>Boy</hi> becoming it well, and doing nothing that did bewray the basenesse of his condition. And within a few dayes after hee was proclaimed King in <hi>Dublin,</hi> by the name of King EDWARD the Sixt; there beeing not a sword drawne in King HENRY his quarrell.</p>
            <p>The King was much moued with this vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted accident, when it came to his eares, both because it strooke vpon that <hi>String</hi> which euer he most feared, as also because it was stirred in such a <hi>Place,</hi> where hee could not with safetie transferre his owne person, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7276:15"/>
suppresse it. For partly through naturall valour, and partly through an vniuersall suspition (not knowing whom to trust) he was euer readie to wait vpon all his atchieuements in person. The King therefore first called his <hi>Councell</hi> together at the <hi>Charter-house</hi> at <hi>Shine.</hi> Which <hi>Councell</hi> was held with great secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but the open <hi>Decrees</hi> thereof, which presently came abroad, were three.</p>
            <p>The first was, that the Queene <hi>Dowager,</hi> for that she, contrarie to her <hi>Pact,</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> with those that had concluded with her concerning the <hi>Mariage</hi> of her daughter ELIZABETH with King HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, had neuerthelesse deliuered her daughters out of <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> into King RICHARDS hands; should be cloistered in the Nunnerie of <hi>Bermondsey,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all her lands and goods.</p>
            <p>The next was, that EDWARD PLANTAGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET then Close-prisoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> should be in the most publike and notorious manner, that could be deuised, shewed vnto the people: In part to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the King of the Enuie of that opinion and bruit, how he had beene put to death priuily in the <hi>Tower;</hi> But chiefly to make the people see the leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and imposture of the proceedings of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that their PLANTAGENET was indeed but a puppit, or a <hi>Counterfeit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third was, that there should be againe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a <hi>Generall-Pardon</hi> to all that would reueale their offences, and submit themselues by a day. And that this <hi>Pardon</hi> should be conceiued in so ample and liberall a manner, as no <hi>High-Treason</hi> (no not against the Kings owne person) should be excepted. Which though it might seeme strange, yet was it not so to a wise King, that knew his greatest dangers were not from the least <hi>Treasons,</hi> but from the greatest. These resolutions of the King and his <hi>Councell</hi> were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7276:16"/>
put in execution. And first, the Queene <hi>Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> was put into the Monasterie of <hi>Bermondsey,</hi> and all her estate seized into the Kings hands, whereat there was much wondering; That a weake woman, for the yeelding to the menaces and promises of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> after such a distance of time (wherein the King had shewed no displeasure nor alteration) but much more after so happie a mariage, betweene the <hi>King</hi> and her <hi>Daughter,</hi> blessed with <hi>Issue-male,</hi> should vpon a sodaine mutabilitie or disclosure of the Kings mind be so seuerely handled.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Lady</hi> was amongst the examples of great varietie of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Shee had first from a distressed <hi>Suitor,</hi> and desolate <hi>Widdow,</hi> beene taken to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Bed</hi> of a <hi>Batchellour-King,</hi> the goodliest perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of his time; and euen in his reigne she had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a strange <hi>Eclipse</hi> by the Kings flight, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie depriuing from the Crowne. Shee was also very happie, in that she had by him faire <hi>Issue,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his Nuptiall loue (helping her selfe by some obsequious bearing and dissembling of his pleasures) to the very end. Shee was much affectionate to her owne Kindred, euen vnto <hi>Faction;</hi> which did stirre great Enuie in the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Kings side, who counted her Bloud a disparagement to be mingled with the Kings. With which <hi>Lords</hi> of the Kings bloud, ioyned also the Kings <hi>Fauorite</hi> the Lord HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINGS; who, notwithstanding the Kings great affection to him, was thought at times, through her malice and Splene, not to be out of danger of falling. After her husbands death, she was matter of <hi>Tragedie,</hi> hauing liued to see her <hi>Brother</hi> beheaded, and her two <hi>Sonnes</hi> deposed from the Crowne, Bastarded in their bloud, and cruelly murthered. All this while neuerthelesse shee inioyed her libertie, State, and Fortunes. But afterwards againe, vpon the <hi>Rise</hi> of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7276:16"/>
               <hi>Wheele,</hi> when she had a <hi>King</hi> to her <hi>Sonne-in-Law,</hi> and was made <hi>Grand mother</hi> to a <hi>Grand-child</hi> of the best Sexe; yet was she (vpon darke and vnknowne Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and no lesse strange Pretences) precipitated, and banished the World, into a <hi>Nunnery;</hi> where it was almost thought dangerous to visit her, or see her; and where not long after she ended her life: but was by the Kings Commandement buried with the King her husband at <hi>Windsore.</hi> Shee was <hi>Foundresse</hi> of <hi>Queenes-College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> For this <hi>Act</hi> the King sustained great obloquie, which neuerthelesse (besides the reason of State) was somwhat sweetned to him by a great <hi>Confiscation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time also EDWARD PLANTAGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET was vpon a <hi>Sonday</hi> brought throughout all the principall Streets of <hi>London,</hi> to be seene of the people. And hauing passed the view of the Streets, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to PAVLS <hi>Church,</hi> in solemne <hi>Procession,</hi> where great store of people were assembled. And it was prouided also in good fashion, that diuers of the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and others of Qualitie (especially of those that the King most suspected, and knew the person of PLANTAGENET best) had communication with the young Gentleman by the way, and entertayned him with speech and discourse; which did in effect marre the <hi>Pageant</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Subiects here, atleast with so many, as out of error, and not out of malice, might be mis-led. Neuerthelesse, in <hi>Ireland</hi> (where it was too late to goe backe) it wrought little or no effect. But contrarivvise, they turned the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> vpon the King, and gaue out, That the King, to defeat the true <hi>Inheritor,</hi> and to mocke the World, and blinde the eyes of simple man, had tricked vp a <hi>Boy</hi> in the likenesse of EDWARDPLANTAGENET, and shewed him to the people, not sparing to prophane the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of a <hi>Procession,</hi> the more to countenance the <hi>Fable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:7276:17"/>
The <hi>Generall-Pardon</hi> likewise neere the same time came forth; and the King therewithall omitted no diligence, in giuing straight order, for the keeping of the <hi>Ports;</hi> that <hi>Fugitiues, Male-contents,</hi> or suspected <hi>Persons</hi> might not passe ouer into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meane while the <hi>Rebels</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> had sent priuie Messengers both into <hi>England,</hi> and into <hi>Flanders,</hi> who in both places had wrought effects of no small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. For in <hi>England</hi> they wonne to their Partie IOHN, Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> sonne of IOHN DE LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLE, Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and of ELIZABETH, King EDWARD the Fourths eldest sister. This <hi>Earle</hi> was a man of great wit and courage, and had his thoughts highly raysed by Hopes and Expectations for a time. For RICHARD the third had a Resolution, out of his hatred to both his Brethren, King EDWARD, and the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and their Lines, (hauing had his hand in both their blouds) to disable their Issues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on false and incompetent pretexts; the one, of <hi>Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;</hi> the other, of <hi>Illegitimation:</hi> and to designe this <hi>Gentleman</hi> (in case himselfe should die without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) for <hi>Inheritor</hi> of the <hi>Crowne.</hi> Neither was this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the King, who had secretly an Eye vpon him. But the King hauing tasted of the Enuie of the people, for his imprisonment of EDWARD PLAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGENET, was doubtfull to heape vp any more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasts of that kind, by the imprisonment of DE LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLE also; the rather thinking it Policie to conserue him as a <hi>Corriuall</hi> vnto the other. The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne</hi> was induced to participate with the Action of <hi>Ireland,</hi> not lightly vpon the strength of the <hi>Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> there, which was but a <hi>Bubble,</hi> but vpon Letters from the Lady MARGARET of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> in whose succours and declaration for the <hi>Enterprise;</hi> there see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a more solid foundation, both for Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

and Forces. Neither did the <hi>Earle</hi> refraine the Businesse, for that he knew the pretended PLANTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENET to be but an <hi>Idoll.</hi> But contrariwise, hee was more glad it should be the false PLANTAGENET then the true: because the False being sure to fall away of himselfe, and the True to be made sure of by the King; it might open and paue a faire and prepared way to his owne <hi>Title.</hi> With this Resolution hee say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led secretly into <hi>Flanders;</hi> where was a little before arriued the Lord LOVEL, leauing a correspondence here in <hi>England</hi> with Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON, a man of great Power and Dependencies in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi> For before this time, when the pretended PLAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGENET was first receiued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> secret Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers had beene also sent to the Lady MARGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RET, aduertising her what was passed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring Succoures in an Enterprise (as they said) so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and iust, and that God had so miraculously pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the beginning therof; and making offer, that all things should be guided by her will and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as the <hi>Soueraigne Patronesse</hi> and <hi>Protectresse</hi> of the Enterprise. MARGARET was second sister to King EDWARD the Fourth, and had beene second Wife to CHARLES, surnamed the HARDY, Duke of <hi>Burgundie;</hi> by whome, hauing no Children of her owne, she did with singular care and tendernesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Education of PHILIP and MARGARET, Grand-children to her former Husband; which wonne her great loue and authority among the <hi>Dutch.</hi> This <hi>Princesse</hi> (hauing the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Man, and <hi>Malice</hi> of a woman) abounding in <hi>Treasure,</hi> by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her <hi>Dower,</hi> and her prouident Gouernment, and being childlesse, and without any neerer Care, made it her <hi>Designe</hi> and Enterprise, to see the <hi>Maiestie Royall</hi> of <hi>England</hi> once againe re-placed in her House, and had set vp King HENRY as a Marke, at whose
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7276:18"/>
ouerthrow all her actions should ayme and shoote; insomuch as all the <hi>Counsells</hi> of his succeeding trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles came chiefly out of that <hi>Quiuer.</hi> And shee bare such a mortall hatred to the House of LANCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER, and personally to the <hi>King,</hi> as she was no wayes mollified by the <hi>Coniunction</hi> of the Houses in her <hi>Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> marriage, but rather hated her <hi>Neece,</hi> as the meanes of the Kings ascent to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and assurance therein. Wherefore with great violence of affection she embraced this Ouerture. And vpon Counsaile ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and the Lord LOVEL, and some other of the <hi>Partie,</hi> it was resolued with all speed, the two <hi>Lords</hi> assisted with a Regiment of two thousand <hi>Almaines,</hi> being choice and Veterane <hi>Bands,</hi> vnder the command of MARTIN SWART (a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and experimented <hi>Captaine)</hi> should passe ouer into <hi>Ireland</hi> to the new <hi>King.</hi> Hoping, that when the <hi>Action</hi> should haue the face of a receiued and setled <hi>Regalitie</hi> (with such a second Person, as the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and the <hi>Coniunction</hi> and reputation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine succours) the fame of it would imbolden and prepare all the <hi>Partie</hi> of the <hi>Confederates</hi> and <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents</hi> within the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> to giue them assistance, when they should come ouer there. And for the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> it was agreed, that if all things succeeded well, he should be put downe, and the true PLANTAGENET receiued: Wherein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne</hi> had his particular hopes. After they were come into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the <hi>Partie</hi> tooke courage, by seeing themselues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Bodie, they grew very confident of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, conceiuing and discoursing amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that they went in vpon farre better <hi>Cards</hi> to ouerthrow King HENRY, then King HENRY had to ouerthrow King RICHARD. And that if there were not a Sword drawne against them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7276:18"/>
was a <hi>Signe</hi> the Swords in <hi>England</hi> would be soone sheathed, or beaten downe. And first, for a <hi>Brauery</hi> vpon this accession of power, they crowned their new <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> of <hi>Dublin;</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had beene but proclaimed onely; and then sate in <hi>Councell</hi> what should further be done. At which <hi>Councell</hi> though it were propounded by some, that it were the best way to establish themselues first in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to make that the Seat of the Warre, and to draw King HENRY thither in person, by whose ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, they thought there would be great alterations and commotions in <hi>England,</hi> yet because the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> there was poore, and they should not be able to keepe their <hi>Armie</hi> together, nor pay their <hi>Germane.</hi> Soldiers, and for that also the sway of the <hi>Irish-men</hi> and generally of the Men-of-warre, which (as in such cases of Popular tumults is vsuall) did in effect go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne their Leaders, was eager, and in affection to make their fortunes vpon <hi>England;</hi> It was concluded with all possible speed to transport their forces into <hi>England.</hi> The King in the meane time, who at the first when he heard what was done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> though it troubled him, yet thought hee should bee well enough able to scatter the <hi>Irish</hi> as a <hi>Flight</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> and rattle away this <hi>Swarme</hi> of Bees, with their <hi>King;</hi> when hee heard afterwards that the Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> was embarqued in the action, and that the Lady MARGARET was declared for it, he apprehended the danger in a true Degree as it was, and saw plainly that his Kingdome must againe be put to the <hi>Stake,</hi> and that he must fight for it. And first, he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, before he vnderstood of the Earle of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> sayling into <hi>Ireland</hi> out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he should be assailed both vpon the <hi>East-parts</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> by some impression from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>North-west</hi> out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And therefore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7276:19"/>
hauing ordered Musters to be made in both <hi>Parts,</hi> and hauing prouisionally designed two <hi>Generals,</hi> IAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and IOHN Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> (meaning himselfe also to goe in person, where the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires should most require it) and neuerthelesse not expecting any actuall <hi>Inuasion</hi> at that time (the Winter being farre on) he tooke his iourney himselfe towards <hi>Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Northfolke,</hi> for the confirming of those parts. And being come to S. <hi>Edmonds-bury,</hi> hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that THOMAS, Marquesse <hi>Dorset</hi> (who had beene one of the <hi>Pledges</hi> in <hi>France)</hi> was hasting towards him, to purge himselfe of some Accusations which had beene made against him. But the King, though hee kept an Eare for him, yet was the time so doubtfull, that hee sent the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> to meet him, and forth with to carry him to the <hi>Tower;</hi> with a faire Message neuerthelesse, that hee should beare that disgrace with patience, for that the King meant not his hurt, but onely to preserue him from doing hurt, either to the Kings seruice, or to himselfe; and that the King should alwayes be able (when hee had cleared himselfe) to make him reparation.</p>
            <p>From S. <hi>Edmonds-bury</hi> he went to <hi>Norwich,</hi> where he kept his <hi>Christmas.</hi> And from thence he went (in a manner of <hi>Pilgrimage)</hi> to Walsingham, where hee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited our <hi>Ladies Church,</hi> famous for <hi>miracles,</hi> and made his Prayers and Vowes for helpe and deliuerance. And from thence he returned by <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Not long after, the <hi>Rebels,</hi> with their King (vnder the Leading of the Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> the Lord LOVEL, and Colonell SWART) landed at <hi>Fouldrey</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> whither there repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, Sir THOMAS BROVGHTON, with some small companie of <hi>English.</hi> The King by that time (knowing now the Storme would not diuide, but fall in one place) had leuied <hi>Forces</hi> in good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7276:19"/>
number; And in person (taking with him his two designed <hi>Generals,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Oxford)</hi> was come on his way towards them as farre as <hi>Couentry,</hi> whence he sent forth a troupe of <hi>Light-Horsemen</hi> for discouerie, and to intercept some straglers of the Enemies, by whom he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstand the particulars of their Progresse and purposes, which was accordingly done; though the King otherwise was not without intelligence from <hi>Espials</hi> in the <hi>Campe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Rebels</hi> tooke their way towards <hi>Yorke,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spoyling the <hi>Countrie,</hi> or any act of Hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the better to put themselues into fauour of the people, and to personate their <hi>King:</hi> who (no doubt, out of a princely feeling) was sparing, and compassionate towards his Subiects. But their <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> did not gather as it went. For the people came not in to them: Neither did any rise or declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in other parts of the Kingdome for them, which was caused partly by the good taste that the King had giuen his People of his <hi>Gouernement,</hi> ioyned with the reputation of his <hi>Felicitie;</hi> and partly for that it was an odious thing to the people of <hi>England,</hi> to haue a King brought in to them vpon the shoulders of <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> of which their Armie was in substance compounded. Neither was it a thing done with any great iudgement on the <hi>Party</hi> of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> for them to take their way towards <hi>Yorke:</hi> Considering that howsoeuer those parts had formerly beene a <hi>Nurserie</hi> of their friends; yet it was there, where the Lord LOVEL had so lately disbanded, and where the Kings presence had a little before qualified discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne</hi> deceiued of his hopes of the Countries concourse vnto him (in which case he would haue temporized) and seeing the businesse past Retract, resolued to make on where the King was,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7276:20"/>
and to giue him battaile; and therupon, marched towards <hi>Newarke,</hi> thinking to haue surprized the Towne. But the King was somewhat before this time come to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where he called a <hi>Councell</hi> of Warre, at which was consulted, whether it were best to protract time, or speedily to set vpon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi> In which <hi>Councell</hi> the King himselfe (whose continuall vigilancie did sucke in sometimes cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse suspitions, which few else knew) inclined to the accelerating a <hi>Battaile.</hi> But this was presently put out of doubt, by the great aides that came in to him in the instant of this Consultation, partly vpon <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siues,</hi> and partly <hi>Voluntaries</hi> from many parts of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The principall persons that came then to the Kings aide, were the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Shrewesburie,</hi> and the Lord STRANGE, of the <hi>Nobilitie:</hi> and of <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to the number of at least threescore and tenne persons, with their Companies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the whole, at the least six thousand fighting men, besides the <hi>Forces</hi> that were with the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Wherupon the King, finding his Armie so brauely re-enforced, and a great alacritie in all his men to fight, was confirmed in his former resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and marched speedily, so as hee put himselfe betweene the Enemies <hi>Campe</hi> and <hi>Newarke;</hi> being loth their Armie should get the commoditie of that Towne. The <hi>Earle</hi> nothing dismayed, came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that day vnto a little Village called <hi>Stoke,</hi> and there encamped that night, vpon the Brow or hanging of a hill. The King the next day presented him Battaile vpon the <hi>Plaine,</hi> the fields there being open and champion. The <hi>Earle</hi> couragiously came downe and ioyned Battaile with him. Concerning which <hi>Battaile,</hi> the relations that are left vnto vs are so naked, and negligent (though it be an action of so
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7276:20"/>
recent memorie) as they rather declare the <hi>Successe</hi> of the day, then the <hi>Manner</hi> of the fight. They say, that the King diuided his Armie into three <hi>Battailes,</hi> whereof the <hi>vant-guard</hi> onely well strengthened with wings, came to fight. That the <hi>Fight</hi> was fierce and obstinate, and lasted three houres, before the victorie inclined either way; saue that Iudgement might be made, by that the Kings <hi>Vant-guard</hi> of it selfe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fight against the whole <hi>Power</hi> of the Enemies, (the other two <hi>Battailes</hi> remaining out of action) what the successe was like to bee in the end. That MARTIN SWART with his <hi>Germanes</hi> performed brauely; and so did those few <hi>English</hi> that were on that side, neither did the <hi>Irish</hi> faile in courage or fiercenesse, but being almost naked men, only armed with <hi>Darts</hi> and <hi>Skeines,</hi> it was rather an <hi>Execution,</hi> then a <hi>fight</hi> vpon them; insomuch as the furious slaughter of them was a great discouragement and appalement to the rest; That there died vpon the place all the <hi>Chiefetaines;</hi> That is, the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Kildare,</hi> FRANCIS Lord LOVEL, MARTIN SWART, and Sir THOMAS BROVGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON; all making good the fight without any ground giuen. Onely of the Lord LOVEL there went a report, that he fled and swam ouer <hi>Trent</hi> on horsebacke, but could not recouer the further side, by reason of the steepnesse of the Banke, and so was drowned in the <hi>Riuer.</hi> But another <hi>Report</hi> leaues him not there, but that he liued long after in a Caue or Vault. The number that was slaine in the field, was of the <hi>Enemies</hi> part, foure thousand at the least; and of the <hi>Kings</hi> part, one halfe of his <hi>Vant-guard,</hi> besides many hurt, but none of name. There were taken prisoners amongst others, the <hi>Counterfet</hi> PLANTAGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET (now, LAMBERT SIMNELL againe) and the crastie <hi>Priest</hi> his <hi>Tutor.</hi> For LAMBERT, the King
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7276:21"/>
would not take his life, both out of Magnanimitie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him but as an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Wax,</hi> that others had tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and moulded; and likewise out of wisdome, thinking that if he suffered death, he would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten too soone; but being kept aliue, he would be a continuall <hi>Spectacle,</hi> and a kind of remedie against the like <hi>Inchantments</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> in time to come. For which cause hee was taken into seruice in his <hi>Court</hi> to a base office in his <hi>Kitchin;</hi> so that (in a kind of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacina</hi> of humane fortune) Hee turned a <hi>Broach,</hi> that had worne a <hi>Crowne.</hi> Whereas Fortune commonly doth not bring in a <hi>Comedie</hi> or <hi>Farce</hi> after a <hi>Tragedy.</hi> And afterwards hee was preferred to be one of the Kings <hi>Falconers.</hi> As to the <hi>Priest,</hi> he was committed <hi>Close prisoner,</hi> and heard of no more; the King louing to seale vp his owne dangers.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Battaile,</hi> the King went to <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where he caused <hi>Supplications</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiuings</hi> to be made for his Deliuerance and Victorie. And that his Deuotions might goe round in <hi>Circle,</hi> he sent his <hi>Banner</hi> to bee offered to our Ladie of <hi>Walsingham,</hi> where before he made his <hi>Vows.</hi> And thus deliuered of this so strange an <hi>Engine</hi> &amp; new <hi>Inuention</hi> of Fortune, he returned to his former confidence of minde, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king now, that all his misfortunes had come at once. But it fell out vnto him according to the <hi>Speech</hi> of the <hi>Common people</hi> in the beginning of his reigne, that said; <hi>It was a token he should reigne in labour, because his reigne began with a sicknesse of Sweat.</hi> But howsoeuer the King thought himselfe now in a <hi>Hauen,</hi> yet such was his wisdome, as his <hi>Confidence</hi> did seldome dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his <hi>Fore-sight,</hi> especially in things neare hand. And therefore awakened by so fresh, and vnexpected dangers, hee entred into due consideration, aswell how to weed out the <hi>Partakers</hi> of the former <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> as to kill the <hi>Seeds</hi> of the like in time to come:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7276:21"/>
and withall to take away all <hi>Shelters</hi> and <hi>Harbours</hi> for discontented <hi>Persons,</hi> where they might hatch and foster <hi>Rebellions,</hi> which afterwards might gather strength and motion. And first, he did yet againe make a <hi>Progresse</hi> from <hi>Lincolne</hi> to the <hi>Northerne Parts,</hi> though it were indeed rather an <hi>Itinerarie Circuit</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> then a <hi>Progresse.</hi> For all along as he went, with much seueritie and strict inquisition, partly by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Law,</hi> and partly by <hi>Commission,</hi> were punished, the <hi>Adherents,</hi> and <hi>Ayders</hi> of the late <hi>Rebels.</hi> Not all by death, (for the Field had drawne much bloud) but by <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Ransomes</hi> which spared <hi>Life,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Treasure.</hi> Amongst other Crimes of this nature, there was diligent Inquirie made of such as had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and dispersed abruit and rumour, a little before the Field fought, <hi>That the Rebels had the day; and that the Kings Armie was ouerthrowne, and the King fled.</hi> Whereby it was supposed that many Succours, which otherwise would haue come vnto the King, were cunningly put off, and kept backe. Which <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Accusation,</hi> though it had some ground, yet it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously embraced and put on by diuers, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene in themselues not the best affected to the Kings part, nor forward to come to his aid, were glad to apprehend this colour, to couer their neglect and coldnesse, vnder the pretence of such discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. Which cunning neuerthelesse, the King would not vnderstand, though he lodged it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in some particulars, as his manner was.</p>
            <p>But for the extirpating of the Roots and causes of the like <hi>Commotions</hi> in time to come, the King began to find where his Shooe did wring him, and that it was his depressing of the <hi>House</hi> of YORKE, that did rancle and fester the affections of his People. And therefore being now too wise to disdaine perils any longer, and willing to giue some concentment in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7276:22"/>
that kind (at least in <hi>Ceremonie)</hi> he resolued at last to proceed to the <hi>Coronation</hi> of his <hi>Queene.</hi> And therefore at his comming to <hi>London,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in state, and in a kind of <hi>Triumph,</hi> and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated his <hi>Victorie,</hi> with two dayes of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (for the first day he repaired to <hi>Pauls,</hi> and had the <hi>Hymne</hi> of <hi>Te Deum</hi> sung, and the morrow after he went in <hi>Procession,</hi> and heard the Sermon at the <hi>Crosse)</hi> the <hi>Queene</hi> was with great solemnitie crowned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the fiue and twentieth of <hi>Nouember,</hi> in the third yeare of his reigne, which was about two yeares after the marriage; <hi>Like an old Christning, that had stayed long for Godfathers.</hi> Which strange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsuall distance of time, madeit subiect to euery mans note, that it was an Act against his stomacke, and put vpon him by necessitie and reason of <hi>State.</hi> Soone after, to shew that it was now faire weather againe, and that the imprisonment of THOMAS <hi>Marquesse Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi> was rather vpon suspicion of the Time, then of the man, hee the said <hi>Marquesse</hi> was set at libertie without examination, or other circumstance. At that time also the King sent an <hi>Ambassadour</hi> vnto <hi>Pope</hi> INNOCENT, signifying vnto him this his Marriage, and that now (like another AENEAS) he had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the flouds of his former troubles and trauailes, and was arriued vnto a safe <hi>Hauen:</hi> and thanking his <hi>Holinesse,</hi> that he had honoured the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of his Marriage with the presence of his <hi>Ambassadour:</hi> and offering both his <hi>Person</hi> and the forces of his <hi>Kingdome</hi> vpon all occasions to doe him seruice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ambassadour</hi> making his Oration to the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the presence of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> did so magnifie the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queene,</hi> as was enough to glut the Hearers. But then he did againe so exroll and deifie the <hi>Pope,</hi> as made all that he had said in praise of his <hi>Master</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7276:22"/>
               <hi>Mistresse</hi> seeme temperate and passable. But hee was very honourably entertained, and extreamly much made on by the <hi>Pope.</hi> Who knowing himselfe to bee Lazie and vnprofitable to the <hi>Christian world,</hi> was wonderfully glad to heare that there were such <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes</hi> of him sounding in remote parts. Hee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned also of the <hi>Pope</hi> a very iust and honorable <hi>Bull,</hi> qualifying the <hi>Priuiledges</hi> of <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> (wherewith the king had beene extreamely gauled) in three points.</p>
            <p>The first, that if any <hi>Sanstuarie man</hi> did by night or otherwise, get out of <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> priuily, and commit mischiefe and trespasse, and then come in againe, hee should lose the benefit of <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> for euer after. The second, that howsoeuer the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie-man</hi> was protected from his <hi>Creditors,</hi> yet his Goods out of <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> should not. The third, that if any tooke <hi>Sanstuarie</hi> for case of <hi>Treason,</hi> the King might appoint him <hi>Keepers</hi> to looke to him in <hi>Sanctuarie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King also for the better securing of his estate, against mutinous and malecontented Subiects (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of He saw the <hi>Realme</hi> was full) who might haue their refuge into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was not vnder Key, as the <hi>Ports</hi> were; For that cause, rather then for any doubt of Hostilitie from those parts, before his comming to <hi>London</hi> (when he was at <hi>Newcastle)</hi> had sent a solemne Ambassage vnto IAMES the third, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to treate and conclude a peace with him. The <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> were RICHARD FOXE Bishop of <hi>Excester,</hi> and Sir RICHARD EDGCOMBE <hi>Comptroller</hi> of the Kings House, who were honourably receiued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained there. But the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> labouring of the same disease that King HENRY did (though more mortall, as afterwards appeared) that is, <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Subiects,</hi> apt to rise, and raise Tumuh, although
<pb n="04" facs="tcp:7276:23"/>
in his owne affection hee did much desire to make a Peace with the King; Yet finding his <hi>Nobles</hi> auerse, and not daring to displease them, concluded onely a <hi>Truce</hi> for seuen yeeres; giuing neuerthelesse promise in priuate, that it should bee renewed from time to time, during the two Kings liues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HItherto</hi> the King had beene exercised in setling his affaires at home. But about this time brake forth an occasion that drew him to looke abroad, and to hearken to forraine businesse. CHARLES the eight the French King, by the vertue and good fortune of his two immediate Predecessors, CHARLES the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth his <hi>Grand-father,</hi> and LEWES the eleuenth his Father, receiued the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> in more flourishing and spread Estate, than it had beene of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares before; being redintegrate in those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Members,</hi> which anciently had beene portions of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and were after disseuered, so as they remained onely in <hi>Homage,</hi> and not in <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie</hi> (being gouerned by absolute Princes of their owne) <hi>Angeou, Normandy, Prouence,</hi> and <hi>Burgundie.</hi> There remained only <hi>Brittaine</hi> to be revnited, and so the <hi>Monarchie</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to be reduced to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Termes and Bounds.</p>
            <p>King CHARLES was not a little inflamed with an ambition to repurchase, and reannex that <hi>Duchie.</hi> Which his ambition was a wise and well weighed Ambition; not like vnto the ambitions of his succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding enterprizes of <hi>Italie.</hi> For at that time being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> he was somewhat guided by his Fathers <hi>Counsels (Counsels,</hi> not <hi>Counsellors)</hi> for his Father was his owne <hi>Counsell,</hi> and had few able men about him. And that King (be knew well) had euer distasted the designes of <hi>Italie,</hi> and in particular had an eye vpon <hi>Brittaine.</hi> There were many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7276:23"/>
that did feed the ambition of CHARLES, with pregnant and apparant hopes of <hi>Successe.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> old, and entred into a <hi>Lethargie,</hi> and serued with <hi>Mercenarie Counsellors,</hi> father of two only daughters, the one sickly and not like to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. King CHARLES himselfe in the flower of his age, and the Subiects of <hi>France</hi> at that time well tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Warre, both for <hi>Leaders</hi> and <hi>Souldiers;</hi> men of seruice being not yet worne out, since the warres of LEWIS against <hi>Burgundie.</hi> Hee found himselfe also in peace with all his <hi>Neighbour-Princes.</hi> As for those that might oppose to his enterprise; MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN King of <hi>Romans,</hi> his <hi>Riuall</hi> in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, (as well for the <hi>Duchy,</hi> as the <hi>Daughter)</hi> feeble in meanes; and King HENRY of <hi>England</hi> aswell somwhat obnoxious to him for his fauours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, as busied in his particular noubles at home. There was also a faire and specious occasion offered him to hide his ambition, and to iustifie his warring vpon <hi>Britaine,</hi> for that the <hi>Duke</hi> had receiued, and succoured LEWIS Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and other of the French <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> which had taken Armes against their King. Wherfore King CHARLES being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued vpon that Warre, knew well he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any opposition so potent, as if King HENRY should either vpon <hi>Policie</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> in preuenting the growing greatnesse of <hi>France:</hi> or vpon gratitude vnto the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> for his former fauours, in the time of his distresse, espouse that quarrell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himselfe in aide of the <hi>Duke.</hi> Therfore hee no sooner heard that King HENRY was setled by his victorie, but forth with he sent <hi>Ambassadours</hi> vnto him, to pray his assistance, or at the least that hee would stand neutrall. Which <hi>Ambassadours</hi> found the King at <hi>Leicester,</hi> and deliuered their <hi>Ambassage</hi> to this effect. They first imparted vnto the King the successe that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7276:24"/>
their <hi>Master</hi> had had a little before against MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN, in recouerie of certaine Townes from him: which was done in a kind of priuacie, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards the King; as if the <hi>French-king</hi> did not esteeme him for an outward or formall <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> but as one that had part in his affections and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and with whom he tooke pleasure to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his businesse. After this <hi>Complement,</hi> and some gratulation for the Kings victorie, they fell to their errand; declaring to the King, that their <hi>Master</hi> was enforced to enter into a iust and necessarie Warre with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> for that hee had receiued and succoured those that were <hi>Traitors,</hi> and Declared Enemies vnto his Person and <hi>State.</hi> That they were no meane, distressed, and calamitous <hi>Persons</hi> that fled to him for refuge, but of so great qualitie, as it was apparant that they came not thither to protect their owne fortune, but to infest and inuade his; the <hi>Head</hi> of them being the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the first <hi>Prince</hi> of the bloud, and the second Person of <hi>France.</hi> That therfore, rightly to vnderstand it, it was rather on their <hi>Masters</hi> part a <hi>Defensiue</hi> Warre, then an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue;</hi> as that, that could not bee omitted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, if he tendred the conseruation of his owne <hi>Estate;</hi> and that it was not the first <hi>Blow</hi> that made the Warre inuasiue, (for that no wise Prince would stay for) but the first <hi>Prouocation,</hi> or at least the first <hi>Preparation.</hi> Nay that this Warre was rather a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> of <hi>Rebels,</hi> then a Warre with a iust Enemie, where the case is; That his Subiects, <hi>Traitors,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> his <hi>Homager.</hi> That King HENRY knew well what went vpon it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if <hi>Neighbour-Princes</hi> should patronize and comfort <hi>Rebels,</hi> against the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> and of <hi>Leagues.</hi> Neuerthelesse that their <hi>Master</hi> was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the King had beene beholding to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7276:24"/>
               <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> in his aduersitie; as on the other side, they knew he would not forget also the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their <hi>King,</hi> in ayding him when the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> or his mercenary <hi>Councellors</hi> failed him, and would haue betrayed him; And that there was a great difference betweene the courtesies receiued from their <hi>Master,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine;</hi> for that the <hi>Dukes</hi> might haue ends of vtilitie and <hi>Bargaine;</hi> whereas their <hi>Masters</hi> could not haue proceeded but out of entire <hi>Affection.</hi> For that, if it had beene mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by a politicke line, it had beene better for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, that a <hi>Tyrant</hi> should haue reigned in <hi>England,</hi> troubled and hated, then such a <hi>Prince,</hi> whose vertues could not saile to make him great and potent, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he was come to be <hi>Master</hi> of his affaires. But howsoeuer it stood for the point of obligation, which the <hi>King</hi> might owe to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> yet their <hi>Master</hi> was well assured, it would not diuert King HENRY of <hi>England</hi> from doing that, that was iust, nor euer embarke him in so ill grounded a quarrell. Therefore, since this Warre which their <hi>Master</hi> was now to make, was but to deliuer himselfe from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, their <hi>King</hi> hoped the <hi>King</hi> would shew the like affection to the conseruation of their <hi>Masters</hi> estate, as their <hi>Master</hi> had (when time was) shewed to the Kings acquisition of his Kingdome. At the least, that according to the inclination which the <hi>King</hi> had euer professed of peace, he would looke on, and stand <hi>Neutrall;</hi> for that their <hi>Master</hi> could not with reason presse him to vndertake part in the Warre, being so newly setled and recouered from intestine seditions. But touching the <hi>Mysterie</hi> of reannexing of the <hi>Duchy</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> either by Warre, or by marriage with the Daughter of <hi>Britaine;</hi> the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> bare aloofe from it, as from a <hi>Rocke,</hi> knowing that it made most against them. And therefore by all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7276:25"/>
meanes declined any mention thereof, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise interlaced in their conference with the King, the assured purpose of their <hi>Master,</hi> to match with the Daughter of MAXIMILIAN; And entertained the King also with some wandring Discourses of their Kings purpose, to recouer by Armes his right to the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> by an expedition in Person; All to remoue the King from all iealousie of any <hi>Designe,</hi> in these hither Parts vpon <hi>Britaine,</hi> otherwise then for quenching of the fire, which hee feared might bee kindled in his owne estate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> after aduice taken with his <hi>Coùncell,</hi> made answer to the <hi>Ambassadors.</hi> And first returned their <hi>Complement,</hi> shewing hee was right glad of the <hi>French Kings</hi> reception of those Townes from MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN. Then hee familiarly related some particular passages of his owne aduentures and victorie passed. As to the businesse of <hi>Britaine,</hi> the King answered in few words; That the <hi>French</hi> King and the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> were the two persons to whom hee was most obliged of all men; and that hee should thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very vnhappie, if things should goe so betweene them, as he should not be able to acquite himselfe in gratitude towards them both; and that there was no meanes for him as a <hi>Christian</hi> King and a Common friend to them, to satisfie all obligations both to God and Man, but to offer himselfe for a <hi>Mediator</hi> of an <hi>Accord</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> betweene them; by which course he doubted not but their Kings estate and honour both, would be preserued with more <hi>Safetie</hi> and lesse <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis</hi> then by a Warre, and that hee would spare no cost or paines, no if it were <hi>To goe on Pilgrimage,</hi> for so good an effect; And concluded, that in this great <hi>Affaire,</hi> which he tooke so much to heart, hee would expresse himselfe more fully by an <hi>Ambassage,</hi> which he would speedily dispatch vnto the <hi>French</hi> King for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7276:25"/>
And in this sort the French <hi>Ambassadors</hi> were dismissed; The King auoiding to vnderstand any thing touching the re-annexing of <hi>Britaine,</hi> as the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> had auoided to mention it; saue that hee gaue a little touch of it in the word, <hi>Enuie.</hi> And so it was, that the King was neither so shallow, nor so ill aduertised, as not to perceiue the intention of the <hi>French,</hi> for the inuesting himselfe of <hi>Britaine.</hi> But first he was vtterly vnwilling (howsoeuer hee gaue out) to enter into Warre with <hi>France.</hi> A <hi>Fame</hi> of a Warre he liked well, but not an <hi>Atchieuement;</hi> for the one hee thought would make him <hi>Richer,</hi> and the other <hi>Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:</hi> and hee was possessed with many secret feares, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his owne people, which hee was therfore loth to arme, and put weapons into their hands. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding (as a prudent and couragious <hi>Prince)</hi> he was not so auerse from a Warre, but that he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to choose it, rather then to haue <hi>Britaine</hi> carried by <hi>France,</hi> being so great and opulent a <hi>Duchy,</hi> and situate so opportunely to annoy <hi>England,</hi> either for <hi>Coast,</hi> or <hi>Trade.</hi> But the Kings hopes were, that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by negligence, commonly imputed to the <hi>French</hi> (especially in the <hi>Court</hi> of a young King) and partly by the natiue power of <hi>Britaine</hi> it selfe, which was not small; but chiefely in respect of the great <hi>Partie,</hi> that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance</hi> had in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and therby meanes to stirre vp <hi>Ciuill</hi> troubles, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the <hi>French-king</hi> from the enterprise of <hi>Britaine:</hi> And lastly, in regard of the power of MAXIMILIAN, who was <hi>Corriuall</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King in that <hi>Pursuit,</hi> the <hi>Enterprize</hi> would eyther bow to a pace, or breake in it selfe. In all which, the King measured and valued things amisse, as afterwards appeared. He sent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forth with to the <hi>French</hi> King, CHRISTOPHER VRSWICKE, his <hi>Chaplaine,</hi> a person by him much trusted and imployed: choosing him the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7276:26"/>
he was a <hi>Church-man,</hi> as best sorting with an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie</hi> of <hi>Pacification:</hi> and giuing him also a <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> That if the <hi>French King</hi> consented to treat, hee should thence repaire to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and ripen the <hi>Treatie</hi> on both parts. VRSWICK made declaration to the <hi>French King,</hi> much to the purpose of the Kings answer to the <hi>French Ambassadours</hi> here; instilling also tenderly some ouerture of receiuing to grace the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and some taste of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Accord. But the <hi>French King</hi> on the other side proceeded not sincerely, but with a great deale of art and dissimulation, in this <hi>Treatie;</hi> hauing for his end to gaine time, and so put off the <hi>English-Succors,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope of <hi>Peace,</hi> till he had got good footing in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> by force of <hi>Armes.</hi> Wherefore he answered the <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> That hee would put himselfe into the Kings hands, and make him <hi>Arbiter</hi> of the Peace: and willingly consented, that the <hi>Ambassadour</hi> should straight wayes passe into <hi>Britaine,</hi> to signifie this his consent, and to know the <hi>Dukes</hi> minde likewise; well fore-seeing, that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> by whom the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> was wholly led, taking himselfe to be vpon termes irreconcileable with him, would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no <hi>Treatie</hi> of Peace. Whereby hee should in one, both generally abroad veyle ouer his Ambition, and winne the reputation of iust and moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and should withall endeare himselfe in the Affections of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as one, that had committed all to his Will: Nay, and (which was yet more fine) make Faith in him, That although he went on with the Warre, yet it should be but with his <hi>Sword</hi> in his hand, to bend the stiffenesse of the other party to accept of Peace: and so the <hi>King</hi> should take no vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of his arming and prosecution; but the <hi>Treatie</hi> to be kept on foot; to the very last instant, till hee were <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:7276:26"/>
Which grounds being by the <hi>French King</hi> wisely laid, all things fell out as he expected. For when the <hi>English Ambassadour</hi> came to the Court of <hi>Britaine,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> was then scarcely perfect in his memorie, and all things were directed by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance;</hi> who gaue audience to the <hi>Chaplaine</hi> VRSWICK, and vpon his <hi>Ambassage</hi> deliuered, made answer in somewhat high termes: That the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> hauing beene an <hi>Host,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Parent</hi> or <hi>Foster-father</hi> to the King, in his tendernesse of age, and weaknesse of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, did looke for at this time from King HENRY (the renowned King of <hi>England)</hi> rather braue <hi>Troupes</hi> for his Succours, then a vaine <hi>Treatie</hi> of Peace. And if the King could forget the good Offices of the <hi>Duke</hi> done vnto him aforetime; yet he knew well, he would in his wisdome consider of the future, how much it imported his owne safetie, and reputation, both in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine parts, and with his owne people, not to suffer <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> (the old <hi>Confederates</hi> of <hi>England)</hi> to be swallowed vp by <hi>France,</hi> and so many good <hi>Ports,</hi> and strong <hi>Townes</hi> vpon the <hi>Coast,</hi> be in the command of so potent a <hi>Neighbour-King,</hi> and so ancient an <hi>Enemie.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly desired the King to thinke of this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as his owne; and therewith brake off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any further conference for <hi>Treatie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VRSWICK returned first to the <hi>French King,</hi> and related to him what had passed. Who finding things to sort to his desire, tooke hold of them, and said; That the <hi>Ambassadour</hi> might perceiue now, that which he for his part, partly imagined before. That considering in what hands the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> was, there would be no <hi>Peace,</hi> but by a mixt <hi>Treatie</hi> of force and perswasion. And therfore he would goe on with the one, and desired the <hi>King</hi> not to desist from the other. But for his owne part, he did faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promise, to bee still in the Kings power, to rule
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7276:27"/>
him in the matter of Peace. This was accordingly represented vnto the <hi>King</hi> by VRSWICK at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and in such a fashion, as if the <hi>Treatie</hi> were in no sort desperate, but rather stayed for a better houre, till the <hi>Hammer</hi> had wrought, and beat the <hi>Partie</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> more pliant. Whereupon there passed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>Packets</hi> and <hi>Dispatches</hi> betweene the two <hi>Kings,</hi> from the <hi>One</hi> out of <hi>desire,</hi> and from the other out of <hi>dissimulation,</hi> about the negotiation of Peace. The <hi>French King</hi> meane while inuaded <hi>Britaine</hi> with great forces, and distressed the Citie of <hi>Nantes</hi> with a strait siege, and (as one, who though hee had no great Iudgement, yet had that, that hee could dissemble home) the more he did vrge the prosecution of the <hi>Warre,</hi> the more he did at the same time, vrge the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the <hi>Peace.</hi> Insomuch as during the siege of <hi>Nantes,</hi> after many Letters and particular messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the better to maintaine his dissimulation, and to refresh the <hi>Treatie;</hi> he sent BERNARD DAVBIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEY (a person of good qualitie) to the King, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to desire him, to make an end of the businesse howsoeuer.</p>
            <p>The King was no lesse readie to reuiue and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Treatie;</hi> And therupon sent three <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Abington,</hi> Sir RICHARD TVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAL, and CHAPLEINE VRSWICK formerly imployed, to doe their vtmost endeuours, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the <hi>Treatie</hi> roundly and strongly.</p>
            <p>About this time the Lord WOODVILE, (Vncle to the <hi>Queene)</hi> a valiant gentleman, &amp; desirous of honor, sued to the King, that he might raise some <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Voluntaries</hi> vnder-hand, and without licence or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port (wherein the King might any wayes appeare) goe to the aide of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine.</hi> The King denied his request, (or at least seemed so to doe) and layed strait commandement vpon him, that hee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7276:27"/>
should not stirre, for that the King thought his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would suffer therein, during a <hi>Treatie,</hi> to better a <hi>Partie.</hi> Neuerthelesse this <hi>Lord</hi> (either being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, or out of conceipt that the King would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly dislike that, which he would not openly auow) sailed secretly ouer into the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> whereof hee was <hi>Gouernour,</hi> and leuied a faire <hi>Troupe</hi> of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and with them passed ouer into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and ioyned himselfe with the <hi>Dukes</hi> Forces. The Newes whereof when it came to the <hi>French Court,</hi> put diuers <hi>Young Bloods</hi> into such a furie, as the <hi>English Ambassadors</hi> were not without perill to bee outraged. But the <hi>French King</hi> both to preserue the Priuiledge of <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and being conscious to himselfe that in the businesse of Peace, hee himselfe was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dissembler of the two, forbade all iniuries of fact or word, against their persons, or Followers. And presently came an <hi>Agent</hi> from the King, to purge himselfe touching the Lord WOODVILES going ouer, vsing for a principall argument, to demonstrate that it was without his priuitie, for that the <hi>Troupes</hi> were so small, as neither had the <hi>Face</hi> of a succour by authoritie; nor could much aduance the <hi>Brittaine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. To which message, although the <hi>French King</hi> gaue no full credit, yet he made faire weather with the King, and seemed satisfied. Soone after the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Ambassadors</hi> returned, hauing two of them beene likewise with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and found things in no other termes, then they were before. Vpon their returne, they informed the King of the state of the affaires, and how farre the <hi>French King</hi> was from any true meaning of Peace; and therefore he was now to aduise of some other course. Neither was the King himselfe lead all this while with credulity meerely, as was generally supposed: But his Error was not so much facility of beleefe, as an ill measuring of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the other <hi>Partie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7276:28"/>
For (as was partly touched before) the King had cast the businesse thus with himselfe. He tooke it for granted in his owne iudgement, that the Warre of <hi>Britaine,</hi> in respect of the strength of the <hi>Townes,</hi> and of the <hi>Partie,</hi> could not speedily come to a <hi>Period.</hi> For he conceiued that the Counsels of a Warre, that was vndertaken by the <hi>French King,</hi> then childlesse, against an <hi>Heire-apparant</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> would be very faint and slow. And besides, that it was not possible, but that the state of <hi>France</hi> should be imbroiled with some troubles and alterations in fauour of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance.</hi> Hee conceiued likewise, that MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN, King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was a Prince warlike and potent; who (he made account) would giue suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to the <hi>Britaines</hi> roundly. So then iudging it would be a worke of <hi>Time,</hi> hee laide his plot, how hee might best make vse of that <hi>Time,</hi> for his owne affaires. Wherein first hee thought to make his vantage vpon his <hi>Parliament;</hi> knowing that they being affectionate vnto the quarrell of <hi>Britaine,</hi> would giue treasure largely. Which treasure, as a noise of Warre might draw forth; so a peace succeeding might cofer vp. And because hee knew his people were hot vpon the businesse, hee chose rather to seeme to bee deceiued, and lulled asleepe by the <hi>French,</hi> then to be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in himselfe; considering his <hi>Subiects</hi> were not so fully capable of the reasons of <hi>State,</hi> which made him hold backe. Wherefore to all these purposes hee saw no other expedient, then to set and keepe on foot a continuall <hi>Treatie</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> laying it downe, and taking it vp againe, as the occurrence required. Besides, he had in consideration the point of Honour in bearing the blessed person of a <hi>Pacificator.</hi> Hee thought likewise to make vse of the Enuie, that the <hi>French King</hi> met with, by occasion of this Warre of <hi>Britaine,</hi> in strengthening himselfe with new allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7276:28"/>
as namely that of FERDINANDO of <hi>Spaine,</hi> with whom he had euer a consent euen in nature and customes; and likewise with MAXIMILIAN, who was particularly interessed. So that in substance hee promised himselfe Money, Honour, Friends, and Peace in the end. But those things were too fine to be fortunate, and succeed in all parts; for that great affaires are commonly too rough and stubborne to be wrought vpon by the finer edges, or points of wit. The King was likewise deceiued in his two main grounds. For although he had reason to conceiue, that the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>France</hi> wold be wary to put the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Warre against the <hi>Heire-apparant</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> yet hee did not consider, that CHARLES was not guided by any of the principall of the <hi>Bloud</hi> or <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> but by meane Men, who would make it their <hi>Master-peece</hi> of Credit and fauour, to giue venturous Counsels, which no great or wise Man durst, or would. And for MAXIMILIAN, he was thought then a <hi>Greater-matter</hi> then he was; his vnstable and necessitous Courses being not then knowne.</p>
            <p>After Consultation with the <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> who brought him no other newes, then he expected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though he would not seeme to know it till then) he presently summoned his <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in open <hi>Parliament</hi> propounded the cause of <hi>Britaine</hi> to both <hi>Houses,</hi> by his <hi>Chancellor</hi> MORTON <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> who spake to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY Lords and Masters; The Kings Grace our Soueraigne Lord, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to declare vnto you the causes that haue moued him at this time to summon this his Parliament; which I shall doe in few words,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7276:29"/>
crauing pardon of his Grace, and you all, if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it not as I would.</p>
            <p>His Grace doth first of all let you know, that he retaineth in thankefull memorie the loue and loyaltie shewed to him by you, at your last Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in establishment of his royaltie; freeing and discharging of his partakers, and confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Traytors and Rebels: more then which could not come from Subiects to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, in one action. This he taketh so well at your hands, as he hath made it a Resolution to himselfe, to communicate with so louing and well approued Subiects, in all Affaires that are of publike nature, at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>Two therefore are the causes of your present assembling: the one, a forraigne Businesse; the other, matter of gouernment at home.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French King</hi> (as no doubt yee haue heard) maketh at this present hot warre vpon the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine.</hi> His Armie is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nantes,</hi> and holdeth it straitly besieged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principall Citie (if not in Ceremonte and Preheminence, yet in Strength and Wealth) of that <hi>Duchie.</hi> Yee may guesse at his Hopes, by his attempting of the hardest part of the Warre first. The cause of this Warre he knoweth best. Hee alleageth the entertaining and succouring of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7276:29"/>
some other <hi>French</hi> Lords, whom the King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for his Enemies. Others diuine of other Matters. Both parts haue by their <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours</hi> diuers times prayed the Kings Aids: The <hi>French King</hi> Aides, or Neutralitie; the <hi>Britons</hi> Aides simply; for so their case requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. The King, as a Christian Prince, and blessed Sonne of the Holy Church, hath offered himselfe as a Mediator, to treat a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. The <hi>French King</hi> yeeldeth to treat, but will not stay the prosecution of the Warre. The <hi>Britons,</hi> that desire Peace most, hearken to it least; not vpon confidence or stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but vpon distrust of true meaning, seeing the Warre goes on. So as the King, after as much paines and care to effect a Peace, as euer he tooke in any Businesse, not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the Prosecution on the one side, nor the Distrust on the other, caused by that Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath let fall the <hi>Treatie;</hi> not repenting of it, but desparing of it now, as not likely to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Therefore by this Narratiue you now vnderstand the state of the Question, whereupon the King prayeth your aduice: which is no other, but whether hee shall enter into an auxiliarie and defensiue Warre for the <hi>Britons</hi> against <hi>France.</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7276:30"/>
in this Affaire, the King hath commanded mee to say somewhat to you from him, of the Persons that doe interuene in this Businesse; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Consequence thereof, as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this Kingdome; and somewhat of the Example of it in generall: making neuerthelesse no Conclusion or Judgement of any Point, vntill his Grace hath receiued your faithfull and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique aduices.</p>
            <p>First, for the King our Soueraigne himselfe, who is the principall Person you are to eye in this Businesse; his Grace doth professe, that he truly and constantly desireth to reigne in Peace. But his Grace saith, he will neither buy Peace with Dishonour, nor take it vp at interest of Danger to ensue; but shall thinke it a good Change, if it please God to change the inward Troubles and Seditions, wherewith he hath beene hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, into an honourable Forraigne Warre. And for the other two Persons in this Action, the <hi>French King,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> his Grace doth declare vnto you, that they be the Men, vnto whom be is of all other Friends and Allies most bounden: the one hauing held ouer him his hand of Protection from the Tyrant: the Other hauing reacht forth vnto him his hand of helpe, for the recouerie of his Kingdome. So that his affection toward them in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7276:30"/>
Person, is vpon equall tearmes. And whereas you may haue heard, that his Grace was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to flie out of <hi>Britaine</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> for doubts of being betrayed; his Grace would not in any sort haue that reflect vpon the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> in defacement of his former benefits: for that hee is throughly informed, that it was but the practice of some corrupt Persons about him, during the time of his sicknesse, altogether without his consent or priuitie.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer these things doe interesse his Grace in his particular, yet hee knoweth well, that the higher Bond that tieth him to procure by all meanes the safetie and welfare of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Subiects, doth dis-interesse him of these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Gratitude, otherwise then thus: that if his Grace be forced to make a Warre, he doe it without passion, or ambition.</p>
            <p>For the consequence of this Action towards this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> it is much as the <hi>French Kings</hi> intention is. For if it be no more, but to range his Subiects to reason, who beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues stout vpon the strength of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> it is nothing to vs. But if it be in the <hi>French Kings</hi> purpose, or if it should not be in his purpose, yet if it shall follow all one, as if it were sought, that the <hi>French King</hi> shall make a Prouince of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and ioyne it to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7276:31"/>
Crowne of <hi>France:</hi> then it is worthy the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, how this may import <hi>England,</hi> as well in the increasement of the greatnesse of <hi>France,</hi> by the addition of such a Countrey, that stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Boughes vnto our Seas, as in depriuing this Nation, and leauing it naked of so firme and assured Confederates, as the <hi>Britons</hi> haue alwayes beene. For then it will come to passe, that whereas not long since, this Realme was mightie vpon the Continent, first in Territorie, and after in Alliance, in respect of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> which were Confederates indeed, but dependant Confederates; now the one being already cast, partly into the greatnes of <hi>France,</hi> and partly into that of <hi>Austria,</hi> the other is like wholly to be cast into the greatnesse of <hi>France,</hi> and this Island shall remaine confined in effect within the salt Waters, and girt about with the Coast-Countries of two mightie Monarchs.</p>
            <p>For the Example, it resteth likewise vpon the same Question, vpon the <hi>French Kings</hi> intent. For if <hi>Britaine</hi> be carried and swallowed vp by <hi>France,</hi> as the world abroad (apt to impute and construe the Actions of Princes to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition) conceiue it will; then it is an Example very dangerous and vniuersall, that the lesser Neighbour Estate should bee deuoured of the greater. For this may bee the case of <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7276:31"/>
towards <hi>England;</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> towards <hi>Spaine;</hi> of the smaller Estates of <hi>Italie,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the greater; and so of <hi>Germanie;</hi> or as if some of you of the Commons, might not liue and dwell safely, besides some of these great Lords. And the bringing in of this Example, will be chiefely laid to the Kings charge, as to him that was most interested and most able to forbid it. But then on the other side, there is so faire a Pretext on the <hi>French Kings</hi> Part (and yet Pretext is neuer wanting to Power) in regard the danger imminent to his owne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state is such, as may make this Enterprise seeme rather a Work of Necessitie, then of Ambition, as doth in reason correct the Danger of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For that the Example of that which is done in a mans owne defence, cannot be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; because it is in anothers power to auoid it. But in all this businesse, the King remits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to your graue and mature aduice, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he purposeth to relye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the effect of the Lord</hi> Chancellors <hi>Speech touching the Cause of</hi> Britaine: <hi>For the King had commanded him to carrie it so, as to affect the</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>towards the Businesse; but without engaging the King in any expresse declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Chancellor <hi>went on:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:7276:32"/>
FOr that which may concerne the Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home, the King hath commanded me to say vnto you; That he thinketh there was neuer any King (for the small time that hee hath reigned) had greater and iuster cause of the two contrarie Passions of Joy, and Sorrow, then his Grace hath. Joy, in respect of the rare and visible Fauours of Almightie God, in gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Imperiall Sword vpon his side, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the same his Sword against all his Enemies; and likewise in blessing him with so many good and louing Seruants and Subiects, which haue neuer fayled to giue him faithfull Counsell, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Obedience, and couragious Defence. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for that it hath not pleased God to suffer him to sheathe his Sword (as hee greatly desired otherwise then for Administration of Justice) but that he hath beene forced to draw it so oft, to cut off Trayterous and disloyall Subiects, whom (it seemes) God hath left (a few amongst many good) as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> among the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> to be thornes in their sides, to tempt and trie them; though the end hath beene alwayes (Gods Name bee blessed therefore) that the destruction hath fallen vpon their owne heads.</p>
            <p>Wherefore his Grace saith; That hee seeth, that it is not the Bloud spilt in the Field, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7276:32"/>
will saue the Bloud in the Citie; nor the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals</hi> Sword, that will set this Kingdome in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace: But that the true way is, to stop the Seeds of Sedition and Rebellion in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; and for that purpose to deuise, confirme, and quicken good and holesome Lawes, against Riots, and vnlawfull Assemblies of People, and all Combinations and Confederacies of them, by Liueries, Tokens, and other Badges of factious Dependance; that the Peace of the Land may by these Ordinances, as by Barres of Iron, bee soundly bound in and strengthned, and all Force both in Court, Countrey, and priuate Houses, be supprest. The care hereof, which so much concerneth your selues, and which the nature of the Times doth instantly call for, his Grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to your Wisdomes.</p>
            <p>And because it is the Kings desire, that this Peace, wherein he hopeth to gouerne and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you, doe not beare onely vnto you Leaues for you to sit vnder the shade of them in safetie; but also should beare you Fruit of Riches, Wealth and Plentie: Therfore his Grace prayes you, to take into consideration matter of Trade, as also the Manufactures of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to represse the bastard and barren Imployment of Moneyes, to Usurie and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Exchanges, that they may be (as their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7276:33"/>
vse is) turned vpon Commerce, and lawfull and Royall Trading. And likewise, that our People bee set on worke in Arts and Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts; that the Realme may subsist more of it selfe; that Idlenesse be auoided, and the dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of our Treasure, for forraine Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, stopped. But you are not to rest heere onely, but to prouide further, that whatsoeuer Merchandize shall bee brought in from beyond the Seas, may bee imployed vpon the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Land; wherby the Kingdomes stocke of Treasure may be sure to bee kept from being diminished, by any ouer-trading of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer.</p>
            <p>And lastly, because the King is well assured, that you would not haue him poore, that wishes you rich; he doubteth not, but that you will haue care, as well to maintaine his Reuenues, of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, and all other Natures, as also to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with your louing Aides, if the case shall so require. The rather, for that you know the King is a good Husband, and but a Steward in effect for the Publike; and that what comes from you is but as Moisture drawne from the Earth, which gathers into a Cloud, and fals back vpon the Earth againe. And you know well, how the Kingdomes about you grow more and more in Greatnesse, and the Times
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7276:33"/>
are stirring; and therefore not fit to finde the King with an emptie Purse. More I haue not to say to you; and wish, that what hath beene said, had beene better exprest: But that your Wisdomes and good Affections will supply. GOD blesse your Doings.</p>
            <p>IT was no hard matter to dispose and affect the <hi>Parliament</hi> in this businesse; aswell in respect of the Emulation betweene the Nations, and the Enuie at the late growth of the <hi>French Monarchie;</hi> as in regard of the Danger, to suffer the <hi>French</hi> to make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches vpon <hi>England,</hi> by obtaining so goodly a maritime <hi>Prouince,</hi> full of Sea-townes, and Hauens, that might doe mischiefe to the <hi>English,</hi> either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion or by interruption of <hi>Traffique.</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was also moued with the point of <hi>Oppression;</hi> for although the <hi>French</hi> seemed to speake reason, yet <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> are euer with multitudes too weake for <hi>Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Wherefore they did aduise the King, roundly to embrace the <hi>Britons</hi> quarrell, and to send them speedy aides, and with much alacritie and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse granted to the King a great rate of <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> in contemplation of these aides. But the King both to keepe a decencie towards the <hi>French King,</hi> to whom he profest himselfe to be obliged, and indeed desirous rather to shew Warre, then to make it; sent new solemne <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to intimate vnto him, the <hi>Decree</hi> of his <hi>Estates,</hi> and to iterate his motion, that the <hi>French</hi> would desist from <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie;</hi> or if Warre must follow, to desire him to take it in good part, if at the motion of his people, who were sensible of the cause of the <hi>Britons</hi> as their ancient
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7276:34"/>
Friends, and Confederates, hee did send them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours; with protestation neuerthelesse, that to saue all <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Lawes</hi> of Friendship, hee had limited his <hi>Force,</hi> to proceed in aide of the <hi>Britons,</hi> but in no wise to warre vpon the <hi>French,</hi> otherwise then as they maintained the possession of <hi>Britaine.</hi> But before this formall <hi>Ambassage</hi> arriued, the <hi>Partie</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> had receiued a great blow, and grew to manifest declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For neere the Towne of Saint <hi>Alban</hi> in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> a Battaile had beene giuen, where the <hi>Britons</hi> were ouerthrowne, and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> taken <hi>Prisoners,</hi> there being slaine on the <hi>Britons</hi> part six thousand Men, and amongst them the <hi>Lord</hi> WOODVILE, and almost all his Souldiers, valiantly fighting. And of the <hi>French</hi> part one thousand two hundred, with their <hi>Leader,</hi> IAMES GALEOT, a great <hi>Commander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the newes of this Battaile came ouer into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it was time for the King (who now had no subrer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to continue further <hi>Treatie,</hi> and saw before his Eyes, that <hi>Britaine</hi> went so speedily for lost, contrarie to his hopes, knowing also that with his People and Forreiners both, he sustained no small Enuie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation for his former delayes) to dispatch with all possible speed his succours into <hi>Britaine;</hi> which hee did vnder the conduct of ROBERT Lord BROOKE to the number of eight thousand choise Men, and well armed; who hauing a faire wind, in few houres landed in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and ioyned themselues forthwith to those <hi>Briton-Forces,</hi> that remained after the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,</hi> and marched straight on to find the <hi>Enemie,</hi> and incamped fast by them. The <hi>French</hi> wisely husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the possession of a <hi>Victorie,</hi> and well acquainted with the courage of the <hi>English,</hi> especially when they are fresh, kept themselues within their <hi>Trenches,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strongly lodged, and resolued not to giue battaile.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7276:34"/>
But meane while, to harrasse and wearie the <hi>English,</hi> they did vpon all aduantages set vpon them with their <hi>Light-Horse;</hi> wherein neuerthelesse they receiued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly losse, especially by meanes of the <hi>English-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But vpon these atchieuements FRANCIS <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> deceased; an accident that the King might easily haue foreseene, and ought to haue reckoned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prouided for, but that the <hi>Point of Reputation,</hi> when newes first came of the <hi>Battaile</hi> lost (that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what must bee done) did ouerbeare the <hi>Reason of Warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Dukes</hi> decease, the principall persons of <hi>Britaine,</hi> partly bought, partly through faction, put all things into confusion; so as the <hi>English</hi> not finding <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Bodie</hi> with whom to ioyne their <hi>Forces,</hi> and being in iealousie of <hi>Friends,</hi> as well as in danger of <hi>Enemies,</hi> and the Winter begun, returned home fiue moneths after their landing. So the Battaile of <hi>Saint Alban,</hi> the death of the <hi>Duke,</hi> and the retire of the <hi>English succours</hi> were (after some time) the causes of the losse of that <hi>Duchie;</hi> which action some accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a blemish of the Kings Iudgement; but most but as the misfortune of his times.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer the temporarie Fruit of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in their aid and aduice giuen for <hi>Britaine,</hi> tooke not, nor prospered not; yet the lasting Fruit of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is good and wholsome <hi>Lawes,</hi> did prosper, and doth yet continue to this day. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lord <hi>Chancellours</hi> admonition, there were that <hi>Parliament</hi> diuers excellent Lawes ordained, concerning the <hi>Points</hi> which the King recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the authoritie of the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> which before subsisted by the ancient <hi>Common-Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Realme,</hi> was confirmed in certaine <hi>Cases</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7276:35"/>
               <hi>Parliament.</hi> This <hi>Court</hi> is one of the sagest and noblest <hi>Institutions</hi> of this Kingdome. For in the distribution of <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Ordinarie Iustice</hi> (besides the <hi>High-Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament)</hi> in which distribution the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> holdeth the <hi>Pleas</hi> of the <hi>Crowne,</hi> the <hi>Common-Place, Pleas Ciuill,</hi> the <hi>Exchequer Pleas</hi> concerning the Kings <hi>Reuenue,</hi> and the <hi>Chancery</hi> the <hi>Pretorian</hi> power for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the <hi>Rigour</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> in case of extremitie by the conscience of a good man; there was neuerthelesse alwaies reserued a high and preheminent power to the <hi>Kings Counsell,</hi> in <hi>Causes</hi> that might in example, or consequence, concerne the state of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> which if they were <hi>Criminall,</hi> the <hi>Counsell</hi> vsed to sit in the <hi>Chamber,</hi> called the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> if <hi>Ciuill,</hi> in the <hi>White-Chamber,</hi> or <hi>White-hall.</hi> And as the <hi>Chancery</hi> had the <hi>Pretorian</hi> power for <hi>Equitie;</hi> so the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> had the <hi>Censorian</hi> power for <hi>Offences,</hi> vnder the degree of <hi>Capitall.</hi> This <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Star-chamber</hi> is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of good Elements; for it consisteth of foure kindes of <hi>Persons: Councellors, Peeres, Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Chief-Iudges.</hi> It discerneth also principally of foure kinds of <hi>Causes; Forces, Frauds, Crimes</hi> various of <hi>Stellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> and the <hi>Inchoations</hi> or middle acts towards <hi>Crimes Capitall,</hi> or hainous, not actually committed or perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. But that which was principally aimed at by this Act was <hi>Force,</hi> and the two chiefe <hi>Supports</hi> of <hi>Force, Combination</hi> of multitudes, and <hi>Maintenance</hi> or Headship of great <hi>Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the generall peace of the <hi>Countrie,</hi> the Kings care went on to the peace of the <hi>Kings House,</hi> and the securitie of his great <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Counsellors.</hi> But this <hi>Law</hi> was somwhat of a strange composition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

               <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who being a sterne and haughtie man, and finding he had some mortall Enemies in <hi>Court,</hi> proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his owne safetie; drowning the enuie of it in a generall <hi>Law,</hi> by communicating the priuiledge with all other <hi>Councellors</hi> and <hi>Peeres,</hi> and yet not daring to extend it further, then to the Kings seruants in <hi>Check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowle,</hi> lest it should haue beene too harsh to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> and other <hi>Commons</hi> of the Kingdome; who might haue thought their ancient <hi>Libertie,</hi> and the clemencie of the <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>England</hi> inuaded, <hi>If the will in any case of Felonie should be made the deed.</hi> And yet the reason which the Act yeeldeth (that is to say, <hi>That hee that conspireth the death of Councellors may be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, and by a meane, to conspire the death of the King himselfe) is</hi> indifferent to all <hi>Subiects,</hi> as well as to <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants</hi> in <hi>Court.</hi> But it seemeth this sufficed to serue the <hi>Lord Chancellors</hi> turne at this time. But yet hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to neede a <hi>Generall Law,</hi> for that hee grew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as odious to the <hi>Countrie,</hi> as hee was then to the <hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the peace of the Kings House, the Kings care extended to the peace of <hi>Priuate Houses</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi> For there was an excellent Morall <hi>Law</hi> moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus; The taking and carrying away of <hi>Women</hi> forcibly, and against their will (except <hi>Female-Wards</hi> and <hi>Bond-women)</hi> was made Capitall. The <hi>Parliament</hi> wisely and iustly conceiuing, that the obtaining of <hi>Women</hi> by force into <hi>Possession</hi> (howsoeuer afterwards Assent might follow by Allurements) was but a <hi>Rape</hi> drawne forth in length, because the first <hi>Force</hi> drew on all the rest.</p>
            <p>There was made also another <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Peace</hi> in generall, and repressing of <hi>Murthers</hi> and <hi>Man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and was in amendment of the <hi>Common Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Realme,</hi> being this: That wheras by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> the <hi>Kings-suit</hi> in case of <hi>Homicide,</hi> did expect <hi>The</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:7276:36"/>
               <hi>yeare and the day,</hi> allowed to the <hi>Parties Suit</hi> by way of <hi>Appeale;</hi> and that it was found by experience, that the <hi>Partie</hi> was many times compounded with, and many times wearied with the <hi>Suit,</hi> so that in the end such Suit was let fall, and by that time the matter was in a manner forgotten, and therby <hi>Prosecution</hi> at the <hi>Kings suit</hi> by <hi>Indictment</hi> (which is euer best, <hi>Flagrante crimine)</hi> neglected; it was ordained, That the <hi>Suit</hi> by <hi>Indictment</hi> might bee taken as well at any time within the <hi>yeare</hi> and the <hi>day,</hi> as after, not preiudicing neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse the <hi>Parties Suit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King began also then, as well in <hi>Wisdome</hi> as in <hi>Iustice</hi> to pare a little the <hi>Priuiledge</hi> of <hi>Clergie,</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>That Clarkes conuict should bee burned in the hand,</hi> both because they might taste of some corporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and that they might carry a <hi>Brand</hi> of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But for this good Acts sake, the King himselfe was after branded by PERKINS Proclamation, for an execrable breaker of the Rites of <hi>Holy Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>Law</hi> was made for the better <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Countrey;</hi> by which <hi>Law</hi> the Kings <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> were to forfeit their Places and Holds, in case of vnlawfull <hi>Retainer,</hi> or partaking in <hi>Routs</hi> and vnlawfull Assemblies.</p>
            <p>These were the <hi>Lawes</hi> that were made for repressing of Force, which those times did chiefely require; and were so prudently framed, as they are found fit for all succeeding times, and so continue to this day.</p>
            <p>There were also made good and politicke <hi>Lawes</hi> that <hi>Parliament</hi> against <hi>Vsurie,</hi> which is the <hi>Bastard vse</hi> of Money; And against vnlawfull <hi>Chieuances</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,</hi> which is <hi>Bastard Vsurie;</hi> And also for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the <hi>Kings Customes;</hi> And for the imployment of the <hi>Procedures</hi> of Forraine Commodities, brought in by <hi>Merchant-strangers,</hi> vpon the Natiue Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Realme;</hi> Together with some other <hi>Lawes</hi> of lesse importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:7276:36"/>
But howsoeuer the <hi>Lawes</hi> made in that <hi>Parliament</hi> did beare good and holesome Fruit; yet the <hi>Subsidie</hi> granted at the same time, bare a Fruit, that proued harsh and bitter. All was inned at last into the Kings Barne; but it was after a <hi>Storme.</hi> For when the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> entred into the Taxation of the <hi>Subsidie</hi> in <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> and the <hi>Bishopricke</hi> of <hi>Duresme;</hi> the people vpon a sudaine grew into great mutinie, and said o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that they had endured of late yeares a thousand miseries, and neither could nor would pay the <hi>Subsidie.</hi> This (no doubt) proceeded not simply of any present necessitie, but much by reason of the old hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of those Countries, where the memorie of King RICHARD was so strong, that it lies like <hi>Lees</hi> in the bottome of mens hearts; and if the <hi>Vessell</hi> was but stirred, it would come vp. And (no doubt) it was partly also by the instigation of some factious <hi>Male-contents,</hi> that bare principall stroke amongst them. Hereupon the <hi>Commissioners</hi> being somewhat astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, deferred the matter vnto the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> who was the principall man of Authoritie in those Parts. The <hi>Earle</hi> forthwith wrote vnto the <hi>Court,</hi> signifying to the King plainely enough in what flame hee found the people of those Countries, and praying the Kings direction. The King wrote backe peremptorily, That hee would not haue one penny abated, of that which had beene granted to him by <hi>Parliament,</hi> both because it might encourage other Countries to pray the like <hi>Release,</hi> or Mitigation, and chiefely, because hee would neuer endure, that the base <hi>Multitude</hi> should frustrate the Authoritie of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> wherein their <hi>Votes</hi> and Consents were concluded. Vpon this dispatch from Court, the <hi>Earle</hi> assembled the principall <hi>Iustices</hi> and <hi>Free-holders</hi> of the Countrey; and speaking to them in that imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Language wherein the King had written to him,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7276:37"/>
which needed not (saue that an <hi>Harsh businesse</hi> was vnfortunately fallen into the hands of a <hi>Harsh-man)</hi> did not onely irritate the People, but make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, by the stoutnesse and haughtinesse of deliuerie of the Kings Errand; that himselfe was the Author or principall Perswader of that Counsell. Whereupon the meaner sort routed together, and suddenly assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Earle</hi> in his House, slew him, and diuers of his seruants. And rested not there, but creating for their Leader Sir IOHN EGREMOND, a factious person, and one that had of a long time borne an ill <hi>Talent</hi> towards the King; and being animated also by a base Fellow, called IOHN A CHAMBER, a very <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feu,</hi> who bare much sway amongst the vulgar and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, entred into open <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and gaue out in flat termes, that they would goe against King HENRY, and fight with him for the maintenance of their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the King was aduertised of this new <hi>Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> (being almost a <hi>Feuer,</hi> that tooke him euery yeare) after his manner little troubled therewith, hee sent THOMAS <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Surrey</hi> (whom hee had a little before not onely released out of the Tower, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but also receiued to speciall fauour) with a competent Power against the <hi>Rebels;</hi> who fought with the principall Band of them, and defeated them, and tooke aliue IOHN A CHAMBER, their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand. As for Sir IOHN EGREMOND, hee fled into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the Ladie MARGARET of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie;</hi> whose Palace was the <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> and Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of all Traitors against the King. IOHN A CHAMBER was executed at <hi>Yorke,</hi> in great state; for he was hanged vpon a Gibbet raised a Stage high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the midst of a square <hi>Gallowes,</hi> as a <hi>Traitor Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount;</hi> And a number of his men that were his chiefe <hi>Complices,</hi> were hanged vpon the lower Storie round
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7276:37"/>
about him; and the rest were generally pardoned. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the King himselfe omit his custome, to be first or second in all his warlike Exploits; making good his Word, which was vsuall with him when he heard of <hi>Rebels;</hi> that <hi>He desired but to see them.</hi> For immediatly after he had sent downe the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Surrey,</hi> he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards them himselfe in person. And although in his iourney hee heard newes of the Victory, yet hee went on as farre as <hi>Yorke,</hi> to pacifie and settle those Countryes. And that done returned to <hi>London,</hi> leauing the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Surrey</hi> for his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> in the <hi>Northerne parts,</hi> and Sir RICHARD TVNSTALL for his principall <hi>Commissioner,</hi> to leuie the <hi>Subsidie,</hi> whereof he did not remit a <hi>Denier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the same time that the King lost so good a Seruant, as the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> hee lost like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a faithfull friend and Allie of IAMES the third, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a miserable disaster. For this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Prince,</hi> after a long smother of discontent, and hatred of many of his <hi>Nobilitie</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forth at times into seditions and alterations of <hi>Court,</hi> was at last distressed by them, hauing taken Armes, and surprised the person of <hi>Prince</hi> IAMES his sonne, partly by force, partly by threats, that they would otherwise deliuer vp the Kingdome to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to shadow their Rebellion, and to bee the titular and painted Head of those Armes. Whereupon the King (finding himselfe too weake) sought vnto King HENRY, as also vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> to compose those troubles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and his Subiects. The Kings according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interposed their Mediation in a round and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner: Not only by way of request and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but also by way of protestation of menace; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that they thought it to be the common Cause of all Kings, <hi>If Subiects should be suffered to giue Lawes</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:7276:38"/>
               <hi>vnto their Soueraigne;</hi> and that they would according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resent it, and reuenge it. But the <hi>Rebels</hi> that had shaken off the greater <hi>Yoke</hi> of Obedience, had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise cast away the lesser <hi>Tye</hi> of Respect. And <hi>Furie</hi> preuailing aboue <hi>Feare,</hi> made answer, That there was no talking of Peace, except the King would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signehis Crowne. Whereupon (Treatie of Accord taking no place) it came vp to a <hi>Battaile,</hi> at <hi>Bannocks Bourne</hi> by <hi>Striuelin.</hi> In which Battaile the King trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with wrath and iust indignation, inconsiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fighting and precipitating the charge, before his whole numbers came vp to him, was (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the contrarie expresse and straight commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Prince</hi> his sonne) slaine in the Pursuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fled to a Mill, scituate in the field, where the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile was fought.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Popes</hi> Ambassie, which was sent by ADRIAN DE CASTELLO an <hi>Italian Legate)</hi> and perhaps as those times were might haue preuailed more) it came too late for the <hi>Ambassie,</hi> but not for the <hi>Ambassador.</hi> For passing through <hi>England,</hi> and being honourably entertained, and dreceiued of King HENRY; (who euer applied himselfe with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome)</hi> hee fell into great grace with the King, and great familiaritie and friendship with MORTON the <hi>Chancellor.</hi> In so much as the King taking a liking to him, and finding him to his minde, preferred him to the Bishopricke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to that of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and imployed him in many of his affaires of <hi>State,</hi> that had relation to <hi>Rome.</hi> Hee was a man of great learning, wisedome, and dexteritle in businesse of <hi>State;</hi> and hauing not long after ascended to the degree of <hi>Cardinall,</hi> payd the King large tribute of his gratitude, in diligent and iudicious aduertisement of the occurrents of <hi>Italie.</hi> Neuerthelesse in the end of his time, hee was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7276:38"/>
partaker of the conspiracie, which <hi>Cardinall</hi> AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHONSO PETRVCCI, and some other <hi>Cardinalls</hi> had plotted against the life of <hi>Pope</hi> LEO. And this offence in it selfe so hainous, was yet in him aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the motiue therof, which was not malice or discontent, but an aspiring minde to the <hi>Papacie.</hi> And in this height of impietie there wanted not an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of leuitie and follie; for that (as was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally belieued) hee was animated to expect the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie,</hi> by a fatall <hi>Mockerie,</hi> the prediction of a <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saier,</hi> which was; <hi>That one should succeed</hi> Pope LEO, <hi>whose name should bee</hi> ADRIAN, <hi>an aged man of meane birth, and of great learning and wisdome.</hi> By which <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> and figure, hee tooke himselfe to bee described though it were fulfilled of ADRIAN the <hi>Flemming,</hi> sonne of a <hi>Dutch Brewer, Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Tortosa,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor</hi> vnto CHARLES the Fift; the same that not changing his <hi>Christen-name,</hi> was afterwards called ADRIAN the Sixt.</p>
            <p>But these things happened in the yeare following, which was the fift of this King. But in the end of the fourth yeare the King had called againe his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not as it seemeth for any particular occasion of <hi>State.</hi> But the former <hi>Parliament</hi> being ended some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what sodainly, in regard of the preparation for <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> the King thought hee had not remunerated his people sufficiently with good <hi>Lawes,</hi> which euermore was his Retribution for Treasure. And finding by the Insurrection in the <hi>North,</hi> there was discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abroad, in respect of the <hi>Subsidie,</hi> hee thought it good to giue his Subiects yet further contentment, and comfort in that kind. Certainly his times for good <hi>Common-wealths Lawes</hi> did excell. So as he may iustly be celebrated for the best <hi>Law giuer</hi> to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after King EDWARD the first. For his <hi>Lawes</hi> (who so markes them well) are deepe, and not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7276:39"/>
not made vpon the <hi>Spurre</hi> of a particular Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the <hi>Present,</hi> but out of Prouidence of the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to make the Estate of his People still more and more happie; after the manner of the <hi>Legislators</hi> in ancient and Heroicall Times.</p>
            <p>First therfore he made a <hi>Law,</hi> sutable to his owne Acts and Times. For as himselfe had in his Person and Marriage made a finall Concord, in the great Suit and Title for the <hi>Crowne;</hi> so by this <hi>Law</hi> hee setled the like Peace and Quiet in the priuate Possessions of the Subjects. Ordaining, <hi>That Fines thence-forth should bee finall, to conclude all Strangers Rights;</hi> and that vpon <hi>Fines</hi> leuied, and solemnely proclaimed, the <hi>Subiect</hi> should haue his time of Watch for fiue yeares after his Title accrued; which if hee fore-passed, his Right should be bound for euer after; with some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception neuerthelesse, of <hi>Minors, Married-Women,</hi> and such incompetent Persons.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Statute</hi> did in effect but restore an ancient Statute of the Realme, which was it selfe also made but in affirmance of the <hi>Common-Law.</hi> The alteration had beene by a <hi>Statute,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Non-claime,</hi> made in the time of EDWARD the Third. And surely this <hi>Law</hi> was a kind of <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> of the good Peace, which since his time hath (for the most part) continued in this Kingdome, vntill this day. For <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Non-Claime</hi> are fit for times of Warre, when mens heads are troubled, that they cannot intend their Estate; But <hi>Statutes,</hi> that quiet <hi>Possessions,</hi> are fittest for Times of Peace, to extinguish Suits and Contentions, which is one of the <hi>Banes</hi> of Peace.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Statute</hi> was made of singular <hi>Policie,</hi> for the Population apparantly, and (if it bee throughly considered) for the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> and <hi>Militar Forces</hi> of the <hi>Realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:7276:39"/>
               <hi>Inclosures</hi> at that time began to be more frequent, whereby Arrable Land (which could not be manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without people and Families) was turned into Pasture, which was easily rid by a few <hi>Heards men;</hi> and Tenancies for <hi>Yeares, Liues,</hi> and <hi>At Will</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon much of the <hi>Yeomanrie</hi> liued) were turned into Demesnes. This bred a decay of People, and (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence) a decay of <hi>Townes, Churches, Tithes,</hi> and the like. The King likewise knew full well, and in no wise forgot, that there ensued with all vpon this a decay and diminution of <hi>Subsidie</hi> and <hi>Taxes;</hi> for the more Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, euer the lower bookes of <hi>Subsidies.</hi> In reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying of this inconuenience, the Kings Wisdome was admirable, and the <hi>Parliaments</hi> at that time. <hi>Inclosures</hi> they would not forbid, for that had beene to forbid the improuement of the <hi>Patrimonie</hi> of the Kingdome; nor <hi>Tillage</hi> they would not compell, for that was to striue with Nature and Vtilitie. But they tooke a course to take away depopulating <hi>Inclosures,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populating <hi>Pasturage,</hi> and yet not by that name, or by any Imperious expresse <hi>Prohibition,</hi> but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. The <hi>Ordinance</hi> was, <hi>That all Houses of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, that were vsed with twentie Acres of Ground, and vpwards, should bee maintained and kept vp for euer; together with a competent Proportion of Land to be vsed and occupied with them;</hi> and in no wise to be seruered from them, as by another <hi>Statute,</hi> made afterwards in his Successors time, was more fully declared. This vpon Forfeiture to be taken; not by way of Popular <hi>Action,</hi> but by seizure of the Land it selfe. by the King and Lords of the <hi>Fee,</hi> as to halfe the Profits, till the Houses and Lands were restored. By this meanes the Houses being kept vp, did of necessitie inforce a <hi>Dweller;</hi> and the proportion of Land for Occupation being kept vp, did of necessitie inforce that <hi>Dweller;</hi> not to be a Begger or <hi>Cottager,</hi> but a man
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7276:40"/>
of some substance, that might keepe Hiends and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and set the Plough on going. This did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully concerne the <hi>Might</hi> and <hi>Manner-hood</hi> of the Kingdome, to haue Fermes, as it were of a <hi>Standard</hi> sufficient to maintaine an able Body out of Penurie, and did in effect amortize a great part of the Lands of the Kingdome vnto the Hold and Occupation of the <hi>Yeomanrie</hi> or <hi>Middle-people,</hi> of a condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and <hi>Cottagers,</hi> or <hi>Peasants.</hi> Now, how much this did aduance the <hi>Militar Power</hi> of the Kingdome, is apparant by the true <hi>Principles</hi> of Warre, and the examples of other Kingdomes. For it hath beene held by the generall Opinion of men of best Iudgement in the warres (howsoeuer some few haue varied, and that it may receiue some distinction of Case) that the principall Strength of an Armie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the <hi>Infanterie</hi> or <hi>Foot.</hi> And to make good <hi>Infanterie,</hi> it requireth men bred, not in a seruile or indigent fashion, but in some free and plentifull manner. Therefore if a <hi>State</hi> runne most to <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and that the <hi>Husband-men</hi> and <hi>Plough-men</hi> be but as their Work-folkes and Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or else meere <hi>Cottagers</hi> (which are but <hi>Housed-Beggers)</hi> you may haue a good <hi>Cauallerie,</hi> but neuer good stable Bands of <hi>Foot;</hi> like to <hi>Coppice-Woods,</hi> that if you leaue in them <hi>Staddles</hi> too thicke, they will runne to Bushes and Briars, and haue little cleane Vnderwood. And this is to be seene in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> and lome other Parts abroad, where in effect all is <hi>Noblesse,</hi> or <hi>Pesantrie,</hi> I speake of People out of Townes, and no middle People; and therefore no good Forces of <hi>Foot:</hi> Insomuch, as they are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to imploy Mercenarie Bands, of <hi>Switzers</hi> and the like, for their <hi>Battalions</hi> of <hi>Foot:</hi> Whereby also it comes to passe, that those <hi>Nations</hi> haue much People, and few <hi>Souldiors.</hi> Whereas the King saw, that contrariwise
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7276:40"/>
it would follow, that <hi>England</hi> though much lesse in Territorie, yet should haue infinitly more <hi>Souldiours</hi> of their natiue Forces, then those other Nations haue. Thus did the King secretly sow <hi>Hidraes</hi> teeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon (according to the <hi>Poets</hi> fiction) should rise vp <hi>Armed men</hi> for the seruice of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The King also (hauing care to make his Realme potent, as well by <hi>Sea</hi> as by <hi>Land)</hi> for the better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the <hi>Nauie,</hi> ordained; <hi>That wines and woads from the parts of</hi> Gascoigne <hi>and</hi> Languedocke, <hi>should not be brought but in English bottomes;</hi> Bowing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Policie of this Estate, from consideration of <hi>Plentie,</hi> to consideration of <hi>Power.</hi> For that almost all the ancient <hi>Statutes</hi> incite by all meanes <hi>Merchant-Strangers,</hi> to bring in all sorts of Commodities; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for end <hi>Cheapnesse,</hi> and not looking to the point of <hi>State</hi> concerning the <hi>Nauall-power.</hi>

            <p>The King also made a <hi>Statute</hi> in that <hi>Parliament</hi> Monitory and Minatory, towards <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> that they should duly execute their office, inuiting complaints against them, first to their <hi>Fellow-Iustices,</hi> then to the <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Assise,</hi> then to the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor;</hi> and that a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> which hee had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of that Tenor, should be read in open <hi>Sessions</hi> foure times a yeare, to keepe them awake. Meaning also to haue his lawes executed, and therby to reape either <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Forfeitures;</hi> (wherein towards his latter times hee did decline too much to the left hand) he did ordaine remedie against the practice that was growne in vse, to stop and dampe <hi>Informations</hi> vpon <hi>Penall Lawes,</hi> by procuring <hi>Informations</hi> by collusion to be put in by the Confederates of the Delinquents, to be faintly prosecuted, and let fall at pleasure, and pleading them in Barre of the <hi>Informations,</hi> which were prosecuted with effect.</p>
            <p>He made also <hi>Lawes</hi> for the correction of the <hi>Mint,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:7276:41"/>
and counterfaiting of forreine <hi>Coyne</hi> currant. And that no payment in <hi>Gold,</hi> should bee made to any <hi>Merchant-stranger,</hi> the better to keepe Treasure within the <hi>Realme,</hi> for that <hi>Gold</hi> was the mettall that lay in leastroome.</p>
            <p>He made also <hi>Statutes</hi> for the maintenance of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,</hi> and the keeping of <hi>Wools</hi> within the <hi>Realme;</hi> and not only so, but for stinting, and limiting the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Cloth,</hi> one for the <hi>Finer,</hi> and another for the <hi>Courser</hi> sort. Which I note, both because it was a rare thing to set prices by <hi>Statute,</hi> especially vpon our Home-Commodities; and because of the wise <hi>Modele</hi> of this <hi>Act,</hi> not prescribing Prices, but stinting them not to exceed a rate, that the <hi>Clothier</hi> might drape ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as he might affoord.</p>
            <p>Diuers other good <hi>Statutes</hi> were made that <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but these were the principall. And here I doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire those, into whose hands this worke shall fall, that they do take in good part my long insisting vpon the <hi>Lawes,</hi> that were made in this Kings reigne. Whereof I haue these reasons; Both because it was the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent vertue and merit of this King, to whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie I doe honour; and because it hath some corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence to my Person; but chiefly, because (in my iudgement) it is some defect euen in the best wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Historie,</hi> that they doe not often enough sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily deliuer and set downe the most memorable <hi>Lawes,</hi> that passed in the times whereof they write, being indeed the principall <hi>Acts</hi> of Peace For though they may bee had in <hi>Originall Bookes</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; yet that informeth not the iudgement of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Councellors,</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Estate,</hi> so well as to see them described, and entred in the <hi>Table</hi> and <hi>Pourtrait</hi> of the Times.</p>
            <p>About the same time, the King had a <hi>Loane</hi> from the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>Foure thousand pounds;</hi> which was double
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7276:41"/>
to that they lent before, and was duely and orderly payd back at the day, as the former likewise had beene. The King euer choosing rather to borrow too soone, then to pay too late, and so keeping vp his Credit.</p>
            <p>Neither had the King yet cast off his cares and hopes touching <hi>Britaine,</hi> but thought to master the occasion by Policie, though his Armes had beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and to bereaue the <hi>French King</hi> of the fruit of his <hi>Victorie.</hi> The summe of his designe was, to encourage MAXIMILIAN to goe on with his suit, for the marriage of ANNE, the heire of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and to aide him to the consummation therof. But the affaires of MAXIMILIAN were at that time in great trouble and combustion, by a <hi>Rebellion</hi> of his Subiects in <hi>Flanders;</hi> especially those of <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Gaunt,</hi> wherof the Towne of <hi>Bruges</hi> (at such time as MAXIMILIAN was there in person) had sodainly armed in tumult, and slaine some of his principall Officers, and taken himself prisoner, and held him in durance, till they had enforced him, and some of his Councellors, to take a solemne oath, to pardon all their offences, and neuer to question and reuenge the same in time to come. Neuerthelesse FREDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICKE the <hi>Emperour</hi> would not suffer this reproach and indignitie offered to his sonne to passe, but made sharpe warres vpon <hi>Flanders,</hi> to reclaime and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise the <hi>Rebels.</hi> But the Lord RAVENSTEIN, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall person about MAXIMILIAN, and one that had taken the oath of <hi>Abolition</hi> with his Master, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Religion therof, but indeed vpon priuate ambition, and as it was thought) instigated and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from <hi>France,</hi> for sooke the <hi>Emperour</hi> and MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XIMILIAN his Lord, and made himselfe an Head of the <hi>Popular Partie,</hi> and seized vpon the Townes of <hi>Ipre</hi> and <hi>Sluce,</hi> with both the <hi>Castles.</hi> And forthwith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7276:42"/>
sent to the Lord CORDES, Gouernour of <hi>Picardie</hi> vnder the <hi>French King,</hi> to desire aide, and to moue him, that hee on the behalfe of the <hi>French King</hi> would bee <hi>Protector</hi> of the <hi>United Towns,</hi> and by force of Armes reduce the rest. The Lord CORDES was readie to embrace the occasion, which was partly of his owne setting, and sent forthwith greater <hi>Forces,</hi> then it had beene possible for him to raise on the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, if hee had not looked for such a summons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in aide of the Lord RAVENSTEIN, and the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> with instructions to inuest the Townes betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Bruges.</hi> The <hi>French Forces</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged a little Towne called <hi>Dixmue,</hi> where part of the <hi>Flemmish Forces</hi> ioyned with them. While they lay at this siege, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> vpon pretence of the safety of the <hi>English Pale</hi> about <hi>Calice,</hi> but in truth being loth that MAXIMILIAN should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come contemptible, and therby bee shaken off by the States of <hi>Britaine</hi> about this marriage, sent ouer the Lord MORLEY with a thousand men vnto the Lord DAVBIGNY, then Deputie of <hi>Calice,</hi> with secret instructions to aide MAXIMILIAN, and to raise the siege of <hi>Dixmue.</hi> The Lord DAVBIGNY (giuing it out that all was for the strengthning of the <hi>English Marches)</hi> drew out of the <hi>Garrisons</hi> of <hi>Calice, Hammes,</hi> and <hi>Guines,</hi> to the number of a thousand Men more. So that with the fresh Succours that came vnder the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the Lord MORLEY, they made vp to the number of two thousand, or better. Which <hi>Forces</hi> ioyning with some Companies of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> put themselues into <hi>Dixmue,</hi> not perceiued by the Enemies; and passing through the Towne with some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforcement (from the <hi>Forces</hi> that were in the Towne) assailed the Enemies Campe, negligently guarded, as being out of feare; where there was a bloudy fight, in which the <hi>English</hi> and their <hi>Partakers</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:7276:42"/>
obtained the victorie, and slew to the number of eight thousand Men, with the losse on the <hi>English</hi> part of a hundred or there abouts; amongst whom was the Lord MORLEY. They tooke also their great Ordnance, with much rich spoiles, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Newport,</hi> whence the Lord DAVBIGNY re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Calice,</hi> leauing the hurt Men, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Voluntaries in <hi>Newport.</hi> But the Lord CORDES being at <hi>Ipre</hi> with a great power of Men, thinking to recouer the losse and disgrace of the fight at <hi>Dixmue,</hi> came presently on, and sate downe before <hi>Newport,</hi> and besieged it; and after some dayes siege, hee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to trie the fortune of an <hi>Assault:</hi> Which hee did one day, and succeeded therein so farre, that hee had taken the principall Tower and Fort in that Citie, and planted vpon it the <hi>French</hi> Banner. Whence neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they were presently beaten forth by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> by the helpe of some fresh Succours of Archers arriuing by good fortune (at the instant) in the Hauen of <hi>Newport.</hi> Whereupon the Lord CORDES dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and measuring the new Succours (which were small) by the Successe (which was great) leuied his Siege. By this meanes, matters grew more exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate betweene the two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> for that in the warre of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarie Forces of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> were much blouded one against another. Which Bloud rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the more, by the vaine words of the Lord CORDES, that declared himselfe an open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the <hi>English,</hi> beyond that that appertained to the present Seruice; making it a common by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word of his, <hi>That hee could bee content to lie in Hell seuen yeares, so hee might winne</hi> Calice <hi>from the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</p>
            <p>The King hauing thus vpheld the Reputation of MAXIMILIAN, aduised him now to presse on his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7276:43"/>
Marriage with <hi>Britaine</hi> to a conclusion. Which MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XIMILIAN accordingly did, and so farre forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled both with the young <hi>Lady,</hi> and with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall persons about her, as the Marriage was consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate by <hi>Proxie,</hi> with a <hi>Ceremonie</hi> at that time in these Parts new. For shee was not onely publikely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but stated as a <hi>Bride,</hi> and solemnly Bedded; and after shee was laid, there came in MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIANS <hi>Ambassadour</hi> with letters of <hi>Procuration,</hi> and in the presence of sundry Noble Personages, Men and Women, put his Legge (stript naked to the Knee) betweene the Espousall Sheets; to the end, that that <hi>Ceremonie</hi> might bee thought to amount to a <hi>Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and actuall Knowledge. This done, MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN (whose propertie was to leaue things then, when they were almost come to perfection, and to end them by imagination; like ill Archers, that draw not their Arrowes vp to the Head: and who might as easily haue bedded the <hi>Lady</hi> himselfe, as to haue made a <hi>Play</hi> and <hi>Disguise</hi> of it) thinking now all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, neglected for a time his further Proceeding, and intended his Warres. Meane while, the <hi>French King</hi> (consulting with his <hi>Diuines,</hi> and finding that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Consummation</hi> was rather an <hi>Inuention</hi> of Court, then any wayes valide by the Lawes of the <hi>Church)</hi> went more really to worke, and by secret Instruments and cunning Agents, as well <hi>Matrons</hi> about the young <hi>Lady</hi> as <hi>Councellors,</hi> first sought to remoue the Point of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> out of the minde of the <hi>Lady</hi> her selfe, wherein there was a double labour. For MAXIMILIAN was not onely contracted vnto the <hi>Lady,</hi> but MAXIMILIANS daughter was likewise contracted to King CHARLES. So as the <hi>Marriage halted vpon both feet,</hi> and was not cleare on either side: But for the <hi>Contract</hi> with King CHARLES, the Exception lay plaine and faire; for that MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIANS
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7276:43"/>
daughter was vnder yeares of <hi>consent,</hi> and so not bound by Law, but a power of Disagreement left to either part. But for the <hi>Contract</hi> made by MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN with the <hi>Lady</hi> her selfe, they were harder driuen: hauing nothing to alledge, but that it was done without the consent of her <hi>Soueraigne</hi> Lord, King CHARLES, whose <hi>Ward</hi> and <hi>Client</hi> shee was, and Hee to her in place of a Father; and therfore it was void, and of no force, for want of such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Which defect (they sayd) though it would not euacuate a <hi>Marriage,</hi> after <hi>Cohabitation,</hi> and <hi>Actuall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation;</hi> yet it was enough to make void a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi> For as for the pretended <hi>Consummation,</hi> they made sport with it, and said: <hi>That it was an argument, that</hi> MAXIMILIAN <hi>was a Widdower, and a cold Wooer, that could content himselfe to be a Bridgrome by Deputie, and would not make a little Iourney, to put all out of question.</hi> So that the young <hi>Lady,</hi> wrought vpon by these Reasons, finely instilled by such as the <hi>French King</hi> (who spared for no Rewards or Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) had made on his side; and allured likewise by the present Glory and Greatnesse of King CHARLES. (being also a young King, and a <hi>Batchelor)</hi> and loth to make her Countrey the Seat of a long and miserable Warre; secretly yeelded to accept of King CHARLES. But during this secret <hi>Treatie</hi> with the <hi>Ladie,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to saue it from Blasts of Opposition and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, King CHARLES resorting to his wonted Arts, and thinking to carry the <hi>Marriage,</hi> as hee had carried the Warres, by entertaining the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in vaine beliefe, sent a solemne <hi>Ambassage</hi> by FRANCIS Lord of <hi>Luximburge,</hi> CHARLES MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGNIAN and ROBERT GAGVIEN, Generall of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Bonnes Hommes</hi> of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> to treat a Peace and League with the King; accoupling it with an <hi>Article</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Request,</hi> that the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7276:44"/>
               <hi>French King</hi> might with the Kings good will (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto his right of <hi>Seigniorie</hi> and <hi>Tutelage)</hi> dispose of the Marriage of the young <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> as hee should thinke good; offering by a Iudiciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to make void the <hi>Marriage</hi> of MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN by <hi>Proxie.</hi> Also all this while the better to amuse the world, hee did continue in his Court and custodie the Daughter of MAXIMILIAN, who formerly had beene sent vnto him, to bee bred and educated in <hi>France;</hi> not dismissing or renvoying her, but contrariwise professing and giuing out strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee meant to proceed with that Match. And that for the <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> hee desired onely to preserue his right of <hi>Seigniory,</hi> and to giue her in <hi>Marriage</hi> to some such <hi>Allye,</hi> as might depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
            <p>When the three Commissioners came to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> they deliuered their <hi>Ambassage</hi> vnto the King, who remitted them to his <hi>Councell;</hi> where some dayes after they had Audience, and made their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position by the <hi>Prior</hi> of the <hi>Trinitie</hi> (who though hee were third in place, yet was held the best Speaker of them) to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY Lords, the King our Master, the greatest and mightiest King that raigned in</hi> France <hi>since</hi> CHARLES <hi>the Great (whose Name he beareth) hath neuerthelesse thought it no disparagement to his Greatnesse, at this time to propound a Peace, yea, and to pray a Peace with the King of</hi> England. <hi>For which purpose hee hath sent vs his Commissioners, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and enabled with full and ample power,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:7276:44"/>
               <hi>to treat and conclude; giuing vs further in charge, to open in some other businesse the secrets of his owne intentions. These be indeed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Loue-tokens <hi>betweene great Kings, to communicate one with another the true state of their affaires, and to passe by nice Points of Honour, which ought not to giue Law vnto Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. This I doe assure your Lordships; It is not possible for you to imagine the true and cordiall Loue, that the King our Master bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to your Soueraigne, except you were neare him, as we are. He vseth his Name with so great respect; he remembreth their first acquaintance at</hi> Paris <hi>with so great contentment; nay, hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer speakes of him, but that presently he falls into discourse of the miseries of great Kings, in that they cannot conuerse with their Equalls, but with Seruants. This affection to your Kings Person and Vertues,</hi> GOD <hi>hath put into the Heart of our Master, no doubt for the good of Christendome, and for purposes yet vnknowne to vs all. For other Root it cannot haue, since it was the same to the Earle of</hi> Richmond, <hi>that it is now to the King of</hi> England. <hi>This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first motiue that makes our King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Peace, and League with your Soueraigne: Good affection, and somewhat that hee findes in his owne Heart. This affection is also armed</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:7276:45"/>
with reason of Estate. For our King doth in all candour and franknesse of dealing open himselfe vnto you; that hauing an honourable, yea, and a holy Purpose, to make a Voyage and Warre in remote Parts, he considereth that it will be of no small effect, in point of Reputation to his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, if it be knowne abroad, that hee is in good peace with all his Neighbour Princes, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the King of <hi>England,</hi> whom for good causes he esteemeth most.</p>
            <p>But now (my Lords) giue me leaue to vse a few words to remoue all scruples and misse-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, betweene your Soueraigne and ours, concerning some late Actions; which if they be not cleared, may perhaps hinder this Peace. To the end, that for matters past, neither King may conceiue vnkindnesse of other, nor think the other conceiueth vnkindnesse of him. The late Actions are two; That of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and that of <hi>Flanders.</hi> In both which, it is true, that the Subiects swords of both Kings, haue encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and stricken, and the wayes and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also of the two Kings, in respect of their Confederates and Allies, haue seuered.</p>
            <p>For that of <hi>Brittaine;</hi> The King your Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne knoweth best what hath passed. It was a Warre of necessitie on our Masters part. And though the Motiues of it were sharp and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7276:45"/>
as could be, yet did he make that Warre rather with an <hi>Oliue-branch,</hi> then a <hi>Laurel-Branch</hi> in his Hand, more desiring Peace then Victorie. Besides, from time to time he sent (as it were) <hi>Blank-papers</hi> to your King, to write the conditions of Peace. For though both his Honour and Safetie went vpon it, yet he thought neither of them too precious, to put into the King of <hi>Englands</hi> hands. Neither doth your King on the other side make any vnfriendly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of your Kings sending of succours to the Duke of <hi>Brittaine;</hi> for the King knoweth well, that many things must bee done of Kings for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of their People, and it is not hard to discerne what is a Kings owne. But this matter of <hi>Brittaine</hi> is now (by the Act of <hi>GOD)</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and passed; and (as the King hopeth) like the way of a Ship in the Sea, without leauing any impression in either of the Kings mindes; as hee is sure for his part it hath not done in his.</p>
            <p>For the Action of <hi>Flanders;</hi> As the former of <hi>Brittaine</hi> was a Warre of necessitie, so this was a Warre of Justice; which with a good King is of equall necessitie, with danger of Estate, for else hee should leaue to bee a King. The Subiects of <hi>Burgundie</hi> are Subiects in Chiefe to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and their Duke the Homager and Vassall of <hi>France.</hi> They had wont to bee good
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7276:46"/>
Subiects, howsoeuer <hi>MAXIMILIAN</hi> hath of late distempered them. They fled to the <hi>King</hi> for Justice, and deliuerance from oppression, Justice hee could not denie; Purchase hee did not seeke. This was good for <hi>MAXIMILIAN,</hi> if he could haue seene it in people mutined, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Fury, and preuent Despaire. My Lords, it may bee this I haue said is needlesse, saue that the <hi>King</hi> our Master is tender in any thing, that may but glance vpon the friendship of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> The amitie betweene the two <hi>Kings</hi> (no doubt) stands entire and inuiolate. And that their Subiects swords haue clashed, it is nothing vnto the publike Peace of the Crownes; it being a thing very vsuall in auxiliarie Forces of the best and straitest Confederates, to meet and draw bloud in the Field. Nay, many times there bee Aides of the same Nation on both sides, and yet it is not (for all that) <hi>A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diuided in it selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It resteth (my Lords) that Jimpart vnto you a matter, that I know your Lordships all will much reioyce to heare; as that which importeth the Christian Common-weale more, then any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that hath hapned of long time. The <hi>King</hi> our Master hath a purpose and determination, to make Warre vpon the kingdome of <hi>Naples;</hi> being now in the possession of a Bastardslip of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7276:46"/>
               <hi>Arragon,</hi> but appertaining vnto his Maiestie, by cleare and vndoubted right; which if hee should not by iust Armes seeke to recouer, hee could neither acquite his Honour, nor answer it to his People. But his Noble and Christian thoughts rest not here. For his Resolution and Hope is, to make the Re-conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi> but as a Bridge, to transport his Forces into <hi>Grecia;</hi> and not to spare Bloud or Treasure (If it were to the impawning of his Crowne, and dis-peopling of <hi>France)</hi> till either hee hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne the Empire of the <hi>OTTOMANS,</hi> or taken it in his way to Paradise. The King knoweth well, that this is a designe; that could not arise in the minde of any <hi>King,</hi> that did not stedfastly looke vp vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> whose quarrell this is, and from whom commeth both the Will, and the Deed.

THus did the <hi>French Ambassadors</hi> with great shew of their Kings affection, and many sugred words seeke to adulce all matters betweene the two Kings, hauing two things for their ends; The one, to keepe the King quiet till the Marriage of <hi>Britaine</hi> was past, and this was but a <hi>Summer fruit,</hi> which they thought was almost ripe and would be soone gathered. The other was more lasting; and that was to put him into such a temper as he might be no disturbance or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the voyage for <hi>Italie.</hi> The <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> were silent; and said only, <hi>That they knew the Ambassadors would looke for no answer, till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the King;</hi> And so they rose from <hi>Councell.</hi> The King could not well tell what to thinke of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Britaine.</hi> He saw plainly the ambition of the <hi>French King</hi> was to impatronize himselfe of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;</hi> but he wondred he would bring into his <hi>House</hi> a litigious Marriage, especially considering who was his Successor. But weighing one thing with another, he gaue <hi>Britaine</hi> for lost; but resolued to make his profit of this businesse of <hi>Britaine,</hi> as a quarrell for Warre; and that of <hi>Naples,</hi> as a <hi>Wrench</hi> and meane for Peace; being well aduertised, how strongly the King was bent vpon that <hi>Action.</hi> Hauing therefore conferred diuers times with his <hi>Councell,</hi> and keeping himselfe somewhat close; he gaue a direction to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> for a formall answer to the <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and that hee did in the presence of his <hi>Councell.</hi> And after calling the <hi>Chancellor</hi> to him apart, bade him speake in such language, as was fit for a <hi>Treatie</hi> that was to end in a Breach; and gaue him also a speciall <hi>Caueat,</hi> that he should not vse any words, to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the voyage of <hi>Italie.</hi> Soone after the <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> were sent for to the <hi>Councell,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> spake to them in this sort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:7276:48"/>
               <hi>MY Lords Ambassadours, I shall make answer by the Kings Commandement, vnto the eloquent Declaration of you my Lord</hi> Prior, <hi>in a briefe and plaine manner. The King forgetteth not his former loue and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the King your</hi> Master. <hi>But of this there needeth no repetition. For if it bee betweene them as it was, it is well; if there bee any alteration, it is not words that will make it vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Businesse of</hi> Britaine, <hi>the King findeth it a little strange that the</hi> French King <hi>maketh mention of it, as matter of well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing at his hand. For that Deseruing was no more, but to make him his</hi> Instrument, <hi>to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize one of his best</hi> Confederates. <hi>And for the</hi> Marriage, <hi>the King would not meddle in it if your</hi> Master <hi>would marry by the</hi> Book, <hi>and not by the</hi> Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For that of</hi> Flanders, <hi>if the Subiects of</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie <hi>had appealed to your King, as their Chiefe Lord, at first, by way of</hi> Supplication; <hi>it might haue had a shew of Justice. But it was a new forme of</hi> Processe, <hi>for Subiects to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son their</hi> Prince <hi>first, and to slay his</hi> Officers, <hi>and then to be</hi> Complainants. <hi>The King saith, That sure he is, when the</hi> French King, <hi>and himselfe sent to the Subiects of</hi> Scotland <hi>(that</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7276:49"/>
had taken <hi>Armes</hi> against their King) they both spake in another <hi>Stile,</hi> and did in princely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner signifie their detestation of <hi>Popular Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> vpon the Person or Authoritie of <hi>Princes.</hi> But my Lords Ambassadors, the King leaueth these two actions thus: That on the one side, hee hath not receiued any manner of satisfaction from you concerning them; and on the other, that he doth not apprehend them so deepely, as in respect of them, to refuse to treat of Peace, if other things may goe hand in hand. As for the Warre of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Designe</hi> against the <hi>Turke;</hi> the King hath commanded me expressely to say, That hee doth wish with all his heart, to his good <hi>Brother</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> that his Fortunes may succeede accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Hopes, and honourable intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And whensoeuer he shall heare, that he is prepared for <hi>Grecia,</hi> as your <hi>Master</hi> is pleased now to say, that he beggeth a Peace of the King, so the King will then begge of him a part in that Warre.</p>
            <p>But now my Lords Ambassadours, I am to propound vnto you somewhat on the Kings part. The King your <hi>Master</hi> hath taught our King what to say and demand. You say (my Lord <hi>Prior)</hi> that your King is resolued to recouer his right to <hi>Naples,</hi> wrongfully detained from him.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7276:49"/>
And that if hee should not thus doe, he could not acquite his Honour, nor answere it to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thinke (my Lords) that the King our <hi>Master</hi> saith the same thing ouer againe to you touching <hi>Normandie, Guien, Angeou,</hi> yea and the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> it selfe. I cannot expresse it better then in your owne words: If therefore the <hi>French</hi> King shall consent, that the King our <hi>Masters</hi> Title to <hi>France</hi> (at least <hi>Tribute</hi> for the same) be handled in the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> the King is content to goe on with the rest; otherwise he refuseth to Treat.</p>
            <p>THe <hi>Ambassadors</hi> being somwhat abashed with this demand, answered in some heat; <hi>That they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, but the King their Soueraignes sword would be able to maintaine his Scepter:</hi> And they assured themselues, he neither could nor would yeeld to any diminution of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> either in <hi>Territory</hi> or <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</hi> But howsoeuer, they were too great matters for them to speake of, hauing no Commission. It was replied, that the King looked for no other answer from them; but would forth-with send his own <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors</hi> to the <hi>French King.</hi> There was a question also asked at the Table, <hi>Whether the French King would agree to haue the disposing of the Marriage of</hi> Britaine <hi>with an exception &amp; exclusion, that he should not marry her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?</hi> To which the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> answered; That it was so farre out of their Kings thoughts, as they had receiued no Instructions touching the same. Thus were the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> dismissed, all saue the <hi>Prior;</hi> and were followed immediatly by THOMAS <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and THOMAS GOLDENSTON <hi>Prior</hi> of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7276:50"/>
               <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who were presently sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into <hi>France.</hi> In the meane space, LIONELL Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Concordia,</hi> was sent as <hi>Nuntio</hi> from <hi>Pope</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEXANDER the sixth to both Kings, to mooue a Peace betweene them. For <hi>Pope</hi> ALEXANDER fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe pent and lockt vp, by a League and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of the Principall States of <hi>Italie,</hi> that hee could not make his way for the aduancement of his owne <hi>House</hi> (which he immoderatly thirsted after) was desirous to trouble the waters in <hi>Italie,</hi> that hee might fish the better; casting the Net, not out of Saint PETERS, but out of BORGIA'S Barke. And doubting lest the feares fom <hi>England,</hi> might stay the <hi>French Kings</hi> voyage into <hi>Italie,</hi> dispatched this <hi>Bishop</hi> to compose all matters betweene the two Kings, if he could. Who first repaired to the <hi>French King,</hi> and finding him well inclined (as he conceiued) tooke on his Iourney towards <hi>England,</hi> and found the <hi>English Ambassadors</hi> at <hi>Calice,</hi> on their way towards the <hi>French King.</hi> After some conference with them, he was in Honourable manner transported ouer into <hi>England,</hi> where he had audience of the King. But notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee had a good <hi>Ominous name</hi> to haue made a Peace, nothing followed. For in the meane time, the purpose of the <hi>French King</hi> to marry the Duchesse could be no longer dissembled. Wherefore the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ambassadors</hi> (finding how things went) took their leaue, and returned. And the <hi>Prior</hi> also was warned from hence, to depart out of <hi>England.</hi> Who when he turned his backe (more like a <hi>Pedant,</hi> then an <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour)</hi> dispersed a bitter <hi>Libell,</hi> in Latine Verse, against the King; vnto which the King (though hee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a <hi>Pedant)</hi> yet was content to cause an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to bee made in like Verse; and that as speaking in his owne Person, but in a style of <hi>Scorne</hi> and <hi>Sport.</hi> About this time also was borne the Kings second Son
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7276:50"/>
HENRY, who afterward reigned. And soone after followed the solemnization of the marriagee between CHARLES, and ANNE <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Britaine,</hi> with whom he receiued the <hi>Duchie</hi> of <hi>Britaine</hi> as her Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Daughter of MAXIMILIAN being a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent home. Which when it came to the Eares of MAXIMILIAN (who would neuer beleeue it till it was done, being euer the Principall in deceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, though in this the <hi>French King</hi> did very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely second it) and tumbling it ouer and ouer in his thoughts, that he should at one blowe (with such a double scorne) be defeated, both of the marriage of his daughter, and his owne (vpon both which hee had fixed high imaginations;) he lost all patience, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the Respects fit to be continued betweene great Kings (euen when their bloud is hottest, and most risen) fell to bitter <hi>Inuectiues</hi> against the person and Actions of the <hi>French King.</hi> And (by how much he was the lesse able to do, talking so much the more) spake all the Iniuries he could deuise of CHARLES, saying; That he was the most perfidious man vpon the Earth, and that he had made a marriage compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between an <hi>Aduoutry</hi> and a <hi>Rape:</hi> which was done (he said) by the iust iudgement of God; to the end, that (the <hi>Nullitie</hi> thereof being so appparant to all the World) the Race of so vnworthy a person might not reigne in <hi>France.</hi> And forthwith he sent <hi>Ambassadors</hi> as well to the King of <hi>England,</hi> as to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to incite them to Warre, and to treat a <hi>League</hi> offensiue against <hi>France,</hi> promising to concurre with great Forces of his owne. Hereupon the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (going neuerthelesse his owne way) called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> it being the seuenth yeere of his Reigne; and the first day of opening thereof (sitting vnder his <hi>Cloth</hi> of <hi>Estate)</hi> spake himselfe vnto his Lords, and Commons in this manner.</p>

MY Lords, and you the Commons, When I purposed to make a Warre in <hi>Britaine</hi> by my <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> I made declaration thereof to you by my <hi>Chancellor.</hi> But now that I meane to make a Warre vpon <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Person,</hi> I will declare it to you my Selfe. That Warre, was to desend another mans Right, but this is to recouer our owne; And that ended by <hi>Accident,</hi> but we hope this shall end in <hi>Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French King</hi> troubles the Christian World. That which he hath, is not his owne, and yet he seeketh more. He hath inuested himselfe of <hi>Britaine.</hi> Hee maintaineth the <hi>Rebels</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and he threatneth <hi>Italy.</hi> For Our Selues, he hath proceeded from Dissimulation, to Neglect; and from Neglect to Contumely. He hath assayled our <hi>Confederates:</hi> He deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our <hi>Tribute:</hi> In a word, he seekes Warre. So did not his <hi>Father,</hi> but sought Peace at Our Hands; and so perhaps will hee, when good Counsell or Time, shall make him see as much as his Father did.</p>
            <p>Meane while; let Us make his <hi>Ambition,</hi> our <hi>Aduantage;</hi> and let vs not stand vpon a few Crownes of <hi>Tribute,</hi> or <hi>Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but (by the fauour of <hi>Almighty GOD)</hi> try Our Right for the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> it selfe; remembring that there hath beene <hi>A</hi>

French <hi>King Prisoner in</hi> England, <hi>and a King of</hi> England <hi>Crowned in</hi> France. Our <hi>Confederates</hi> are not diminished. <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> is in a mightier Hand then euer, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more prouoked. <hi>Britaine</hi> cannot helpe vs, but it may hurt them.

The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (doubt yee not) will ioyne with vs, not knowing where the <hi>French Kings</hi> Ambition will stay. Our Holy <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> likes no <hi>Tramontanes</hi> in <hi>Italie.</hi> But howsoeuer it bee, this Matter of <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,</hi> is rather to bee thought on, then recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on.

            </p>
            <p>At the <hi>Battailes</hi> of <hi>Cressy, Poictiers, Agent-Court,</hi> wee were of our selues. <hi>France</hi> hath much people, and few Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.

Some good Horse they haue; but those are <hi>Forces,</hi> which are least fit for a Defensiue <hi>Warre,</hi> where the Actions are in the <hi>Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants</hi> choice. It was our <hi>Discords</hi> onely, that lost <hi>France;</hi> and (by the Power of <hi>GOD)</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:7276:52"/>
it is the good <hi>Peace</hi> which wee now enioy, that will recouer it. <hi>GOD</hi> hath hitherto blessed my <hi>Sword.</hi> I haue in this time that I haue Reigned, weeded out my bad Subiects, and tryed my good. My People and I know one another; which breeds Confidence. And if there should bee any bad Bloud left in the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> an Honourable <hi>Forrain Warre</hi> will vent it, or purifie it. In this great <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,</hi> let me haue your Aduice, and Aid. If any of you were to make his Sonne <hi>Knight,</hi> you might haue aid of your <hi>Tenants</hi> by <hi>Law.</hi> This concernes the <hi>Knighthood</hi> and <hi>Spurres</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> whereof I am <hi>Father;</hi> and bound not only to seeke to maintaine it, but to aduance it. But for Matter of <hi>Treasure,</hi> let it not be taken from the Poorest Sort; but from those, to whom the Benefit of the Warre may redound. <hi>France</hi> is no Wildernesse: and I, that professe Good Husbandrie, hope to make the Warre (after the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings) to pay it selfe. Goe together in <hi>GODS</hi> Name, and loose no time; for I haue called this <hi>Parliament</hi> wholly for this Cause.</p>

THus spake the King; But for all this, though hee shewed great forwardnesse for a Warre, not onely to his <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> but to his <hi>Priuie-Councell</hi> likewise, (except the two <hi>Bishops</hi> and a few more) yet neuerthelesse in his secret intentions, hee had no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to goe through with any Warre, vpon <hi>France.</hi> But the truth was, that hee did but traffique with that Warre, to make his <hi>Returne</hi> in money. Hee knew well, that <hi>France</hi> was now entire, and at vnitie with it selfe, and neuer so mightie many yeares before. Hee saw by the taste that he had of his Forces sent into <hi>Britaine,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> knew well enough how to make warre with the <hi>English;</hi> by not putting things to the hazard of a <hi>Battaile,</hi> but wearing them by long Sieges of <hi>Townes,</hi> and strong fortified Encampings. IAMES the Third of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (his true friend, and <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate)</hi> gone; and IAMES the Fourth (that had succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) wholly at the deuotion of <hi>France,</hi> and ill affected towards him. As for the Coniunctions of FERDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDO of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and MAXIMILIAN; hee could make no foundation vpon them. For the One had <hi>Power,</hi> and not <hi>Will;</hi> and the Other hath <hi>Will,</hi> and not <hi>Power.</hi> Besides that, FERDINANDO had but newly taken breath, from the Warre with the <hi>Moores;</hi> and merchanded at this time with <hi>France,</hi> for the restoring of the Counties of <hi>Russignon</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignian,</hi> oppignorated to the <hi>French.</hi> Neither was hee out of feare of the <hi>Discontents,</hi> and ill bloud within the <hi>Realme;</hi> which hauing vsed alwaies to represse and appease in person, hee was loth they should find him at a distance beyond Sea, and engaged in warre. Finding therfore the Inconueniences and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the prosecution of a Warre, hee cast with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe how to compasse two things. The one, how by the declaration, and inchoation of a warre, to make his <hi>Profit.</hi> The other, how to come off from the warre,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7276:53"/>
with sauing of his <hi>Honour.</hi> For <hi>Profit,</hi> it was to bee made two wayes; vpon his <hi>Subiects</hi> for the <hi>Warre,</hi> and vpon his <hi>Enemies</hi> for the <hi>Peace;</hi> like a good <hi>Merchant,</hi> that maketh his gaine, both vpon the Commodities <hi>Exported,</hi> and <hi>Imported</hi> backe againe. For the point of <hi>Honour,</hi> wherein hee might suffer, for giuing ouer the Warre; hee considered well, that as hee could not trust vpon the aides of FERDINANDO and MAXIMILIAN for supports of Warre: so the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puissance of the one, and the double proceeding of the other, lay faire for him for occasions to accept of <hi>Peace.</hi> These things hee did wisely fore-see, and did as artificially conduct, wherby all things fell into his lappe, as hee desired.</p>
            <p>For as for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> it presently tooke fire, being affectionate (of old) the Warre of <hi>France;</hi> and desirous afresh to repaire the dishonour, they thought the King sustained by the losse of <hi>Britaine.</hi> Therfore they aduised the King (with great alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) to vndertake the Warre of <hi>France.</hi> And although the <hi>Parliament</hi> consisted of the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> (together with principall <hi>Citizens</hi> and Townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) yet worthily and iustly respecting more the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (whose deputies they were) then their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Persons, and finding by the Lord <hi>Chancellours</hi> speech the Kings inclination that way; they consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>Commissioners</hi> should goe forth, for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and leuying of a <hi>Beneuolence,</hi> from the more able sort. This <hi>Tax</hi> (called <hi>Beneuolence)</hi> was deuised by EDWARD the Fourth, for which hee sustained much Enuie. It was abolished by RICHARD the Third by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to ingratiate himselfe with the people; and it was now reuiued by the King, but with consent of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for so it was not in the time of King EDWARD the Fourth. But by this way hee raised exceeding great summes. Insomuch

as the Citie of <hi>London</hi> (in those dayes) contributed nine thousand pounds and better; and that chiefly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied vpon the wealthier sort. There is a Tradition of a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that Bishop MORTON the <hi>Chancellour</hi> vsed, to raise vp the <hi>Beneuolence</hi> to higher Rates; and some called it his <hi>Forke,</hi> and some his <hi>Crotch.</hi> For hee had couched an <hi>Article</hi> in the Instructions to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,</hi> who were to leuie the <hi>Beneuolence; That if they met with any that were sparing, they should tell them, That they must needs haue, because they laid vp; and if they were spenders, they must needs haue, because it was seene in their Port, and manner of liuing.</hi> So neither kinde came amisse.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Parliament</hi> was meerly a <hi>Parliament</hi> of Warre; for it was in Substance, but a declaration of Warre against <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> with some <hi>Statutes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereunto; As the seuere punishing of <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payes,</hi> and keeping backe of <hi>Souldiours</hi> wages in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. The like seueritie for the departure of <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours</hi> without licence; Strengthening of the <hi>Common-Law</hi> in fauour of <hi>Protections,</hi> for those that were in the Kings seruice; And the setting the gate open and wide, for men to sell or <hi>Morgage</hi> their lands without <hi>Fines</hi> for <hi>Alienation,</hi> to furnish themselues with money for the Warre; And lastly, the voiding of all <hi>Scottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> out of <hi>England.</hi> There was also a <hi>Statute,</hi> for the dispersing of the <hi>Standard</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England;</hi> therby to size <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Measures;</hi> and two or three more of lesse importance.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Parliament</hi> was broken vp (which lasted not long) the King went on with his Preparations for the Warre of <hi>France;</hi> yet neglected not in the meane time the affaires of MAXIMILIAN, for the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and restoring him to his authoritie amongst his <hi>Subiects.</hi> For at that time, the Lord of <hi>Rauenstein</hi> being not onely a <hi>Subiect</hi> rebelled, but a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7276:54"/>
               <hi>Seruant</hi> reuolted (and so much the more malicious and violent, by the aide of <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Gaunt)</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Towne, and both the Castles of <hi>Sluice;</hi> as wee said before.</p>
            <p>And hauing (by the commoditie of the Hauen) gotten together certaine Ships and Barkes, fell to a kind of <hi>Pyraticall</hi> Trade; robbing and spoyling, and taking Prisoners the Ships and Vessels of all Nations, that passed alongst that Coast, towards the <hi>Mart</hi> of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> or into any part of <hi>Brabant, Zeland,</hi> or <hi>Freezland;</hi> being euer well victualled from <hi>Picardie,</hi> besides the commoditie of Victuals from <hi>Sluice,</hi> and the Countrey adjacent, and the auailes of his owne <hi>Prizes.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> assisted him still vnder-hand; and hee likewise (as all men doe, that haue beene of both sides) thought himselfe not safe, except hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended vpon a third <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a small Towne some two miles from <hi>Bruges,</hi> towards the Sea, called <hi>Dam;</hi> which was a Fort and Approch to <hi>Bruges,</hi> and had a relation also to <hi>Sluice.</hi> This Towne the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> had attempted often, (not for any worth of the Towne in it selfe, but because it might choake <hi>Bruges,</hi> and cut it off from the Sea) and euer failed. But therewith the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie</hi> came downe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Person of an <hi>Vmpire,</hi> to compose things betweene MAXIMILIAN and his Subiects; but being (indeed) fast and assured to MAXIMILIAN. Vpon this Pretext of <hi>Neutralitie</hi> and Treatie, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Bruges;</hi> desiring of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Bruges,</hi> to enter peaceably into their Towne, with a Retinue of some number of men of Armes, fit for his Estate; being somewhat the more (as hee said) the better to guard him in a Countrey, that was vp in Armes: and bearing them in hand, that hee was to communicate with them of diuers matters of great importance, for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7276:54"/>
their good. Which hauing obtained of them, hee sent his Carriages and <hi>Harbingers</hi> before him, to prouide his Lodging. So that his <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Warre</hi> entred the Citie in good Array, but in peaceable manner, and he followed. They that went before, enquired still for <hi>Innes</hi> and Lodgings, as if they would haue rested there all Night, and so went on, till they came to the Gate, that leadeth directly towards <hi>Dam;</hi> and they of <hi>Bruges</hi> only gazed vpon them and gaue them passage. The <hi>Captaines</hi> and inhabitants of <hi>Dam</hi> also suspected no harme, from any that passed through <hi>Bruges;</hi> and discouering Forces a farre off, supposed they had beene some <hi>Succours,</hi> that were come from their Friends, knowing some Dangers towards them. And so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing nothing but well, till it was too late, suflered them to enter their Towne. By which kinde of <hi>Sleight</hi> rather then <hi>Stratageme,</hi> the Towne of <hi>Dam</hi> was taken and the Town of <hi>Bruges</hi> shrewdly blockt vp, wherby they tooke great discouragement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie</hi> hauing wonne the Towne of <hi>Dam,</hi> sent immediatly to the King to let him know that it was <hi>Sluice</hi> chiefely, and the Lord RAVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STEIN, that kept the Rebellion of <hi>Flanders</hi> in life; And that if it pleased the King to besiege it by Sea, he also would besiege it by Land, and so cut out the <hi>Core</hi> of those Warres.</p>
            <p>The King willing to vphold the Authoritie of MAXIMILIAN (the better to hold <hi>France</hi> in awe) and being likewise sued vnto by his <hi>Merchants,</hi> for that the Seas were much infested by the Barkes of the Lord RAVENSTEIN; sent straightwayes Sir EDWARD POYNINGS, a valiant man, and of good seruice, with twelue Ships, well furnished with Souldiers and Artillerie, to cleare the Seas, and to besiege <hi>Sluice</hi> on that part. The <hi>Englishmen</hi> did not only coupe vp the Lord RAVENSTEIN, that hee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7276:55"/>
stirred not, and likewise hold in strait Siege the Maritime part of the Towne; but also assailed one of the Castles, and renewed the assault so for twentie dayes space (issuing still out of their Ships at the Ebbe) as they made great slaughter of them of the Castle; who continually fought with them to repulse them, though of the <hi>English</hi> part also were slaine a brother of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Oxfords,</hi> and some fiftie more.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Siege</hi> still continuing more and more strait, and both the Castles (which were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall strength of the Towne) being distressed, the one by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and the other by the <hi>English;</hi> and a Bridge of boats, which the Lord RAVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STEIN had made betweene both Castles, whereby Succours and Releefe might passe from the one to the other, being on a night set on fire by the <hi>English,</hi> hco despairing to hold the Towne, yeelded (at the last) the Castles to the <hi>English,</hi> and the Towne to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> by composition. Which done, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie</hi> and Sir EDWARD POYNINGS treated with them of <hi>Bruges,</hi> to submit themselues to MAXIMILIAN their Lord; which after some time they did, paying (in some good part) the Charge of the Warre, whereby the <hi>Almaines</hi> and forraigne Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours were dismissed. The example of <hi>Bruges,</hi> other of the <hi>Reuolted Townes</hi> followed; so that MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN grew to be out of danger, but (as his manner was to handle matters) neuer out of necessitie. And Sir EDWARD POYNINGS (after he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at <hi>Sluice</hi> some good while, till all things were setled) returned vnto the King, being then before <hi>Bulleigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Somewhat about this time came Letters from FERDINANDO, and ISABELLA, King and Queene of <hi>Spaino;</hi> signifying the finall conquest of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7276:55"/>
               <hi>Granada</hi> from the <hi>Moores;</hi> which action in it selfe so worthie, King FERDINANDO (whose manner was neuer to lose any vertue for the shewing) had expressed and displayed in his letters at large, with all the particularities, and religious <hi>Punctoes</hi> and Ceremonies, that were obserued in the reception of that <hi>Citie</hi> and <hi>Kingdome:</hi> Shewing amongst other things, That the King would not by any meanes in person enter the Citie, vntill hee had first aloofe seene the <hi>Crosse</hi> set vp vpon the greater <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> whereby it became <hi>Christian</hi> ground: That likewise before hee would enter, he did <hi>Homage</hi> to God aboue, pronouncing by an <hi>Herauld</hi> from the <hi>Height</hi> of that Tower, that hee did acknowledge to haue recouered that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> by the helpe of GOD <hi>Almightie</hi> and the glorious <hi>Virgin,</hi> and the vertuous Apostle Saint IAMES, and the holy Father INNOCENT the Eight, together with the aides and seruices of his <hi>Prelates, Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Commons:</hi> That yet he stirred not from his <hi>Campe,</hi> till hee had seene a little Armie of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> to the number of seuen hundred and more <hi>Christians</hi> (that had liued in bonds and seruitude as <hi>Slaues</hi> to the <hi>Moores)</hi> passe before his Eyes, singing a <hi>Psalme</hi> for their redemption, and that he had giuen <hi>Tribute</hi> vnto GOD by Almes, and releefe, extended to them all, for his admission into the Citie. These things were in the Letters, with many more Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a kind of <hi>Holy Ostentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King euer willing to put himselfe into the <hi>Consort</hi> or <hi>Quire</hi> of all religious Actions, and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting much the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (as farre as one King can affect another) partly for his vertues, and partly for a counterpoise to <hi>France;</hi> vpon the receipt of these Letters, sent all his <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> that were about the <hi>Court,</hi> together with the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in great solemnitie to the Church
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7276:56"/>
of <hi>Pauls;</hi> there to heare a Declaration from the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> now <hi>Cardinall.</hi> When they were assembled, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> (standing vpon the vppermost step or Halfe-pase before the <hi>Quire;</hi> and all the <hi>Nobles, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> and <hi>Gouernours</hi> of the Citie at the foot of the Staires) made a Speech to them; letting them know, that they were assembled in that Consecrate place, to sing vnto God a <hi>New-song;</hi> For that (said he) these many yeares the <hi>Christians</hi> haue not gayned new ground or Territorie vpon the <hi>Infidels,</hi> nor enlarged and set further the <hi>Bounds</hi> of the <hi>Christian-world:</hi> But this is now done, by the prowesse and deuotion of FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, Kings of <hi>Spaine;</hi> Who haue (to their immortall Honour) reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the great and rich Kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi> and the populous and mightie Citie of the same name, from the <hi>Moores,</hi> hauing beene in possession thereof by the space of seuen hundred yeares, and more. For which, this Assembly and all <hi>Christians</hi> are to render laud and thankes vnto God, and to celebrate this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Act of the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> who in this is not only <hi>Victorious,</hi> but <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> in the gaining of new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith. And the rather, for that this Victorie and Conquest is obtained, without much effusion of bloud. Whereby it is to bee hoped, that there shall bee gained, not only new Territorie, but infinite soules, to the Church of <hi>Christ;</hi> whom the <hi>Almightie</hi> (as it seemes) would haue liue to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. Herewithall hee did relate some of the most memorable Particulars of the Warre and Victorie. And after his Speech ended, the whole assemblie went solemnely in <hi>Procession,</hi> and <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Solemnitie, the King kept his <hi>May Day</hi> at his Palace of <hi>Sheine,</hi> now <hi>Richmond.</hi> Where to warme the blood of his <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:7276:56"/>
against the warre, hee kept great Triumphs of <hi>Iusting</hi> and <hi>Tourney,</hi> during all that Moneth. In which space it so fell our, that <hi>Sir</hi> IAMES PARKER, and HVGH VAVGHAH, (one of the Kings Gentlemen-Vshers) hauing had a Controuersie touching certaine <hi>Armes,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Armes</hi> had giuen VAVGHAN, were appointed to runne some <hi>Courses</hi> one against an other. And by accident of a faultie Helmet, that PARKER had on, he was stricken into the mouth at the first course, so that his tongue was borne vnto the hinder part of his head, in such sort that hee died pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vpon the Place. Which because of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie precedent, and the Death that followed, was accounted amongst the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> as a <hi>Combate</hi> or Tryall of Right. The King, towards the end of this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, hauing put his Forces, where with hee meant to inuade <hi>France,</hi> in readinesse, (but so as they were not yet met or mustered together) sent VRSWICK (now made his <hi>Almoner)</hi> and <hi>Sir</hi> IOHN RISLEY, to MAXIMILIAN; to let him know, that hee was in Armes, ready to passe the Seas into <hi>France,</hi> and did but expect to heare from him, when and where he did appoint to ioyne with him, according to his promise made vnto him by COVNTEBALT, his <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English Ambassadors,</hi> hauing repaired to MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XIMILIAN, did finde his power and promise at a very great distance; hee being vtterly vnprouided of <hi>Men, Money,</hi> and <hi>Armes,</hi> for any such enterprize. For MAXIMILIAN, hauing neither <hi>Wing</hi> to flie on (for that his Patrimony of <hi>Austria</hi> was not in his hands, his Father beeing then liuing: And on the other side, his <hi>Matrimonial</hi> Territories of <hi>Flanders</hi> being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Dowre to his <hi>Mother-in-law,</hi> and partly not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable, in respect of the late <hi>Rebellions)</hi> was thereby destitute of meanes to enter into Warre. The <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:7276:57"/>
saw this well, but wisely thought fit to aduertise the King thereof, rather than to returne themselues till the Kings further pleasure were knowne: The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that MAXIMILIAN himselfe spake as great, as euer hee did before, and entertained them with dilatory Answers; so as the formall part of their <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage</hi> might well warrant and require their further stay. The King hereupon (who doubted as much before, and saw through his businesse from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) wrote backe to the <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their discretion in not returning, and willing them to keepe the State wherein they found MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN, as a Secret, till they heard further from him; And meane while went on with his Voyage Royall for <hi>France,</hi> suppressing for a time this Aduertisement touching MAXIMILIAN'S pouertie and disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
            <p>By this time, was drawne together a great and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant Armie into the Citie of <hi>London.</hi> In which were THOMAS <hi>Marquesse Dorset,</hi> THOMAS <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arundell,</hi> THOMAS <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Derby,</hi> GEORGE <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> EDMOND <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> GEORGE <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> THOMAS <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with a great number of <hi>Barons, Knights,</hi> and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> and amongst them, RICHARD THOMAS, much noted for the braue Troupes that hee brought out of <hi>Wales;</hi> The Armie rising in the whole to the number of fiue and twenty thousand <hi>Foot,</hi> and sixteene hundred <hi>Horse.</hi> Ouer which, the King (constant in his accustomed trust and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) made IASPER <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and IOHN <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Generals vnder his owne Person. The ninth of <hi>September,</hi> in the eighth yeere of his Reigne, he departed from <hi>Greenwich,</hi> towards the Sea; all men wondring, that hee tooke that Season (beeing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7276:57"/>
so neare winter) to begin the Warre; and some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gathering it was a Signe, that the Warre would not beelong. Neuerthelesse, the King gaue out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, thus: <hi>That he intending not to make a Summer busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, but a resolute Warre (without terme prefixed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till bee recouered</hi> France; <hi>it skilled not much when bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it: especially, hauing</hi> Calice <hi>at his backe; where he might winter, if the reason of the Warre so required.</hi> The sixt of <hi>October,</hi> hee imbarqued at <hi>Sandwich;</hi> and the same day tooke land at <hi>Calice:</hi> which was the <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> where all his Forces were assigned to meet. But in this his Iourney towards the Sea side (wherein, for the cause that we shall now speake of, he houered so much the longer) hee had receiued Letters from the Lord CORDES: who the hotter he was against the <hi>English</hi> in time of <hi>Warre,</hi> had the more credit in a Negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Peace;</hi> and besides was held a man open, and of good faith. In which Letters there was made an Ouerture of Peace from the <hi>French King,</hi> with such Conditions, as were somewhat to the Kings Taste: but this was carried at the first with wonderfull secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The King was no sooner come to <hi>Calice,</hi> but the calme windes of <hi>Peace</hi> began to blow. For, first, the <hi>English Ambassadors</hi> returned out of <hi>Flanders</hi> from MAXIMILIAN, and certified the King, that he was not to hope for any aide from MAXIMILIAN, for that he was altogether improuided. His will was good; but he lacked mony. And this was made knowne, and spread through the Army. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>English</hi> were therewithall nothing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied; and that it bee the manner of <hi>Souldiers, vpon bad newes to speake the more brauely:</hi> yet neuerthelesse, it was a kind of <hi>Preparatiue</hi> to a Peace. Instantly in the neck of this (as the King had laid it) came newes that FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had concluded a Peace with King CHARLES;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7276:58"/>
and that CHARLES had restored vnto them the Counties of <hi>Russignon</hi> and <hi>Perpignian,</hi> which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were <hi>Morgaged</hi> by IOHN King of <hi>Arragon</hi> (FER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINANDOES Father) vnto <hi>France,</hi> for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crownes: which debt was also, vpon this Peace, by CHARLES clearely released. This came also handsomely to put on the Peace: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so potent a <hi>Confederate</hi> was fallen off, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was a faire example of a Peace bought; so as the King should not bee the sole Merchant in this <hi>Peace.</hi> Vpon these <hi>Aires</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that the Bishop of Excester, and the Lord DAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIGNEY (Gouernour of <hi>Calice)</hi> should giue a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the Lord CORDES, for the <hi>Treatie</hi> of a <hi>Peace.</hi> But himselfe neuerthelesse, and his Armie, the fifteenth of <hi>October,</hi> remooued from <hi>Calice,</hi> and in foure dayes march sate him downe before <hi>Bulloigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Siege of <hi>Bulloigne</hi> (which continued neare a Moneth) there passed no memorable Action, no<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Accident of Warre: onely Sir IOHN SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAGE, a valiant Captaine, was slaine, riding about the Walls of the Towne, to take a View. The Towne was both well fortified, and well manned; yet it was distressed, and ready for an Assault. Which if it had beene giuen (as was thought) would haue cost much Bloud; but yet the Towne would haue beene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the end. Meane while, a Peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> to continue for both the Kings Liues. Where there was no Article of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; being in effect, rather a <hi>Bargaine,</hi> than a <hi>Treatie.</hi> For, all things remayned as they were: saue that there should bee payed to the King seuen hundred fortie fiue thousand Duckats in present, for his Charges in that Iourney; and fiue and twentie thousand Crownes yearely, for his Charges sustained
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7276:58"/>
in the Aides of the <hi>Britons.</hi> For wich <hi>Annuall,</hi> though he had MAXIMILIAN bound before for those Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; yet hee counted the alteration of the Hand, as much as the principall Debt. And besides, it was left somewhat indefinitely, when it should determine or expire: which made the <hi>English</hi> esteeme it as a <hi>Tribute,</hi> carried vnder faire Tearmes. And the truth is, it was paid both to the King, and to his Sonne King HENRY the Eight, longer than it could continue vpon any computation of Charges. There were also assigned by the <hi>French King,</hi> vnto al the King's principal <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,</hi> great <hi>Pensions,</hi> besides rich Gifts for the present. Which whether the King did permit, to saue his owne Purse from Rewards, or to communicate the Enuie of a Businesse, that was displeasing to his People, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly interpreted. For certainly, the King had no great fancie to owne this <hi>Peace.</hi> And therefore, a little before it was concluded, he had vnder-hand procured some of his best <hi>Captaines,</hi> and <hi>Men of Warre,</hi> to aduise him to a <hi>Peace</hi> vnder their Hands, in an earnest manner, in the Nature of a <hi>Supplication.</hi> But, the truth is, this <hi>Peace</hi> was welcome to both Kings. To CHARLES, for that it assured vnto him the possession of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and freed the enterprise of <hi>Naples.</hi> To HENRY, for that it filled his Coffers; and that hee foresaw at that time a storme of inward troubles comming vpon him; which presently after brake forth. But it gaue no lesse discontent to the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and principall persons of the <hi>Armie;</hi> who had many of them sold or engaged their estates, vpon the hopes of the Warre. They stucke not to say, <hi>That the King cared not to plume his Nobilitie and People, to feather himselfe.</hi> And some made themselues merrie with that the <hi>King</hi> had said in Parliament: <hi>That after the Warre was once begun, he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not but to make it pay it selfe;</hi> saying hee had kept promise.</p>

Hauing risen from <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> hee went to <hi>Calice,</hi> where hee stayed some time. From whence also hee wrote Letters, (which was a Courtesie that hee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vsed) to the <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> his brethren; halfe bragging, what great summes hee had obtayned for the <hi>Peace;</hi> knowing well, that full <hi>Cofers</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> is euer good Newes to <hi>London.</hi> And better Newes it would haue beene, if their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence</hi> had beene but a <hi>Loane.</hi> And vpon the seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>December</hi> following, hee returned to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> where he kept his <hi>Christmasse.</hi>

            <p>Soone after the Kings returne, he sent the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> to ALPHONSO <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Calabria,</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne to FERDINANDO King of <hi>Naples;</hi> An honour sought by that <hi>Prince,</hi> to hold him vp in the eyes of the <hi>Italians:</hi> Who, expecting the Armes of CHARLES, made great account of the Amitie of <hi>England,</hi> for a Bridle to <hi>France.</hi> It was receiued by ALPHONSO, with all the Ceremonie and Pomp that could bee deuised; as things vse to be carried, that are intended for Opinion. It was sent by VRS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WICK: vpon whom the King bestowed this <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage,</hi> to helpe him, after many drie Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>AT this time the King began againe to be haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Sprites,</hi> by the <hi>Magicke</hi> and curious Arts of the <hi>Lady</hi> MARGARET: Who raysed vp the <hi>Ghost</hi> of RICHARD, Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> second Sonne to King EDWARD the Fourth, to walke and vex the King. This was a finer <hi>Counterfeit Stone,</hi> than LAMBERT SYMNELL, better done, and worne vpon greater hands; being graced after, with the wearing of a King of <hi>France,</hi> and a King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not of a <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Burgundie</hi> onely. And for SIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NELL, there was not much in him, more than that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7276:59"/>
hee was a handsome <hi>Boy,</hi> and did not shame his <hi>Robes.</hi> But this <hi>Youth</hi> (of whom wee are now to speake) was such a <hi>Mercuriall,</hi> as the like hath sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beene knowne, and could make his owne Part, if at any time hee chanced to bee out. Wherefore, this being one of the strangest Examples of a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonation,</hi> that euer was in <hi>Elder</hi> or <hi>Later</hi> Times; it deserueth to bee discouered, and related at the full: Although the Kings manner of shewing things, by Peeces and by <hi>Darke Lights,</hi> hath so muffled it, that it hath left it almost as a <hi>Mysterie</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lady</hi> MARGARET (whom the Kings Friends called IVNO, because shee was to him as IVNO was to AENEAS, stirring both <hi>Heauen</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> to doe him mischiefe) for a foundation of her particular Practices against him, did continually, by all meanes possible, nourish, maintaine, and divulge the flying Opinion, That RICHARD, <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke</hi> (second Sonne to EDWARD the Fourth) was not murthered in the <hi>Tower</hi> (as was giuen out) but sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aliue; For that those, who were imployed in that barbarous Fact, hauing destroyed the elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were stricken with remorse and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the younger, and set him priuily at libertie, to seeke his Fortune. This <hi>Lure</hi> shee cast abroad, thinking that this Fame and Beleefe (together with the fresh Example of LAMBERT SIMNELL) would draw at one time, or other, some <hi>Birds</hi> to strike vpon it. Shee vsed likewise a further diligence, not committing all to <hi>Chance.</hi> For, she had some secret <hi>Espials</hi> (like to the <hi>Turks Commissioners</hi> for Children of <hi>Tribute)</hi> to looke abroad for handsome and gracefull Youths, to make PLANTAGENETS, and <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Yorke.</hi> At the last she did light on one, in whom all things met, as one would wish, to serue her turne, for a <hi>Counterfeit</hi> of RICHARD, Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:7276:60"/>
This was PERKIN WARBECK whose Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wee shall now describe. For, first, the yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed well. Secondly, hee was a <hi>Youth</hi> of fine fauour and shape. But, more than that, hee had such a craftie and bewitching fashion, both to mooue <hi>Pitie,</hi> and to induce <hi>Beleefe,</hi> as was like a kind of <hi>Fascination,</hi> and <hi>Inchantment,</hi> to those that saw him, or heard him. Thirdly, he had beene from his Child-hood such a <hi>Wanderer,</hi> or (as the King called him) such a <hi>Land-loper,</hi> as it was extreme hard to hunt out his <hi>Nest</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> Neither againe could any man, by companie or conuersing with him, be able to say or detect well what hee was; he did so flit from place to place Lastly, there was a <hi>Circumstance</hi> (which is mentioned by one that wrote in the same time) that is very likely to haue made somewhat to the matter; which is, That King EDWARD the Fourth was his <hi>God-father.</hi> Which, as it is somewhat suspicious, for a wanton <hi>Prince</hi> to become Gossip in so meane a House; and might make a man thinke, that hee might indeed haue in him some base Bloud of the House of YORKE: so at the least (though that were not) it might giue the occasion to the <hi>Boy,</hi> in being called <hi>King</hi> EDWARDS <hi>God-sonne,</hi> or perhaps in sport, <hi>King</hi> EDWARDS <hi>Sonne,</hi> to entertaine such Thoughts into his Head. For, <hi>Tutor</hi> hee had none (for ought that appeares) as LAMBERT SIMNELL had, vntill hee came vnto the <hi>Lady</hi> MARGARET, who instructed him.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore it came to passe: There was a Townes-man of <hi>Tourney,</hi> that had borne office in that Towne, whose name was IOHN OSBECKE, a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-Iew,</hi> married to CATHERINE DE FARO; whose businesse drew him, to liue for a time with his wife at <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>King</hi> EDWARD the fourths daies. During which time hee had a sonne by her: and being knowne in Court, the King either out of a religious
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7276:60"/>
Noblenesse, because hee was a <hi>Conuert,</hi> or vpon some priuate acquaintance, did him the Honour, as to bee <hi>Godfather</hi> to his child, and named him PETER. But, afterwards, proouing a dainty and effeminate <hi>Youth,</hi> hee was commonly called by the <hi>Diminutiue</hi> of his name; PETER-KIN, or PERKIN. For, as for the name of WARBECKE, it was giuen him when they did but guesse at it, before examinations had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But yet hee had been so much talked on by that name; as it stucke by him after his true name of OS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BECKE was knowne. While hee was a young child his Parents returned with him to <hi>Tourney.</hi> Then was hee placed in a house of a kinsman of his, called IOHN STENBECK, at <hi>Antwerpe:</hi> and so roued vp and down betweene <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Tourney,</hi> and other Townes of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for a good time; liuing much in <hi>English Companie,</hi> and hauing the <hi>English</hi> Tongue perfect. In which time, beeing growne a comely <hi>Youth,</hi> hee was brought by some of the espialls of the Lady MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GARET vnto her Presence. Who viewing him well, and seeing that hee had a Face and personage, that would beare a noble fortune: And finding him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of a fine spirit, and winning behauiour; thought she had now found a curious <hi>Peece</hi> of <hi>Marble,</hi> to carue out an <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Duke of Yorke.</hi> Shee kept him by her a great while; but, with extreme secrecy. The while, shee instructed him, by many <hi>Cabinet-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</hi> First, in <hi>Princely</hi> behauiour and gesture; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him how hee should keepe <hi>State,</hi> and yet with a modest sense of his misfortunes. Then shee informed him of all the circumstances and particulars, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Person of RICHARD Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> which hee was to act: Describing vnto him the <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, Lineaments,</hi> and <hi>Features</hi> of the King and Queen, his pretended Parents; and of his Brother, and Sisters, and diuers others, that were neerest him in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7276:61"/>
together with all passages, some secret, some common, that were fit for a Childs memorie, vntill the death of King EDWARD. Then she added the particulars of the time, from the Kings death, vntill hee and his brother were committed to the Tower, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well during the time hee was abroad, as while he was in <hi>Sanctuarie.</hi> As for the times while hee was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the manner of his Brothers death, and his owne escape; shee knew they were things that a verie few could controll. And therfore she taught him, onely to tell a smooth and likely <hi>Tale</hi> of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; warning him not to vary from it. It was agreed likewise betweene them, what account he should giue of his <hi>Peregrination</hi> abroad; intermixing many things which were true, and such as they knew others could testifie, for the credit of the rest: but, still making them to hang together, with the <hi>Part</hi> hee was to play. Shee taught him likewise how to auoid sundry captious and tempting questions, which were like to bee asked of him. But, in this shee found him of himselfe so nimble and shifting, as shee trusted much to his owne wit and readinesse; and therefore laboured the lesse in it. Lastly, shee raysed his thoughts with some present rewards, and further promises; setting before him chiefly the glorie, and fortune of a Crowne, if things went well; and a sure refuge to her <hi>Court,</hi> if the worst should fall. After such time as shee thought hee was perfect in his <hi>Lesson,</hi> shee began to cast with herselfe from what coast this <hi>Blazing-starre</hi> should first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and at what time it must bee vpon the <hi>Horizon</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for, there had the like <hi>Meteor</hi> strong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before: The time of the <hi>Apparition</hi> to bee, when the King should bee engaged into a Warre with <hi>France.</hi> But well she knew, that whatsoeuer should come from her, would bee held suspected. And therfore, if hee should goe out of <hi>Flanders</hi> immediately into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:7276:61"/>
shee might bee thought to haue some hand in it. And besides, the time was not yet ripe; for that the two Kings were then vpon tearmes of <hi>Peace.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shee wheel'd about; and to put all suspicion a far off, and loth to keepe him any longer by her (for that shee knew <hi>Secrets</hi> are not long liued) shee sent him vnknowne into <hi>Portugall,</hi> with the Lady BRAMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, an <hi>English Ladie,</hi> that embarqued for <hi>Portugall</hi> at that time; with some <hi>Priuado</hi> of her owne, to haue an eye vpon him: and there hee was to remaine, and to expect her further directions In the meane time, shee omitted not to prepare things for his better welcome, and accepting, not onely in the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Hee continued in <hi>Portugall</hi> about a yeare; and, by that time, the King of <hi>England</hi> called his <hi>Parliament</hi> (as hath beene said) and declared open Warre against <hi>France.</hi> Now did the <hi>Signe</hi> reigne, and the <hi>Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was come, vnder which PERKIN should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And therefore hee was straight sent vnto by the <hi>Duchesse,</hi> to goe for <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the first designement. In <hi>Ireland</hi> hee did arriue at the Towne of <hi>Corke.</hi> When hee was thither come, his owne <hi>Tale</hi> was (when hee made his <hi>Confession</hi> afterwards) That the <hi>Irish-men,</hi> finding him in some good Clothes, came flocking about him, and bare him downe, that he was the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarence,</hi> that had beene there before, And after, that hee was RICHARD the Thirds base sonne; And lastly, that he was RICHARD <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> second sonne to EDWARD the Fourth: But that hee (for his part) renounced all these things, and offered to sweare vpon the holy <hi>Euangelists,</hi> that hee was no such man; till, at last, thy forced it vpon him, and bade him feare nothing, and so forth. But the truth is, that immediately vpon his comming into <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee tooke vpon him the said <hi>Person</hi> of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7276:62"/>
               <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and drew vnto him <hi>Complices,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,</hi> by all the meanes hee could deuise: Insomuch, as hee wrote his Letters vnto the <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Desmond</hi> and <hi>Kildare,</hi> to come in to his <hi>Aide,</hi> and bee of his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> the <hi>Originalls</hi> of which Letters are yet extant.</p>
            <p>Somewhat before this time, the <hi>Duchesse</hi> had also gayned vnto her, a neare seruant of King HENRY's owne, one STEPHEN FRION, his <hi>Secretarie</hi> for the <hi>French Tongue;</hi> an actiue man, but turbulent, and discontented. This FRION had fled ouer to CHARLES the <hi>French King,</hi> and put himselfe into his seruice, at such time as hee began to bee in open enmitie with the King. Now King CHARLES, when he vnderstood of the Person and Attempts of PERKIN (readie of himselfe to embrace all aduantages against the King of <hi>England;</hi> instigated by FRION, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prepared by the Ladie MARGARET) forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with dispatched one LVCAS, and this FRION, in the nature of <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to PERKIN; to aduertise him of the Kings good inclination to him, and that hee was resolued to aide him, to recouer his right against King HENRY, an <hi>Vsurper</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of <hi>France;</hi> and wished him, to come ouer vnto him at <hi>Paris.</hi> PERKIN thought himselfe in heauen, now that hee was inuited by so great a King, in so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a manner; And imparting vnto his Friends in <hi>Ireland</hi> for their incouragement, how <hi>Fortune</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and what great hopes hee had, sayled pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently into <hi>France.</hi> When hee was come to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the King receiued him with great honour; saluted, and stiled him by the name of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke;</hi> lodged him, and accommodated him in great <hi>State;</hi> And the better to giue him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation and the countenance of a <hi>Prince,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him a <hi>Guard</hi> for his Person, whereof the Lord CONGRESALL was Captaine. The <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:7276:62"/>
likewise (though it bee ill mocking with the <hi>French)</hi> applyed themselues to their Kings Bent, seeing there was reason of <hi>State</hi> for it. At the same time there repaired vnto PERKIN diuers <hi>Englishmen</hi> of Qualitie; Sir GEORGE NEVILE, Sir IOHN TAYLOR, and about one hundred more: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, this STEPHEN FRION, of whom wee spake; who followed his fortune both then and for a long time after, and was indeed his principall <hi>Counsellor,</hi> and <hi>Instrument</hi> in all his Proceedings. But all this, on the <hi>French Kings</hi> part, was but a Tricke, the better to bow King HENRY to Peace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon the first Graine of <hi>Incense,</hi> that was sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon the <hi>Altar of Peace</hi> at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> PERKIN was smoked away. Yet would not the <hi>French King</hi> deliuer him vp to King HENRY (as hee was labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe) for his Honors sake, but warned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and dismissed him. And PERKIN on his part was as readie to bee gone, doubting hee might bee caught vp vnder hand. Hee therefore tooke his way into <hi>Flanders,</hi> vnto the <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Burgundie;</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that, hauing beene variously tossed by <hi>Fortune,</hi> hee directed his course thither, as to a safe <hi>Harbour:</hi> No wayes taking knowledge, that he had euer beene there before, but as if that had beene his first addresse. The <hi>Duchesse,</hi> on the other part, made it as new and strange to see him: pretending (at the first) that she was taught and made wise by the example of LAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT SIMNELL, how shee did admit of any <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Stuffe;</hi> though euen in that (she said) she was not fully satisfied. Shee pretended at the first (and that was euer in the presence of others) to pose him and sift him, thereby to trie whether hee were indeed the very <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> or no. But, seeming to receiue full satisfaction by his answers, shee then fained her selfe to be transported with a kind of astonishment,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7276:63"/>
mixt of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Wonder,</hi> at his miraculous deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; receiuing him, as if hee were risen from Death to Life: and inferring, that GOD, who had in such wonderfull manner preserued him from Death, did likewise reserue him for some great and prosperous <hi>Fortune.</hi> As for his dismission out of <hi>France,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted it not, as if hee were detected or neglected for a <hi>Counterfeit Deceiuer;</hi> but contrariwise, that it did shew manifestly vnto the World, that hee was some <hi>Great matter;</hi> for that it was his abandoning, that (in effect) made the <hi>Peace:</hi> being no more but the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of a poore distressed <hi>Prince</hi> vnto the vtilitie and Ambition of two Mightie <hi>Monarchs.</hi> Neither was PERKIN for his part wanting to himselfe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in gracious and princely behauiour, or in ready and apposite answers, or in contenting and caressing those that did applie themselues vnto him, or in pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie scorne and disdaine to those that seemed to doubt of him; but in all things did notably acquite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: Insomuch as it was generally beleeued (aswell amongst great Persons, as amongst the <hi>Vulgar)</hi> that he was indeed <hi>Duke</hi> RICHARD. Nay, himselfe, with long and continuall counterfeiting, and with oft tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a <hi>Lye,</hi> was turned by habit almost into the thing heesee med to bee; and from a <hi>Lyer,</hi> to a <hi>Beleeuer.</hi> The <hi>Duchesse</hi> therefore (as in a case out of doubt) did him all princely honour, calling him alwaies by the name of her <hi>Nephew,</hi> and giuing him the <hi>Delicate Title</hi> of the <hi>White-rose</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and appointed him a <hi>Guard</hi> of thirtie Persons, <hi>Halberdiers,</hi> clad in a <hi>Party-coloured Liuerie</hi> of <hi>Murrey</hi> and <hi>Blue,</hi> to attend his Person. Her <hi>Court</hi> likewise, and generally the <hi>Dutch</hi> and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their vsage towards him, expressed no lesse respect.</p>
            <p>The Newes hereof came blazing and thundering ouer into <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke</hi> was sure
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7276:63"/>
aliue. As for the name of PERKIN WARBECK, it was not at that time come to light, but all the newes ranne vpon the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke;</hi> that hee had beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> bought and sold in <hi>France,</hi> and was now plainly auowed, and in great honour in <hi>Flanders.</hi> These <hi>Fames</hi> tooke hold of diuers; In some vpon discontent, in some vpon ambition, in some vpon leuitie and desire of change, and in some few vpon conscience and beleefe, but in most vpon sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie; and in diuers out of dependance vpon some of the better sort, who did in secret fauour and nourish these bruits. And it was not long, ere these rumours of <hi>Noueltie,</hi> had begotten others of <hi>Scandall</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> against the King, and his gouernment; taxing him for a great <hi>Taxer</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancer of his <hi>Nobilitie.</hi> The losse of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and the Peace with <hi>France</hi> were not forgotten. But chiefly they fell vpon the wrong that hee did his <hi>Queene,</hi> in that hee did not reigne in her <hi>Right.</hi> Wherefore they said, that GOD had now brought to light a <hi>Masculine-Branch</hi> of the House of YORKE, that would not bee at his Curtesie, howsoeuer hee did depresse his poore <hi>Ladie.</hi> And yet (as it fareth in things which are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with the <hi>Multitude,</hi> and which they affect) these Fames grew so generall, as the <hi>Authors</hi> were lost in the generalitie of <hi>Speakers.</hi> They being like running <hi>Weedes,</hi> that haue no certaine root; or like <hi>Footings</hi> vp and downe, impossible to be traced. But after a while, these ill <hi>Humours</hi> drew to an head, and setled secretly in some eminent <hi>Persons;</hi> which were Sir WILLIAM STANLEY Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> of the Kings <hi>Houshold,</hi> The Lord FITZ-WATER, Sir SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON MOVNTFORT, Sir THOMAS THWAITES. These entred into a secret Conspiracie to fauour <hi>Duke</hi> RICHARDS Title. Neuerthelesse none engaged their fortunes in this businesse openly, but two; Sir
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7276:64"/>
ROBERT CLIFFORD, and Master WILLIAM BARLEY, who sailed ouer into <hi>Flanders,</hi> sent indeed from the <hi>Partie</hi> of the Conspiratours here, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the truth of those things, that passed there, and not without some helpe of monies from hence; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisionally</hi> to bee deliuered, if they found and were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that there was truth in these pretences. The person of <hi>Sir</hi> ROBERT CLIFFORD (being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Familie)</hi> was extremely welcome to the <hi>Ladie</hi> MARGARET. Who after shee had conference with him, brought him to the sight of PERKIN, with whom hee had often speech and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. So that in the end wonne either by the <hi>Duchesse,</hi> to affect, or by PERKIN to beleeue, hee wrote backe into <hi>England,</hi> that he knew the Person of RICHARD <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> as well as hee knew his owne; and that this <hi>Young-man</hi> was vndoubtedly hee. By this meanes all things grew prepared to Reuolt and Sedition here, and the <hi>Conspiracie</hi> came to haue a <hi>Correspondence</hi> betweene <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King on his part was not asleepe; but to Arme or leuie <hi>Forces</hi> yet, he thought would but shew feare, and doe this <hi>Idoll</hi> too much worship. Neuerthelesse the <hi>Ports</hi> hee did shut vp, or at least kept a <hi>Watch</hi> on them, that none should passe to or fro that was suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But for the rest, hee choose to worke by <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> His purposes were two; the one, to lay open the Abuse. The other, to breake the knot of the <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> To detect the <hi>Abuse,</hi> there were but two wayes; The first, to make it manifest to the world, that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke</hi> was indeed murthered: The other, to prooue, that were he dead or aliue, yet PERKIN was a <hi>Counterfeit.</hi> For the first, thus it stood. There were but foure <hi>Persons</hi> that could speake vpon knowledge, to the murther of the Duke of <hi>Yorke: Sir</hi> IAMES TIRREL (the employed-man from King RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7276:64"/>
IOHN DIGHTON, and MILES FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REST, his seruants (the two Butchers or Tormentors) and the <hi>Priest</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> that buried them. Of which foure, MILES FOREST, and the <hi>Priest</hi> were dead, and there remained aliue onely <hi>Sir</hi> IAMES TIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REL, and IOHN DIGHTON. These two the King caused to bee committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and examined touching the manner of the death of the two inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Princes.</hi> They agreed both in a <hi>Tale,</hi> (as the King gaue out) to this effect: That King RICHARD hauing directed his warrant for the putting of them to death to BRACKENBVRIE the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> was by him refused. Whereupon the King directed his Warrant to <hi>Sir</hi> IAMES TIRREL, to receiue the keyes of the <hi>Tower</hi> from the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> (for the space of a night) for the Kings speciall seruice. That <hi>Sir</hi> IAMES TIRREL accordingly repaired to the <hi>Tower</hi> by night, attended by his two <hi>Seruants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named, whom hee had chosen for that purpose. That himselfe stood at the staire-foot, and sent these two <hi>Villaines</hi> to execute the murther. That they smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them in their bed; &amp; that done, called vp their Master to see their naked dead bodies, which they had laid forth. That they were buried vnder the <hi>Staires,</hi> and some stones cast vpon them. That when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was made to King RICHARD, that his will was done, hee gaue <hi>Sir</hi> IAMES TIRREL great thankes; but tooke exception to the place of their buriall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too base for them that were <hi>Kings</hi> children. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon another night by the Kings warrant renued, their bodies were remoued by the <hi>Priest</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and buried by him in some place, which (by meanes of the <hi>Priests</hi> death soone after) could not be knowne. Thus much was then deliuered abroad, to be the effect of those <hi>Examinations.</hi> But the King neuerthelesse made no vse of them in any of his <hi>Declarations;</hi> whereby (as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7276:65"/>
it seemes) those <hi>Examinations</hi> left the businesse some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perplexed. And a for <hi>Sir</hi> IAMES TIRREL, hee was soone after beheaded in the <hi>Tower-yard,</hi> for other matters of <hi>Treason.</hi> But IOHN DIGHTON (who it seemeth spake best for the King) was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with set at libertie, and was the principall meanes of diuulging this <hi>Tradition.</hi> Therefore this kind of Proofe being left so naked, the King vsed the more diligence in the latter, for the tracing of PERKIN. To this purpose, hee sent abroad into seuerall parts, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially into <hi>Flanders,</hi> diuers secret and nimble <hi>Scouts</hi> and <hi>Spies;</hi> some faining themselues to flie ouer vnto PERKIN, and to adhere vnto him; and some vnder other pretences, to learne, search, and discouer all the circumstances and particulars of PERKINS Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Birth, Person, Trauailes vp and downe; and in briefe, to haue a <hi>Iournall</hi> (as it were) of his life and doings. Hee furnished these his imployed-men liberally with Money, to draw on and reward Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: giuing them also in charge, to aduertise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually what they found, and neuerthelesse still to goe on. And euer as one Aduertisement and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie called vp another, hee employed other new Men, where the Businesse did require it. Others hee employed in a more speciall nature and trust, to be his <hi>Pioners</hi> in the maine <hi>Counter-mine.</hi> These were directed to insinuate themselues into the familiaritie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the principall <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Partie</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and so to learne what <hi>Associates</hi> they had, and <hi>Correspondents,</hi> either heere in <hi>England,</hi> or abroad; and how farre euery one ingaged, and what new ones they meant afterwards to trie, or board. And as this for the <hi>Persons;</hi> so for the <hi>Actions</hi> themselues, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer to the Bottome (as they could) the vtmost of PERKINS and the <hi>Conspiratours</hi> their Intentions, Hopes, and Practices. These latter <hi>Best-be-trust-Spies</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:7276:65"/>
had some of them further instructions, to practise and draw off the best Friends and Seruants of PERKIN, by making remonstrance to them, how weakly his Enterprize and Hopes were built, and with how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and potent a King they had to deale; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to the King, with promise of <hi>Pardon,</hi> and good Conditions of <hi>Reward.</hi> And (aboue the rest) to assayle, sappe, and worke into the constancie of Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD; and to winne him (if they could) being the man that knew most of their secrets, and who being wonne away, would most appall and discourage the rest, and in a manner breake the <hi>Knot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a strange <hi>Tradition;</hi> That the King being lost in a <hi>Wood</hi> of Suspicions, and not knowing whom to trust, had both intelligence with the <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Chaplaines</hi> of diuers great men, and for the better <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> of his <hi>Espialls</hi> abroad with the contrarie side, did vse to haue them cursed at PAVLS (by Name) amongst the <hi>Bead-roll</hi> of the Kings Enemies, according to the Custome of those Times. These <hi>Espials</hi> plyed their Charge so roundly, as the King had an <hi>Anatomie</hi> of PERKIN aliue; and waslikewise well informed of the particular correspondent <hi>Conspiratours</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and many other Mysteries were reuealed; and Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD in especiall wonne to bee assured to the King, and industrious and officious for his seruice. The King therfore (receiuing a rich <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> of his diligence, and great satisfaction touching a number of Particulars) first diuulged and spred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the <hi>Imposture</hi> and iuggling of PERKINS Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Trauailes, with the Circumstances therof, throughout the <hi>Realme.</hi> Not by <hi>Proclamation</hi> (because things were yet in Examination, and so might receiue the more or the lesse) but by <hi>Court-fames,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly print better than printed <hi>Proclamations.</hi> Then thought hee it also time to send an <hi>Ambassage</hi> vnto
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7276:66"/>
Archduke <hi>PHILIP, into</hi> Flanders, <hi>for the abandoning and dismissing of PERKIN. Heerein hee employed</hi> Sir <hi>EDWARD POYNINGS, and</hi> Sir <hi>WILLIAM WARHAM,</hi> Doctor <hi>of the</hi> Canon Law. <hi>The</hi> Archduke <hi>was then young, and gouerned by his Councell: before whom the</hi> Ambassadours <hi>had audience, and</hi> Doctor <hi>WARHAM spake in this manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Lords, the King our <hi>Master</hi> is very sorie, that <hi>England</hi> and your Countrey here of <hi>Flanders</hi> hauing beene counted as Man and Wife for so long time, now this Countrey of all others should be the Stage, where a base Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit should play the part of a King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> not onely to his Graces disquiet and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, but to the scorne and reproach of all Soueraigne Princes. To counterfeit the dead Image of a King in his Coyne, is an high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by all Lawes: But to counterfeit the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Image of a King in his Person, exceedeth all Falsifications, except it should bee that of a <hi>MAHOMET,</hi> or an <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Diuine Honour. The King hath too great an Opinion of this sage Counsell, to thinke that any of you is caught with this Fable (though way may be giuen by you to the passion of some) the thing in it selfe is so improbable. To set Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies aside of the Death of <hi>Duke RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD,</hi> which the King hath vpon Record,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7276:66"/>
plaine and infallible (because they may bee thought to bee in the Kings owne Power) let the thing testifie for it selfe. Sense and Reason no Power can command. Is it possible (trow you) that King <hi>RICHARD</hi> should damne his soule, and foule his Name with so abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a Murther, and yet not mend his Case? Or doe you thinke, that Men of Bloud (that were his Instruments) did turne to Pitty in the middest of their Execution? Whereas in cruell and sauage Beasts, and Men also, the first Draught of Bloud doth yet make them more fierce, and enraged. Doe you not know, that the Bloudie Executioners of Tyrants doe goe to such Errands, with an Halter about their necke: So that if they performe not, they are sure to die for it? And doe you thinke, that these men would hazard their owne liues, for sparing anothers? Admit they should haue saued him: What should they haue done with him? Turne him into <hi>London</hi> Streets, that the Watch-men or any Passenger that should light vpon him, might carry him before a <hi>Iustice,</hi> and so all come to light? Or should they haue kept him by them secretly? That surely would haue required a great deale of Care, Charge, and continuall Feares. But (my Lords) I labour too much in a cleare
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7276:67"/>
Businesse. The King is so wise, and hath so good Friends abroad, as now hee knoweth <hi>Duke PERKIN</hi> from his Cradle. And because hee is a great <hi>Prince,</hi> if you haue any good <hi>Poet</hi> here, hee can helpe him with <hi>Notes</hi> to write his <hi>Life;</hi> and to parallel him with <hi>LAMBERT SIMNELL,</hi> now the Kings <hi>Faulconer.</hi> And therefore (to speake plainely to your Lordships) it is the strangest thing in the World, that the Lady <hi>MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GARET</hi> (excuse vs, if wee name her, whose Malice to the King is both causelesse and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) should now when she is old, at the time when other Women giue ouer Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, bring forth two such Monsters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the Births of nine or tenne Moneths, but of many yeares. And whereas other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Mothers bring forth Children weake, and not able to helpe themselues; she brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth tall <hi>Striplings,</hi> able soone after their comming into the World, to bid Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to mightie Kings. My Lords, wee stay vnwillingly vpon this Part. Wee would to <hi>GOD,</hi> that Lady would once taste the Joyes, which <hi>GOD</hi> Almightie doth serue up vnto her, in beholding her Neece to Reigne in such Honour, and with so much Royall Issue, which shee might bee pleased
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7276:67"/>
to accompt as her owne. The Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest vnto the <hi>Archduke,</hi> and your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,</hi> might bee; That according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready discarded him, you would banish this vnworthy Fellow out of your Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But because the King may iustly expect more from an ancient <hi>Confederate,</hi> than from a new reconciled <hi>Enemie;</hi> hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Request vnto you, to deliuer him vp into his hands. <hi>Pirates</hi> and <hi>Impostures</hi> of this sort, beeing fit to bee accounted the Common <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Mankinde,</hi> and no wayes to bee protected by the Law of <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After some time of Deliberation, the</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours <hi>receiued this short Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat the <hi>Archduke,</hi> for the loue of King <hi>HENRY,</hi> would in no sort aide or assist the pretended <hi>Duke,</hi> but in all things conserue the Amitie hee had with the King. But for the <hi>Duchesse Dowager,</hi> shee was absolute in the Lands of her <hi>Dowrie,</hi> and that hee could not let her to dispose of her owne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:7276:68"/>
THe King, vpon the returne of the <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> was nothing satisfied with this Answer. For well he knew, that a <hi>Patrimoniall Dowrie</hi> carried no part of <hi>Soueraignty,</hi> or Command of <hi>Forces.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> told him plainly, that they saw the <hi>Duchesse</hi> had a great <hi>Party</hi> in the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell; &amp; that howsoeuer it was carried in a course of conniuence, yet the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> vnder hand gaue aid and furtherance to PERKIN. Wherefore (partly out of <hi>Courage,</hi> and partly out of <hi>Policie)</hi> the King forthwith banished all <hi>Flemmings</hi> (as wel their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> as their <hi>Wares)</hi> out of his <hi>Kingdom;</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Subiects likewise (and by name his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants-Aduenturers)</hi> which had a Resiance in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi> to return; translating the <hi>Mart</hi> (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly followed the <hi>English</hi> Cloth) vnto <hi>Calice,</hi> &amp; embarred also all further trade for the future. This the <hi>King</hi> did, being sensible in point of honour, not to suffer a <hi>Pretender</hi> to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> to affront him so neare at hand, and he to keep termes of friendship with the <hi>Countrie</hi> where he did set vp. But he had also a further reach: for that hee knew well, that the Subiects of <hi>Flanders</hi> drew so great commoditie from the trade of <hi>England,</hi> as by this <hi>Embargo</hi> they would soon waxe weary of PERKIN, and that the Tumults of <hi>Flanders</hi> had bin so late &amp; fresh, as it was no time for the <hi>Prince</hi> to displease the <hi>People.</hi> Neuerthelesse for formes sake, by way of requitall, the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> did likewise banish the <hi>English</hi> out of <hi>Flanders;</hi> which in effect was done to his hand.</p>
            <p>The King being well aduertised, that PERKIN did more trust vpon Friends and Partakers within the Realme, than vpon forraine Armes, thought it behooued him to apply the <hi>Remedy,</hi> where the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease</hi> lay; &amp; to proceed with seueritie against some of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7276:68"/>
the principall <hi>Conspirators</hi> here within the Realme; Thereby to purge the ill Humours in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; to coole the Hopes in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Wherefore hee caused to bee apprehended (almost at an instant) IOHN RATCLIFFE Lord <hi>Fitz-water, Sir</hi> SIMON MOVNTFORD, <hi>Sir</hi> THOMAS THWAITES, WILLIAM DAWBIGNEY, ROBERT RAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLIFFE, THOMAS CHRESSENOR, &amp; THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS ASTWOOD. All these were arraigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted and condemned for <hi>High-Treason,</hi> in adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and promising aide to PERKIN. Of these, the <hi>Lord</hi> FITZWATER was conueighed to <hi>Calice,</hi> and there kept in hold, and in hope of life, vntill soone after (eyther impatient, or betrayed) he dealt with his Keeper to haue escaped, &amp; thereupon was beheaded. But <hi>Sir</hi> SIMON MOVNTFORD, RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT RATCLIFFE, and WILLIAM DAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BIGNEY were beheaded immediately after their Condemnation. The rest were pardoned, together with many others <hi>Clerkes</hi> and <hi>Laikes,</hi> amongst which were two <hi>Dominican Friars,</hi> and WILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AM WORSELEY, <hi>Deane</hi> of <hi>Paules:</hi> which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort passed Examination, but came not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like triall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Chamberlaine</hi> at that time was not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; whether it were, that the King would not stir too many humours at once, but (after the maner of good <hi>Physitians)</hi> purge the head last; or that CLIF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD (from whom most of these <hi>Discoueries</hi> came) reserued that Piece for his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ouer: signifying only to the King in the meane time, that he doubted there were some greater ones in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, whereof he would giue the King further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, when he came to his presence.</p>
            <p>Vpon <hi>Al-hallowes-day-euen</hi> being now the tenth yeare of the Kings Reigne, the Kings second Sonne
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7276:69"/>
HENRY was created <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke;</hi> &amp; as well the <hi>Duke,</hi> as diuers others, <hi>Noblemen, Knights-Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of Quality were made knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> according to the <hi>Ceremony.</hi> Vpon the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after <hi>Twelfth-Day,</hi> the King remoued from <hi>Westminster</hi> (where he had kept his <hi>Christmas)</hi> to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> This he did as soon as he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement, that <hi>Sir</hi> ROBERT CLIFFORD (in whose <hi>Bosom</hi> or <hi>Budget</hi> most of PERKINS secrets were layed vp) was come into <hi>England.</hi> And the place of the <hi>Tower</hi> was chosen to that end, that if CLIFFORD should accuse any of the <hi>Great-ones,</hi> they might without suspition, or noise, or sending abroad of Warrants, be presently attached; the <hi>Court</hi> &amp; <hi>Prison</hi> being within the cincture of one Wal. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a day or two, the king drew vnto him a selected <hi>Councel,</hi> &amp; admitted CLIFFORD to his presence; who first fell downe at his feet, and in all humble manner craued the <hi>Kings Pardon,</hi> which the King then granted, though hee were indeed secretly assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his life before. Then commanded to tell his knowledge, he did amongst many others (of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, not interrogated) appeach <hi>Sir</hi> WILLIAM STAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY, the <hi>Lord Chamberlaine</hi> of the Kings Houshold.</p>
            <p>The King seemed to be much amazed at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this <hi>Lord,</hi> as if he had heard the Newes of some strange and fearfull <hi>Prodigie.</hi> To heare a <hi>Man</hi> that had done him seruice of so high a nature, as to saue his life, &amp; set the Crown vpon his head; a <hi>Man,</hi> that enioied by his fauor &amp; aduancement so great a fortune, both in Honour &amp; Riches; a <hi>Man,</hi> that was tied vnto him in so near a <hi>Band</hi> of alliance, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hauing married the Kings Mother; and lastly, a <hi>Man,</hi> to whom he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the trust of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in making him his <hi>Chamberlain.</hi> That this <hi>Man,</hi> no waies disgraced, no waies discontent, no waies
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7276:69"/>
put in feare, should be false vnto him. CLIFFORD was required to say ouer again, &amp; againe, the <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> of his accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; being warned, that in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so vnlikely, &amp; that concerned so great a Seruant of the Kings, he should not in any wise go too far. But the king finding that he did sadly, &amp; constantly (without hesitation or varying, &amp; with those ciuill Protestations that were fit) stand to that that he had said, offering to iustifie it vpon his soule and life; he caused him to be remoued. And after he had not a litle bemoaned himself vnto his Councel there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, gaue order that <hi>Sir</hi> WILLIAM STANLEY should be restrained in his own Chamber, where he lay before, in the <hi>Square Tower.</hi> And the next day he was examined by the Lords. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his <hi>Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he denied little of that wherewith he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor endeauoured much to excuse or extenuate his fault. So that (not very wisely) thinking to make his Offence lesse by <hi>Confession,</hi> hee made it enough for <hi>Condemnation.</hi> It was conceiued, that he trusted much to his former merits, and the interest that his brother had in the king. But those helpes were ouer weighed by diuers things that made against him, &amp; were predominant in the Kings nature and minde. First, an <hi>Ouer-merit;</hi> for conuenient Merit, vnto w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> reward may easily reach, doth best with kings: next the sense of his <hi>Power;</hi> for the King thought, that he that could set him vp, was the more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous to pul him down. Thirdly, the glimmering of a <hi>Confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for he was the richest <hi>subiect</hi> for value in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; There being found in his <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Holt</hi> forty thousand Marks in ready mony, and plate, besides <hi>Iewels, Houshold-stuffe, Stockes</hi> vpon his grounds, &amp; other Personall Estate, exceeding great. And for his Reuenue in <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Fee,</hi> it was three thousand pounds a yeere of old Rent, a great matter in those
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7276:70"/>
times. Lastly, the Nature of the <hi>Time;</hi> for if the King had been out of feare of his own Estate, it was not vnlike he would haue spared his life. But the Cloud of so great a <hi>Rebellion</hi> hanging ouer his head, made him worke sure. Wherefore after some six weekes distance of time, which the King did honorably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose, both to giue space to his Brothers Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, &amp; to shew to the World, that he had a conflict with himself what he should do; he was arraigned of <hi>High-Treason,</hi> and condemned, and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beheaded.</p>
            <p>Yet is it to this day left but in dark memorie both what the Case of this <hi>Noble Person</hi> was, for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he suffred; and what likewise was the ground &amp; cause of his defection, &amp; the alienation of his heart from the King. His <hi>Case</hi> was said to be this: That in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between <hi>Sir</hi> ROBERT CLIFFORD and him, he had said; <hi>That if he were sure, that that young man were King</hi> EDWARDS <hi>Sonne, hee would neuer beare Armes against him.</hi> This <hi>Case</hi> seemes somwhat an hard Case, both in respect of the <hi>Conditionall,</hi> and in respect of the other words. But for the <hi>Conditional,</hi> it seemes the <hi>Iudges</hi> of that time (who were learned men, &amp; the three chief of them of the <hi>Priuy Councel)</hi> thought it was a dangerous thing to admit <hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands,</hi> to qualifie words of <hi>Treason;</hi> wherby euery man might expresse his malice, and blanch his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And it was like to the <hi>Case</hi> (in the following times) of ELIZABETH BARTON, the <hi>Holy-maid</hi> of <hi>Kent:</hi> who had said, <hi>That if king</hi> HENRY <hi>the eighth did not take</hi> KATHERINE <hi>his Wife againe, he should be depriued of his Crown, and dye the death of a Dogge.</hi> And infinite <hi>Cases</hi> may be put of like nature. Which (it seemeth) the graue <hi>Iudges</hi> taking into Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would not admit of <hi>treasons</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>condition.</hi> And as for the <hi>Positiue</hi> words, <hi>That he would not bear arms</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7276:70"/>
               <hi>against King</hi> EDWARDS <hi>Son;</hi> though the words seeme calme, yet it was a plain &amp; direct <hi>Ouer-ruling</hi> of the Kings Title, either by the <hi>Line</hi> of LANCAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, or by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Which (no doubt) pierced the King more, than if STANLEY had charged his <hi>Lance</hi> vpon him in the fielde. For if STANLEY would hold that opinion, that a son of King EDWARD had still the better right, he being so principall a <hi>Person</hi> of authoritie, and fauor about the King; it was to teach all <hi>England,</hi> to say as much. And therfore (as those times were) that speech tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the <hi>Quicke.</hi> But some Writers doe put this out of doubt; for they say, That STANLEY did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly promise to aide PERKIN, &amp; sent him some helpe of Treasure.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Motiue</hi> of his falling off from the King; It is true, that at <hi>Bosworth Field</hi> the King was beset, and in a manner inclosed round about by the Troupes of King RICHARD, &amp; in manifest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life; when this STANLEY was sent by his brother, with three thousand men to his Rescue, which he performed so, that king RICHARD was slaine vpon the Place. So as the condition of Mortal men is not capable of a greater benefit, than the king receiued by the hands of STANLEY; being like the benefit of CHRIST, at once to <hi>Saue,</hi> and <hi>Crowne.</hi> For which seruice the King gaue him great gifts, made him his <hi>Counsellor,</hi> &amp; <hi>Chamberlain;</hi> and (som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his nature) had winked at the great spoiles of <hi>Bosworth Field,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> came almost wholly to this mans hands, to his infinite enriching. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse blown vp with the conceit of his <hi>Merit,</hi> he did not think he had receiued good <hi>Measure</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King, at least not <hi>Pressing-downe,</hi> and running<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, as he expected. And his ambition was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant, and vnbounded, as he became <hi>Sutour</hi> to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7276:71"/>
the King for the <hi>Earledome</hi> of <hi>Chester.</hi> Which euer beeing a kinde of <hi>Appennage</hi> to the <hi>Principalitie</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and vsing to goe to the Kings Sonne; his suit did not only end in a <hi>Deniall,</hi> but in a <hi>Distaste.</hi> The King perceiuing thereby, that his <hi>Desires</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, and his <hi>Cogitations</hi> vaste, and irregular, and that his former <hi>Benefits</hi> were but cheape, and lightly regarded by him. Wherefore the King began not to brook him wel. And as a litle <hi>Leauen</hi> of new Distaste doth commonly sowre the whole <hi>Lumpe</hi> of former Merits, the Kings <hi>Wit</hi> began now to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest vnto his <hi>Passion,</hi> that STANLEY, at <hi>Bosworth Field,</hi> though he came time enough to saue his life, yet hee stayed long enough to endanger it. But yet hauing no matter against him, he continued him in his <hi>Places,</hi> vntill this his <hi>Fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him was made Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> GILES Lord <hi>Dawbeny,</hi> a man of great sufficiencie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the more, because he was gentle and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>There was a common Opinion, That Sir RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERT CLIFFORD (who now was become the <hi>State-Informer)</hi> was from the beginning an <hi>Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> and <hi>Spie</hi> of the Kings; and that hee fled ouer into <hi>Flanders</hi> with his consent and priuitie. But this is not probable; both because hee neuer recouered that Degree of Grace, which he had with the king before his going ouer; and chiefly, for that the <hi>Discouerie</hi> which hee had made touching the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> (which was his great Seruice) grew not from any thing he learn'd abroade, for that hee knew it well before he went.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Executions</hi> (and especially that of the Lord <hi>Chamberlaines,</hi> which was the chiefe strength of the <hi>Partie,</hi> and by meanes of Sir ROBERT CLIFFORD, who was the most inward man of Trust amongst
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7276:71"/>
them) did extremely quaile the Designe of PERKIN, and his complices, as well through Discouragement, as Distrust. So that they were now (like <hi>Sand</hi> without <hi>Lyme)</hi> ill bound together; especially as many as were <hi>English:</hi> who were at a gaze, looking strange one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, not knowing who was faithfull to their <hi>Side;</hi> but thinking, that the King (what with his <hi>Baits,</hi> and what with his <hi>Nets)</hi> would draw them all vnto him, that were anything worth. And indeede it came to passe, that diuers came away by the <hi>Thred,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one, and sometimes another. BARLEY (that was <hi>Ioint-Commissioner</hi> with CLIFFORD) did hold out one of the longest, till PERKIN was farre worne; yet made his Peace at the length. But, the Fall of this <hi>Greatman,</hi> beeing in so high Authoritie and Fauour (as was thought) with the King; and the manner of Carriage of the Businesse, as if there had beene secret Inquisition vpon him, for a great time before; and the Cause for which hee suffered, which was little more, than for saying in effect, <hi>That the Title of</hi> YORKE <hi>was better than the Title of</hi> LANCASTER; which was the Case almost of euery man (at the least in Opinion;) was matter of great Terrour amongst all the Kings Seruants and Subiects: Insomuch, as no man almost thought himselfe secure; and men durst scarce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune or talke one with another: but there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Diffidence euery where. Which neuerthelesse made the King rather more <hi>Absolute,</hi> than more <hi>Safe.</hi> For, <hi>Bleeding Inwards and shut Vapours strangle soonest, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse most.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon presently came forth <hi>Swarmes</hi> and <hi>Volies</hi> of <hi>Libels</hi> (which are the <hi>Gusts</hi> of Libertie of Speech restrayned, and the <hi>Females</hi> of Sedition) contayning bitter <hi>Inuectiues,</hi> and Slanders against the King, and some of the <hi>Councell.</hi> For the contriuing and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing whereof (after great Diligence of Inquirie)
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7276:72"/>
fiue meane Persons were caught, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Meane while, the King did not neglect <hi>Ireland;</hi> being the <hi>Soyle</hi> where the <hi>Mushromes</hi> and <hi>Upstart-Weedes</hi> (that spring vp in a Night) did chiefly prosper. Hee sent therefore from hence (for the better settling of his affaires there) <hi>Commissioners</hi> of both <hi>Robes:</hi> The <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>Lanthony,</hi> to bee his <hi>Chancellour</hi> in that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> and Sir EDWARD POYNINGS, with a Power of Men, and a <hi>Marshall Commission,</hi> together with a Ciuill Power of his <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> with a Clause, That the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Kildare,</hi> then <hi>Deputie,</hi> should obey him. But, the <hi>Wilde-Irish</hi> (who were the principall Offenders) fledde into the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Bogges,</hi> after their manner: and those, that knew themselues guilty, in the <hi>Pale,</hi> fledde to them. So that Sir EDWARD POYNINGS was enforced to make a <hi>Wilde-Chase</hi> vpon the <hi>Wilde-Irish:</hi> Where (in respect of the Mountaines and <hi>Fastnesses)</hi> hee did little good. Which (eyther out of a suspicious Melancholy vpon his bad <hi>Successe,</hi> or the better to saue his seruice from <hi>Disgrace)</hi> hee would needes impute vnto the <hi>Comfort,</hi> that the <hi>Rebels</hi> should receiue vnder-hand from the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Kildare;</hi> euery light suspicion growing vpon the <hi>Earle,</hi> in respect of the KILDARE that was in the Action of LAMBERT SIMNELL, and slaine at <hi>Stoke-field.</hi> Wherefore hee caused the <hi>Earle</hi> to bee apprehended, and sent into <hi>England;</hi> where, vpon Examination, hee cleared himselfe so well, as he was re-placed in his <hi>Gouernment.</hi> But, POYNINGS (the better to make compensation of the Meagernesse of his Seruice in the <hi>Warres,</hi> by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Peace)</hi> called a <hi>Parliament;</hi> where was made that memorable <hi>Act,</hi> which at this day is called POYNINGS <hi>Law,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were made to bee of force in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For, before they were not: neither
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7276:72"/>
are any now in force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were made in <hi>England</hi> since that time; which was the tenth yeare of the King.</p>
            <p>About this time, beganne to be discouered in the King that Disposition, which, afterward nourished and whet-on by bad <hi>Counsellers</hi> and Ministers, proued the <hi>Blot</hi> of his times; which was, the course he tooke, to crush <hi>Treasure</hi> out of his Subiects Purses, by forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vpon <hi>Penall-Lawes.</hi> At this, men did startle the more at this time, because it appeared plainely to bee in the <hi>King's Nature,</hi> and not out of his <hi>Necessitie,</hi> hee beeing now in <hi>Float</hi> for <hi>Treasure;</hi> For that he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued the <hi>Peace-money</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence-money</hi> from his Subiects, and great <hi>Casualties</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Confiscations of the <hi>Lord Chamberlaine,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others. The first-noted <hi>Case</hi> of this kinde, was that of <hi>Sir</hi> WILLIAM CAPEL, Alderman of <hi>London:</hi> Who, vpon sundry <hi>Penall-Lawes,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the summe of seuen and twenty hundred pounds, and compounded with the <hi>King</hi> for sixteene hundred: And yet after, EMPSON would haue cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Chop</hi> out of him, if the <hi>King</hi> had not dyed in the Instant.</p>
            <p>The Summer following, the King, to comfort his <hi>Mother</hi> (whom he did alwaies tenderly loue and reuere) and to make Demonstration to the World, that the proceedings against <hi>Sir</hi> WILLIAM STANLEY (which was imposed vpon him by necessitie of <hi>State)</hi> had not in any degree diminished the affection he bare to THOMAS, his brother; went in <hi>Progresse</hi> to <hi>Latham,</hi> to make merry with his <hi>Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Earle,</hi> and lay there diuers dayes.</p>
            <p>During this <hi>Progresse,</hi> PERKIN WARBECKE finding, that time and Temporizing, which (whilest his practices were couert and wrought well in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> made for him; did now, when they were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7276:73"/>
and defeated, rather make against him (for that when matters once goe downe the <hi>Hill,</hi> they stay not without a new force) resolued to trie his aduenture in some exploit vpon <hi>England;</hi> hoping still vpon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Common-People towards the House of YORKE. Which <hi>Body</hi> of Common-People hee thought was not to bee practised vpon, as Persons of <hi>Qualitie</hi> are; But, that the only practice vpon their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, was, To set vp a <hi>Standard</hi> in the fielde. The Place where hee should make his Attempt, hee chose to be the Coast of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King by this time was growne to sueh an height of <hi>Reputation</hi> for cunning and <hi>Policie,</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Accident and Euent, that went well, was laid and imputed to his foresight, as if hee had set it before: As, in this Particular of PERKINS <hi>Designe</hi> vpon <hi>Kent.</hi> For, the world would not beleeue afterwards, but the King, hauing secret Intelligence of PERKINS inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Kent</hi> (the better to draw it on) went of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose into the <hi>North,</hi> a farre off, laying an open side vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to PERKIN, to make him come to the <hi>Close,</hi> and so to trip vp his heeles, hauing made sure in <hi>Kent</hi> before hand.</p>
            <p>But so it was, that PERKIN had gathered together a Power of all Nations, neither in number, nor in the hardinesse and courage of the Persons, contemptible; but, in their nature and fortunes, to bee feared as well of <hi>Friends</hi> as <hi>Enemies;</hi> being <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> and many of them <hi>Felons,</hi> and such as liued by <hi>Rapine.</hi> These hee put to Sea, and arriued vpon the Coast of <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Deale</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> about <hi>Iuly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There he cast Anchor; and to prooue the affections of the People, sent some of his men to land, making great boast of the Power that was to follow. The <hi>Kentish-men</hi> (perceiuing that PERKIN was not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by any <hi>English</hi> of name or accompt, and that his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7276:73"/>
forces consisted but of strangers borne, and most of them base People, and <hi>Free-booters,</hi> fitter to spoile a <hi>Coast,</hi> than to recouer a <hi>Kingdome)</hi> resorting vnto the principall <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the Countrie, professed their loyaltie to the King, and desired to bee directed and commanded for the best of the Kings seruice. The <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> entring into Consultation, directed some forces in good number, to shew themselues vpon the <hi>Coast;</hi> and some of them to make signes, to entice PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS <hi>Souldiers</hi> to land, as if they would ioyne with them: and some others to appeare from some other Places, and to make semblance as if they fledde from them; the better to encourage them to land. But, PERKIN (who, by playing the <hi>Prince,</hi> or else taught by <hi>Secretarie</hi> FRION, had learned thus much, That People vnder Command, doe vse to consult, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to march in order; and <hi>Rebells</hi> contrariwise runne vpon an <hi>Head</hi> together in confusion) considering the delay of time, and obseruing their orderly, and not tumultuary Arming, doubted the worst. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wily <hi>Youth</hi> would not set one foote out of his Ship, till hee might see things were sure. Wherefore the Kings <hi>Forces,</hi> perceiuing that they could draw on no more than those that were formerly landed, set vpon them, and cut them in pieces, ere they could fly backe to their ships. In which <hi>Skirmish</hi> (besides those that fledde, and were slaine) there were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred and fifty persons. Which, for that the King thought, that to punish a few for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was <hi>Gentlemans-play,</hi> but for <hi>Rascall-Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> they were to bee cut off euery man, especially in the beginning of an Enterprize; and likewise for that hee saw, that PERKINS Forces would now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist chiefly of such <hi>Rabble</hi> and scumme of desperate People; hee therefore hanged them all, for the greater terrour. They were brought to <hi>London,</hi> all rayl'd in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7276:74"/>
Ropes, like a Teame of Horses in a Cart; and were executed some of them at <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Wapping,</hi> and the rest at diuers places vpon the Sea-Coast of <hi>Kent, Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Norfolke,</hi> for <hi>Sea-markes</hi> or <hi>Light-houses,</hi> to teach PERKINS People to auoyd the Coast. The King, being aduertised of the landing of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> thought to leaue his <hi>Progresse:</hi> But, being certified the next day, that they were partly defeated, and partly fled, hee continued his <hi>Progresse,</hi> and sent Sir RICHARD GVILFORD into <hi>Kent</hi> in message. Who, calling the Countrie together, did much commend (from the King) their fidelitie, manhood, and well handling of that seruice; and gaue them all thankes, and (in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate) promised Reward to some particulars.</p>
            <p>Vpon the sixteenth of <hi>Nouember</hi> (this beeing the eleuenth yeare of the King) was holden the <hi>Serieants-Feast,</hi> at <hi>Elie-Place;</hi> there being nine <hi>Serieants</hi> of that <hi>Call.</hi> The King, to honour the Feast, was present with his <hi>Queene</hi> at the Dinner; being a <hi>Prince,</hi> that was euer ready to grace and countenance the Professors of the <hi>Law;</hi> hauing a little of that, <hi>That as he gouerned his</hi> Subiects <hi>by his</hi> Lawes, <hi>so he gouerned his</hi> Lawes <hi>by his</hi> Lawyers.</p>
            <p>This yeare also the King entred into League with the <hi>Italian Potentates,</hi> for the defence of <hi>Italie,</hi> against <hi>France.</hi> For, King CHARLES had conquered the <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and lost it againe, in a kinde of <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie</hi> of a Dreame. Hee passed the whole length of <hi>Italie</hi> without resistance: so that it was true which <hi>Pope</hi> ALEXANDER was wont to say; <hi>That the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came into Italie, with Chalke in their hands, to marke up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.</hi> Hee likewise entred and wonne, in effect, the whole Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> it selfe, without striking stroke. But, presently thereupon, he did commit and multiply so many Errours, as was too great a taske for the best
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7276:74"/>
fortune to ouercome. Hee gaue no contentment to the <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> of the <hi>Angeouines;</hi> but, scattered his rewards according to the mercenarie appetites of some about him. He put all <hi>Italie</hi> vpon their <hi>Guard,</hi> by the seizing and holding of <hi>Ostia,</hi> and the protecting of the Libertie of <hi>Pisa:</hi> which made all men suspect that his purposes looked further, than his title of <hi>Naples.</hi> He fell too soone at difference with LVDOVICO SFORTIA; who was the Man that carried the <hi>Keyes</hi> which brought him in, and shut him out. Hee neglected to extinguish some reliques of the Warre. And lastly, in regard of his easie passage through <hi>Italie</hi> without resistance, hee entred into an ouermuch despising of the Armes of the <hi>Italians:</hi> Whereby he left the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> at his departure, so much the lesse prouided. So that not long after his returne, the whole Kingdome reuolted to FERDINANDO the younger, and the <hi>French</hi> were quite driuen out. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, CHARLES did make both great threats, and great preparations, to re-enter <hi>Italie</hi> once againe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the instance of diuers of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Italie</hi> (and especially of <hi>Pope</hi> ALEXANDER) there was a League concluded, betweene the said <hi>Pope,</hi> MAXIMILIAN King of <hi>Romanes,</hi> HENRY King of <hi>England,</hi> FERDINANDO and ISABELLA, King and Queen of <hi>Spaine</hi> (for so they are constantly placed in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Treaty</hi> throughout,) AVGVSTISSIMO BARBADICO, <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and LVDOVICO SFORTIA, <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Millan,</hi> for the common defence of their estates. Wherein though FERDINANDO of <hi>Naples</hi> was not named as principall; yet, no doubt, the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> was tacitly included, as a <hi>Fee</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>There dyed also this yeare CECILE, <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> mother to King EDWARD the Fourth, at her Castle of <hi>Barkhamsted,</hi> beeing of extreame yeares;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7276:75"/>
and who had liued to see three <hi>Princes</hi> of her bodie crowned, and foure murthered. Shee was buried at <hi>Foderingham,</hi> by her husband.</p>
            <p>This yeare also the King called his <hi>Parliament:</hi> where many Lawes were made, of a more priuate and vulgar nature, than ought to detaine the <hi>Reader</hi> of an <hi>Historie.</hi> And it may bee iustly suspected, by the proceedings following, that as the King did excell in good Common-wealth <hi>Lawes;</hi> so neuerthelesse hee had, in secret, a designe to make vse of them, as well for collecting of <hi>Treasure,</hi> as for correcting of <hi>Manners;</hi> and so, meaning thereby to harrow his People, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate them the rather.</p>
            <p>The principall <hi>Law,</hi> that was made this <hi>Parliament,</hi> was a Law of a strange nature: rather <hi>Iust,</hi> than <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall;</hi> and more magnanimous than prouident. This <hi>Law</hi> did ordaine, That no person, that did assist in Armes, or otherwise, the King for the time beeing, should after bee impeached therefore, or attainted, either by the course of the Law, or by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But, if any such Act of <hi>Attainder</hi> did happen to bee made, it should bee voyde, and of none effect; For that it was agreeable to reason of <hi>Estate,</hi> that the <hi>Subiect</hi> should not enquire of the iustnesse of the Kings Title, or <hi>Quarrell;</hi> and it was agreeable to good <hi>Conscience,</hi> that (whatsoeuer the fortune of the Warre were) the <hi>Subiect</hi> should not suffer for his Obedience. The spirit of this <hi>Law</hi> was wonderfull Pious and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: beeing like in matter of <hi>Warre,</hi> vnto the spirit of DAVID in matter of <hi>Plague,</hi> who said, <hi>If I haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, strike mee; but what haue these sheepe done?</hi> Neither wanted this <hi>Law</hi> parts of prudent and deepe fore-sight. For, it did the better take away occasion, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to busie themselues, to prie into the Kings Title; for that howsoeuer it fell, their safety was alreadie prouided for. Besides, it could not but greatly draw
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7276:75"/>
vnto him, the loue and hearts of the people, because hee seemed more carefull for them, than for himselfe. But yet neuerthelesse, it did take off from his <hi>Partie,</hi> that great <hi>Tie</hi> and <hi>Spurre</hi> of necessity, to fight and goe <hi>Victors</hi> out of the fielde; considering their liues and fortunes were put in safety, and protected, whether they stood to it or ranne away. But the force and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of this <hi>Law</hi> was in it selfe <hi>Illusorie,</hi> as to the latter part of it; by a <hi>precedent Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to binde or frustrate a <hi>future.</hi> For a supreme and absolute <hi>Power</hi> cannot conclude it selfe, neither can that which is in nature reuocable bee made fixed; no more than if a man should appoint or declare by his Will, that if hee made any Latter will, it should bee voyde. And for the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> there is a notable President of it in King HENRIE the Eight's time. Who doubting hee might dye in the minoritie of his Sonne, procured an <hi>Act</hi> to passe, <hi>That no Statute made during the minoritie of the King, should binde him or his Successours, except it were confirmed by the King vnder his great Seale, at his full age.</hi> But the first <hi>Act</hi> that passed in King EDWARD the Sixth his time, was an <hi>Act</hi> of Repeale of that former <hi>Act;</hi> at which time neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the King was <hi>Minor.</hi> But things that doe not binde, may satisfie for the time.</p>
            <p>There was also made a shoaring or vnderpropping <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Beneuolence;</hi> to make the summes which any person had agreed to pay, and neuerthelesse were not brought in, to bee leuiable by course of Law. Which <hi>Act</hi> did not only bring in the <hi>Areres,</hi> but did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed countenance the whole businesse, and was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bee made at the desire of those, that had beene forward to pay.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Parliament</hi> also was made that good <hi>Law,</hi> which gaue the <hi>Attaint</hi> vpon a <hi>false Uerdict</hi> betweene <hi>Partie</hi> and <hi>Partie,</hi> which before was a kinde of <hi>Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:7276:76"/>
irremediable. It extends not to causes <hi>Capitall,</hi> as well because they are for the most part at the Kings Suite; as because in them (if they bee followed in Course of <hi>Indictment)</hi> there passeth a double <hi>Iurie,</hi> the <hi>Indictors,</hi> and the <hi>Triers;</hi> and so not Twelue Men, but Foure and twentie. But it seemeth that was not the onely reason; for this reason holdeth not in the <hi>Appeale.</hi> But the great reason was, lest it should tend to the discouragement of <hi>Iurors</hi> in Cases of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> if they should bee subiect to Suite and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie, where the fauour of <hi>Life</hi> maketh against them. It extendeth not also to any Suite, where the <hi>Demand</hi> is vnder the value of fortie pounds; for that in such Cases of pettie value, it would not quite the Charge, to goe about againe.</p>
            <p>There was another <hi>Law</hi> made against a branch of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> in Women, who hauing beene aduanced by their <hi>Husbands,</hi> or their Husbands <hi>Ancestors,</hi> should alien, and thereby seeke to defeate the <hi>Heires,</hi> or those in <hi>Remainder,</hi> of the Lands, whereunto they had bin so aduanced. The remedie was, by giuing power to the next, to enter for a forfeiture.</p>
            <p>There was also enacted that Charitable <hi>Law,</hi> for the admission of poore Suiters <hi>In Forma Pauperis,</hi> without Fee to <hi>Counsellor, Atturney,</hi> or <hi>Clerke,</hi> whereby poore men became rather able to <hi>vexe,</hi> than vnable to <hi>sue.</hi> There were diuers other good <hi>Lawes</hi> made that <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as we said before: but we still obserue our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in selecting out those, that are not of a <hi>Vulgar</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The King this while, though hee sate in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as in full Peace, and seemed to account of the designes of PERKIN (who was now returned into <hi>Flanders)</hi> but as a <hi>May game;</hi> yet hauing the composition of a wise King <hi>(Stout</hi> without, and <hi>apprehensiue</hi> within) had giuen order for the watching of <hi>Beacons</hi> vpon the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7276:76"/>
Coasts, and erecting more where they stood too thin, and had a carefull eye where this wandering <hi>Cloude</hi> would breake. But PERKIN aduised to keepe his fire (which hitherto burned as it were vpon greene Wood) aliue, with continuall blowing; Sailed againe into <hi>Ireland,</hi> whence he had formerly departed, rather vpon the hopes of <hi>France,</hi> than vpon any vnreadinesse or discouragement hee found in that People. But in the space of time betweene the Kings <hi>Diligence</hi> and POYNINGS <hi>Commission,</hi> had so settled things there, as there was nothing left for PERKIN, but the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string affection of wilde and naked people. Wherefore hee was aduised by his <hi>Councell,</hi> to seeke aide of the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> yong, and valourous, and in good termes with his <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to King HENRY. At this time also both MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN and CHARLES of <hi>France</hi> began to beare no good will to the King. The one beeing displeased with the Kings <hi>Prohibition</hi> of Commerce with <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> The Other holding the King for suspect, in regard of his late entrie into league with the <hi>Italians.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore besides the open <hi>Aides</hi> of the <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which did with <hi>Sayles</hi> and <hi>Oares</hi> put on and aduance PERKINS designes, there wanted not some secret <hi>Tides</hi> from MAXIMILIAN and CHARLES, which did further his fortunes. In so much as they, both by their secret Letters, and Messages, recommended him to the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PERKIN therefore comming into <hi>Scotland</hi> vpon those hopes, with a well appointed company, was by the King of <hi>Scots</hi> (beeing formerly well prepared) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably welcommed, and soone after his arriuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Presence, in a solemne manner. For the King receiued him in <hi>State</hi> in his Chamber of <hi>Presence,</hi> accompanied with diuers of his <hi>Nobles.</hi> And PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIN well attended, as well with those that the King
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7276:77"/>
had sent before him, as with his owne <hi>Traine,</hi> entered the roome where the King was, and comming neare to the King, and bowing a little to embrace him, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired some paces backe, and with a loud voyce (that all that were present might heare him) made his <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               </hi>ration in this manner.</p>
            <p>HIgh and Mighty King, your Grace, and these your Nobles here present, may be pleased benignely to bow your Eares, to heare the <hi>Tragedie</hi> of a young Man, that by Right ought to hold in his hand the <hi>Ball</hi> of a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> but by Fortune is made Himselfe a <hi>Ball,</hi> tossed from Miserie to Miserie, and from Place to Place. You see here before you the Spectacle of a <hi>PLANTAGENET,</hi> who hath beene carried from the <hi>Nurserie</hi> to the <hi>Sanctuarie;</hi> from the <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Prison;</hi> from the <hi>Prison,</hi> to the Hand of the cruell <hi>Tormentor;</hi> and from that Hand, to the wide <hi>Wildernesse</hi> (as I may truely call it) for so the World hath beene to mee. So that hee that is borne to a great <hi>Kingdome,</hi> hath not Ground to set his foote vpon, more than this where hee now standeth, by your Princely Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Fourth, late King of <hi>England,</hi> (as your Grace cannot but haue heard) left two Sonnes; <hi>EDWARD,</hi> and <hi>RICHARD, Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> both very
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7276:77"/>
young. <hi>EDWARD,</hi> the eldest succeeded their <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Crowne,</hi> by the name of <hi>King EDWARD</hi> the Fift. But <hi>RICHARD, Duke</hi> of <hi>Glocester,</hi> their vnnaturall Vnckle, first thirsting after the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> through <hi>Ambition,</hi> and afterwards thirsting for their <hi>Bloud,</hi> out of desire to secure himselfe; imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Instrument</hi> of his (confident to him, as hee thought) to murther them both. But this Man that was imployed, to execute that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable <hi>Tragedie,</hi> hauing cruelly slaine King <hi>EDWARD,</hi> the eldest of the two, was mooued partly hy Remorse, and partly by some other meane, to saue <hi>RICHARD</hi> his Brother; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Report</hi> neuerthelesse to the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> that hee had performed his <hi>Commandement</hi> for both Brethren. This <hi>Report</hi> was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly beleeued, and published generally. So that the World hath beene possessed of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they both were barbarously made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, though euer <hi>Truth</hi> hath some sparkes that flye abroade, vntill it appeare in due time, as this hath had. But Almighty <hi>GOD,</hi> that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Mouth of the <hi>Lion,</hi> and saued little <hi>JOAS</hi> from the <hi>Tyrannie</hi> of <hi>ATHALIAH,</hi> when shee massacred the Kings Children; and did saue <hi>ISAACK,</hi> when the hand was stretched forth to sacrifice him; preserued the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7276:78"/>
second Brother. For I my selfe, that stand heere in your presence, am that very <hi>RI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARD, Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Brother of that infortunate Prince, King <hi>EDWARD</hi> the Fift, now the most rightfull suruiuing Heire-Male to that Uictorious and most Noble <hi>EDWARD,</hi> of that Name the Fourth, late King of <hi>England.</hi> For the manner of my <hi>Escape,</hi> it is fit it should passe in silence, or (at least) in a more secret <hi>Relation:</hi> for that it may concerne some aliue, and the memorie of some that are dead. Let it suffice to thinke, I had then a <hi>Mother</hi> liuing, a <hi>Queene,</hi> and one that expected dayly such a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> from the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of her <hi>Children.</hi> Thus in my tender age escaping by <hi>GODS</hi> Mercie out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I was secretly conueyed ouer Sea. Where, after a time, the <hi>Partie</hi> that had mee in Charge, (vpon what new <hi>Feares,</hi> change of <hi>Minde,</hi> or <hi>Practice, GOD</hi> knoweth) suddenly forsooke mee. Whereby I was forced to wander abroade, and to seeke meane <hi>Conditions</hi> for the sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my <hi>Life.</hi> Wherefore distracted betweene seuerall <hi>Passions,</hi> the one of <hi>Feare</hi> to bee knowne, lest the <hi>Tyrant</hi> should haue a new <hi>Attempt</hi> vpon mee, the other of <hi>Griefe</hi> and <hi>Disdaine</hi> to bee vnknowne, and to liue in that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7276:78"/>
base and seruile manner that I did; I resolued with my selfe, to expect the <hi>Tyrants</hi> Death, and then to put my selfe into my <hi>Sisters</hi> hands, who was next <hi>Heire</hi> to the <hi>Crowne.</hi> But in this Season, it happened one <hi>HENRIE TIDDER,</hi> sonne to <hi>EDMOND TIDDER Earle</hi> of <hi>Richmond,</hi> to come from <hi>France,</hi> and enter into the <hi>Realme,</hi> and by subtile and foule meanes to obtaine the <hi>Crowne</hi> of the same, which to mee rightfully appertained. So that it was but a <hi>Change,</hi> from <hi>Tyrant</hi> to <hi>Tyrant.</hi> This <hi>HENRIE,</hi> my extreame and mortall <hi>Enemie,</hi> so soone as hee had knowledge of my beeing aliue, imagined and wrought all the subtill waies and meanes hee could, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my finall Destruction. For my mortall <hi>Enemie</hi> hath not onely falsly surmised, mee to bee a fayned <hi>Person,</hi> giuing mee <hi>Nick-names,</hi> so abusing the World; but also, to deferre and put mee from entrie into <hi>England,</hi> hath offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red large Summes of <hi>Money,</hi> to corrupt the <hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Ministers,</hi> with whom I haue beene retayned; and made importune <hi>Labours</hi> to certaine <hi>Seruants</hi> about my <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> to murther or poyson mee, and others to forsake and leaue my Righteous <hi>Quarrell,</hi> and to depart from my <hi>Seruice,</hi> as Sir <hi>ROBERT CLIFFORD,</hi> and others. So that euery
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7276:79"/>
Man of <hi>Reason</hi> may well perceiue, that <hi>HENRIE,</hi> calling himselfe King of <hi>England,</hi> needed not to haue bestowed such great Summes of <hi>Treasure,</hi> nor so to haue busied himselfe with importune and incessant <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Industrie,</hi> to compasse my <hi>Death and Ruine,</hi> if I had beene such a fained <hi>Person.</hi> But the truth of my Cause beeing so manifest, moued the most <hi>Christian King CHARLES,</hi> and the Lady Duchesse <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> my most Deare <hi>Aunt,</hi> not onely to acknowledge the truth thereof, but louingly to assist mee. But it seemeth that <hi>GOD</hi> aboue (for the good of this whole <hi>Island,</hi> and the knitting of these two <hi>Kingdomes</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in a strait <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Amitie,</hi> by so great an Obligation) had reserued the placing of mee in the <hi>Imperiall Throne</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for the <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Succours</hi> of your <hi>Grace.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it the first time that a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath supported them, that were bereft and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> as of late (in fresh memorie) it was done in the Person of <hi>HENRY</hi> the Sixth. Wherefore for that your <hi>Grace</hi> hath giuen cleare Signes, that you are in no <hi>Noble</hi> qualitie inferiour to your <hi>Royall Ancestours;</hi> I, so distressed a <hi>Prince,</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mooued to come and put my Selfe into your

            <p>AFter PERKIN had told his Tale, King IAMES answered brauely and wisely; <hi>That whatsoeuer hee were, hee should not repent him, of putting himselfe into his hands.</hi> And from that time forth, though there wanted not some about him, that would haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him, that all was but an <hi>Illusion;</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, either taken by PERKINS amiable and alluring behauiour, or inclining to the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great <hi>Princes</hi> abroade, or willing to take an occasion of a Warre against King HENRY, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him in all things, as became the person of RICHARD <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke;</hi> embraced his Quarrell; and (the more to put it out of doubt, that hee tooke him to bee a great <hi>Prince,</hi> and not a <hi>Representation</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) hee gaue consent, that this <hi>Duke</hi> should take to wife the <hi>Lady</hi> KATHERINE GORDON, daughter to the <hi>Earle Huntley,</hi> beeing a neare Kinswoman to the King himselfe, and a young <hi>Uirgin</hi> of excellent beautie and vertue.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the King of <hi>Scots</hi> in person, with PERKIN in his company, entred with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie (though it consisted chiefly of <hi>Borderers,</hi> beeing raysed somewhat suddenly) into <hi>Northumberland.</hi> And PERKIN, for a <hi>Perfume</hi> before him as hee went,

that hee should bee too good a <hi>Steward</hi> for his Enemie, to saue the Countrie to his vse.</p>
            <p>By this time, beeing the Eleuenth yeare of the King, the Interruption of Trade betweene the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and the <hi>Flemmish,</hi> beganne to pinch the <hi>Merchants</hi> of both Nations very sore. Which mooued them, by all meanes they could deuise, to affect and dispose their <hi>Soueraignes</hi> respectiuely, to open the <hi>Entercourse</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Wherein, time fauoured them. For the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> and his <hi>Councell</hi> beganne to see, that PERKIN would prooue but a <hi>Runnagate,</hi> and <hi>Citizen of the World;</hi> and that it was the part of children to fall out about <hi>Babies.</hi> And the King on his part, after the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts vpon <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> beganne to haue the businesse of PERKIN in lesse estimation; so as hee did not put it to accompt, in any Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>State.</hi> But that that mooued him most, was, that beeing a King that loued Wealth and Treasure, hee could not endure to haue <hi>Trade</hi> sicke, nor any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to continue in the <hi>Gate-veine,</hi> which disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that bloud. And yet he kept State so farre, as first to bee sought vnto. Wherein the <hi>Merchant-Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> likewise, (beeing a strong Companie at that time, and well vnderset with rich Men, and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) did hold out brauely; taking off the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> though they lay dead vpon their hands for want of <hi>Vent.</hi> At the last, <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> met at <hi>London,</hi> to Treate. On the Kings part; Bishop FOXE Lord <hi>Priuy Seale, Viscount Wells,</hi> KENDAL Prior of Saint IOHNS, WARHAM Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the <hi>Rolles,</hi> who beganne to gaine much vpon the Kings opinion; VRSWICK, who was almost euer one; and RISELY. On the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> part, the Lord BEVERS his <hi>Admirall,</hi> the Lord VERVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEL <hi>President</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and others. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a perfect Treatie, both of <hi>Amitie</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:7276:84"/>
betweene the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Duke;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning Articles both of <hi>State, Commerce,</hi> and <hi>Free-Fishing.</hi> This is that <hi>Treatie,</hi> which the <hi>Flemmings</hi> call at this day, <hi>Intercursus Magnus;</hi> both because it is more compleat, than the precedent Treaties, of the Third and Fourth yeares of the King: and chiefly to giue it a difference, from the <hi>Treatie</hi> that followed in the One and twentieth yeare of the King: which they call <hi>Intercursus Malus.</hi> In this <hi>Treatie,</hi> there was an expresse Article against the <hi>Reception</hi> of the <hi>Rebels</hi> of either <hi>Prince</hi> by other; purporting, that if any such <hi>Rebell</hi> should bee required by the <hi>Prince</hi> whose <hi>Rebell</hi> hee was, of the <hi>Prince Confederate,</hi> that forthwith the <hi>Prince Confederate</hi> should by <hi>Proclamation</hi> command him to auoyde the Countrey. Which if hee did not within fifteene daies, the <hi>Rebell</hi> was to stand proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and put out of <hi>Protection.</hi> But neuerthelesse in this Article, PERKIN was not named, neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps contained, because hee was no <hi>Rebell.</hi> But by this meanes his wings were clipt of his Followers, that were <hi>English.</hi> And it was expresly comprised in the <hi>Treatie,</hi> that it should extend to the <hi>Territories</hi> of the <hi>Duchesse Dowager.</hi> After the <hi>Intercourse</hi> thus restored, The <hi>English Merchants</hi> came againe to their <hi>Mansion</hi> at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> where they were receiued with <hi>Procession</hi> and great Ioy.</p>
            <p>The Winter following, beeing the Twelfth yeare of his reigne, The King called againe his <hi>Parliament:</hi> where hee did much exaggerate both the <hi>Malice,</hi> and the cruell <hi>Predatory Warre</hi> lately made by the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> That that King, being in Amitie with him, and no wayes prouoked, should so burne in hatred towards him, as to drinke of the <hi>Lees</hi> and <hi>Dreggs</hi> of PERKINS <hi>Intoxication,</hi> who was euery where else detected and discarded: And that when hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it was out of his reach, to doe the King any hurt,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7276:84"/>
hee had turned his Armes vpon vnarmed and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided <hi>People,</hi> to spoyle onely and depopulate, contrary to the <hi>Lawes</hi> both of <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> Concluding, that hee could neither with Honour, nor with the safety of his People, to whom he did owe Protection, let passe these wrongs vnreuenged. The <hi>Parliament</hi> vnderstood him well, and gaue him a <hi>Subsidie,</hi> limited to the summe of one hundred and twentie thousand Pounds, besides two <hi>Fifteenes.</hi> For his <hi>Warres</hi> were alwaies to him as a <hi>Mine</hi> of <hi>Treasure,</hi> of a strange kind of <hi>Ore; Iron</hi> at the top, and <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Siluer</hi> at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. At this <hi>Parliament</hi> (for that there had beene so much time spent in making <hi>Lawes</hi> the yeare before, and for that it was called purposely in respect of the <hi>Scottish Warre)</hi> there were no <hi>Lawes</hi> made to bee remembred. Onely there passed a <hi>Law,</hi> at the Sute of the <hi>Merchant-Aduenturers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> against the <hi>Merchant-Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> for <hi>Monopolizing</hi> and exacting vpon the Trade: Which it seemeth they did, a little to saue themselues, after the hard time they had sustained by want of Trade. But those <hi>Innouations</hi> were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was fatall to the King, to fight for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And though hee auoyded to fight with <hi>Enemies</hi> abroad, yet hee was still enforced to fight for it with <hi>Rebels</hi> at home. For no sooner beganne the <hi>Subsidie</hi> to bee leuied in <hi>Corne-wall,</hi> but the People there began to grudge and murmure. The <hi>Cornish</hi> being a Race of Men, stout of stomacke, mighty of Bodie and Limme, and that liued hardly in a barren Countrey, and many of them could (for a neede) liue vnder ground, that were <hi>Tinners;</hi> they muttered extreamely, that it was a thing not to be suffered, that for a little stirre of the <hi>Scots,</hi> soone blowne ouer, they should be thus grinded to Powder with <hi>Payments:</hi> And said, it was for them to pay, that had too much, and liued idly. But
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7276:85"/>
they would eate the bread they got with the sweat of their browes, and no man should take it from them. And as in the <hi>Tides</hi> of <hi>People</hi> once vp, there want not commonly stirring <hi>Windes</hi> to make them more rough: So this <hi>People</hi> did light vpon two <hi>Ring-leaders,</hi> or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the <hi>Rout.</hi> The one was one MICHAEL IOSEPH, a <hi>Black-smith</hi> or <hi>Farrier</hi> of <hi>Bodmin;</hi> anota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble talking Fellow, and no lesse desirous to bee talked of. The other was THOMAS FLAMMOCKE, a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer;</hi> who by telling his neighbours commonly vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion, that the <hi>Law</hi> was on their side, had gotten great sway amongst them. This Man talked learnedly, and as if he could tell how to make a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer breake the <hi>Peace.</hi> Hee told the <hi>People,</hi> that <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> were not to be granted nor leuied in this case; that is, for <hi>Warres</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> (for that the <hi>Law</hi> had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another course, by seruice of <hi>Escuage,</hi> for those Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes) much lesse when all was quiet, and Warre was made but a <hi>Pretence</hi> to poll and pill the <hi>People:</hi> And therefore that it was good, they should not stand now like Sheepe before the Shearers, but put on Harnesse, and take Weapons in their hands: Yet to doe no creature hurt; but goe and deliuer the King a <hi>Strong Petition,</hi> for the laying downe of those grieuous <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and for the punishment of those that had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him that Counsell; to make others beware how they did the like in time to come: And said, for his part hee did not see how they could doe the duetie of true <hi>English-men,</hi> and good <hi>Liege-men,</hi> except they did deliuer the King from such wicked Ones that would destroy both Him and the Countrey. Their ayme was at <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> MORTON, and Sir REGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOLD BRAY, who were the Kings <hi>Skreens</hi> in this Enuy.</p>
            <p>After that these two, FLAMMOCKE and the <hi>Blacke-smith,</hi> had, by ioynt and seuerall <hi>Pratings,</hi> found
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7276:85"/>
tokens of consent in the <hi>Multitude,</hi> they offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to leade them, vntill they should heare of better men to be their <hi>Leaders;</hi> which they said would be ere long: Telling them further, that they would be but their seruants, and first in euery danger; but doubted not but to make both the <hi>West-end</hi> and the <hi>East-end</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to meete in so good a <hi>Quarrell;</hi> and that all (rightly vnderstood) was but for the Kings seruice. The <hi>People,</hi> vpon these seditious <hi>Instigations,</hi> did arme (most of them with <hi>Bowes,</hi> and <hi>Arrowes,</hi> and <hi>Bills,</hi> and such other Weapons of rude and Countrey Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) and forthwith vnder the <hi>Command</hi> of their <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (which in such cases is euer at pleasure) marched out of <hi>Corne-wall,</hi> through <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> vnto <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> without any slaughter, violence, or spoyle of the Countrey. At <hi>Taunton</hi> they killed, in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, an officious and eager <hi>Commissioner</hi> for the <hi>Subsidie,</hi> whom they called The <hi>Prouost</hi> of <hi>Perin.</hi> Thence they marched to <hi>Wells:</hi> where the Lord AVDLEY (with whom their <hi>Leaders</hi> had, before, some secret <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence)</hi> a Noble-man of an ancient <hi>Family,</hi> but vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and popular, and aspiring to Ruine, came-in to them, and was by them (with great Gladnesse and cries of Ioy) accepted as their <hi>Generall;</hi> they beeing now proud, that they were ledde by a <hi>Noble-man.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> AVDLEY ledde them on from <hi>Wells</hi> to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to <hi>Winchester.</hi> Thence the foolish people, who (in effect) led their <hi>Leaders,</hi> had a minde to beeled into <hi>Kent;</hi> fansying, that the People there would ioyne with them, contrary to all reason or iudgement; considering, the <hi>Kentish-men</hi> had shewed great <hi>Loyaltie</hi> and Affection to the King so lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But the rude People had heard FDAMMOCKE say, that Kent <hi>was neuer</hi> Conquered, and <hi>that they were the freest People of</hi> England. And, vpon these vaine Noises, they looked for great matters at their hands,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7276:86"/>
in a cause which they conceited to be for the libertie of the <hi>Subiect.</hi> But when they were come into <hi>Kent,</hi> the Countrey was so well settled, both by the Kings late kind vsage towards them, and by the credit and power of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> ABERGAVENNIE, and the <hi>Lord</hi> COBHAM, as neither <hi>Gentleman</hi> nor <hi>Yeoman</hi> came-in to their aide; which did much dampe and dismay many of the simpler sort: Insomuch, as diuers of them did secretly flie from the <hi>Army,</hi> and went home. But the sturdier sort, and those that were most engaged, stood by it, and rather waxed <hi>Proud,</hi> than failed in <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Courage.</hi> For as it did somewhat appall them, that the people came not in to them; so it did no lesse encourage them, that the Kings <hi>Forces</hi> had not set vpon them, hauing marched from the <hi>West</hi> vnto the <hi>East</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore they kept on their way, and encamped vpon <hi>Blacke-heath,</hi> betweene <hi>Greenwich</hi> and <hi>Eltham;</hi> threatning either to bid <hi>Battell</hi> to the King (for now the Seas went higher than to MORTON, and BRAIE) or to take <hi>London</hi> within his view; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining with themselues, there to finde no lesse <hi>Feare,</hi> than <hi>Wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to returne to the King. When first hee heard of this <hi>Commotion</hi> of the <hi>Cornish-men,</hi> occasioned by the <hi>Subsidie;</hi> he was much troubled therewith: Not for it selfe, but in regard of the Concurrence of other <hi>Dangers,</hi> that did hang ouer him at that time. For hee doubted lest a <hi>Warre</hi> from <hi>Scotland, a Rebellion</hi> from <hi>Corne-wall,</hi> and the Practices and <hi>Conspiracies</hi> of PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIN and his <hi>Partakers,</hi> would come vpon him at once; Knowing well, that it was a dangerous <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie</hi> to a <hi>Monarchie,</hi> to haue the <hi>Armes</hi> of a <hi>Forreiner,</hi> the <hi>Discontents</hi> of <hi>Subiects,</hi> and the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Pretender,</hi> to meete. Neuerthelesse, the <hi>Occasion</hi> tooke him in some part well prouided. For as soone as the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> had broken vp, the King had presently raysed a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7276:86"/>
puissant <hi>Armie,</hi> to <hi>Warre</hi> vpon <hi>Scotland.</hi> And King IAMES of <hi>Scotland</hi> likewise, on his part, had made great Preparations eyther for defence, or for new as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayling of <hi>England.</hi> But as for the Kings <hi>Forces,</hi> they were not onely in preparation, but in readinesse presently to set forth, vuder the Conduct of DAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BENEY, the <hi>Lord Chamberlaine.</hi> But as soone as the King vnderstood of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> hee stayed those <hi>Forces,</hi> retaining them for his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and safetie. But therewithall hee dispatched the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Surrey</hi> into the <hi>North,</hi> for the defence and strength of those Parts, in case the <hi>Scots</hi> should stirre. But for the course hee held towards the <hi>Rebels,</hi> it was vtterly differing from his former custome, and practice; which was euer full of forwardnesse and celeritie, to make head against them, or to set vpon them as soone as euer they were in <hi>Action.</hi> This hee was wont to doe. But now, besides that hee was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered by <hi>Yeares,</hi> and lesse in loue with <hi>Dangers,</hi> by the continued Fruition of a <hi>Crowne;</hi> it was a time when the various appearance to his Thoughts of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils</hi> of seuerall <hi>Natures,</hi> and from diuers <hi>Parts,</hi> did make him iudge it his best and surest way, to keepe his Strength together, in the Seate and <hi>Centre</hi> of his <hi>Kingdome.</hi> According to the ancient <hi>Indian Embleme;</hi> in such a swelling Season, <hi>To hould the hand vpon the middle of the Bladder, that no side might rise.</hi> Besides, there was no necessitie put vpon him, to alter this Counsell. For neither did the <hi>Rebels</hi> spoyle the <hi>Countrey;</hi> in which case it had beene dishonour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his <hi>People:</hi> Neyther on the other side, did their <hi>Forces</hi> gather or encrease, which might hasten him to precipitate and assayle them, before they grew too strong. And lastly, both <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Warre</hi> seemed to agree with this course; For that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections</hi> of base <hi>People</hi> are commonly more furious
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7276:87"/>
in their Beginnings. And by this meanes also hee had them the more at <hi>Vantage,</hi> beeing tyred and harrassed with a long march; and more at <hi>Mercie,</hi> being cut off farre from their <hi>Countrey,</hi> and therefore not able by any sudden flight to get to <hi>Retrait,</hi> and to renew the <hi>Troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore the <hi>Rebels</hi> were encamped on <hi>Blacke-Heath,</hi> vpon the <hi>Hill,</hi> whence they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and the faire <hi>Valley</hi> about it: the King knowing well, that it stood him vpon, by how much the more hee had hitherto protracted the time in not encountring them, by so much the sooner to dispatch with them, that it might appeare to haue beene no <hi>Coldnesse</hi> in foreslowing, but <hi>Wisedome</hi> in choosing his time; resolued with all speede to assayle them, and yet with that Prouidence, and Suretie, as should leaue little to <hi>Venture</hi> or <hi>Fortune.</hi> And hauing very great and puissant <hi>Forces</hi> about him, the better to master all <hi>Euents</hi> and <hi>Accidents,</hi> hee diuided them into three parts. The first was ledde by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> in chiefe, assisted by the <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Suffolke.</hi> These <hi>Noblemen</hi> were appointed, with some <hi>Cornets</hi> of <hi>Horse,</hi> and <hi>Bands</hi> of <hi>Foot,</hi> and good store of <hi>Artillerie</hi> wheeling about, to put themselues beyond the <hi>Hill,</hi> where the <hi>Rebels</hi> were encamped; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set all the Skirts and Descents thereof, except those that lay towards <hi>London;</hi> whereby to haue these <hi>Wilde Beasts</hi> (as it were) in a <hi>Toyle.</hi> The second part of his <hi>Forces</hi> (which were those that were to bee most in <hi>Action,</hi> and vpon which hee relyed most for the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> of the <hi>Day)</hi> hee did assigne to bee ledde by the <hi>Lord Chamberlaine,</hi> who was appointed to set vpon the <hi>Rebels</hi> in Front, from that side which is toward <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The third part of his <hi>Forces</hi> (beeing likewise great and braue <hi>Forces)</hi> hee retained about himselfe, to bee ready, vpon all <hi>Euents,</hi> to restore the <hi>Fight,</hi> or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7276:87"/>
consummate the <hi>Victorie;</hi> and meane while, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Citie.</hi> And for that purpose hee encamped in Person in Saint GEORGES <hi>Fields,</hi> putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe betweene the <hi>Citie,</hi> and the <hi>Rebels.</hi> But the <hi>Citie,</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (specially at the first) vpon the neare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> was in great Tumult: As it vseth to bee with wealthy and populous <hi>Cities</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those, which, for greatnesse and fortune, are <hi>Queenes</hi> of their <hi>Regions)</hi> who seldome see out of their <hi>Windowes,</hi> or from their <hi>Towers,</hi> an <hi>Armie</hi> of enemies. But that which troubled them most, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that they dealt with a <hi>Rout</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> with whom there was no Composition, or Condition, or orderly Treating, if neede were; but likely to bee bent alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vpon Rapine and Spoyle. And although they had heard that the <hi>Rebels</hi> had behaued themselues quietly and modestly, by the way as they went; yet they doubted much, That would not last, but rather make them more hungry, and more in appetite, to fall vpon spoyle in the end. Wherefore there was great running to and fro of <hi>People,</hi> some to the <hi>Gates,</hi> some to the <hi>Walles,</hi> some to the <hi>Water-side;</hi> giuing themselues <hi>Alarmes,</hi> and <hi>Panick feares</hi> continually. Neuerthelesse, both TATE the <hi>Lord Maior,</hi> and SHAW, and HADDON, the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> did their parts stoutly and well, in arming and ordering the <hi>People.</hi> And the King likewise did adioyne some <hi>Captaines</hi> of experience in the <hi>Wartes,</hi> to aduise and assist the <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</hi> But soone after, when they vnderstood that the King had so ordered the matter, that the <hi>Rebels</hi> must winne three <hi>Battells,</hi> before they could approach the <hi>Citie,</hi> and that hee had put his own <hi>Person</hi> betweene the <hi>Rebels</hi> and them, and that the great care was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to impound the <hi>Rebels,</hi> that none of them might escape, than that any doubt was made to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish them; they grew to bee quiet and out of feare.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7276:88"/>
The rather, for the confidence they reposed (which was not small) in the three Leaders, OXFORD, ESSEX, and DAWBENEY; All, men famed and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amongst the <hi>People.</hi> As for IASPER <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> whom the King vsed to employ with the first in his Wars, he was then sicke, and dyed soone after.</p>
            <p>It was the two and twentieth of <hi>Iune,</hi> and a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> (which was the <hi>Day</hi> of the weeke the King fansied) when the <hi>Battaile</hi> was fought; though the King had, by all the Art hee could deuise, giuen out a false Day, as if hee prepared to giue the <hi>Rebells</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile on the <hi>Monday</hi> following, the better to find them vnprouided, and in disarray. The <hi>Lords,</hi> that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to circle the <hi>Hill,</hi> had some daies before plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues (as at the Receipt) in places conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. In the afternoone towards the decline of the day (which was done, the better to keepe the <hi>Rebells</hi> in opinion that they should not fight that day) the Lord DAWBENEY marched on towards them, and first beat some <hi>Troups</hi> of them from <hi>Detford-bridge,</hi> where they fought manfully; But beeing in no great number were soone driuen backe, and fled vp to their maine <hi>Armie</hi> vpon the <hi>Hill.</hi> The <hi>Armie,</hi> at that time hearing of the approach of the Kings <hi>Forces,</hi> were put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues in Array, not without much Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But neither had they placed vpon the first high-ground towards the <hi>Bridge,</hi> any <hi>Forces</hi> to second the <hi>Troupes</hi> below, that kept the <hi>Bridge;</hi> neither had they brought forwards their <hi>Maine Battaile</hi> (which stood in array farre into the <hi>Heath)</hi> neare to the ascent of the <hi>Hill.</hi> So that the <hi>Earle</hi> with his <hi>Forces</hi> mounted the <hi>Hill,</hi> and recouered the <hi>Plaine,</hi> without resistance. The Lord DAWBENEY charged them with great furie; Insomuch, as it had like (by accident) to haue brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Fortune of the Day. For, by inconsiderate Forwardnesse in fighting in the head of his <hi>Troupes,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:7276:88"/>
he was taken by the <hi>Rebells;</hi> but, immediately rescued, and deliuered. The <hi>Rebells</hi> maintained the Fight for a small time, and for their Persons shewed no want of courage: but beeing ill armed, and ill led, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Horse</hi> or <hi>Artillerie,</hi> they were with no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie cut in peeces, and put to flight. And for their three Leaders; the Lord AVDLEY, the <hi>Black-smith,</hi> and FLAMMOCKE (as, commonly the Captaines of <hi>Commotions</hi> are but <hi>halfe-couraged Men)</hi> suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to bee taken aliue. The number slaine on the <hi>Rebells</hi> part, were some two thousand Men; their <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> amounting (as it is said) vnto the number of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand. The rest were (in effect) all taken; for that the <hi>Hill,</hi> as was said, was encompassed with the Kings <hi>Forces</hi> round about. On the Kings part there dyed about three hundred; most of them shot with Arrowes, which were reported to bee of the length of a <hi>Taylors yard:</hi> So strong and mighty a <hi>Bow</hi> the <hi>Cornish-men</hi> were said to draw.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Victorie</hi> thus obtained, the King created di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Bannerets,</hi> as well vpon <hi>Black-heath,</hi> where his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> had wonne the <hi>Fielde</hi> (whither hee rode in Person to performe the said <hi>Creation)</hi> as in Saint GEORGES <hi>Fieldes,</hi> where his owne Person had bin encamped. And for matter of <hi>Liberalitie,</hi> he did (by open <hi>Edict)</hi> giue the goods of all the <hi>Prisoners,</hi> vnto those that had taken them; either to take them in <hi>Kinde,</hi> or compound for them as they could. After matter of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Liberalitie,</hi> followed matter of <hi>Seueritie</hi> and <hi>Execution.</hi> The Lord AVDLEY was led from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> in a <hi>Paper Coate</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his own <hi>Armes;</hi> the <hi>Armes</hi> reuersed, the <hi>Coate</hi> torne, and hee at <hi>Tower-hill</hi> beheaded. FLAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOCKE, and the <hi>Black-smith</hi> vvere hanged, drawn, and quartered at <hi>Tiburne;</hi> The <hi>Black-smith</hi> taking pleasure vpon the <hi>Hurdle</hi> (as it seemeth by vvords
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7276:89"/>
that hee vttered) to thinke that hee should be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in aftertimes. The King was once in minde to haue sent downe FLAMMOCKE, and the <hi>Blac-smith,</hi> to haue beene executed in <hi>Corne-wall,</hi> for the more terrour. But, beeing aduertised, that the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> was yet vnquiet and boyling, hee thought better not to irritate the <hi>People</hi> further. All the rest were pardoned by <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and to take out their <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> vnder <hi>Seale,</hi> as many as would. So that, more than the bloud drawn in the <hi>Field,</hi> the King did satisfie himselfe with the liues of onely three <hi>Offenders,</hi> for the expiation of this great <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a strange thing, to obserue the varietie and inequalitie of the Kings <hi>Executions</hi> and <hi>Pardons.</hi> And a man would thinke it, at the first, a kinde of <hi>Lotterie</hi> or Chance. But, looking into it more nearely, one shall find there was reason for it; much more perhaps, than (after so long a distance of time) wee can now discerne. In the <hi>Kentish Commotion</hi> (which was but an landfull of men) there were executed to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one hundred and fiftie; and, in this so mighty a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but three: Whether it were, that the king put go accompt the men that wereslaine in the <hi>Fielde:</hi> or that hee was not willing to bee seuerein a popular Cause; or that the harmelesse behauiour of this <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (that came from the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to the <hi>East,</hi> without mischiefe almost, or spoyle of the <hi>Countrey)</hi> did somewhat mollifie him, and mooue him to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, or lastly, that he made a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twoene <hi>People,</hi> that did Rebell vpon <hi>Wantonnesse,</hi> and them that did Rebell vpon <hi>Want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Cornish-men</hi> were defeated, there came from, <hi>Calice</hi> to the King, an honourable <hi>Ambassage</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> King, which had arriued at <hi>Calice</hi> a Moneth before, and there was stayed in respect of the troubles, but honourably entertained and defrayed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:7276:89"/>
The King, at their first comming, sent vnto them, &amp; prayed them to haue patience, till a little <hi>Smoake,</hi> that was raised in his Countrie, were ouer; which would sonne bee: Slighting (as his manner was) that openly, which neuerthelesse he intended seriously.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ambassage</hi> concerned no great Affaire; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Prolongation</hi> of Dayes for payment of Monies, and some other Particulars of the <hi>Frontiers.</hi> And it was (indeed) but a wooing <hi>Ambassage;</hi> with good respects to entertaine the King in good affection: but nothing was done, or handled, to the derogation of the Kings late <hi>Treatie</hi> with the <hi>Italians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, during the time that the <hi>Cornish-men</hi> were in their march towards <hi>London,</hi> the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> (wel aduertised of all that passed, and knowing himselfe sure of <hi>Warre</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> whensoeuer those Stirs were appeased) neglected not his opportunitie; But, thinking the King had his hands full, entred the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> againe with an <hi>Armie,</hi> and besieged the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Norham</hi> in Person, with part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, sending the rest to Forrage the <hi>Countrie.</hi> But FOX, <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Duresme</hi> (a wise man, and one that could see through the <hi>Present,</hi> to the <hi>Future)</hi> doubting as much before, had caused his <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Norham</hi> to bee strongly fortified, and furnished, with all kinde of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:</hi> And had manned it likewise, with a very great number of tall <hi>Souldiours,</hi> more than for the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Castle;</hi> reckoning rather vpon a sharpe <hi>Assault,</hi> than a long <hi>Siege.</hi> And for the <hi>Countrey</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, hee had caused the <hi>People</hi> to withdraw their Cattell and Goods into <hi>Fast Places,</hi> that were not of easie approach; and sent in Post to the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> (who was not farre off, in <hi>Yorkeshire)</hi> to come in diligence to the Succour. So as the <hi>Scottish King</hi> both failed of doing good vpon the <hi>Castle,</hi> and his men had but a <hi>Catching Haruest</hi> of their <hi>Spoyles.</hi> And
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7276:90"/>
when hee vnderstood, that the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Surrey</hi> was comming on with great <hi>Forces,</hi> hee returned backe into <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Earle</hi> finding the <hi>Castle</hi> freed, and the enemie retired, pursued with all celeritie into <hi>Scotland;</hi> hoping to haue ouer-taken the <hi>Scottish</hi> King, and to haue giuen him <hi>Battaile;</hi> But not attaining him in time, sate downe before the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Aton</hi> (one of the strongest places, then esteemed, betweene <hi>Barwicke</hi> and <hi>Edenborough)</hi> which in a small time hee tooke. And soone after, the <hi>Scottish</hi> King retyring further into his Countrey, and the weather being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie foule and stormie, the <hi>Earle</hi> returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England.</hi> So that the <hi>Expeditions</hi> on both parts were (in effect) but a <hi>Castle</hi> taken, and a <hi>Castle</hi> distressed; not answerable to the puissance of the <hi>Forces,</hi> nor to the heat of the <hi>Quarrell,</hi> nor to the greatness of the <hi>Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst these <hi>Troubles</hi> both Ciuill and Externall, came into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Spaine</hi> PETER HIALAS, some call him ELIAS (surely hee was the forerunner of the good <hi>Hap,</hi> that we enioy at this day. For, his <hi>Ambassage</hi> set the <hi>Truce</hi> betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the <hi>Truce</hi> drew on the <hi>Peace;</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;</hi> and the <hi>Marriage</hi> the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Kingdomes)</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> of great wisedome, and (as those times were) not vnlearned; sent from FERDINANDO and IS A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELLA Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> vnto the King, to treate a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> betweene KATHERINE their second daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVR. This <hi>Treatie</hi> was by him set in a very good way, and almost brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But it so fell out by the way, that vpon some <hi>Conference</hi> which hee had with the King touching this businesse, the King (who had a great dexteritie in getting sodainely into the bosome of <hi>Ambassadours</hi> of forraine <hi>Princes,</hi> if he liked the men; Insomuch as he would many times communicate with them of his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7276:90"/>
owne affaires, yea and employ them in his seruice) fell into speech and discourse incidently, concerning the ending of the <hi>Debates</hi> and differences with <hi>Scotland.</hi> For the King naturally did not loue the barren <hi>Warres</hi> with <hi>Scotland,</hi> though he made his profit of the <hi>Noise</hi> of them. And he wanted not in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> those that would aduise their King to meet him at the halfe way, and to giue ouer the <hi>War</hi> with <hi>England;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bee good <hi>Patriots;</hi> but indeede fauouring the affaires of the King. Onely his heart was too great to beginne with <hi>Scotland</hi> for the motion of <hi>Peace.</hi> On the other side, he had met with an <hi>Allie</hi> of FERDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDO of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as fit for his turne as could bee. For after that King FERDINANDO had, vpon assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Confidence of the <hi>Marriage</hi> to succeed, taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the person of a <hi>Fraternall Allie</hi> to the King, hee would not let (in a <hi>Spanish grauitie)</hi> to counsell the King in his owne affaires. And the King on his part not being wanting to himselfe, but making vse of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans humours, made his aduantage of this in such things as hee thought either not decent, or not pleasant to proceede from himselfe; putting them off as done by the <hi>Counsell</hi> of FERDINANDO. Wherefore hee was content that HIALAS (as in a matter moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and aduised from HIALAS himselfe) should goe into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to treate of a <hi>Concord</hi> betweene the two Kings. HIALAS tooke it vpon him: and comming to the <hi>Scottish</hi> King, after hee had with much Art brought King IAMES to hearken to the more safe and quiet Counsells, wrote vnto the King, that hee hoped that <hi>Peace</hi> would with no great difficultie ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and close, if hee would send some wise and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>Counsellour</hi> of his owne, that might treate of the <hi>Conditions.</hi> Whereupon the King directed <hi>Bishop</hi> FOX (who at that time was at his <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Norham)</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with HIALAS, and they both to treate with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7276:91"/>
some <hi>Commissioners,</hi> deputed from the <hi>Scottish</hi> King. The <hi>Commissioners</hi> on both sides met. But after much dispute vpon the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vpon eyther part, they could not conclude a <hi>Peace.</hi> The chiefe <hi>Impediments</hi> thereof was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King, to haue PERKIN deliuered into his hands, as a <hi>Reproach</hi> to all Kings, and a <hi>Person</hi> not protected by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations.</hi> The King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the other side, peremptorily denied so to doe; saying, That he (for his part) was no <hi>Competent Iudge</hi> of PERKINS Title: But that he had receiued him as a <hi>Suppliant,</hi> protected him as a Person fled for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> espoused him with his <hi>Kinswoman,</hi> and aided him with his <hi>Armes,</hi> vpon the beleefe that hee was a <hi>Prince;</hi> And therefore that hee could not now with his Honour so vnrippe and (in a sort) put a <hi>Lye</hi> vpon all that hee had said and done before, as to deliuer him vp to his Enemies. The <hi>Bishop</hi> likewise (who had certaine proud instructions from the King, at the least in the <hi>Front,</hi> though there were a pliant clause at the <hi>Foote,</hi> that remitted all to the <hi>Bishops</hi> discretion, and required him by no meanes to breake off in ill tearmes) after that he had fayled to obtaine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie of PERKIN, did mooue a second point of his <hi>Instructions;</hi> which was, that the <hi>Scottish</hi> King would giue the King an <hi>Enteruiew</hi> in Person at <hi>Newcastle.</hi> But this being reported to the <hi>Scottish</hi> King, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was; <hi>That he meant to treate a Peace, and not to goe a begging for it.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> also (according to another Article of his <hi>Instructions)</hi> demanded <hi>Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of the Spoyles taken by the <hi>Scottish,</hi> or <hi>Damages</hi> for the same. But the <hi>Scottish Commissioners</hi> answered; <hi>That that was but as Water spilt vpon the ground, which could not bee gotten vp againe; and that the Kings People were better able to beare the losse, than their Master to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire it.</hi> But in the end (as Persons capable of reason)
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7276:91"/>
on both sides they made rather a kinde of <hi>Recesse,</hi> than a <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Treaty,</hi> &amp; concluded vpon a <hi>Truce</hi> for some moneths following. But the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though hee would not formally retract his iudgement of PERKIN, wherein he had engaged himselfe so farre; yet in his priuate opinion, vpon often speech with the <hi>English-men,</hi> and diuers other aduertisements, began to suspect him for a <hi>Counterfeit.</hi> Wherefore in a Noble fashion hee called him vnto him, and recounted the Benefits and fauours that he had done him, in making him his <hi>Allie,</hi> and in prouoking a Mighty and Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent King by an <hi>Offensiue Warre</hi> in his <hi>Quarrell,</hi> for the space of two yeares together. Nay more, that he had refused an Honourable <hi>Peace,</hi> whereof he had a faire Offer, if he would haue deliuered him; and that to keepe his promise with him, he had deepely offended both his <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> whom he might not hold in any long discontent. And therefore required him to thinke of his own <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and to choose out some fitter place for his <hi>Exile:</hi> Telling him withall, that he could not say, but the <hi>English</hi> had forsaken him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Scottish;</hi> for that vpon two seueral Trials, none had declared themselues on his side. But neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee would make good what he said to him at his first receiuing, which was; <hi>That hee should not repent him, for putting himselfe into his hands;</hi> For that he would not cast him off, but helpe him with Spipping and meanes, to transport him where he should desire. PERKIN, not descending at all from his <hi>Stage-like</hi> Greatnesse, answered the King in few words; <hi>That he saw his time was not yet come: But whatsoeuer his</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes <hi>were, he should both thinke and speake</hi> Honour <hi>of the King.</hi> Taking his leaue, hee would not thinke on <hi>Flanders,</hi> doubting it was but hollow ground for him, since the <hi>Treatie</hi> of the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> concluded the yeare before; but tooke his <hi>Ladie,</hi> and such Followers
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7276:92"/>
as would not leaue him, and sailed ouer into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Twelfth yeare of the King, a little before this time, <hi>Pope</hi> ALEXANDER (who loued best those <hi>Princes</hi> that were furthest off, and with whom he had least to doe) taking very thankefully the Kings late entrance into <hi>League,</hi> for the defence of <hi>Italie,</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate him with an <hi>Hallowed-Sword,</hi> and <hi>Cap-</hi>of-<hi>Maintenance</hi> sent by his <hi>Nuncio. Pope</hi> INNOCENT had done the like, but it was not receiued in that <hi>Glory.</hi> For the King appointed the <hi>Maior</hi> and his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> to meet the <hi>Popes Orator</hi> at <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and all the <hi>Streets</hi> between the <hi>Bridge-foote</hi> and the Palace of <hi>Paules</hi> (where the King then lay) were garnished with the <hi>Citizens,</hi> standing in their <hi>Liueries.</hi> And the Morrow after (being <hi>All-hallowes day)</hi> the King, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many of his <hi>Prelates, Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Courtiers,</hi> went in <hi>Procession</hi> to <hi>Paules,</hi> and the <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> were borne before him. And after the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> the King himselfe remaining seated in the <hi>Quire,</hi> the <hi>Lord Archbishop</hi> vpon the greece of the <hi>Quire,</hi> made a long <hi>Oration,</hi> setting forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and <hi>Eminencie</hi> of that <hi>Honour,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> (in these Ornaments and Ensignes of <hi>Benediction)</hi> had done the King; and how rarely, and vpon what high deserts they vsed to bee bestowed. And then recited the Kings principall <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Merits,</hi> which had made him appeare worthy in the eyes of his <hi>Holinesse</hi> of this great <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Cornewall</hi> (whereof wee haue spoken) seemed to haue no relation to PERKIN; saue that perhaps PERKINS <hi>Proclamation</hi> had stricken vpon the right Veine, in promising to lay downe <hi>Exactions</hi> and <hi>Payments,</hi> and so had made them now and then haue a <hi>Kind-thought</hi> on PERKIN. But now these <hi>Bubbles</hi> by much stirring began to meete, as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7276:92"/>
they vse to doe vpon the top of <hi>Water.</hi> The Kings le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie (by that time the <hi>Cornish Rebels,</hi> who were taken and pardoned, and (as it was said) manie of them sold by them that had taken them, for twelue pence and two shillings a-peece, were come downe into their Countrey) had rather imboldened them, than reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them. Insomuch, as they stucke not to say to their Neighbours and Countrey-men, that <hi>The King did well to pardon them, for that hee knew hee should leaue few Subiects in</hi> England, <hi>if hee hanged all that were of their minde:</hi> And beganne whetting and inciting one another to renew the <hi>Commotion.</hi> Some of the subtilest of them, hearing of PERKINS being in <hi>Ireland,</hi> found meanes to send to him, to let him know, that if hee would come ouer to them, they would serue him.</p>
            <p>When PERKIN heard this Newes, hee beganne to take heart againe, and aduised vpon it with his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> which were principally three; HERNE a <hi>Mercer,</hi> that had fledde for Debt; SKELTON a <hi>Taylor,</hi> and ASTLEY a <hi>Scriuener:</hi> for, <hi>Secretarie</hi> FRION was gone. These told him, that hee was mightily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, both when hee went into <hi>Kent,</hi> and when hee went into <hi>Scotland:</hi> The one being a place so neare <hi>London,</hi> and vnder the Kings Nose; and the other, a Nation so distasted with the People of <hi>England,</hi> that if they had Ioued him neuer so well, yet they would neuer haue taken his part in that Companie. But if hee had beene so happie, as to haue beene in <hi>Cornewall</hi> at the first, when the People began to take <hi>Armes</hi> there, hee had beene crowned at <hi>Westminster</hi> before this time. For, these Kings (as hee had now experience) vvould sell poore <hi>Princes</hi> for shooes: But hee must relye wholly vpon <hi>People;</hi> and therefore aduised him to sayle ouer with all possible speede into <hi>Cornewall.</hi> Which, accordingly hee did; hauing in his Companie
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7276:93"/>
foure small <hi>Barks,</hi> with some sixe score or seuen score fighting men. Hee arriued in <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Whitsand-Bay;</hi> and forthwith came to <hi>Bodmin,</hi> the <hi>Black-smiths</hi> Town: Where there assembled vnto him to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three thousand men of the rude People. There he set forth a new <hi>Proclamation,</hi> stroaking the People with faire Promises, and humouring them with <hi>Inuectiues</hi> against the King and his <hi>Gouernment.</hi> And, as it fareth with <hi>Smoke,</hi> that neuer loseth it selfe till it bee at the highest; hee did now before his end raise his <hi>Stile,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling himself no more RICHARD, <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York;</hi> but RICHARD the Fourth, King of <hi>England.</hi> His <hi>Councell</hi> aduised him, by all meanes, to make himselfe <hi>Master</hi> of some good walled <hi>Towne;</hi> as well to make his Men finde the sweetnesse of rich <hi>Spoyles,</hi> and to allure to him all loose and lost <hi>People,</hi> by like hopes of <hi>Bootie;</hi> as to bee a sure <hi>Retrait</hi> to his <hi>Forces,</hi> in case they should haue any ill <hi>Day,</hi> or vnluckie <hi>Chance</hi> in the <hi>Field.</hi> Wherefore they tooke heart to them, and went on, and besieged the Citie of <hi>Excester,</hi> the principall <hi>Towne</hi> for Strength and Wealth in those Parts.</p>
            <p>When they were comne before <hi>Excester,</hi> they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to vse any Force at the first; but made continuall <hi>Shouts</hi> and <hi>Out-cries,</hi> to terrifie the <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> They did likewise in diuers places call and talke to them from vnder the Walls, to ioyne with them, and be of their <hi>Partie;</hi> telling them, that The King would make them another <hi>London,</hi> if they would bee the first <hi>Towne</hi> that should acknowledge him. But they had not the wit to send to them, in any orderly fashion, <hi>Agents</hi> or <hi>chosen Men,</hi> to tempt them, and to treat with them. The Citizens on their part shewed themselues stout and loyall Subiects. Neyther was there so much as any <hi>Tumult</hi> or <hi>Diuision</hi> amongst them: but all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themselues for a valiant <hi>Defence,</hi> and making
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7276:93"/>
good the <hi>Towne.</hi> For, well they saw, that the <hi>Rebels</hi> were of no such Number or Power, that they needed to feare them as yet: and well they hoped, that before their <hi>Numbers</hi> encreased, the Kings <hi>Succours</hi> would come-in. And, howsoeuer, they thought it the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest of Euils, To put themselues at the mercy of those hungry and disorderly People. Wherefore, setting all things in good order within the <hi>Towne,</hi> they neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse let-downe with Cords, from seuerall parts of the Walls priuily, seuerall <hi>Messengers</hi> (that, if one came to mischance, another might passe-on) which should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise the King of the State of the <hi>Towne,</hi> and implore his aide. PERKIN also doubted, that Succours would come ere long; and therefore resolued to vse his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Force to assault the <hi>Towne:</hi> And for that purpose, hauing mounted <hi>Scaling-Ladders</hi> in diuers places vpon the Walls, made at the same instant an <hi>Attempt</hi> to force one of the <hi>Gates.</hi> But, hauing no <hi>Artillery</hi> nor <hi>Engines,</hi> and finding that hee could doe no good by ramming with Logges of <hi>Timber,</hi> nor by the vse of Iron <hi>Barres</hi> and Iron <hi>Crowes,</hi> and such other meanes at hand, hee had no way left him, but to set one of the <hi>Gates</hi> on fire: which hee did. But the Citizens, well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Danger, before the <hi>Gate</hi> could bee fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, blocked vp the <hi>Gate,</hi> and some space about it on the inside, with Fagots and other Fuell: which they likewise set on fire, and so repulsed fire with fire; And, in the meane time, raised vp <hi>Rampiers</hi> of earth, and cast vp deep <hi>Trenches,</hi> to serue in stead of <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Gate.</hi> And for the <hi>Escaladaes,</hi> they had so bad successe, as the <hi>Rebels</hi> were driuen from the <hi>Wals,</hi> with the losse of two hundred men.</p>
            <p>The King, when hee heard of PERKINS Siege of <hi>Excester,</hi> made sport with it, and said to them that were about him, that <hi>The King of Rake-hells was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the West, and that hee hoped now to haue the honour</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:7276:94"/>
               <hi>to see him, which hee could neuer yet doe.</hi> And it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plainely to those that were about the King, that he was indeed much ioied with the newes of PERKINS being in <hi>English Ground,</hi> where hee could haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait by Land; thinking now, that hee should bee cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of those priuie <hi>Stitches,</hi> which hee had long had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his <hi>Heart,</hi> and had sometimes broken his <hi>Sleeps</hi> in the middest of all his Felicitie. And, to set all mens hearts on fire, hee did by all possible meanes let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that those, who should now doe him seruice to make an end of these troubles, should bee no lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, than hee that came vpon the <hi>Eleuenth Houre,</hi> and had the whole <hi>Wages</hi> of the <hi>Day.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now (like the end of a <hi>Play)</hi> a great number came vpon the <hi>Stage</hi> at once. He sent the <hi>Lord Chamberlaine,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> BROOK, and Sir RICEAP THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS, with expedite Forces to speed to <hi>Excester,</hi> to the Rescue of the Towne, and to spread the Fame of his owne following in Person with a <hi>Royall Army.</hi> The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> and his Son, with the CAROES, and the FVLFORDES, and other principall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Deuonshire</hi> (vncalled from the <hi>Court,</hi> but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the Kings heart was so much bent vpon this Seruice) made haste with <hi>Troupes,</hi> that they had ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to bee the first that should succour the Citie of <hi>Excester,</hi> and preuent the Kings Succours. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> likewise, with many braue <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> put themselues in <hi>Armes,</hi> not staying eyther the Kings or the <hi>Lord Chamberlaines</hi> comming on, but making a Bodie of Forces of themselues, the more to indeare their merit; signifying to the King their readinesse, and desiring to know his pleasure. So that according to the Prouerbe, <hi>In the comming downe, euerie Saint did helpe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PERKIN, hearing this Thunder of <hi>Armes,</hi> and Preparations against him from so many Parts, raised
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7276:94"/>
his <hi>Siege,</hi> and marched to <hi>Taunton;</hi> beginning alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to squint one eye vpon the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and another vpon the <hi>Sanctuarie:</hi> Though the <hi>Cornish-men</hi> were become, like <hi>Metall</hi> often fired and quenched, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and that would sooner breake than bow; swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and vowing not to leaue him, till the vttermost drop of their blood were spilt. Hee was at his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from <hi>Excester</hi> betweene sixe and seuen thousand strong, many hauing come vnto him, after he was set before <hi>Excester,</hi> vpon fame of so great an <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,</hi> and to partake of the <hi>Spoyle;</hi> Though vpon the raysing of his <hi>Siege,</hi> some did slippe away. When hee was come neare <hi>Taunton;</hi> hee dissembled all feare, and seemed all the day to vse diligence in preparing all things ready to fight. But about Midnight, hee fled with threescore Horse to <hi>Bewley</hi> in the <hi>New-Forrest,</hi> where hee and diuers of his Companie regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred themselues <hi>Sanctuarie-men,</hi> leauing his <hi>Cornish-men</hi> to the <hi>Foure Windes;</hi> But yet thereby easing them of their <hi>Vow,</hi> and vsing his wonted Compassion, <hi>Not to bee by when his Subiects bloud should bee spilt.</hi> The King, as soone as he heard of PERKINS <hi>Flight,</hi> sent presently fiue hundred Horse to pursue and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, before hee should get either to the <hi>Sea,</hi> or to that same little <hi>Island,</hi> called a <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> But they came too late for the latter of these. Therefore all they could doe, was to beset the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and to maintaine a strong <hi>Watch</hi> about it, till the Kings pleasure were further knowne. As for the rest of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> they (beeing destituted of their head) without stroke stricken, submitted themselues vnto the Kings Mercie. And the King, who commonly drew Bloud (as <hi>Physitians</hi> doe) rather to saue life than to spill it, and was neuer <hi>Cruell</hi> when he was <hi>Secure;</hi> now he saw the Danger was past, pardoned them all in the end, except some few desperate persons which hee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7276:95"/>
reserued to bee executed, the better to set of his <hi>Mercie</hi> towards the rest. There were also sent with all speede some horse to Saint MICHAELS <hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE GORDON was left by her Husband, whom in all Fortunes shee entirely loued; adding the vertues of a <hi>Wife,</hi> to the vertues of her <hi>Sexe.</hi> The King sent in the greater diligence, not knowing whether she might be with <hi>Childe;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the businesse would not haue ended in PERKINS person. When shee was brought to the King, it was commonly said, that the King receiued her not onely with <hi>Compassion,</hi> but with <hi>Affection; Pitie</hi> giuing more <hi>Impression</hi> to her excellent <hi>Beautie.</hi> Wherefore comforting her (to serue as well his <hi>Eye,</hi> as his <hi>Fame)</hi> he sent her to his <hi>Queene,</hi> to remaine with her; giuing her very honourable <hi>Allowance</hi> for the support of her Estate: which shee enioyed both during the Kings life, and many yeares after. The name of the <hi>White-Rose</hi> (which had beene giuen to her Husbands <hi>False-Title)</hi> was continued in common speech to her true <hi>Beautie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King went forwards on his Iourney, and made a ioyfull entrance into <hi>Excester,</hi> where hee gaue the <hi>Citizens</hi> great commendations and thankes: and taking the <hi>Sword</hi> hee wore, from his side, he gaue it to the Maior, and commanded it should bee euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carried before him. There also hee caused to bee executed some of the <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> of the <hi>Cornish-men,</hi> in sacrifice to the <hi>Citizens,</hi> whom they had putin feare, and trouble. At <hi>Excester</hi> the King consulted with his <hi>Councell,</hi> whether he should offer life to PERKIN, if hee would quit the <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> and voluntarily submit himselfe. The <hi>Councell</hi> were diuided in opinion. Some aduised the King to take him out of <hi>Sanctuary</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, and to put him to death, as in a case of <hi>Necessity,</hi> which in it selfe dispenseth with <hi>Consecrated Places</hi> and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7276:95"/>
things. Wherein they doubted not also, but the King should find the <hi>Pope</hi> tractable to ratifie his <hi>Deed,</hi> either by <hi>Declaration,</hi> or (at least) by <hi>Indulgence.</hi> Others were of opinion (since all was now safe, and no further hurt could bee done) that it was not worth the exposing of the King to new <hi>Scandall</hi> and <hi>Enuy.</hi> A third sort fell vpon the opinion that it was not possible for the King euer, either to satisfie the world well touching the <hi>Imposture,</hi> or to learne out the bottome of the <hi>Conspiracie,</hi> except by promise of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> and other faire meanes, hee should get PERKIN into his hands. But they did all in their <hi>Preambles</hi> much bemone the Kings Case, with a kind of <hi>Indignation</hi> at his <hi>Fortune;</hi> That a <hi>Prince</hi> of his high <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> should haue beene so long, and so oft exercised and vexed with <hi>Idols.</hi> But the King said; that it was the <hi>Vexation</hi> of GOD <hi>Almightie</hi> himselfe, to be vexed with <hi>Idols,</hi> and therefore that that was not to trouble any of his Friends. And that for himselfe, hee alwayes despised them; but was grieued that they had put his <hi>People</hi> to such trouble and misery. But (in Conclusion) hee leaned to the third opinion, and so sent some to deale with PERKIN. Who seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Prisoner, and destitute of all hopes, hauing tried <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>People, Great</hi> and <hi>Small,</hi> and found all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther false, faint, or vnfortunate, did gladly accept of the Condition. The King did also (while hee was at <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester)</hi> appoint the <hi>Lord</hi> DARCIE, and others, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,</hi> for the Fining of all such, as were of any value, and had any hand or partaking in the aide or comfort of PERKIN or the <hi>Cornish-men,</hi> either in the <hi>Field</hi> or in the <hi>Flight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Commissioners</hi> proceeded with such strictnesse and seueritie, as did much obscure the Kings mercie in sparing of <hi>Bloud,</hi> with the bleeding of so much <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> PERKIN was brought vnto the Kings Court,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7276:96"/>
but not to the Kings presence; though the King (to satisfie his <hi>Curiositie)</hi> saw him sometimes out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or in passage. Hee was in shew at libertie, but guarded with all care and watch that was possible, and willed to follow the King to <hi>London.</hi> But from his first appearance vpon the <hi>Stage,</hi> in his new person of a <hi>Sycophant</hi> or <hi>Iugler,</hi> in stead of his former Person of a <hi>Prince,</hi> all men may thinke how he was exposed to the derision, not onely of the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> but also of the <hi>Common-People,</hi> who flocked about him as hee went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; that one might know a farre off, where the <hi>Owle</hi> was, by the <hi>Flight</hi> of <hi>Birdes.</hi> Some mocking, some wondring, some cursing, some prying and picking matter out of his Countenance and Gesture, to talke of. So that the false <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Respects</hi> which hee had so long enioyed, was plentifully repaied in <hi>Scorne</hi> and <hi>Contempt.</hi> As soone as hee was come to <hi>London,</hi> the King gaue also the <hi>Citie</hi> the solace of this <hi>May-Game.</hi> For hee was conueighed leasurely on Horse-backe (but not in any ignominious fashion) through <hi>Cheape-side,</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and from thence backe againe vnto <hi>Westminster,</hi> with the <hi>Churme</hi> of a thousand taunts and reproches. But to amend the <hi>Show,</hi> there followed a little distance of PERKIN, an inward <hi>Councellour</hi> of his, One that had beene <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant Farrier</hi> to the King. This Fellow when PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIN tooke <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> chose rather to take an <hi>Holy-Habit,</hi> than an <hi>Holy-Place,</hi> and clad him selfe like an <hi>Hermite,</hi> and in that weede wandered about the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,</hi> till hee was discouered, and taken. But this Man was bound hand and foote vpon the Horse, and came not backe with PERKIN, but was left at the <hi>Tower,</hi> and within few dayes after Executed. Soone after, now that PERKIN could tell better what himselfe was, he was diligently examined; and after his <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> taken, an <hi>Extract</hi> was made of such parts of them,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7276:96"/>
as were thought fit to be divulged, which was Printed and dispersed abroad. Wherein the King did himselfe no Right. For as there was a laboured <hi>Tale</hi> of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, of PERKINS <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Grandsire,</hi> and <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> and <hi>Unckles,</hi> and <hi>Cosens,</hi> by <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Sirnames,</hi> and from what places hee trauailed vp and downe; so there was little or nothing to purpose of any thing concerning his <hi>Designes,</hi> or any <hi>Practises</hi> that had beene held with him; nor the <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Burgundie</hi> her selfe (that all the World did take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, as the <hi>Person</hi> that had put <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Beeing</hi> into the whole <hi>Businesse)</hi> so much as named or pointed at. So that men missing of that they looked for, looked about for they knew not what, and were in more doubt than before. But the King chose rather not to satisfie, than to kindle <hi>Coales.</hi> At that time also it did not appeare by any new <hi>Examinations</hi> or <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that any other Person of qualitie was discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or appeached, though the Kings closenesse made that a <hi>Doubt-Dormant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, a great <hi>Fire</hi> in the night time so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely began at the kings <hi>Pallace</hi> of <hi>Shyne,</hi> neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kings owne Lodgings, whereby a great part of the Building was consumed, with much costly Houshold-stuffe; which gaue the king occasion of Building from the ground that fine <hi>Pile</hi> of <hi>Richmond,</hi> which is now standing.</p>
            <p>Somewhat before this time also, there fell out a memorable Accident. There was one SEBASTIAN GABATO, a <hi>Venetian,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Bristow,</hi> a man seene and expert in <hi>Cosmographie</hi> and <hi>Nauigation.</hi> This Man seeing the successe, and emulating per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the enterprise of CHRISTOPHERVS CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVMBVS in that fortunate discouerie towards the <hi>Southwest,</hi> which had beene by him made some sixe yeares before; conceited with himselfe, that <hi>Lands</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:7276:97"/>
might likewise bee discouered towards the <hi>Northwest.</hi> And surely it may bee hee had more firme and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Coniectures of it, than COLVMBVS had of this at the first. For the two great <hi>Islands</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New world,</hi> beeing (in the shape and making of them) broad towards the <hi>North,</hi> and pointed towards the <hi>South;</hi> it is likely, that the discouerie first beganne where the <hi>Lands</hi> did nearest meet. And there had beene before that time a discouerie of some <hi>Lands,</hi> which they tooke to bee <hi>Islands,</hi> and were indeed the <hi>Continent of America,</hi> towards the <hi>Northwest.</hi> And it may bee, that some Relation of this nature comming afterwards to the knowledge of COLVMBVS, and by him suppressed, (desirous rather to make his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise the <hi>Child</hi> of his <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> than the <hi>Follower</hi> of a former <hi>Discouerie)</hi> did giue him better assurance, that all was not <hi>Sea,</hi> from the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>Africke</hi> vnto <hi>Asia,</hi> than either SENECA'S <hi>Prophesie,</hi> or PLATO'S <hi>Antiquities,</hi> or the Nature of the <hi>Tides,</hi> and <hi>Land-winds,</hi> and the like, which were the <hi>Coniectures</hi> that were giuen out, whereupon hee should haue relyed. Though I am not ignorant, that it was likewise laid vnto the casuall and <hi>wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten Discouerie</hi> (a little before) of a <hi>Spanish Pilot,</hi> who died in the house of COLVMBVS. But this GABATO bearing the King in hand, that hee would find out an <hi>Island</hi> endued with rich Commodities, procured him to man and victuall a Ship at <hi>Bristow,</hi> for the discouerie of that <hi>Island,</hi> With whom ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also three small Shippes of <hi>London-Merchants,</hi> fraught with some grosse and sleight Wares, fit for Commerce with barbarous people. Hee sayled (as hee affirmed at his Returne, and made a <hi>Card</hi> thereof) very farre <hi>Westwards,</hi> with a <hi>Quarter</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> on the <hi>North-side</hi> of <hi>Tierra de Labrador,</hi> vntill hee came to the <hi>Latitude</hi> of sixtie seuen Degrees and an halfe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7276:97"/>
finding the <hi>Seas</hi> still open. It is certaine also, that the <hi>Kings</hi> Fortune had a tender of that great <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> Neither was it a <hi>Refusall</hi> on the kings part, but a <hi>Delay</hi> by accident, that put by so great an <hi>Acquest.</hi> For CHRISTOPHERVS COLVMBVS refused by the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> (who would not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace at once both <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West)</hi> imployed his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther BARTHOLOMEVS COLVMBVS vnto king HENRY, to negotiate for his Discouerie. And it so fortuned, that hee was taken by <hi>Pirats</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> by which accidentall impediment hee was longere hee came to the king. So long, that before hee had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Capitulation with the King for his Brother, the Enterprise by him was atchieued, and so the <hi>West-Indies</hi> by <hi>Prouidence</hi> were then reserued for the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>Castilia.</hi> Yet this sharpned the king so, that not onely in this Voyage, but againe in the sixteenth yeare of his Raigne, and likewise in the Eighteenth thereof, hee granted forth new <hi>Commissions,</hi> for the <hi>Discouerie</hi> and inuesting of vnknowne <hi>Lands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Fourteenth yeare also (by GODS won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull prouidence, that boweth things vnto his will, and hangeth great <hi>Weights</hi> vpon small <hi>Wyers)</hi> there fell out a trifling and vntoward Accident, that drew on great and happie effects. During the Truce with <hi>Scotland,</hi> there were certaine <hi>Scottish young Gentlemen,</hi> that came into <hi>Norham</hi> Towne, and there made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with some of the <hi>English</hi> of the <hi>Towne.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing little to doe, went sometimes forth, and would stand looking vpon the <hi>Castle.</hi> Some of the <hi>Garrison</hi> of the <hi>Castle,</hi> obseruing this their doing twice or thrice and hauing not their minds purged of the late ill bloud of <hi>Hostilitie,</hi> either suspected them, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled them for <hi>Spies.</hi> Whereupon they fell at ill <hi>Words,</hi> and from <hi>Words</hi> to <hi>Blowes;</hi> so that many were wounded of either side, and the <hi>Scottish-men</hi> (beeing
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7276:98"/>
strangers in the <hi>Towne)</hi> had the worst. In so much as some of them were slaine, and the rest made haste home. The matter beeing complained on, and often debated before the <hi>Wardens</hi> of the <hi>Marches</hi> of both sides, and no good order taken, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> tooke it to himselfe, and beeing much kindled, sent a <hi>Herald</hi> to the king to make protestation, That if Reparation were not done, according to the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Truce,</hi> his king did denounce <hi>Warre.</hi> The king (who had often tryed <hi>Fortune,</hi> and was inclined to <hi>Peace)</hi> made answer; That what had been done, was vtterly against his will, and without his <hi>Priuitie.</hi> But if the <hi>Garrison-Souldiers</hi> had been in fault, he would see them punished, and the <hi>Truce</hi> in all points to bee preserued. But this answer seemed to the <hi>Scottish king</hi> but a Delay, to make the Complaint breathe out with time; and therefore it did rather exasperate him, than satisfie him. <hi>Bishop</hi> FOX, vnderstanding from the king, that the <hi>Scottish</hi> king was still discontent and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, beeing troubled that the occasion of breaking of the <hi>Truce</hi> should grow from his men, sent many humble and deprecatorie Letters to the <hi>Scottish</hi> King to appease him. Whereupon King IAMES, mollified by the <hi>Bishops</hi> submisse and eloquent Letters, wrote back vnto him; That though he were in part moued by his <hi>Letters,</hi> yet he should not bee fully satisfied, except hee spake with him; as well about the compounding of the present differences, as about other matters, that might concerne the good of both <hi>Kingdomes.</hi> The <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> aduising first with the king, tooke his Iourney for <hi>Scotland.</hi> The meeting was at <hi>Melrosse,</hi> an <hi>Abbey</hi> of the <hi>Cestersians,</hi> where the king then abode. The king first roundly vttered vnto the <hi>Bishop</hi> his offence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for the insolent Breach of <hi>Truce,</hi> by his men of <hi>Norham Castle.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Bishop</hi> FOX made such an humble and smooth answer, as it was like <hi>Oyle</hi> into
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7276:98"/>
the <hi>wound,</hi> whereby it began to heale. And this was done in the presence of the King and his <hi>Councell.</hi> After, the King spake with the <hi>Bishop</hi> apart, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himselfe vnto him, saying; That these temporarie <hi>Truces</hi> and <hi>Peaces</hi> were soone made, and soone bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: But that hee desired a straiter Amitie with the King of <hi>England,</hi> discouering his mind; that if the King would giue him in <hi>Mariage,</hi> the <hi>Ladie</hi> MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GARET, his eldest <hi>Daughter,</hi> That indeede might bee a <hi>Knot</hi> indissoluble. That hee knew well what Place and Authoritie the <hi>Bishop</hi> deseruedly had with his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Therefore, if hee would take the businesse to heart, and deale in it effectually, hee doubted not but it would succeed well. The <hi>Bishop</hi> answered soberly, that hee thought himselfe rather happie, than wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to bee an Instrument in such a matter; but would doe his best endeauour. Wherefore the <hi>Bishop</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the King, and giuing account what had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and finding the King more than well disposed in it, gaue the King aduice; first to proceed to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Peace,</hi> and then to goe on with the Treatie of <hi>Marriage,</hi> by degrees. Hereupon a <hi>Peace</hi> was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which was published a little before <hi>Christmasse,</hi> in the Fourteenth yeare of the Kings <hi>Raigne,</hi> to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for both the Kings liues, and the ouer-liuer of them, and a yeare after. In this <hi>Peace</hi> there was an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> contained, that no <hi>English-man</hi> should enter into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and no <hi>Scottish-man</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> without Letters Commendatorie from the Kings of eyther <hi>Nation.</hi> This at the first sight might seeme a meanes to continue a strangenesse betweene the <hi>Nations;</hi> but it was done, to locke in the <hi>Borderers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This yeare there was also borne to the King a third <hi>Sonne,</hi> who was christned by the name of EDMVND, and shortly after dyed. And much about the same time came newes of the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French-King;</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:7276:99"/>
For whom there were celebrated Solemne and Princely <hi>Obsequies.</hi>

            <p>It was not long, but PERKIN (who was made of <hi>Quick-siluer,</hi> which is hard to hold or imprison) began to stirre. For deceiuing his <hi>Keepers,</hi> hee tooke him to his heeles, and made speede to the <hi>Sea-coasts.</hi> But presently all Corners were laid for him, and such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent pursuit and search made, as hee was faine to turne backe, and get him to the House of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> called the <hi>Priorie</hi> of <hi>Shyne,</hi> (which had the priuiledge of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie)</hi> and put himselfe into the hands of the <hi>Prior</hi> of that <hi>Monasterie.</hi> The <hi>Prior</hi> was thought an <hi>Holy Man,</hi> and much reuerenced in those dayes. Hee came to the King, and besought the King for PERKINS life only, leauing him otherwise to the Kings discretion. Many about the King were againe more hot than euer, to haue the King to take him forth, and hang him. But the King (that had an high stomacke, and could not hato any that hee despised) bid, <hi>Take him forth, and set the Knaue in the Sockes.</hi> And so promising the <hi>Prior</hi> his life, hee caused him to bee brought forth. And within two or three daies after, vpon a <hi>Scaffold,</hi> set vp in the <hi>Palace-Court</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> he was fettered and set in the <hi>Stockes,</hi> for the whole day. And the next day after, the like was done by him at the <hi>Crosse</hi> in <hi>Cheape-side,</hi> and in both places he read his <hi>Confession,</hi> of which we made mention before; and was from <hi>Cheap-side</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed and layed vp in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Notwithstanding all this, the King was (as was partly touched before) growne to be such a <hi>Partner</hi> with <hi>Fortune,</hi> as no body could tell what <hi>Actions</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> and what the <hi>Other</hi> owned. For it was beleeued generally, that PERKIN was betrayed, and that this Escape was not without the Kings priuitie, who had him all the time of his Flight in a Line; and that the King did this, to picke a Quarrell to him to put him to death, and to be ridde
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7276:99"/>
of him at once. But this is not probable. For that the same <hi>Instruments</hi> who obserued him in his <hi>Flight,</hi> might haue kept him from getting into <hi>Sanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was ordained, that this <hi>Winding-Iuie</hi> of a PLANTAGENET, should kill the true <hi>Tree</hi> it selfe. For PERKIN, after hee had beene a while in the <hi>Tower,</hi> began to insinuate himselfe into the fauour and kindnesse of his <hi>Keepers,</hi> Seruants to the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> Sir IOHN DIGBIE, being foure in number; STRANGVVAIES, BLEVVET, AST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVOOD, and LONG-ROGER. These <hi>Varlets,</hi> with mountaines of <hi>promises,</hi> hee sought to corrupt, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his <hi>Escape.</hi> But knowing well, that his owne <hi>Fortunes</hi> were made so contemptible, as hee could feede no mans <hi>Hopes</hi> (and by <hi>Hopes</hi> hee must worke, for <hi>Rewards</hi> he had none) he had contriued with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a vast and tragicall Plot; which was, to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Companie EDVVARD PLANTAGENET <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> then Prisoner in the <hi>Tower;</hi> whom the wearie life of a long <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> and the often and renewing Feares of being put to <hi>Death,</hi> had soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take any impression of <hi>Councell</hi> for his <hi>Libertie.</hi> This young <hi>Prince</hi> hee thought these Seruants would looke vpon, though not vpon himselfe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after that by some <hi>Message</hi> by one or two of them, hee had tasted of the <hi>Earles</hi> Consent; it was agreed, that these foure should murder their <hi>Master</hi> the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> secretly in the night, and make their best of such Money and portable Goods of his, as they should finde readie at hand, and get the <hi>Keyes</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and presently let forth PERKIN and the <hi>Earle.</hi> But this <hi>Conspiracie</hi> was reuealed in time, before it could bee executed. And in this againe the Opinion of the Kings great <hi>Wisedome</hi> did surcharge him with a sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Fame,</hi> that PERKIN was but his <hi>Bait,</hi> to entrap the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke.</hi> And in the very Instant while
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7276:100"/>
this <hi>Conspiracy</hi> was in working (as if that also had been the Kings industrie) it was fatall, that there should breake forth a <hi>Connuerfeit Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> a <hi>Cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wainers</hi> Sonne, whose name was RALPH WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORD; a young man, taught and set on by an <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Friar,</hi> called PATRICKE. They both from the parts of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> came forwards into <hi>Kent,</hi> where they did not onely priuily and vnderhand giue out, that this WILFORD was the true <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> but also the <hi>Friar</hi> finding some light Credence in the People, tooke the boldnesse in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> to declare as much, and to incite the People to come in to his Aide. Whereupon they were both presently apprehended, and the young <hi>Fellow</hi> executed, and the <hi>Friar</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to perpetuall <hi>Imprisonment.</hi> This also hapning so opportunely, to represent the danger to the Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, from the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> and thereby to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the Kings seueritie that followed; together with the madnesse of the <hi>Friar,</hi> so vainely and desperately to divulge a <hi>Treason,</hi> before it had gotten any manner of strength; and the sauing of the <hi>Friars</hi> life, which neuerthelesse was (indeed) but the priuiledge of his <hi>Order;</hi> and the <hi>Pitie</hi> in the Common People (which if it runne in a strong <hi>Streame,</hi> doth euer cast vp <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Enuie)</hi> made it generally rather talked, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, that all was but the Kings deuice. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it were, hereupon PERKIN (that had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against <hi>Grace</hi> now the third time) was at the last proceeded with, and by <hi>Commissioners</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer,</hi> arraigned at <hi>Westminster,</hi> vpon diuers <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> committed and perpetrated after his comming on land within this Kingdome (for so the <hi>Iudges</hi> aduised, for that he was a <hi>Forreiner)</hi> and condemned, and a few dayes after executed at <hi>Tiburne.</hi> Where hee did againe openly read his <hi>Comfession,</hi> and take it vpon his <hi>Death</hi> to bee true. This was the end of this little <hi>Cockatrice</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:7276:100"/>
of a King, that was able to destroy those that did not espie him first. It was one of the longest <hi>Playes</hi> of that kind, that hath beene in memorie; and might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haue had another end, if hee had not met with a King both wise, stout, and fortunate.</p>
            <p>As for PERKINS three <hi>Councellors,</hi> they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred themselues <hi>Sanctuarie-men</hi> when their <hi>Master</hi> did. And whether vpon pardon obtained, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance within the <hi>Priuiledge,</hi> they came not to bee proceeded with.</p>
            <p>There was executed with PERKIN the <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>Corke,</hi> and his Sonne, who had beene principall Abettors of his Treasons. And soone after were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise condemned eight other Persons, about the <hi>Tower-Conspiracie,</hi> whereof foure were the <hi>Lieutenants</hi> men. But of those Eight but two were executed. And immediatly after was arraigned before the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> (then for the time <hi>High-Steward</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> the poore <hi>Prince</hi> the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke;</hi> not for the <hi>Attempt</hi> to escape simply (for that was not acted; And besides, the <hi>Imprisonment</hi> not beeing for Treason, the <hi>Escape</hi> by Law could not bee Treason) But for conspiring with PERKIN to raise sedition, and to destroy the King. And the <hi>Earle</hi> confessing the <hi>Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> had <hi>Iudgement,</hi> and was shortly after beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was also the end not onely of this Noble and Commiserable Person EDVVARD the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> eldest Sonne to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarence,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the <hi>Line-Male</hi> of the PLANTAGENETS, which had flourished in great Royaltie and Renowne, from the time of the famous King of <hi>England</hi> King HENRIE the Second. Howbeit it was a <hi>Race</hi> often dipped in their owne <hi>Bloud.</hi> It hath remained since onely transplanted into other <hi>Names,</hi> as well of the <hi>Imperiall Line,</hi> as of other <hi>Noble Houses.</hi> But it was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7276:101"/>
neither guilt of <hi>Crime,</hi> nor reason of <hi>State,</hi> that could quench the <hi>Enuie</hi> that was vpon the King for this <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> So that hee thought good to export it out of the Land, and to lay it vpon his new <hi>Allie</hi> FERDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDO King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> For these two Kings vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing one another at halfe a word, so it was that there were Letters shewed out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereby in the passages concerning the <hi>Treatie</hi> of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> FERDINANDO had written to the King in plaine termes, that hee saw no assurance of his <hi>Succession,</hi> as long as the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi> liued; and that hee was loth to send his <hi>Daughter</hi> to Troubles and Dangers. But hereby, as the king did in some part remoue the Enuie from himselfe; so hee did not obserue, that hee did withall bring a kind of <hi>Malediction</hi> and Infausting vpon the <hi>Marriage,</hi> as an ill <hi>Prognosticke.</hi> Which in euent so farre proued true, as both <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVR enioyed a verie small time after the <hi>Marriage,</hi> and the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE, her selfe (a sad and a religious woman) long after, when King HENRIE the Eight his resolution of a <hi>Diuorce</hi> from her was first made knowne to her, vsed some words; <hi>That shee had not offended: but it was a Iudgment of</hi> GOD, <hi>for that her former Marriage was made in bloud;</hi> meaning that of the <hi>Erale</hi> of <hi>Warwicke</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fifteenth yeare of the king there was a great <hi>Plague,</hi> both in <hi>London</hi> and in diuers parts of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Wherefore the king after often change of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (whether to auoide the danger of the <hi>Sickenesse</hi> or to giue occasion of an <hi>Enteruiew</hi> with the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> or both) sayled ouer with his <hi>Queene</hi> to <hi>Calice.</hi> Vpon his comming thither, the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> sent an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Ambassage</hi> vnto him, aswell to welcome him into those parts, as to let him know, that (if it pleased him) hee would come and doe him reuerence. But it was said withall; That the King might bee pleased to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7276:101"/>
appoint some place, that were out of any <hi>Walled Towne</hi> or Fortresse, for that hee had denied the same vpon like occasion to the <hi>French</hi> king. And though hee said, he made a great difference betweene the two kings, yet hee would bee loth to giue a <hi>President,</hi> that might make it after to bee expected at his hands, by another whom hee trusted lesse. The king accepted of the Courtesie, and admitted of his Excuse, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the place to be at <hi>Saint</hi> PETERS <hi>Church</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Calice.</hi> But withall hee did visit the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> with <hi>Ambassadors</hi> sent from himselfe, which were the <hi>Lord Saint</hi> IOHN, and the <hi>Secretarie;</hi> vnto whom the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> did the honour, as (going to <hi>Masse</hi> at <hi>Saint Omers)</hi> to set the <hi>Lord Saint</hi> IOHN on his right hand, and the <hi>Secretarie</hi> on his left, and so to ride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them to Church The day appointed for the <hi>Enteruiew,</hi> the king went on Horse backe some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from <hi>Saint</hi> PETERS <hi>Church,</hi> to receiue the <hi>Arch-Duke.</hi> And vpon their approaching, the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> made hast to light, and offered to hold the kings <hi>Stirrope</hi> at his alighting; which the king would not permit, but descending from Horse backe, they embraced with great affection, and withdrawing into the <hi>Church</hi> to a place prepared, they had long <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> not onely vpon the Confirmation of former <hi>Treaties,</hi> and the freeing of <hi>Commerce,</hi> but vpon Crosse <hi>Marriages,</hi> to bee had betweene the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> second Sonne, and the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> Daughter; And againe betweene CHARLES the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> Sonne and Heire, and MARIE the <hi>Kings</hi> second Daughter. But these <hi>Blossoms</hi> of vnripe <hi>Marriages,</hi> were but friendly wishes, &amp; the <hi>Aires</hi> of louing <hi>Entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> though one of them came afterwards to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion in <hi>Treatie,</hi> though not in <hi>Effect.</hi> But during the time that the two <hi>Princes</hi> conuersed and communed together in the Suburbs of <hi>Calice,</hi> the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7276:102"/>
on both sides were passing heartie and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, especially on the part of the <hi>Arch-Duke.</hi> Who (besides that hee was a Prince of an excellent good nature) beeing conscious to himselfe, how driely the King had beene vsed by his <hi>Councell</hi> in the matter of PERKIN, did striue by all meanes to recouer it in the Kings Affection. And hauing also his eares continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten with the Councels of his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Father-in-law,</hi> who (in respect of their iealous hatred against the <hi>French</hi> King) did alwayes aduise the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> to anchor himselfe vpon the Amitie of King HENRY of <hi>England;</hi> was glad vpon this occasion, to put in vre and practice their precepts, calling the King <hi>Patron,</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Protector,</hi> (These very words the King repeates; when he certified of the louing behauiour of the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> to the Citie) and what else hee could deuise, to expresse his loue and obseruance to the King. There came also to the King the Gouernour of <hi>Picardie,</hi> and the Bailiffe of <hi>Amiens,</hi> sent from <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King to doe him honour, and to giue him knowledge of his victorie and winning of the <hi>Duchie</hi> of <hi>Millan.</hi> It seemeth the king was well pleased with the honours hee receiued from those parts, while hee was at <hi>Calice.</hi> For hee did himselfe certifie all the Newes and Occurrents of them in euerie particular, from <hi>Calice,</hi> to the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which (no doubt) made no small talke in the <hi>Citie.</hi> For the King, though hee could not entertaine the good will of the <hi>Citizens,</hi> as EDVVARD the fourth did; yet by affabilitie and other Princely Graces, did euer make very much of them, and apply himselfe to them.</p>
            <p>This yeare also did IOHN MORTON, <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterburie, Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> He was a Wise man, and an Eloquent, but in his nature harsh, and haughtie; much accepted by the King, but enuied by the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> and hated of the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7276:102"/>
               <hi>People.</hi> Neither was his name left out of PERKINS <hi>Proclamation</hi> for any good will, but they would not bring him in amongst the Kings <hi>Casting-Counters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee had the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Superscription</hi> vpon him of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in his <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Cardinall.</hi> Hee wanne the King with <hi>Secrecie</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> but chiefly because hee was his olde Seruant in his lesse <hi>Fortunes:</hi> And also for that (in his affections) hee was not without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate malice against the House of YORKE, vnder whom hee had beene in trouble. He was willing also to take <hi>Enuie</hi> from the King, more than the King was willing to put vpon him. For the King cared not for <hi>Subterfuges,</hi> but would stand <hi>Enuy,</hi> and appeare in any thing that was to his mind; which made <hi>Enuie</hi> still grow vpon him more vniuersall, but lesse daring. But in the matter of Exactions, time did after shew, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> in feeding the Kings humour, did rather temper it. He had beene by RICHARD the third committed (as in Custody) to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom hee did secretly incite to reuolt from King RICHARD. But after the <hi>Duke</hi> was engaged, and thought the <hi>Bishop</hi> should haue beene his chiefe <hi>Pilot</hi> in the <hi>Tempest,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> was gotten into the <hi>Cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat,</hi> and fled ouer beyond <hi>Seas.</hi> But whatsoeuer else was in the Man, hee deserueth a most happie Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in that hee was the principall <hi>Meane</hi> of ioyning the two <hi>Roses.</hi> Hee died of great yeares, but of strong health and <hi>Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next yeare, which was the Sixteenth yeare of the King, and the yeare of our <hi>Lord</hi> one thousand fiue hundred, was the yeare of <hi>Iubile</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Pope</hi> ALEXANDER, to saue the Hazzard and Charges of mens Iourneys to <hi>Rome,</hi> thought good to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer those <hi>Graces</hi> by Exchange, to such as would pay a conuenient <hi>Rate,</hi> seeing they could not come to fetch them.

But it appeareth by a Letter which <hi>Cardinall</hi> ADRIAN, the Kings <hi>Pensioner,</hi> wrote to the King from <hi>Rome</hi> some few yeares after, that this was not so. For this <hi>Cardinall,</hi> beeing to perswade <hi>Pope</hi> IVLIVS on the Kings behalfe, to expedite the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Dispensation</hi> for the <hi>Marriage</hi> betweene <hi>Prince</hi> HENRIE and the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE, finding the <hi>Pope</hi> difficile in granting thereof, doth vse it as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Argument concerning the Kings merit towards that <hi>Sea,</hi> that hee had touched none of those <hi>Deniers,</hi> which had beene leuied by PONS in <hi>England.</hi> But that it might the better appeare (for the satisfaction of the Common people) that this was <hi>Consecrate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> the same <hi>Nuntio</hi> brought vnto the King a <hi>Briefe</hi> from the <hi>Pope;</hi> wherein the King was exhorted and summoned to come in Person against the <hi>Turke.</hi> For that the <hi>Pope</hi> (out of the care of an <hi>Uniuersall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> seeing almost vnder his eyes the Successes and Progresses of that great Enemie of the <hi>Faith,</hi> had had in the <hi>Conclane,</hi> and with the Assistance of the <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours</hi> of forraine <hi>Princes,</hi> diuers <hi>Consultations</hi> about an <hi>Holy Warre,</hi> and a Generall Expedition of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes</hi> against the <hi>Turke.</hi> Wherein it was agreed, and thought fit, that the <hi>Hungarians, Polonians,</hi> and <hi>

Power, would saile with a puissant <hi>Nauie</hi> through the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> vnto <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And that to this end, his <hi>Holinesse</hi> had sent <hi>Nuncio's</hi> to all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes;</hi> Aswell for a <hi>Cessation</hi> of all Quarrels and Differences amongst themselues, as for speedie <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations</hi> and <hi>Contributions</hi> of <hi>Forces</hi> and <hi>Treasure</hi> for this <hi>Sacred Enterprize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the King, (who vnderstood well the Court of <hi>Rome)</hi> made an <hi>Answer</hi> rather <hi>Solemne,</hi> than <hi>Serious.</hi> Signifying,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat no</hi> Prince <hi>on Earth should bee more forward and obedient, both by his</hi> Person, <hi>and by all his possible</hi> Forces, <hi>and</hi> Fortunes, <hi>to enter into this sacred</hi> VVarre, <hi>than himselfe. But that the distance of Place was such, as no</hi> Forces <hi>that hee should raise for the Seas, could be leuied or prepared, but with double the charge, and double the time (at the least) that they might be from the other</hi> Princes, <hi>that had their</hi> Territories <hi>nearer adioyning. Besides, that neither the manner of his Ships (hauing no Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) nor the Experience of his</hi> Pilots <hi>and</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners <hi>could bee so apt for those Seas, as theirs. And therefore that his</hi> Holinesse <hi>might doe well, to mooue one of those other Kings, who lay fitter for the purpose, to accompany him by Sea. Whereby both all things would be sooner put in readinesse, and with lesse Charge, and the</hi> Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>and</hi> Diuision <hi>of</hi> Command, <hi>which</hi>

            <p>There were these two last yeares some procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against <hi>Her etiques,</hi> which was rare in this Kings Reigne, and rather by <hi>Penances,</hi> than by <hi>Fire.</hi> The King had (though hee were no good <hi>Schooleman)</hi> the Honour to conuert one of them by Dispute at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie.</hi>

This yeare also, though the king were no more haunted with <hi>Sprites,</hi> for that by the <hi>Sprinckling</hi> partly of <hi>Bloud,</hi> and partly of <hi>Water,</hi> hee had chased them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; yet neuerthelesse hee had certaine <hi>Apparitions,</hi> that troubled him, still shewing themselues from one <hi>Region,</hi> which was the house of <hi>Yorke.</hi> It came so to passe, that the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> Sonne to ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, eldest Sister to king EDVVARD the fourth, by IOHN <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> her second Husband, and Brother to IOHN <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> that was slaine at <hi>Stocke-field,</hi> being of an hastie and Cholericke Disposition, had killed a man in his furie; whereupon the king gaue him his <hi>Pardon.</hi> But either willing to leaue a <hi>Cloud</hi> vpon him, or the better to make him feele his <hi>Grace,</hi> produced him openly to plead his <hi>Pardon.</hi> This wrought in the <hi>Earle,</hi> as in a haughtie stomacke it vseth to doe; for the <hi>Ignominie</hi> printed dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than the <hi>Grace.</hi> Wherefore hee beeing discontent, fled secretly into <hi>Flanders,</hi> vnto his <hi>Aunt</hi> the <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> The king startled at it. But being taught by Troubles, to vse fare and timely <hi>Remedies,</hi> wrought so with him by Messages, (The <hi>Ladie</hi> MARGARET also growing by often failing in her <hi>Alchymie,</hi> wearie of her Experiments, and partly being a little sweetned, for that the king had not touched her name in the Confession of PERKIN) that hee came ouer againe vpon good termes, and was reconciled to the king.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the next yeare, beeing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteenth of the king, the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE, fourth Daughter of FERDINANDO and ISA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELLA, <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> arriued in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the second of <hi>October</hi> and was married to <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVR in PAVLES, the foureteenth of <hi>Nouember</hi> following. The <hi>Prince</hi> being then about fifteene yeares of age, and the <hi>Ladie</hi> about eighteene. The manner of her receiuing, the manner
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7276:105"/>
of her Entrie into <hi>London,</hi> and the Celebritie of the <hi>Marriage</hi> were performed with great and true Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, in regard of <hi>Cost, Shew,</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> The chiefe man that tooke the care was <hi>Bishop</hi> Fox; who was not onely a graue <hi>Councellor</hi> for Warre or Peace, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a good <hi>Surueyour</hi> of Workes, and a good <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and any thing else that was fit for the <hi>Actiue</hi> part, belonging to the seruice of <hi>Court,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> of a great King. This <hi>Marriage</hi> was almost seuen yeares in <hi>Treatie;</hi> which was in part caused by the tender yeares of the <hi>Marriage-couple,</hi> especially of the <hi>Prince.</hi> But the true reason was, that these two <hi>Princes,</hi> being <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of great Policie and profound Iudgement, stood a great time looking one vpon anothers <hi>Fortunes,</hi> how they would goe; knowing well that in the meane time, the verie <hi>Treatie</hi> it selfe gaue abroad in the World a Reputation of a straite Coniunction, and Amitie betweene them; which serued on both sides to many purposes, that their seuerall Affaires requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and yet they continued still free. But in the end when the <hi>Fortunes</hi> of both the <hi>Princes</hi> did grow euerie day more and more prosperous and assured, and that looking all about them, they saw no better Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they shut it vp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Marriage</hi> Monie the <hi>Princesse</hi> brought (which was turned ouer to the King by Act of <hi>Renunciation)</hi> was two hundred thousand <hi>Ducats</hi> Whereof one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand were payable ten dayes after the <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization,</hi> and the other hundred thousand at two pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Annuall; but part of it to bee in <hi>Iewels</hi> and <hi>Plate,</hi> and a due course set downe to haue them iustly and indifferently prized. The <hi>Ioynture</hi> or <hi>Aduancement</hi> of the <hi>Lady,</hi> was the third part of the <hi>Principality</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of the <hi>Dukedome</hi> of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and of the <hi>Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Chester;</hi> to be after set forth in seueraltie. And in case shee came to bee <hi>Queeene</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> her <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:7276:105"/>
was left indefinite, but thus; That it should bee as great, as euer any former <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had.</p>
            <p>In all the <hi>Deuises</hi> and <hi>Conceits</hi> of the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of this <hi>Marriage,</hi> there was a great deale of <hi>Astronomie.</hi> The <hi>Ladie</hi> beeing resembled to HESPERVS, and the <hi>Prince</hi> to ARCTVRVS, and the old King AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHONSVS (that was the greatest <hi>Astronomer</hi> of Kings, and was <hi>Ancestor</hi> to the <hi>Ladie)</hi> was brought in to bee the <hi>Fortune-teller</hi> of the <hi>Match.</hi> And whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer had those <hi>Toyes</hi> in Compiling, they were not altogether <hi>Pedanticall.</hi> But you may bee sure that King ARTHVR, the <hi>Britton,</hi> and the descent of the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE from the House of LANCAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, was in no wise forgotten. But (as it should seem) it is not good to fetch <hi>Fortunes</hi> from the <hi>Starres.</hi> For this young <hi>Prince</hi> (that drew vpon him at that time, not onely the Hopes and Affections of his <hi>Countrie,</hi> but the Eyes and Expectation of <hi>Forreiners)</hi> after a few Moneths, in the beginning of <hi>Aprill,</hi> deceased at <hi>Ludlow Castle,</hi> where he was sent to keepe his <hi>Resiance</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> as <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> Of this <hi>Prince,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect hee died so young, and by reason of his Fathers manner of Education, that did cast no great <hi>Lustre</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Children,</hi> there is little particular Memorie. Onely thus much remaineth, that hee was very stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and learned, beyond his yeares, and beyond the Custome of great <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a Doubt ripped vp in the times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the <hi>Diuorce</hi> of King HENRIE the Eighth from the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE did so much busie the world, whether ARTHVR was bedded with his <hi>Ladie</hi> or no, whereby that matter in fact (of <hi>Carnall Knowledge)</hi> might bee made part of the <hi>Case.</hi> And it is true, that the <hi>Ladie</hi> her selfe denied it, or atleast her <hi>Counsell</hi> stood vpon it, and would not blaunch that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7276:106"/>
Aduantage, although the <hi>Plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Popes power</hi> of Dispensing was the maine Question. And this Doubt was kept long open, in respect of the two <hi>Queenes</hi> that succeeded MARIE and ELIZABETH, whose <hi>Legitimations</hi> were incompatible one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though their <hi>Succession</hi> was settled by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> And the times that fauoured <hi>Queene</hi> MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES <hi>Legitimation</hi> would haue it beleeued, that there was no <hi>Carnall Knowledge</hi> betweene ARTHVR and KATHERINE. Not that they would seeme to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the <hi>Popes</hi> absolute power, to dispence euen in that <hi>Case;</hi> but onely in point of honour, and to make the <hi>Case</hi> more fauourable and smooth. And the Times that fauoured <hi>Queene</hi> ELIZABETHS <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation</hi> (which were the longer, and the latter) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrarie. So much there remayneth in Memorie, that it was halfe a yeares time betweene the <hi>Creation</hi> of HENRY <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVRS death; which was construed to bee, for to expect a full time, whereby it might appeare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE were with <hi>Child</hi> by <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVR, or no. Againe, the <hi>Ladie</hi> her selfe procured a <hi>Bull,</hi> for the better Corroboration of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> with a Clause of <hi>(vel forsan cognitam)</hi> which was not in the first <hi>Bull.</hi> There was giuen in Euidence also, when the cause of the <hi>Diuorce</hi> was handled, a pleasant passage, which was; That in a Morning <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVR, vpon his vp-rising from Bed with her, called for drinke, which hee was not accustomed to doe, and finding the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of his Chamber that brought him the drinke to smile at it, and to note it, hee said merrily to him; That hee had been in the middest of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which was an hot <hi>Region,</hi> and his Iourney had made him drie, and that if the other had beene in so hot a <hi>Clime,</hi> hee would haue been drier than hee. Besides, the <hi>Prince</hi> was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7276:106"/>
vpon the point of Sixteene yeares of Age when hee died, and forward, and able in Bodie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Februarie</hi> following, HENRY <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Yorke</hi> was created <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Flint.</hi> For the <hi>Dukedome</hi> of <hi>Cornewall</hi> deuolued to him by <hi>Statute.</hi> The King also beeing fast handed, and loath to part with a second <hi>Dowrie,</hi> but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affectionate both by his Nature, and out of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Considerations to continue the Alliance with <hi>Spaine,</hi> preuailed with the <hi>Prince</hi> (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Reluctation, such as could bee in those yeares, for hee was not twelue yeares of <hi>Age)</hi> to bee contracted with the <hi>Princesse</hi> KATHERINE. The secret <hi>Prouidence</hi> of GOD ordaining that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> to bee the Occasion of great Euents and Changes.</p>
            <p>The same yeare were the <hi>Espousals</hi> of IAMES King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the <hi>Ladie</hi> MARGARET, the Kings eldest Daughter; which was done by <hi>Proxie,</hi> and published at PAVLES <hi>Crosse,</hi> the fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> and <hi>Te Deum</hi> solemnly sung. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that the <hi>Ioy</hi> of the <hi>Citie</hi> thereupon shewed, by Ringing of <hi>Bells,</hi> and <hi>Bon-fires,</hi> and such other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> of the People, was more than could be expected, in a Case of so great and fresh Enmitie betweene the <hi>Nations;</hi> especially in <hi>London,</hi> which was farre enough off from feeling any of the former calamities of the <hi>Warre.</hi> And therefore might bee truely attributed to a <hi>Secret Instinct</hi> and <hi>Inspiring</hi> (which many times run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not onely in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> but in the <hi>Pulse</hi> and <hi>Veines</hi> of People) touching the happinesse thereby to ensue in time to come. This <hi>Marriage</hi> was in <hi>August</hi> following consummate at <hi>Edenborough.</hi> The King bringing his Daughter as farre as <hi>Colli-Weston</hi> on the way, and then consigning her to the Attendance of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> who with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7276:107"/>
a great Troupe of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> brought her into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> her Husband.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Marriage</hi> had beene in <hi>Treatie</hi> by the space of almost three yeares, from the time that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> did first open his mind to <hi>Bishop</hi> FOX. The Summe giuen in <hi>Marriage</hi> by the King, was ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds. And the <hi>Iointure</hi> and <hi>Aduancement</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was two Thousand pounds a yeare, after King IAMES his Death, and one Thousand pounds a yeare in present, for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> Allowance or Maintenance. This to be set forth in <hi>Lands,</hi> of the best and most certaine Reuenue. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Treatie,</hi> it is reported, that the King remitted the matter to his <hi>Counsell;</hi> And that some of the <hi>Table</hi> in the Freedome of <hi>Counsellors</hi> (the King beeing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) did put the <hi>Case;</hi> that if GOD should take the Kings two <hi>Sonnes</hi> without <hi>Issue,</hi> that then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England</hi> would fall to the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which might preiudice the <hi>Monarchie</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Whereunto the King himselfe replied; That if that should bee, <hi>Scotland</hi> would bee but an <hi>Accession</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and not <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for that the <hi>Greater</hi> would draw the lesse. And that it was a safer <hi>Vnion</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> than that of <hi>France.</hi> This passed as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> and silenced those that moued the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same yeare was fatall, as well for <hi>Deaths,</hi> as <hi>Marriages,</hi> and that with equall temper. For the <hi>Ioyes</hi> and <hi>Feasts</hi> of the two <hi>Marriages,</hi> were compensed with the <hi>Mournings,</hi> and <hi>Funerals</hi> of <hi>Prince</hi> ARTHVR (of whom wee haue spoken) and of <hi>Queene</hi> ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, who died in Child-bed in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the <hi>Child</hi> liued not long after. There dyed also that yeare <hi>Sir</hi> REGINOLD BRAY, who was noted to haue had with the King the greatest <hi>Freedome</hi> of any <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor;</hi> but it was but a <hi>Freedome,</hi> the better to set off
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7276:107"/>
               <hi>Flatterie.</hi> Yet hee bare more than his iust part of <hi>Enuie,</hi> for the <hi>Exactions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time the Kings Estate was verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous, Secured by the Amitie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> strengthened by that of <hi>Spaine,</hi> cherished by that of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> all Domesticke Troubles quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and all Noyse of <hi>Warre</hi> (like a <hi>Thunder</hi> afarre off) going vpon <hi>Italie.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Nature,</hi> which many times is happily contayned, and refrained by some Bands of <hi>Fortune,</hi> beganne to take place in the King; carrying (as with a strong <hi>Tide)</hi> his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Thoughts vnto the gathering and heaping vp of <hi>Treasure.</hi> And as Kings doe more easily find In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for their <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Humour,</hi> than for their <hi>Seruice</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> Hee had gotten for his purpose, or beyond his purpose, two Instruments, EMPSON and DVDLEY, (whom the people esteemed as his <hi>Horse-Leeches</hi> and <hi>Shearers)</hi> bold men, and carelesse of <hi>Fame,</hi> and that tooke <hi>Toll</hi> of their Masters <hi>Grist.</hi> DVD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY was of a good Family, Eloquent, and one that could put <hi>Hatefull Businesse</hi> into good <hi>Language.</hi> But EMPSON, that was the Sonne of a <hi>Sieue-maker,</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed alwayes vpon the <hi>Deede done,</hi> putting off all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects whatsoeuer. These two Persons beeing <hi>Lawyers</hi> in <hi>Science,</hi> and <hi>Priuie Councellors</hi> in <hi>Authoritie</hi> (as <hi>the Corruption of the best things is the worst)</hi> turned <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> into <hi>Worme-wood</hi> and <hi>Rapine.</hi> For first, their manner was to cause diuers <hi>Subiects</hi> to bee indicted of sundrie Crimes, and so farre forth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in forme of <hi>Law;</hi> But when the <hi>Bils</hi> were found, then presently to commit them. And neuerthelesse not to produce them to any reasonable time to their <hi>Answer,</hi> but to suffer them to languish long in <hi>Prison,</hi> and by sundrie artificiall <hi>Deuices</hi> and <hi>Terrours,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from them great <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Ransomes,</hi> which they termed <hi>Compositions</hi> and <hi>Mitigations.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:7276:108"/>
Neither did they (towards the end) obserue so much as the <hi>Halfe-face</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> in proceeding by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment;</hi> but sent forth their <hi>Precepts</hi> to attache men, and conuent them before themselues and some others, at their priuate Houses, in a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Commission,</hi> and there vsed to shuffle vp a <hi>Summarie Proceeding</hi> by <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> without Tryall of <hi>Iurie;</hi> assuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues there, to deale both in <hi>Pleas</hi> of the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and <hi>Controuersies Ciuill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did they also vse to enthrall and charge the <hi>Subiects</hi> Lands with <hi>Tenures in Capite,</hi> by finding <hi>False Offices,</hi> and thereby to worke vpon them for <hi>Ward-ships, Liueries, Primier Seisines,</hi> and <hi>Alienations,</hi> (being the fruites of those <hi>Tenures)</hi> refusing vpon diuers Pretexts and Delayes, to admit men to trauerse those <hi>False Offices,</hi> according to the <hi>Law.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Kings Wards</hi> after they had accomplished their full Age, could not bee suffered to haue <hi>Liuerie</hi> of their <hi>Lands,</hi> without paying excessiue <hi>Fines,</hi> farre exceeding all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Rates. They did also vexe men with <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Intrusion</hi> vpon scarce colourable <hi>Titles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen men were <hi>Out-lawed</hi> in <hi>Personall Actions,</hi> they would not permit them to purchase their <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Pardon,</hi> except they paid great and intolerable summes; standing vpon the strict Point of <hi>Law,</hi> which vpon <hi>Out-lawries</hi> giueth <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of <hi>Goods.</hi> Nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all <hi>Law</hi> and Colour, they maintained, the King ought to haue the halfe of mens <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Rents,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the space of full two yeares, for a <hi>Paine</hi> in <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Out-lawrie.</hi> They would also ruffle with <hi>Iurors,</hi> and inforce them to finde as they would direct, and (if they did not) Conuent them, Imprison them, and Fine them.</p>
            <p>These and many other Courses, fitter to be buried than repeated, they had of <hi>Preying</hi> vpon the <hi>People;</hi> both like <hi>Tame Hawkes</hi> for their Master, and like <hi>Wild</hi>

               <hi>Hawkes</hi> for themselues; in so much as they grew to great Riches and Substance. But their principall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was vpon <hi>Penall Lawes,</hi> wherein they spared none, great nor small; nor considered whether the <hi>Law</hi> were possible, or impossible, in <hi>Vse</hi> or <hi>Obsolete.</hi> But raked ouer all old and new <hi>Statutes,</hi> though many of them were made with intention rather of <hi>Terrour,</hi> than of <hi>Rigour;</hi> hauing euer a Rabble of <hi>Promoters, Questmongers,</hi> and leading <hi>Iurors</hi> at their Command, so as they could haue any thing found either for <hi>Fact,</hi> or <hi>Valuation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remayneth to this Day a <hi>Report,</hi> that the King was on a time entertained by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (that was his principall <hi>Seruant,</hi> both for <hi>Warre</hi> and <hi>Peace)</hi> nobly and sumptuously, at his <hi>Castle</hi> at <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham.</hi> And at the Kings going away, the <hi>Earles</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants stood (in a seemely manner) in their <hi>Liuerie Coats,</hi> with <hi>Cognisances,</hi> ranged on both sides, and made the King a <hi>Lane.</hi> The King called the <hi>Earle</hi> to him, and said; <hi>My Lord, I have heard much of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalitie, but I see it is greater than the speech. These hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Gentlemen and Teomen, which I see on both sides of me, are sure your Meniall Seruants.</hi> The <hi>Earle</hi> smiled, and said; <hi>It may please your Grace, that were not for mine ease. They are most of them my Retainers, that are come to doe me seruice at such a time as this, and chiefly to see your Grace.</hi> The King started a little, and said; <hi>By my faith (my Lord) I thanke you for my good Cheare, but I may not endure to haue my Lawes broken in my sight. My At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney must speake with you.</hi> And it is part of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> that the <hi>Earle</hi> compounded for no lesse than fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand Markes. And to shew further the kings extreme Diligence; I doe remember to haue seene long since a Booke of Accompt of EMPSONS, that had the kings hand almost to euery Leafe, by way of <hi>Signing,</hi> and was in some places <hi>Postilled</hi> in the

               <hi>Margent</hi> with the Kings hand likewise, where was this <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Item, <hi>receiued of such a one, fiue Markes, for the Pardon to be procured; and if the Pardon doe not passe, the Monie to bee repaied; Except the Partie bee some other-wayes satisfied.</hi>

            <p>Which I doe the rather mention, because it shewes in the king a <hi>Nearenesse,</hi> but yet with a kind of <hi>Iustnesse.</hi> So these little <hi>Sands</hi> and <hi>Graines</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Siluer</hi> (as it seemeth) helped not a little to make vp the great <hi>Heape</hi> and <hi>Banke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But meanewhile (to keepe the king awake) the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suffolke</hi> hauing beene too gay at <hi>Prince</hi> AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THVRS <hi>Marriage,</hi> and sunke himselfe deepe in Debt, had yet once more a mind to bee a <hi>Knight-Errant,</hi> and to seeke <hi>Aduentures</hi> in Forraine parts. And taking his Brother with him, fled againe into <hi>Flanders.</hi> That (no doubt) which gaue him Confidence, was the great <hi>Murmur</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> against the <hi>Kings Gouernement.</hi> And beeing a <hi>Man</hi> of a light and rash <hi>Spirit,</hi> he thought euerie <hi>Vapour</hi> would bee a <hi>Tempest.</hi> Neither wanted hee some Partie within the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> For the <hi>Murmur</hi> of <hi>People</hi> awakes the <hi>Discontents</hi> of <hi>Nobles,</hi> and againe, that calleth vp commonly some <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Sedition.</hi> The King resorting to his wonted and tried Arts, caused Sir ROBERT CVRSON, <hi>Captaine</hi> of the <hi>Castle</hi> at <hi>Hammes</hi> (beeing at that time beyond Sea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lesse likely to bee wrought vpon by the king) to flie from his <hi>Charge,</hi> and to faine himselfe a seruant of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7276:109"/>
the <hi>Earles.</hi> This <hi>Knight,</hi> hauing insinuated himselfe into the Secrets of the <hi>Earle,</hi> and finding by him vpon whom chiefly hee had either <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Hold,</hi> aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King thereof in great secrecie. But neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse maintained his owne Credit and inward trust with the <hi>Earle.</hi> Vpon whose Aduertisements, the King attached WILLIAM COVRTNEY, <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> his <hi>Brother-in-Law,</hi> married to the <hi>Ladie</hi> KATHERINE, daughter to King EDVVARD the Fourth; WILLIAM DE-LA-POLE, Brother to the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suffolke;</hi> Sir IAMES TIRREL, and Sir IOHN WINDHAM, and some other meaner Persons, and committed them to Custodie. GEORGE, Lord A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERGAVENNIE, and Sir THOMAS GREENE, were at the same time apprehended; but as vpon lesse Suspition, so in a freer Restraint, and were soone after deliuered. The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> being interessed in the bloud of <hi>Yorke,</hi> that was rather <hi>Feared</hi> than <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> yet as <hi>One,</hi> that might bee the <hi>Obiect</hi> of others <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Designes,</hi> remained Prisoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> during the Kings life. WILLIAAM DE-LA-POLE, was also long restrained, though not so straitly. But for Sir IAMES TIRREL (against whom the <hi>Bloud</hi> of rhe <hi>Innocent Princes,</hi> EDVVARD the Fifth, and his Brother, did still crie from vnder the <hi>Altar)</hi> and Sir IOHN WINDHAM, and the other meaner ones, they were attainted and executed; The two <hi>Knights</hi> beheaded. Neuerthelesse, to confirme the Credit of CVRSON (who belike had not yet done all his <hi>Feates</hi> of <hi>Actiuitie)</hi> there was published at PAVLES <hi>Crosse,</hi> about the time of the said Executions, the <hi>Popes Bull</hi> of <hi>Excommunication</hi> and <hi>Curse,</hi> against the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> and Sir ROBERT CVRSON, &amp; some others by name, and likewise in generall against all the <hi>Abettors</hi> of the said <hi>Earle.</hi> Wherein it must be confessed, that <hi>Heauen</hi> was made too much to bow to <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:7276:110"/>
to <hi>Policie.</hi> But soone after, CVRSON (when hee saw time) returned into <hi>England,</hi> and withall into wonted <hi>Fauour</hi> with the King, but worse <hi>Fame</hi> with the <hi>People.</hi> Vpon whose returne the <hi>Earle</hi> was much dismayed, and seeing himselfe destitute of hopes (the <hi>Ladie</hi> MARGARET also by tract of <hi>Time,</hi> and bad <hi>Successe,</hi> being now become coole in those Attempts) after some wandering in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> and certaine little <hi>Proiects,</hi> no better than <hi>Squibbs</hi> of an <hi>Exiled man,</hi> being tired out, retired againe into the Protection of the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> PHILIP in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who by the death of ISABELLA was at that time King of <hi>Castile,</hi> in the right of IOAN his Wife.</p>
            <p>This yeare (beeing the Nineteenth of his Raigne) the King called his <hi>Parliament.</hi> Wherein a man may easily guesse, how absolute the King tooke himselfe to bee with his <hi>Parliament,</hi> when DVDLEY that was so hatefull, was made <hi>Speaker</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> In this <hi>Parliament,</hi> there were not made any <hi>Statutes</hi> memorable, touching publike <hi>Gouernement.</hi> But those that were, had still the <hi>Stampe</hi> of the Kings <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Policie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Statute</hi> made for the disanulling of all <hi>Patents</hi> of <hi>Lease,</hi> or <hi>Grant,</hi> to such as came not vpon lawfull <hi>Summons,</hi> to serue the King in his <hi>Warres,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Enemies</hi> or <hi>Rebels,</hi> or that should depart without the kings license; With an Exception of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Persons of the <hi>Long-robe.</hi> Prouiding neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, That they should haue the kings Wages, from their <hi>House,</hi> till their <hi>Returne</hi> home againe. There had beene the like made before for <hi>Offices,</hi> and by thin <hi>Statute</hi> it was extended to <hi>Lands.</hi> But a man may easily see by many <hi>Statutes</hi> made in this kings time, that the king thought it safest, to assist <hi>Martiall Law,</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>Statute</hi> was made, prohibiting the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7276:110"/>
in of <hi>Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Silke</hi> wrought by it selfe, or mixt with any other <hi>Threed.</hi> But it was not of <hi>Stuffes</hi> of whole piece (for that the Realme had of them no <hi>Manufacture</hi> in vse at that time) but of <hi>Knit-Silke,</hi> or <hi>Texture</hi> of <hi>Silke;</hi> as <hi>Ribbands, Laces, Caules, Points,</hi> and <hi>Girdles,</hi> &amp;c. which the People of <hi>England</hi> could then well skill to make. This <hi>Law</hi> pointed at a true <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; That where forraine materials are but Superfluities, forraine Manufactures should bee prohibited.</hi> For that will either banish the <hi>Superfluitie,</hi> or gaine the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Law</hi> also of <hi>Resumption</hi> of <hi>Patents</hi> of <hi>Gaoles,</hi> and the <hi>Reannexing</hi> of them to the <hi>Sherifwicks; Priuiledged Officers</hi> beeing no lesse an Interruption of <hi>Iustice,</hi> than <hi>priuiledged Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was likewise a <hi>Law</hi> to restraine the <hi>By-lawes</hi> or Ordinances of <hi>Corporations,</hi> which many times were against the <hi>Prerogatiue</hi> of the King, the <hi>Common-law</hi> of the <hi>Realme,</hi> and the <hi>Libertie</hi> of the <hi>Subiect,</hi> beeing <hi>Fraternities</hi> in Euill. It was therefore <hi>Prouided,</hi> that they should not bee put in Execution, without the Allowance of the <hi>Chancellor, Treasurer,</hi> and the two <hi>Chiefe-Iustices,</hi> or three of them, or of the two <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Circuit</hi> where the <hi>Corporation</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Law</hi> was (in effect) to bring in the <hi>Siluer</hi> of the <hi>Realme</hi> to the <hi>Mint,</hi> in making all clipped, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, or impayred <hi>Coines</hi> of <hi>Siluer,</hi> not to bee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in payments; without giuing any Remedie of weight, but with an exception onely of a reasonable wearing, which was as nothing in respect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie; and so (vpon the matter) to set the <hi>Mint</hi> on worke, and to giue way to <hi>New Coines</hi> of <hi>Siluer,</hi> which should bee then minted.</p>
            <p>There likwise was a long <hi>Statute</hi> against <hi>Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,</hi> wherein two things may bee noted; The one the <hi>Dislike</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> had of <hi>Gaoling</hi> of them, as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7276:111"/>
that which was chargeable, pesterous, and of no open Example. The other, That in the <hi>Statutes</hi> of this Kings time, (for this of the Nineteenth yeare is not the onely <hi>Statute</hi> of that kind) there are euer cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, the <hi>punishment</hi> of <hi>Uagabonds,</hi> and the <hi>Forbidding</hi> of <hi>Dice,</hi> and <hi>Cards,</hi> and vnlawfull <hi>Games</hi> vnto Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and meane people, and the putting downe and suppressing of <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> as <hi>Strings</hi> of one <hi>Roote</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and as if the One were vnprofitable, without the Other.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Retainers,</hi> there passed scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Parliament</hi> in this time without a <hi>Law</hi> against them, The King euer hauing an Eye to <hi>Might,</hi> and <hi>Multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was granted also that <hi>Parliamemt</hi> a <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> both for the <hi>Temporaltie</hi> and the <hi>Clergie.</hi> And yet neuerthelesse, ere the yeare expired, there went out <hi>Commissions</hi> for a generall <hi>Beneuolence,</hi> though there were no <hi>Warres;</hi> no <hi>Feares.</hi> The same yeare the <hi>Citty</hi> gaue fiue thousand Markes, for <hi>Confirmation</hi> of their <hi>Liberties;</hi> A thing fitter for the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of Kings Raignes, than the latter Ends. Neither was it a small matter, that the <hi>Mint</hi> gained vpon the late <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> by the <hi>Recoinage</hi> of <hi>Groats</hi> and <hi>Halfe-groats,</hi> now <hi>Twelue-pences</hi> and <hi>Six-pences.</hi> As for EMPSON and DVDLEY'S <hi>Mills,</hi> they did grinde more than euer. So that it was a strange thing, to see what <hi>Golden Showres</hi> powred downe vpon the Kings <hi>Treasurie</hi> at once. The last paiments of the <hi>Marriage-money</hi> from <hi>Spaine;</hi> The <hi>Subsidie;</hi> The <hi>Beneuolence;</hi> The <hi>Recoinage;</hi> The <hi>Redemption</hi> of the <hi>Cities Liberties;</hi> The <hi>Casualties.</hi> And this is the more to bee marueiled at, because the King had then no Occasions at all of <hi>Warres</hi> or <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> Hee had now but one <hi>Sonne,</hi> and one <hi>Daughter</hi> vnbestowed. Hee was <hi>Wise;</hi> Hee was of an <hi>High Mind;</hi> Hee needed not to make <hi>Riches</hi> his <hi>Glorie.</hi> Hee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7276:111"/>
did excell in so many things else; saue that certainely <hi>Auarice</hi> doth euer finde in it selfe matter of <hi>Ambition.</hi> Belike hee thought to leaue his <hi>Sonne</hi> such a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and such a <hi>Masse</hi> of <hi>Treasure,</hi> as hee might choose his <hi>Greatnesse</hi> where hee would.</p>
            <p>This yeare was also kept the <hi>Serieants Feast,</hi> which was the second <hi>Call</hi> in this Kings <hi>Dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time ISABELLA, <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> deceased; a right Noble <hi>Ladie,</hi> and an Honour to her <hi>Sexe,</hi> and Times, and the <hi>Corner-stone</hi> of the <hi>Greatnesse</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that hath followed. This Accident the King tooke not for <hi>Newes</hi> at large, but thought it had a great <hi>Relation</hi> to his owne <hi>Affaires;</hi> especially in two points. The One, for <hi>Example;</hi> the Other for <hi>Consequence.</hi> First, hee conceiued that the <hi>Case</hi> of FERDINANDO of <hi>Arragon,</hi> after the death of <hi>Queene</hi> ISABELLA, was his owne <hi>Case,</hi> after the death of his owne <hi>Queene:</hi> and the <hi>Case</hi> of IOAN the <hi>Heire</hi> vnto <hi>Castile,</hi> was the <hi>Case</hi> of his owne Sonne <hi>Prince</hi> HENRY. For if both of the Kings had their <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> in the right of their <hi>Wiues,</hi> they descended to the <hi>Heires,</hi> and did not accrew to the <hi>Husbands.</hi> And although his owne <hi>Case</hi> had both <hi>Steele</hi> and <hi>Parchment,</hi> more than the other (that is to say, a <hi>Conquest</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> and an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament)</hi> yet notwithstanding, that Naturall <hi>Title</hi> of Descent in <hi>Bloud,</hi> did (in the imagination euen of a Wise-man) breed a <hi>Doubt,</hi> that the other two were not safe nor sufficient. Wherefore he was wonderfull diligent, to inquire and obserue what became of the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> in holding and continuing the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile.</hi> And whether he did hold it in his owne <hi>Right,</hi> or as <hi>Administrator</hi> to his <hi>Daughter;</hi> And whether he were like to hold it in <hi>Fact,</hi> or to bee put out by his <hi>Sonne-in-Law.</hi> Secondly, hee did reuolue in his minde, that the Stateof <hi>Christendome</hi> might by this late Accident haue a turne. For whereas before time Himselfe, with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7276:112"/>
the Coniunction of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Castile</hi> (which then was one) and the Amitie of MAXIMILIAN and PHILIP his Sonne the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> was farre too strong a <hi>Partie</hi> for <hi>France;</hi> hee beganne to feare, that now the <hi>French</hi> King (who had great <hi>Interest</hi> in the Affections of PHILIP the young King of <hi>Castile)</hi> and PHILIP himselfe, now king of <hi>Castile,</hi> (who was in ill Termes with his <hi>Father-in-law</hi> about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Gouernment of <hi>Castile)</hi> And thirdly MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN, PHILIPS <hi>Father</hi> (who was euer variable, and vpon whom the surest Aime that could bee taken, was that hee would not be long, as hee had beene last before) would, all three being potent <hi>Princes,</hi> enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some strait <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Confederation</hi> amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Whereby though hee should not be endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet hee should be left to the poore Amitie of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon.</hi> And whereas he had beene heretofore a kind of <hi>Arbiter</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> he should now goe lesse, and bee ouer-topped by so great a <hi>Coniunction.</hi> Hee had also (as it seemes) an inclination to marrie, and bethought himselfe of some fit Conditions abroad. And amongst others, hee had heard of the <hi>Beautie</hi> and vertuous <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour</hi> of the young <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Widdow of FERDINANDO the younger, being then of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronall</hi> yeares of seuen and twentie. By whose <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> he thought that the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> (hauing beene a <hi>Gole</hi> for a time betweene the king of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> and the <hi>French King,</hi> and being but newly setled) might in some part be <hi>Deposited</hi> in his hands, who was so able to keepe the <hi>Stakes.</hi> Therefore hee sent in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage</hi> or <hi>Message</hi> three Confident Persons; FRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIS MARSIN, IAMES BRAY-BROOKE, and IOHN STILE, vpon two seuerall <hi>Inquisitions</hi> rather than <hi>Negotiations.</hi> The One, touching the Person and Condition of the young Queene of <hi>Naples.</hi> The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching all particulars of <hi>Estate,</hi> that concerned
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7276:112"/>
the <hi>Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Intentions</hi> of FERDINANDO. And because they may obserue best, who themselues are obserued least, hee sent them vnder <hi>Colourable Pretexts;</hi> giuing them Letters of Kindnesse and Complement from KATHERINE the <hi>Princesse,</hi> to her Aunt, and Neece, the Olde and Young Queene of <hi>Naples,</hi> and deliuering to them also a <hi>Booke</hi> of new <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> which notwithstanding it had beene deliuered vnto <hi>Doctor de</hi> PVEBLA, the <hi>Leigier Ambassadour</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> to be sent; yet for that the King had beene long without hearing from <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee thought good those <hi>Messengers,</hi> when they had beene with the two Queenes, should likewise passe on to the <hi>Court</hi> of FERDINANDO, and take a Copie of the <hi>Booke</hi> with them. The <hi>Instructions</hi> touching the Queene of <hi>Naples</hi> were so curious and exquisite, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Articles</hi> whereby to direct a <hi>Suruey,</hi> or framing a <hi>Particular</hi> of her <hi>Person,</hi> for Complexion, Fauour, Feature, Stature, Health, Age, Customes, Behauiour, Conditions, and Estate, as if the King had beene young, a Man would haue iudged him to bee <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;</hi> but being ancient, it ought to be interpreted, that sure he was verie <hi>Chaste,</hi> for that hee meant to finde all things in one Woman, and so to settle his <hi>Affections,</hi> without ranging But in this <hi>Match</hi> hee was soone cooled, when hee heard from his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> that this young Queene had had a goodly <hi>Ioynture</hi> in the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> well answered during the time of her Vnckle FREDERICKE, yea, and during the time of LEVVIS the <hi>French King,</hi> in whose <hi>Diuision</hi> her Reuenue fell; But since the time that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was in FERDINANDO'S hands, all was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the <hi>Armie,</hi> and <hi>Garrisons</hi> there, and shee receiued only a <hi>Pension</hi> or <hi>Exhibition</hi> out of his Coffers.</p>
            <p>The other part of the <hi>Inquirie</hi> had a graue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7276:113"/>
Returne, informing the King at full of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State of King FERDINANDO. By this report it appeared to the King, that FERDINANDO did continue the Gouernment of <hi>Castile</hi> as <hi>Administrator</hi> vnto his Daughter IOAN, by the Title of Queene ISABELLA'S <hi>Will,</hi> and partly by the Custome of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as he pretended. And that all <hi>Mandates</hi> and <hi>Grants</hi> were expedited in the name of IOAN his Daughter, and himselfe as <hi>Administrator,</hi> without mention of PHILIP, her Husband. And that king FERDINANDO, howsoeuer hee did dismisse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of the Name of King of <hi>Castile,</hi> yet meant to hold the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> without Accompt, and in abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Command.</p>
            <p>It appeareth also, that hee flattered himselfe with hopes, that king PHILIP would permit vnto him the Gouernement of <hi>Castile</hi> during his life; which hee had layed his plot to worke him vnto, both by some <hi>Councellors</hi> of his about him, which FERDINANDO had at his deuotion, and chiefly by Promise, that in case PHILIP gaue not way vnto it, hee would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie some young <hi>Ladie,</hi> whereby to put him by the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> in case hee should haue a Sonne. And lastly, by representing vnto him that the Gouernement of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> till PHILIP were by continuance in <hi>Spaine</hi> made as Naturall of <hi>Spaine,</hi> would not bee indured by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But in all those things (though wisely layed downe and considered) FERDINANDO failed; But that PLVTO was better to him, than PALLAS.</p>
            <p>In the same Report also, the <hi>Ambassadours</hi> beeing meane men, and therefore the more free, did strike vpon a String which was somewhat dangerous. For they declared plainely, that the People of <hi>Spaine,</hi> both <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> were better affected vnto the part of PHILIP (so hee brought his wife with him)
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7276:113"/>
than to FERDINANDO; And expressed the reason to bee, because hee had imposed vpon them many <hi>Taxes,</hi> and <hi>Tallages,</hi> whith was the Kings owne Case betweene him and his Sonne.</p>
            <p>There was also in this Report a Declaration of an <hi>Ouerture</hi> of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which AMASON the <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> of FERDINANDO had made vnto the <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours</hi> in great secret, betweene CHARLES <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> and MARIE the Kings second Daughter; assuring the king, that the <hi>Treatie</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> then on foot, for the said <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> would breake; and that shee the said Daughter of <hi>France</hi> should bee married to ANGOLESME, that was the <hi>Heire apparant</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a touch also of a speech of <hi>Marriage</hi> betweene FERDINANDO and <hi>Madame de</hi> FOIS, a <hi>Ladie</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed succeeded. But this was reported as learned in <hi>France,</hi> and silenced in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King by the returne of this <hi>Ambassage,</hi> which gaue great light vnto his <hi>Affaires,</hi> was well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and prepared how to carrie himselfe betweene FERDINANDO King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and PHILIP his <hi>Sonne-in-law,</hi> King of <hi>Castile;</hi> resoluing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to doe all that in him lay to keepe them at one within themselues; But howsoeuer that succeeded, by a moderate Carriage and bearing the Person of a <hi>Common-friend,</hi> to loose neither of their Friendships; but yet to runne a <hi>Course</hi> more <hi>entire</hi> with the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> but more <hi>laboured</hi> and <hi>officious</hi> with the King of <hi>Castile.</hi> But hee was much taken with the Ouerture of <hi>Marriage</hi> with his Daughter MARIE; Both because it was the greatest <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and for that it tooke hold of both <hi>Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to corroborate his <hi>Alliance</hi> with PHILIP, the Windes gaue him an Enter-view. For PHILIP

choosing the <hi>Winter-Season,</hi> the better to surprise the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> set forth with a great Nauie out of <hi>Flanders</hi> for <hi>Spaine</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> the one and Twentieth yeare of the Kings Raigne. But himselfe was surprised with a cruell <hi>Tempest,</hi> that scattered his Ships vpon the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Coasts of <hi>England.</hi> And the Ship wherein the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queene</hi> were (with two other small <hi>Barkes</hi> onely) torne, and in great perill to escape the Furie of the weather, thrust into <hi>Waymouth.</hi> King PHILIP himselfe, hauing not beene vsed (as it seemes) to Sea, all wearied and extreame sicke, would needes land ro refresh his Spirits, though it was against the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his <hi>Councell,</hi> doubting it might breed <hi>Delay,</hi> his Occasions requiring <hi>Celeritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rumour of the Arriuall of a puissant <hi>Nauie</hi> vpon the Coast, made the Countrie Arme.

King PHILIP doubting that they, being but <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,</hi> durst not let him passe away againe, without the Kings Notice and Leaue, yeelded to their Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7276:114"/>
desiring him, to thinke himselfe as in his owne Land; and that the king made all hast possible to come and imbrace him. The <hi>Earle</hi> came to him in great Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, with a braue <hi>Troupe</hi> of three hundred <hi>Horse;</hi> and (for more <hi>State)</hi> came by <hi>Torch-Light.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had done the Kings Message, King PHILIP seeing how the world went, the sooner to get away, went vpon speed to the King at <hi>Windsore,</hi> and his Queene followed by easie iourneys. The two kings at their meeting vsed all the <hi>Caresses,</hi> and louing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, that were possible. And the king of <hi>Castile</hi> said pleasantly to the King; <hi>That hee was now punished, for that he would not come within his walled Towne of</hi> Calice, <hi>when they met last.</hi> But the king an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>That walles and Seas were nothing, where Hearts were open; and that hee was here no otherwise, but to bee serued.</hi> After a Day or two's refreshing, the kings entred into speech of renewing the <hi>Treatie;</hi> The King saying, That though King PHILIPS Person were the same, yet his <hi>Fortunes</hi> and <hi>State</hi> were raised. In which Case a Renouation of <hi>Treatie</hi> was vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>Princes.</hi> But while these things were in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the king choosing a fit time, and drawing the king of <hi>Castile</hi> into a Roome, where they two onely were priuate, and laying his hand ciuilly vpon his arme, and changing his Countenance a little from a Countenance of <hi>Intertainment,</hi> said to him; <hi>Sir, you haue beene saued vpon my Coast, I hope you will not suffer mee to wracke vpon yours.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> asked him, <hi>What hee meant by that speech? I meane it</hi> (saith the King) <hi>by that same Harebraine wilde Fellow, my subiect, the</hi> Earle <hi>of</hi> Suffolke, <hi>who is protected in your Countrie, and begins to play the Foole, when all others are wearie of it.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> answered; <hi>I had thought (Sir) your Felicitie had beene aboue those thoughts. But if it trouble you, I will banish him.</hi> The King replied; <hi>Those</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:7276:115"/>
               <hi>Hornets were best in their Nest, and worst then when they did stie abroad, that his desire was, to haue him deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him.</hi> The King of <hi>Castile</hi> here with a little confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in a studie, said; <hi>That can I not doe with my honour, and lesse with yours; for you will bee thought to haue vsed mee as a Prisoner.</hi> The King presently said; <hi>Then the matter is at an end. For I will take that disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vpon me, and so your honour is saued.</hi> The King of <hi>Castile,</hi> who had the king in great Estimation, and besides remembred where hee was, and knew not what vse hee might haue of the kings Amitie, for that himselfe was new in his Estate of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled, both with his <hi>Father-in-Law,</hi> and with his <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> composing his Countenance, said; <hi>Sir, you giue Law to mee; but so will I to you. You shall haue him, but (vpon your honour) you shall not take his life.</hi> The king embracing him, said; <hi>Agreed.</hi> Saith the king of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile, Neither shall it dislike you, if I send to him in such a fashion, as hee may partly come with his owne good will.</hi> The king said; <hi>It was well thought of; and if it pleased him, hee would ioyne with him, in sending to the</hi> Earle <hi>a Message to that purpose.</hi> They both sent seuerally, and meane while they continued <hi>Feasting</hi> and <hi>Pastimes.</hi> The King beeing (on his part) willing to haue the <hi>Earle</hi> sure before the king of <hi>Castile</hi> went; and the king of <hi>Castile</hi> beeing as willing to seeme to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. The King also with many wise and excellent Perswasions, did aduise the king of <hi>Castile,</hi> to bee ruled by the <hi>Councell</hi> of his <hi>Father-in-Law</hi> FERDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDO; a <hi>Prince</hi> so prudent, so experienced, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. The King of <hi>Castile</hi> (who was in no verie good termes with his said <hi>Father-in-Law)</hi> answered; <hi>That if his Father-in-Law would suffer him to gouerne his Kingdomes, hee should gouerne him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were immediatly <hi>Messengers</hi> sent from both Kings to recall the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suffolke:</hi> Who
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7276:115"/>
vpon gentle wordes vsed to him was soone char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and willing enough to returne; assured of his <hi>Life,</hi> and hoping of his <hi>Libertie.</hi> Hee was brought through <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Calice,</hi> and thence landed at <hi>Douer,</hi> and with sufficient <hi>Guard</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and receiued at the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> Meane while King HENRY (to draw out the time) continued his <hi>Feastings</hi> and <hi>Entertainments,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had receiued the king of <hi>Castile</hi> into the <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> and for a <hi>Reciprocall</hi> had his Sonne the <hi>Prince</hi> admitted to the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Golden-Fleece,</hi> hee accompainied <hi>King</hi> PHILIP and his <hi>Queene</hi> to the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> where they were entertayned with the greatest <hi>Magnificence</hi> and <hi>Triumph,</hi> that could bee vpon no greater warning. And as soone as the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Suffolke</hi> had beene conueyed to the <hi>Tower</hi> (which was the serious part) the <hi>Iollities</hi> had an end, and the Kings tooke leaue. Neuerthelesse during their beeing heere, they in Substance concluded that <hi>Treatie,</hi> which the <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> terme <hi>Intercursus malus,</hi> and beares Date at <hi>Windsore;</hi> for that there bee some things in it, more to the Aduantage of the <hi>English,</hi> than of them; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for that the <hi>Free-fishing</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coasts and Seas of <hi>England,</hi> granted in the <hi>Treatie</hi> of <hi>Undecimo,</hi> was not by this <hi>Treatie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. <hi>All Articles</hi> that confirme former <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> beeing precisely and warily limitted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to matter of <hi>Commerce</hi> onely, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</p>
            <p>It was obserued, that the great <hi>Tempest</hi> which draue PHILIP into <hi>England,</hi> blew downe the <hi>Golden Eagle,</hi> from the <hi>Spire</hi> of PAVLES, and in the fall it fell vpon a Signe of the <hi>Blacke Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi> which was in PAVLES <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> in the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7276:116"/>
place where the <hi>Schoole-House</hi> now standeth, and battered it, and brake it downe. Which was a strange <hi>stooping</hi> of a <hi>Hawke</hi> vpon a <hi>Fowle.</hi> This the People interpreted to bee an <hi>Ominous Prognosticke</hi> vpon the <hi>Imperiall House,</hi> which was (by <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> also) fulfilled vpon PHILIP the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> Sonne, not onely in the Present Disaster of the <hi>Tempest,</hi> but in that that followed. For PHILIP arriuing into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and attaining the Possession of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance, (insomuch as FERDINANDO, who had spoke so great before, was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie admitted to the speech of his <hi>Sonne-in-Law)</hi> sickned soone after, and deceased. Yet after such time as there was an <hi>Obseruation</hi> by the wisest of that <hi>Court,</hi> That if hee had liued, his <hi>Father</hi> would haue gained vpon him in that sort, as hee would haue gouerned his <hi>Councells,</hi> and <hi>Designes,</hi> if not his <hi>Affections.</hi> By this all <hi>Spaine</hi> returned into the power of FERDINANDO in state as it was before; the rather, in regard of the infirmitie of IOAN his Daughter, who louing her Husband (by whom shee had many Children) dearely well, and no lesse beloued of him (howsoeuer her <hi>Father,</hi> to make PHILIP ill beloued of the People of <hi>Spaine,</hi> gaue out that PHILIP vsed her not well) was vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in strength of minde to beare the Griefe of his Decease, and fell distracted of her <hi>Wittes.</hi> Of which <hi>Maladie</hi> her <hi>Father</hi> was thought no wayes to endeuour the <hi>Cure,</hi> the better to hold his <hi>Regall Power</hi> in <hi>Castile.</hi> So that as the <hi>Felicitie</hi> of CHARLES the Eighth was said to bee a <hi>Dreame;</hi> so the <hi>Aduersitie</hi> of FERDINANDO was said likewise to bee a <hi>Dreame,</hi> it passed ouer so soone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:7276:116"/>
About this time the King was desirous to bring into the House of LANCASTER <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall Honour,</hi> and became Suitor to <hi>Pope</hi> IVLIVS, to Canonize King HENRY the Sixt for a <hi>Saint;</hi> the rather, in respect of that his famous <hi>Prediction</hi> of the Kings owne Assumption to the <hi>Crowne.</hi> IVLIVS referred the matter (as the manner is) to certaine <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> to take the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of his <hi>Holy Acts</hi> and <hi>Miracles.</hi> But it died vnder the Reference. The generall Opinion was, that <hi>Pope</hi> IVLIVS was too deare, and that the King would not come to his <hi>Rates.</hi> But it is more probable, That that <hi>Pope</hi> (who was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iealous of the Dignitie of the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the <hi>Actes</hi> thereof) knowing that King HENRY the Sixth was reputed in the world abroad but for a <hi>Simple Man,</hi> was affraide it would but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the Estimation of that kinde of <hi>Honour,</hi> if there were not a distance kept betweene <hi>Iunocents</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same yeare likewise there proceeded a <hi>Treatie</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> betweene the King and the <hi>Ladie</hi> MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GARET <hi>Duchesse</hi> Dowager of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> onely Daughter to MAXIMILIAN, and Sister to the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile;</hi> a <hi>Ladie</hi> wise, and of great good <hi>Fame.</hi> This Matter had beene in speech betweene the two Kings at their meeting, but was soone after resumed; and therein was imployed for his first piece the Kings then <hi>Chaplaine,</hi> and after the great <hi>Prelate</hi> THOMAS WOLSEY. It was in the end concluded, with great and ample Conditions for the king, but with promise <hi>De Futuro</hi> only. It may be the king was the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vnto it, for that he heard more and more of the <hi>Marriage</hi> to goe on betweene his great <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> FERDINANDO of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Madame de</hi> FOIS, whereby that King beganne to piece with the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7276:117"/>
               <hi>French King,</hi> from whom hee had beene alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seuered. So fatall a thing it is, for the greatest and straitest Amities of Kings, at one time or other to haue a little of the <hi>Wheele.</hi> Nay thereis a further <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (in <hi>Spaint,</hi> though not with vs) That the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> after hee knew that the <hi>Marriage</hi> betweene CHARLES, the young <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> and MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE the Kings second Daughter went roundly on (which though it was first mooued by the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> yet it was afterwards wholly aduanced and brought to perfection by MAXIMILIAN, and the Friends on that side) entred into a iealousie, that the King did aspire to the Gouernment of <hi>Castilia,</hi> as <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator</hi> during the Minoritie of his <hi>Sonne-in-Law;</hi> as if there should haue beene a Competition of <hi>Three</hi> for that Gouernment; FERDINANDO, <hi>Grand-father</hi> on the Mothers side; MAXIMILIAN, <hi>Grand-father</hi> on the Fathers side; and King HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE; <hi>Father-in-Law</hi> to the young <hi>Prince.</hi> Certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not vnlike, but the Kings Gouernment (carrying the young <hi>Prince</hi> with him) would haue beene perhaps more welcome to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> than that of the other <hi>Two.</hi> For the Nobilitie of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilia,</hi> that so lately put out the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> in fauour of King PHILIP, and had discouered themselues so farre, could not bee but in a secret Distrust and Distaste of that King. And as for MAXIMILIAN, vpon Twentie respects hee could not haue beene the Man. But this purpose of the Kings seemeth to mee (considering the Kings safe Courses, neuer found to bee enterprizing or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous) not greatly probable, except hee should haue had a Desire to breathe warmer, because hee had ill <hi>Lunger.</hi> This <hi>Marriage</hi> with MARGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RET was protracted from time to time, in respect of the <hi>Infirmitie</hi> of the King, who now in the two
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7276:117"/>
and Twentieth of his Raigne beganne to bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the <hi>Goute.</hi> But the Defluxion taking also into his Brest, wasted his <hi>Lungs,</hi> so that thrice in a Yeare (in a kinde of Returne, and especially in the <hi>Spring,)</hi> hee had great Fitts and Labours of the <hi>Tissicke.</hi> Neuerthelesse, hee continued to intend Businesse with as great diligence, as before in his Health. Yet so, as vpon this warning, hee did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise now more seriously thinke of the World to come, and of making himselfe a <hi>Saint,</hi> aswell as King HENRIE the Sixth, by <hi>Treasure</hi> better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, than to bee giuen to <hi>Pope</hi> IVLIVS. For this Yeare hee gaue greater <hi>Almes</hi> than accustomed, and discharged all <hi>Prisoners</hi> about the <hi>Citie,</hi> that lay for <hi>Fees</hi> or <hi>Debts,</hi> vnder fortie shillings. Hee did also make haste with Religious <hi>Foundations;</hi> and in the Yeare following (which was the Three and Twentieth) finished that of the <hi>Sauoy.</hi> And hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring also of the bitter <hi>Cryes</hi> of his <hi>People</hi> against the <hi>Oppressions</hi> of DVDLEY and EMPSON, and their Complices; partly by Deuout Persons about him, and partly by publicke <hi>Sermons</hi> (the <hi>Preachers</hi> doing their Dutie therein) Hee was touched with great Remorse for the same. Neuerthelesse, EMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON and DVDLEY, though they could not but heare of these Scruples in the Kings Conscience; yet as if the Kings <hi>Soule</hi> and his <hi>Money</hi> were in seuerall <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> that the One was not to intermeddle with the Other, went on with as great rage as euer. For the same three and Twentieth Yeare was there a sharpe Prosecution against <hi>Sir</hi> VVILLIAM CAPEL now the second time; and this was for Matters of Misgouernment in his <hi>Maioraltie.</hi> The great Matter beeing, that in some Payments hee had taken knowledge of <hi>False Moneys,</hi> and did
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7276:118"/>
not his diligence to examine, and beate it out, who were the Offendours. For this and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things layed to his Charge, hee was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pay Two Thousand Pounds; and beeing a Man of stomacke, and hardened by his former Troubles, refused to pay 2 <hi>Mite;</hi> and bee like vsed some vntoward Speeches of the Proceedings, for which hee was sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned till the Kings Death. KNESVVORTH likewise, that had beene lately <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and both his <hi>Sheriffes,</hi> were, for Abuses in their Offices, questioned, and imprisoned, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, vpon one Thousand foure hundred pounds payed. HAVVIS, an <hi>Alderman</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> was put in Trouble, and died with Thought, and Anguish, before his Businesse came to an end. <hi>Sir</hi> LAVVRENCE AILMER, who had likewise beene <hi>Maior</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and his two <hi>Sheriffes,</hi> were put to the Fine of one Thousand Pounds. And <hi>Sir</hi> LAVVRENCE, for refusing to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was committed to Prison, where hee stayed till EMPSON himselfe was committed in his place.</p>
            <p>It is no marueile (if the <hi>Faults</hi> were so light, and the <hi>Rates</hi> so heauie) that the Kings Treasure of store, that hee left at his death, most of it in secret places, vnder his owne Key and keeping, at <hi>Richmond,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted (as by Tradition it is reported to haue done) vnto the Summe of neare Eighteene hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds Sterling; a huge Masse of <hi>Money,</hi> euen for these times.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>State</hi> that concluded this kings Temporall Felicitie, was the Conclusion of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Match</hi> betweene his Daughter MARIE, and CHARLES Prince of <hi>Castile,</hi> afterwards the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7276:118"/>
great <hi>Emperour,</hi> both beeing of tender yeares Which <hi>Treatie</hi> was perfected by <hi>Bishop</hi> FOXE, and other his <hi>Commissioners</hi> at <hi>Calice,</hi> the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings Death. In which <hi>Alliance,</hi> it seemeth hee himselfe tooke so high Contentment, as in a Letter which hee wrote thereupon to the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (commaunding all possible demonstrations of ioy to bee made for the same) hee expresseth himselfe, as if hee thought hee had built a <hi>Wall</hi> of <hi>Brasse</hi> about his Kingdome. When hee had for his <hi>Sonnes-in-law,</hi> a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Burgundie.</hi> So as now there was nothing to bee added to this great Kings Felicitie, beeing at the top of all worldly <hi>Blisse,</hi> (in regard of the high <hi>Marriages</hi> of his Children, his great <hi>Renowne</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Europe,</hi> and his scarce credible <hi>Riches,</hi> and the perpetuall <hi>Constancie</hi> of his prosperous Successes) but an opportune <hi>Death,</hi> to withdraw him from any future blowe of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Which certainely (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great <hi>Hatred</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Title</hi> of his <hi>Sonne,</hi> being then come to Eighteene yeares of age, and being a bold <hi>Prince,</hi> and liberall, and that gained vpon the <hi>People</hi> by his very <hi>Aspect</hi> and <hi>Presence)</hi> had not beene impossible to haue come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
            <p>To crowne also the last yeare of his Raigne, as well as his first, hee did an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Pietie,</hi> rare, and worthy to bee taken into Imitation. For hee granted forth a <hi>Generall Pardon,</hi> as expecting a second <hi>Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in a better <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Hee did also declare in his <hi>Will,</hi> that his minde was, that <hi>Restitution</hi> should bee made of those <hi>Summes,</hi> which had beene vniustly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his <hi>Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus this SALOMON of <hi>England</hi> (for SALOMON also was too heauie vpon his <hi>People</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:7276:119"/>

                  <hi>Hee did much maintaine and countenance his</hi> Lawes. <hi>Which (neuerthelesse) was no</hi> Impediment <hi>to him to worke his</hi> VVill. <hi>For it was so handled, that neyther</hi> Prerogatiue, <hi>nor</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:7276:120"/>
Profit <hi>went to</hi> Diminution. <hi>And yet as hee would sometimes straine vp his</hi> Lawes <hi>to his</hi> Prerogatiue, <hi>so would hee also let downe his</hi> Prerogatiue <hi>to his Parliament. For</hi> Minte, <hi>and</hi> Warres, <hi>and</hi> Marshall Discipline, <hi>(things of Absolute Power) hee would neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse bring to</hi> Parliament. Iustice <hi>was well administred in his time, saue where the King was</hi> Partie: <hi>Saue also, that the</hi> Councell-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>intermedled too much with</hi> Meum <hi>and</hi> Tuum. <hi>For it was a very</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Iustice <hi>during his time, especially in the Beginning. But in that part both of</hi> Iustice <hi>and</hi> Policie, <hi>which is the Durable Part, and cut (as it were) in Brasse or Marble (which is</hi> The making of good Lawes) <hi>he did excell. And with his</hi> Iustice, <hi>hee was also a</hi> Mercifull Prince. <hi>As in whose time, there were but three of the</hi> Nobilitie <hi>that suffered; the</hi> Earle <hi>of</hi> Warwicke, <hi>the Lord</hi> Chamberlaine, <hi>and the Lord</hi> AWDLEY. <hi>Though the first two were in stead of</hi> Numbers, <hi>in the Dislike and Obloquie of the</hi> People. <hi>But there were neuer so great</hi> Rebellions, <hi>expiated with so little</hi> Bloud, <hi>drawne by the hand of Iustice, as the two</hi> Rebellions <hi>of</hi> Black-heath <hi>and</hi> Excester. <hi>As for the</hi> Seueritie <hi>vsed vpon those which were taken in</hi> Kent, <hi>it was but vpon a</hi> Scumme <hi>of</hi>

People. His <hi>Pardons</hi> went euer both before, and after his <hi>Sword.</hi> But then hee had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a strange kinde of <hi>Interchanging</hi> of large and inexpected <hi>Pardons,</hi> which seuere <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Which (his Wisedome considered) could not bee imputed to any <hi>Inconstancie,</hi> or <hi>Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie;</hi> but either to some <hi>Reason</hi> which we do not now know, or to a <hi>Principle</hi> hee had set vnto himselfe, <hi>That hee would varie, and try both wayes in turne.</hi> But the lesse <hi>Bloud</hi> hee drew, the more hee tooke of <hi>Treasure.</hi> And (as some construed it) hee was the more sparing in the <hi>One,</hi> that hee might bee the more pressing in the <hi>Other;</hi> for both would haue beene intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Of <hi>Nature</hi> assuredly hee coueted to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate <hi>Treasure,</hi> and was a little <hi>Poore</hi> in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring <hi>Riches.</hi> The <hi>People</hi> (into whom there is infused, for the preseruation of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> a naturall Desire to discharge their <hi>Princes,</hi> though it bee with the vniust charge of their <hi>Councellours</hi> and <hi>Ministers)</hi> did impute this vnto <hi>Cardinall MORTON,</hi> and Sir <hi>REGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOLD BRAY.</hi> Who (as it after appeared) as <hi>Councellours</hi> of ancient Authoritie with him, did so second his <hi>Humours,</hi> as neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they did temper them.

than by the seruile following of his Bent) did not giue way onely (as the first did) but shape him way to those <hi>Extreamities,</hi> for which himselfe was touched with remorse at his Death, and which his <hi>Successour</hi> renounced, and sought to purge. This <hi>Excesse</hi> of his, had at that time many <hi>Glosses</hi> and <hi>Interpretations.</hi> Some thought the continuall <hi>Rebellions</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee had beene vexed, had made him grow to hate his <hi>People.</hi> Some thought it was done to pull downe their <hi>Stomackes,</hi> and to keep them low. Some, for that hee would leaue his Sonne a <hi>Golden fleece.</hi> Some suspected he had some high <hi>Designe</hi> vpon <hi>Forraine parts.</hi> But those perhaps shall come nearest the truth, that fetch not their reasons so far off; but rather impute it to <hi>Nature, Age, Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Minde</hi> fixed vpon no other <hi>Ambition</hi> or Pursuit. Whereunto I should adde, that hauing euery day Occasion to take notice of the <hi>Necessities</hi> and <hi>Shifts</hi> for Money of other great <hi>Princes</hi> abroad, it did the better (by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison) set of to him the <hi>Felicitie</hi> of full <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</hi> As to his expending of <hi>Treasure,</hi> he neuer spared Charge which his <hi>Affaires</hi> required; and in his <hi>Buildings</hi> was <hi>Magnificent,</hi> but his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> were very limitted. So that his <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> was rather vpon his owne <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> than vpon the <hi>Deserts</hi> of others.</p>

                  <hi>Hee was of an</hi> High Minde, <hi>and loued his owne</hi> Will, <hi>and his owne</hi> VVay; <hi>as One that reuered himselfe, and would</hi> Reigne <hi>indeed.

As for little</hi> Enuies <hi>or</hi> Emulations <hi>vpon</hi> Forraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>(which are frequent with many Kings) hee had neuer any; but went substantially to his owne</hi> Businesse. <hi>Certaine it is, that though his</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <hi>was great at home, yet it was greater abroad. For</hi> Forrainers <hi>that could not see the Passages of</hi> Affaires, <hi>but made their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon the</hi> Issues <hi>of them, noted that hee was euer in</hi> Strife, <hi>and euer a</hi> Loft. <hi>It grew also from the</hi> Aires, <hi>which the</hi> Princes <hi>and</hi> States <hi>abroad receiued from their</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours <hi>and</hi> Agents <hi>here; which were attending the</hi> Court <hi>in great number.

                  <hi>Hee was carefull and liberall to obtaine good</hi> Intelligence <hi>from all parts abroad.

               <p>Hee was indeed full of <hi>Apprehensions</hi> and <hi>Suspitions.</hi> But as he did easily take them, so hee did easily checke them, and master them; whereby they were not dangerous, but troubled himselfe more than others.
