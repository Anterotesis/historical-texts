            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His hath been an <hi>Accuſative</hi> age in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and the <hi>Prince of Darkneſſe</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more imitated by us in that <hi>Epither,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>our new lights.</hi> Yet for the moſt part, our <hi>Accuſations</hi> have been but like the crackling of thornes under a pot: And our <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers</hi> like the <hi>Mountaines,</hi> which ſwelled into that bulke, as it ſummon'd the expectation of the world, and were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a poore <hi>Mouſe.</hi> You cannot name us many <hi>Charges</hi> which either have not been quite withdrawn, or ſunk into a lower ſtreame. Pray what <hi>Delinquent</hi> (as they terme them) Abate us but the Tragedie of <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the <hi>Hothams,</hi> and a very few more who fell in a fit of Juſtice, and were ſacrificed to Revenge and Paſsion) hath been brought to a Period commenſurate to his Charge?</p>
            <p>How did the Impeachment of the <hi>Judges</hi> eccho through the kingdome? yet ſome of the chief were not only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſit on thoſe Chaires, which it was pretended they d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d proſtitute, but offer'd Preferment alſo. What a terrible Mouth was opened upon the twelve Proteſting <hi>Biſhops</hi>? yet the turn being ſerv'd, and the Votes againſt their whole Order paſſed in the Houſe, they were not onely acquitted of their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57533:3"/>
Charge, but alſo diſmiſs'd from Cuſtody. How high ran the Tyde once againſt the <hi>Monopoliſts</hi>? what eaſe from other Burdens did not the People believe they ſhould have, by the ſqueezing of thoſe ſwolne Spunges? yet who among them hath received the meaſure of his Deſert? Nay, which of them, that would nimbly dance after the Pipe of his great Accuſers, hath not been even hugg'd in their Boſome, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from the lawfull Attempts of injur'd and oppreſſed Subjects? What Haranges have been made againſt <hi>evill Counſellors</hi>? How was the Kingdome born in hand, with hopes of ſome exemplary Puniſhment upon, or ſome ſevere Admonition at the leaſt unto them? And yet name but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>Privy-Counſellor</hi> ever queſtioned for ill advice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given to the <hi>King.</hi> Of late, what a Charge was entred againſt the <hi>11. Members,</hi> ſome of them Perſons of eminent Integrity and Merit, the Pillars of their reſpective Houſes? yet we hope well in their behalf. It will not ſtand with the Juſtice of a Parliament, to inſtall one (the Earle of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>) again upon the <hi>Bench,</hi> and make him their <hi>Judge,</hi> when his hand was to all the Warrants for Leavy's, and bring them to the <hi>Bar,</hi> condemn them for <hi>Traytors,</hi> who ſigned but onely one; whoſe fault was in compariſon but looking over the Hedge, while the Other Stole the Horſe. What hath been ſaid againſt the late <hi>Lord Maior,</hi> and the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> Stars of the firſt Magnitude in their Orbe, whoſe influences have ſtrongly contributed unto the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Parliament's Cauſe? yet we deſpair not, but that they alſo may be diſmiſs'd, if they would but fairly ſit downe themſelves. For we are not ignorant of the under-hand Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, which have been made them, and the Devices which have been in Agitation, to come off with them handſomly. And it is a good <hi>Omen</hi> that Alderman <hi>Culham</hi> (whoſe guilt if it were any, was greater then any of his Brethrens)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57533:3"/>
is diſcharged upon his humble ſubmiſsion.</p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>Inſtances</hi> enough to prove what I propoſed; and <hi>Both</hi> ſufficient to convince any judgement: That it was not <hi>Publique Juſtice,</hi> nor <hi>Reliefe</hi> of the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were the ſprings of theſe actions; but <hi>ſiniſter</hi> and <hi>private</hi> deſignes of their owne: Something like that of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom, Oh that I were made Judge</hi> (or rather Tyrant) <hi>in the Land, that every man which hath a ſuit or a cauſe might come unto me, and I would doe him juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all theſe former Proceedings are but rude Eſſays, in compariſon of this laſt Grand accuſative <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt the <hi>KING,</hi> which we are aſham'd of already, and after-Ages will condemne as the Top of malicious Villany, and an unſpeakable Scandall to our Religion. And, that which boils up the Iniquity to the height, the <hi>King</hi> is debarr'd the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of His meaneſt Subject, of the greateſt Malefactor, which is, to Plead for Himſelfe, and to wipe off theſe black Aſperſions, whereby His Honour is ſo deeply wounded: Nay to heare, or know His Accuſation.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore be pardon'd the Preſumption, if in this caſe the unworthieſt of millions of His people I become an Advocate for my oppreſſed Soveraigne; and with a few ſparkes which I ſhall ſtrike (as neere as is poſsible) from the Rock of Truth, afford ſome Evidence of His Innocencie, untill the Searcher of all Truth ſhall <hi>bring forth his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe as the light, and his judgement as the noone day.</hi>

               <head>The Ground and Deſigne of the Declaration, diſcovered.</head>
               <p>It is well knowne to all the world, That from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our War (to trace the pedigree of them no higher) there have been two main parties in the Parliament (to omit their ſub-diviſions) commonly diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi>; who, though in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall they concurr'd in beating down the power of the King, yet had ſeverall and indeed irreconcileable deſignes therein unto themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57533:4"/>Nor can it be doubted, that the ſupream ſole Power and Authority was the <hi>Apple of contention,</hi> as well between them now thus divided, as formerly between the <hi>King,</hi> and them conjoyned; what gawdy Colours ſoever are caſt over, and ſpecious Pretences made to ſtalke before it. Truth is, This is the generall Ground of moſt Quarrels; every man inheriting that ambitious Humour of our firſt common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, even from the <hi>Diſciples</hi> in their Poverty (who were projecting for the Right-hand and for the Left, and in a kingdome too) unto the greateſt <hi>States-men.</hi> Nay, a wiſe Gentleman of our Age obſerv'd it to be the Itch, even of kitchin-boyes, who ſhould be the greateſt.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Independents</hi> (though inconſiderable at the firſt, even to Contempt, being not above ſix among fourſcore in the Aſſembly, nor double that number viſible in both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) have plaid their Cards ſo well, and follow'd their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo cloſe, that they have got the <hi>Purſe</hi> of the kingdom at their command, the whole <hi>Strength</hi> of it at their devotion, and now graſp at the <hi>Authority</hi> alſo, and ſeek to eſtabliſh their <hi>Iniquity by a Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by what ſteps and Degrees they have climb'd thus high, is very difficult to diſcover exactly; the foundation being laid deep under ground, and carried up with as much Art, as ever Building of that nature was; Nor is it much materiall.</p>
               <p>The greateſt and onely unqueſtionable <hi>Authority</hi> of this Kingdome is of the <hi>King</hi> and His two Houſes of Parliament; to this their Ambition did aſpire. But having ſtrugled in vain in the <hi>Houſes</hi> for a good while, they found the wind to ſit too ſtrong in their faces there, and an impoſsibility for them to begin that way, as the Temper of the Houſes ſtood. If the <hi>King</hi> were but in their hands, being ſtript of all ſtrength, and in ſome deſperate apprehenſion of Himſelf,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57533:5"/>
then their Hopes would handſomely ſmile upon them.</p>
               <p>In order to this therefore a Quarrell is pickt with the Parliament, the <hi>King's</hi> Perſon ſeized on, and ſoon after the Parliament is moſt ſhamefully deſpiſed, abuſed, diſgraced, made to double at pleaſure, to eat up their owne Ordinances and Decrees, perfectly over-awed and even trampled on. So farre, that one of their owne Members in the Houſe openly told them, <hi>That he could not call them a Houſe of Parliament, but a company of Gentlemen met together to fulfill the Iuſt of an Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet were they ſo wiſe, and commenced their quarrell ſo cunningly, as that they might keep two ſtrings to their Bow; and as the Beaſt, which hath two holes to his den, can ſtop or open either, as the weather ſits: even ſo were their <hi>Propoſals</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> contrived and ſent abroad, that by changing or interpreting one word, they might comply with the <hi>King</hi> to deſtroy the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they ſhould find themſelves unable to mould it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own Humour; Or if once it were under their Girdle, then afterward to bring the <hi>King</hi> to their Bent, or lay him quite aſide, and by binding his Hands to eſtabliſh the whole Power and Authority of the Kingdome in their owne. And either of theſe Cards they drew, as they had Occaſion, and convers'd with men of different Intereſts.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, they handle the <hi>King</hi> with much Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and ſhewes of Indulgence, allowing him the ſervice of his <hi>Chaplains,</hi> and the free uſe of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which was denyed him by the Houſes, bearing him in hand, that they preferr'd <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> before the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way; and tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him with ambiguous Promiſes; to mollifie his hard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits toward them, or at leaſt to harden him the more againſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and make that breach wider. They had likewiſe the wit for to humour and ſtroak the <hi>Royall party,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57533:5"/>
by a thouſand pretty deviſes and Artifices, entertaining ſome of them in their boſomes, allowing them Seats, even in their Councels of War, carefully forbearing in their Declarations to ſtigmatize them with that ſo familiar brand of <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,</hi> and filling them with hopes and expectations of I know not what great favours; which they meant to perform, when two Sundayes met together.</p>
               <p>Thus having well divided the Kings party from the Presbyterians, they had then a ſmooth and eaſie way to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. The <hi>City</hi> opens the Gates; The <hi>Parliament</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; The chiefe Leaders of both Houſes, either flie for't, or withdraw for a while, and play leaſt-in-ſight. Which was fore-ſeen when <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſtole privately to <hi>Newmarket</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> and asking <hi>Whether they had the King in their hand</hi>? Being aſſured of that, told ſome of the Officers, <hi>That then they had the Parliament in their pockets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who are of private ſpirits, and for their owne either ſafety or deſignes conſtantly ſwamme with the ſtreame and Tyde, began now to tack about, and to do Journy-worke for the ſtronger ſide, and Vote with the prevailing party, of which I will give but one Inſtance by the way, and that is of Colonell <hi>Hervy,</hi> who three daies before would undertake <hi>to beate them three miles into the Ground,</hi> but upon their admiſsion into the City, was their firſt Advocate.</p>
               <p>When the Houſe was thus brought in a great meaſure to be at their devotion, the laſt Rub in their Alley was the <hi>King,</hi> He perſiſted in his Obſtinacy, and would not yeild up the Bucklers into their hands, nor the power to protect his people. Wherefore to bring His <hi>Majeſty</hi> under the more advantage, by inſinuations both of danger to His Perſon, and of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibility in them to ſave Him from the <hi>Agitators,</hi> (whom yet they countenanced for that purpoſe) and withall by ſecret promiſes of faire complyance, he is juggled into the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57533:6"/>After that <hi>Bills</hi> are provided, with pretence of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, leſt they ſhould ſeeme to invade the Throne <hi>per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>; but in very deed, ſuch as would have ſtript him bare of all <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and of <hi>power to protect</hi> His Subjects, and eſtabliſhed themſelves by a <hi>Law,</hi> in an abſolute <hi>domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Tyranny</hi> over us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> not more for his owne <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> then for the <hi>benefit</hi> of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> refuſing to comply with their deſires herein, is immediately confined; and that in ſuch a manner, as it is hard to find a Parallel. His Wife, Children, Friends, Servants, all the Comforts of life kept from Him, (a courſe formerly pronounced barbarous and inhumane, even in a Subjects caſe.) By-and-by, the prodigious Votes, forbidding all intercourſe of Letters to Him or from Him, under the penalty of High-Treaſon, ſo cutting off all poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Accommodation, were carryed in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, to render Him as black as was poſsible, and ſo utterly to alienate the affections of his people, this goodly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration (firſt ſet on foot in the Army, and allowed the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators to pleaſe themſelves withall, ſo to divert them from more dangerous deſignes, as the Cheſſe at the ſiege of <hi>Troy</hi> to keep Souldiers from mutiny) is thought upon, and taken up by the Grandees, lick'd into a better forme, ſo expos'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publick view; that beſides their aime therein againſt the King, they might ſomewhat ſtroake the Levellers, by taking up their Principles, in a recompence for deveſting them of their power: and ſo pave their way as much as was poſsible to a perfect ſoveraignty for themſelves.</p>

            <p>It was the Boaſt of a French <hi>Promoter,</hi> That he deſired <hi>no other advantage to break</hi> any <hi>mans neck, then that he might be imployed</hi> in an <hi>Office of State, but for a twelve moneth</hi>; So hard he deemed it for ſuch a one to execute his place free from Exception, fo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for thoſe that ſtand on Battlements and Pinacles to catch a fall.

            <div type="part">
               <head>The <hi>TITLE</hi> of the Declaration conſidered.</head>
               <p>It is chriſtned <hi>a Declaration</hi>; where obſerve the deviation of this manner of proceeding from the Rule in the Goſpel; which enjoynes in caſe of <hi>Treſpaſſe</hi> againſt <hi>a Brother,</hi> firſt a <hi>private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi>; then, if that worke no good effect, before <hi>two or three witneſſes</hi>; and if neither will ſerve the turne; if the delinquent addes obſtinacy to his Treſpaſſe, then, not till then, <hi>Dic Eccleſiae,</hi> declare it to the Church. Now this rule I take to reach to civill Affaires, and to be a direction for private men in their reciprocall Behaviour. The <hi>Scripture</hi> holds forth ſtricter Precepts in reference to the King, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeake evil of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> (no not upon any Provocation) and <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King, Thou art wicked?</hi> and again, <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought.</hi> Eccleſ. 10. It was onely the <hi>ungracious Son,</hi> that made <hi>ſport with his fathers Nakedneſſe</hi>; for which even his Poſterity were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Heires of his Malediction. If they would needs rake in the ſhame of their Soveraigne, How much better had it been for them to have taken the Counſell given them by one of their own Members, <hi>To ſend it to the King himſelfe, becauſe he knowes beſt, whether theſe things are true or no, I am ſure ſome of our Proofs are ſhort.</hi> This courſe might have raiſed in him an opinion of the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe</hi> of his Commons <hi>toward his Honour,</hi> and in caſe he were

               </p>
               <p>Or if it muſt be <hi>a Declaration,</hi> then 'tis <hi>of themſelves,</hi> of what lay before in the Cloſet of their evill Hearts, treaſured up againſt a convenient ſeaſon; <hi>a Declaration</hi> of their deep <hi>Diſtaſte</hi> againſt the <hi>Crowne,</hi> their old <hi>Malice</hi> againſt the <hi>Kings perſon,</hi> their <hi>itching deſire</hi> of <hi>Domination,</hi> their <hi>low Conceit</hi> of this great and wiſe <hi>people,</hi> to be fobb'd with Paper, and fool'd with reaſons of Straw; and that too, after the long and frequent Experience of ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Plots and Cheates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider we the Authors, on whom it is father'd, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of England.</hi> So then, 1.

And perhaps, ſome of them having lived in a ſphear nearer to his Majeſty, might be too well acquainted with his Innocence in many things, and ſo by diſcovery of truth in the debate, bring leſs Credit upon the whole Exploit. 2. <hi>Not of all the Commons,</hi> bate me an Ace there. It is notoriouſly known, that between 50 and 60 of the ableſt men, who for the moſt part were likely to oppoſe this violence, were purpoſely ſent out of <hi>London,</hi> to raiſe the <hi>nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monethes Aſſeſment</hi> from the reſpective Countries, ſo to eaſe them of free-quarter, (where, we will note by the way, there was a double Aime. 1.

To draw <hi>an Odium</hi> upon them from their Countries; whiles that, either the condition, upon which the Money was invited out of their hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould not be performed; or another Tax (as indeed there is one already of ſix moneths) made the Requitall of their forward diſcharge of the firſt ſums.) It is true, ſome of them were returned, but few or none preſent in the Houſe. 3. <hi>Not of all thoſe Commons,</hi> who were not ſo ſent abroad, for upon the diviſion, there were 50 on the one ſide, and 80 on the other. 4.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not daring to looke the ſun in the face. It was huddl'd up; when <hi>divers,</hi> that had their lodgings in the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Where by the way, let me put them in mind, that the <hi>beſt-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd States in Chriſtendome,</hi> even ſuch to which they pretend to modell themſelves, <hi>Venice, Holland, &amp;c.</hi> (Indeed, where is it not ſo, abroad?) nothing of Conſequence is concluded, but wherein <hi>two Thirds of the Suffrages</hi> do concur. In our Kingdom, how oft hath a <hi>Voice,</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> an inconſiderable <hi>Overplus,</hi> carried a buſines, even to our undoing?

               <p n="1">1. Fifty or ſixty (as I ſaid afore) of the moſt active intelligent Members, ſuſpected to be <hi>croſ-grain'd</hi> to that way, were ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad under colour of the <hi>Publick ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Head-quarters</hi> were appointed to draw <hi>towards Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; and the Soldiers from other parts, to ſtartle the ſecurer Members, and affright the weaker and obnoxious.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. To evince theſe Votes, there wanted not <hi>Argumenta bacil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> Inſinuations of Force and compulſion (a common practice there in all Debates of Conſequence) made by <hi>Crumwell</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who repreſented it more then once, how <hi>diſ-taſtfull it might be to the Army, if not conſented to.</hi> And upon the Diviſion, <hi>Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Ceely,</hi> whom he had not ſpoken to in in many moneths before, and gave him thanks; whoſe Anſwer was, <hi>that though he was of his mind in that point, yet was it not upon his Argument.</hi>

               <p>There was never much Difficulty made of the maddeſt Votes to paſſe the Houſe of Lords, if the Commons pleaſed to <hi>ſwitch</hi> or <hi>ſpur</hi> them up: yet here they were not willing to truſt their good Natures altogether.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57533:10"/>
Commons, with <hi>a promiſe to live &amp; die with them in defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi> (a fure ſign, where the Bird was firſt brooded, and from whence it came to the Houſe of Commons.) A <hi>Meſſage</hi> with <hi>two faces,</hi> one looking to what was already done by the Commons, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which was the chief) to what was expected from the Lords, and afterward from the reſt of the Kingdome, to which it was meant as a <hi>Preparation.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Addreſſe</hi> was made in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to every one of the <hi>Lords,</hi> by theſe Champions of the Votes, the Colonels; much Courtſhip ſhewed; many promiſes made; all of them dealt with, according to their ſeverall Temper and Diſpoſition. The fiery Spirits ſtoop'd unto and ply'd with gentle Fomentations; the wel-affected encourag'd; with ſome implicit Menaces unto the tame Spirits; a ſtrong Motive to bring the Lords over to a complyance with the Commons, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that can enforce it, if it be denied. Thirdly, A publick printed <hi>Engagement,</hi> to <hi>maintain the Honour of the Houſe of Peers</hi> is tendred.

Fourthly, While the Lords made ſome demur, and as yet the Scale ſtood even, high words paſſed in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to this effect, <hi>That as they had ſaved the Kingdome without the Lords, ſo could they ſettle it without them</hi>; and more to that purpoſe.

               <p>I need not ſpend much time on this Argument; it ſeems, the Kingdome is convinced hereof already: for neither the <hi>Example of the Army</hi> (who made haſte to preſent a Gratulatory Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement unto the Houſe for theſe Votes) nor <hi>the Policy of</hi> the <hi>Committee-men, Juſtices,</hi> (men according to their own tooth,

The <hi>Buckingham-ſhire men</hi> were out-witted; ſome being made believe, the <hi>Petition</hi> was for taking off <hi>Free-Quarter</hi>; Others, for the <hi>Preſbyterian Government.</hi> Others were <hi>ſent for up</hi> to <hi>meet</hi> their <hi>Miniſters</hi> and other <hi>Confidents</hi> at <hi>Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi> upon pretence <hi>of buſineſſe of huge Importance,</hi> but knew not <hi>what,</hi> untill they were <hi>come thither,</hi> and then went on, like Geeſe, with the flock.</p>
               <p>Let the Kingdome but ſeriouſly conſider the <hi>Barbariſme</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in toward his Majeſty, and the miſery wherein they involve <hi>this Nation</hi> thereby, and I believe there will no more be found to tread in their Steps. <hi>Impriſonment</hi> is the Buriall of a Man alive, and that which <hi>Private</hi> perſons hardly endure with patience: no <hi>Creature</hi> will, if it be poſſible to make any Eſcape.

               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. It is known to all, that K. <hi>James</hi> was an aged man; and to all the <hi>Court,</hi> that he kept an ill Diet: particularly, how he was addicted to Exceſſe of <hi>ſweet Wines</hi>; by reaſon whereof, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>eaſe</hi> and want of <hi>exerciſe,</hi> as alſo the forbearance of all <hi>Phyſick,</hi> he grew full of <hi>humors, corpulent,</hi> and of an evill <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> For the <hi>ſicknes he died of,</hi> it was a kind of <hi>Ague,</hi> mixt of a <hi>quotidian</hi> and a <hi>tertian,</hi> call'd an <hi>Hemitritaea</hi>; and ſo determin'd of by all his <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> ſix or ſeven at leaſt. Now that Diſeaſe, though ſtiled by the name of an <hi>Ague,</hi> is known to be <hi>mortall</hi> in its owne <hi>nature,</hi> and more to <hi>die</hi> of it, then to <hi>recover</hi>: But in ſuch an <hi>Age, Conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>courſe of Diet,</hi> as King <hi>James</hi> was of, nothing more certain; Eſpecially conſidering he hated <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> would conforme to <hi>no directions</hi>; nay, was ſo croſſe, that when one of his <hi>Doctors,</hi> as the <hi>mouth</hi> of the reſt, had told him, that <hi>he muſt bleed, in a great Rage,</hi> he ingeminated the Scandal of a <hi>Butcher</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they agreed, this was his Diſeaſe, ſo they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that his <hi>Death</hi> was <hi>the naturall</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> effect thereof, and they teſtified the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Body</hi> being opened, was found faire and free from any ground of Suſpition, in the judgment both of his <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> (of whom Maſter <hi>Hayes</hi> is yet living, and in the <hi>Kings-bench</hi>) <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary's</hi> and <hi>Phyſitians.</hi> There are three of thoſe Phyſitians yet alive, Doctor <hi>Hervy,</hi> Doctor <hi>Liſter,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Craig,</hi> all three honeſt and worthy men, the two laſt reſident in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> quarters about <hi>London,</hi> and in this Breach between the King and them of their party; Doctor <hi>Craig</hi> under a diſguſt at Court, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57533:12"/>
diſcharg'd from his Attendance long afore, and therefore not likely to be partial to the <hi>King</hi>; Who all doe teſtifie the truth of this <hi>Narrative,</hi> and (I believe) are ſo noble, that they will readily give ſatisfaction to any man, that ſhall but doe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that right, as to informe it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>the Duke,</hi> I ſhall firſt premiſe ſomewhat; both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> about that he adminiſtred to K. <hi>James,</hi> and alſo how far he was accus'd in Parliament, then anſwer the Charge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke himſelfe</hi> had been ſick of an <hi>Ague,</hi> and that not long before: in which Diſeaſe he was attended by three able Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but after ſome wreſtling with it by their help, the <hi>Counteſſe of Buckingham</hi> his Mother, ſhutting them out of dores, gives the Duke a Vomit, made with <hi>Tobacco</hi>; which wrought violently, but recover'd him from his Diſeaſe. After which, finding himſelf ſomewhat weak, he retires to the <hi>Earle of Warwick's houſe</hi> in <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> where, either upon <hi>change</hi> of Aire, or ſome <hi>reliques</hi> of the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> or what cauſe ſoever, he ſuffer'd a <hi>relapſe</hi>: and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the <hi>E. of Warwick,</hi> ſent for one <hi>Remington,</hi> a Phyſician living thereabout, who by a <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> applyed to <hi>his Stomack</hi> and <hi>Wriſts,</hi> and a <hi>Poſſet-drink</hi> taken inwardly, recovered him from that <hi>Relapſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, K. <hi>James</hi> being ſick, his <hi>diſeaſe</hi> an <hi>Ague,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> ignorant of the <hi>diſtinction</hi> between <hi>Agnes,</hi> thinking <hi>all</hi> of the <hi>ſame Nature,</hi> that <hi>bore</hi> the <hi>ſame Name,</hi> perceiving the <hi>Phyſicians doubtfull,</hi> other directions unſucceſsfull, the <hi>Kings</hi> diſpoſition impatient of many <hi>Medicines,</hi> declareth to the <hi>King</hi> his owne <hi>Cure,</hi> propoſeth to the <hi>Phyſicians to Vomit him</hi> with <hi>Tobacco.</hi> But the danger thereof being ſuggeſted, by reaſon of the violence of it, and the ſpeciall Antipathy of the <hi>King againſt it,</hi> he forbeares that <hi>remedy,</hi> yet upon the urgent deſire of King <hi>James</hi> himſelfe, procures for him the aforeſaid <hi>Plaiſter and Drinke</hi>; the one being onely <hi>London-Treacle,</hi> the other no more but <hi>Poſſet-drink,</hi> boil'd with <hi>Harts-horne</hi> and <hi>Marigold-flowers,</hi> then ſweetned with <hi>ſyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup</hi> of <hi>Gilly-flowers</hi>; which were both diſcover'd to the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans afterwards, and obtain'd before, not without ſome aſſiſtance of the <hi>Earle of Warwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the application of this, whether by the naturall courſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57533:13"/>
of the diſeaſe, or ſome other cauſe, the <hi>King grew worſe indeed</hi>; the Phyſicians take it not well; theſe Medicines are laid aſide. Yet, the diſeaſe not abating upon intermiſſion of the directions, the <hi>King,</hi> impatient both of his diſeaſe, and of his Phyſicians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, importunes again for that <hi>Remedy,</hi> which he had rejected. Hereupon, a <hi>Bed-chamber-man</hi> is preſently diſpatch'd unto the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> Monſieur du Plure, <hi>Treacle</hi> is ſent for: no tearm of Specification being added, he thought it fit to ſend the beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſty, and by that means ſent him <hi>Venice-Treacle,</hi> which as it was better in it ſelfe, ſo was it worſe for the Kings diſeaſe. This being brought, no body there preſent could order it, but the <hi>Counteſſe of Buckingham.</hi> It was applied again; but being hotter then the former Plaiſter, and the Kings hot fit approaching, it might ſomewhat aggravate his <hi>Heate</hi>; whereupon, he cryed out, <hi>That theſe had done him hurt, and were the cauſe of his Extremity.</hi> Upon this, ſome one in the roome drank up the Poſſet-drinke; and the Plaiſter was <hi>applied</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> who took no manner of <hi>hurt,</hi> but that he was <hi>cured</hi> of an <hi>Ague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the whole truth concerning that <hi>Application</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides others, it will be atteſted by Maſter <hi>Patrick Maule,</hi> then of the Bed-chamber, and in Attendance, a Gentleman, whom the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath imployed about the <hi>King,</hi> ever ſince he hath bin in their hands, and therefore one that in all probability would relate nothing to their diſadvantage, on ſet purpoſe.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57533:13"/>
that the turbulent Spirits were ſo daſht, that there could be no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Oppoſition in their Houſe to his deſignes</hi> (and indeed in ſight, more of the Members of that Election were at the <hi>Dukes</hi> devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that indeed the <hi>Duke</hi> was guilty of <hi>Imprudence,</hi> to meddle in an <hi>Art,</hi> he was not <hi>Maſter</hi> of; And more yet, to exhibit any thing that way unto a <hi>King</hi>; ſo that he was in ſome meaſure li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Charge</hi> againſt him. Secondly, by way of <hi>Exception,</hi> 1. This was no cauſe of the Kings <hi>death</hi>; and ſo much the very Charge implies, which was but of <hi>Miſ-demeanors</hi> and high <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.</hi> Had it been of his Death, it could not have ſtood on this ſide <hi>High-Treaſon</hi>; and therefore it was a malicious intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Kingdome, that his Majeſty was guilty of what they themſelves were aſhamed to charge upon the <hi>Duke.</hi> 2. It was done out of a good affection, and an intent to recover the <hi>King.</hi> Had he had other Ends, he would never have owned the Action, as he did. He was not ſo weak a <hi>Politician,</hi> as to doe ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with his owne hands, or by thoſe of his <hi>Mother,</hi> or ſo much above-boord. 3. The Medicines of themſelves were innocent, and could not prejudice. I have heard it from learned <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> that <hi>London-Treacle</hi> is of a temperate nature, and propulſive of Venome from the Heart, a <hi>Cordial</hi>; the decoction of <hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> with <hi>Marygold-flowers</hi> and <hi>Gilly-flowers</hi> is no other. Nay, this was atteſted by ſome of the Phyſicians upon their Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57533:14"/>
in that Parliament, that thoſe Medicines did him no hurt. 4. There was a poſſibility to ſave the King thereby. <hi>Experiment</hi> is the beſt Leg and <hi>Baſe</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi>; and oftentimes, when a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctor hath ſtrugled in vaine, a Nurſe or a Midwife hath wrought the Cure by an approved Receit. How oft hath the <hi>Lady of Kent</hi> flatter'd her ſelfe in this kind, and the Lady <hi>Brooks</hi> too, or they have done Cures by a Medicine or two, which have been blow'd at in vaine by good Phyſicians? 5. It was done by K. <hi>James</hi> his earneſt entreaty; and we know, how far the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a great Perſon, a Prince, may tranſport a man, his ſervant, even againſt Reaſon, much more where there was Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. We can produce an example of a French K. in a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> who being prohibited all <hi>Wine</hi> by his <hi>Phyſicians</hi>; did ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune his Servants for that <hi>liquor,</hi> as they gave him his <hi>fill,</hi> and that of the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> too, whereby he was not only <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> but his <hi>Fever cured.</hi> 6. The chief Witneſſes againſt the Duke were <hi>Ramſey</hi> and <hi>Egliſham,</hi> the firſt to the Parliament, the other to the Kingdome by his <hi>pen,</hi> both of them of ſo bad a Reputation, that their teſtimony was not to be taken againſt a private man; the <hi>former</hi> being <hi>expell'd,</hi> or enforced to relinquiſh the Colledge of <hi>London</hi> for his ill-behavior, who will <hi>lie, ſwear, flatter,</hi> do any <hi>vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany</hi>: the <hi>latter</hi> expell'd from his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or rather of no Religion, and of as little <hi>honeſty</hi> or <hi>learning,</hi> a man of a crackt Braine too. 8. For K. <hi>James</hi> his own Clamour, his <hi>word</hi> that way was no <hi>Slander.</hi> How often hath <hi>Treaſon</hi> been in his Mouth, when he was but croſt or diſturb'd in his <hi>ſports</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations</hi>? I have heard, <hi>the King of Sweden</hi> us'd to make himſelf merry with that Expreſſion of King <hi>James,</hi> upon an accidentall <hi>cut</hi> of his <hi>finger</hi> by his <hi>Carver.</hi> 9. That the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> was in the <hi>declination,</hi> was uncertaine. Sometimes one <hi>fit flatters,</hi> and the next <hi>kills. Phyſicians</hi> love to ſpeak <hi>Placentia,</hi> eſpecially to <hi>Great Patients.</hi> We have lately had an <hi>Experiment</hi> of that in the L. <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> who died of a <hi>Corn</hi> in his <hi>Toe,</hi> and that preſently after his <hi>Phyſician</hi> had made his <hi>Attendants</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> ſecure of his <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> Nor is it ſometimes amiſſe in reference to the <hi>Cure,</hi> to feed them with <hi>hopes,</hi> and to cheriſh their <hi>conceit,</hi> which is, though but of ſmall <hi>reality,</hi> yet of no ſmall <hi>Conſequence.</hi> Beſides, at that time it was given out by them ſo; One of the <hi>ableſt</hi> told the reſt, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57533:14"/>
divers others, That the Kings <hi>diſeaſe</hi> was <hi>mortall, and would ſurely ſpeed him</hi>; giving this reaſon, <hi>That he had twenty Patients that year, and none of them recover'd, under ſixteen fits, but the</hi> King <hi>had not ſtrength enough to endure twelve.</hi> Beſides, that was the year, which preceded the <hi>great Sicknes</hi>; before which, uſually <hi>diſeaſes</hi> have much <hi>Malignancy,</hi> and oftentimes put tricks upon the <hi>beſt Phyſicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As <hi>to his Majeſty,</hi> that now is, Thoſe who were converſant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> about him, both Phyſicians and others give this account, <hi>that they are confident, he knew not any of thoſe Paſſages.</hi> In that he brought off the <hi>Duke,</hi> he might think himſelf bound by a <hi>three-fold Cord,</hi> of <hi>Honour, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> becauſe that which was the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Accuſation</hi> was his <hi>owne ſervice,</hi> at leaſt, pretended ſo to be. Of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> becauſe he had done King <hi>James no hurt,</hi> did it in obedience to King <hi>James</hi> his owne command, intended him all good; and was proſecuted by his Adverſaries upon another Score and Spite. Of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> alſo, it being well known, how deeply the <hi>Duke</hi> had wound himſelf into the <hi>Kings favour</hi> (I diſpute not, how juſtly) the very laws of <hi>friendſhip</hi> call'd for <hi>relief at his hands,</hi> when he ſaw the <hi>Duke</hi> in <hi>danger</hi> to be <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. H. Martin</hi> himſelfe, the moſt profeſſed <hi>enemy</hi> unto the King, thought ſo meanly of this <hi>Accuſation,</hi> that he onely made ſport of it: when in ſome company it was ſpoken of, told them, <hi>(if it were true) It was the onely good action he had ever done in his life, and therefore deſired he might not be alwaies twitted with that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now let all the world judge of the abominable Iniquity of theſe men, that lay to the <hi>charge</hi> of their owne Prince things that he knew not, things of that ugly Stamp, that a loyall Subject dares not put them into words.</p>
               <p>We may adde unto all that hath bin ſaid in defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſingular <hi>obſervance</hi> and <hi>dutifulneſſe</hi> of his owne <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> towards himſelf, a <hi>comfort</hi> ſeldome vouchſafed, but as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of former <hi>obedience.</hi> God obſerves, for the moſt part, a <hi>proportion</hi> in all his <hi>Retributions</hi>; and puniſheth, as it were, <hi>in Specie,</hi> according to the nature of our Offences, in their own kind.</p>

Nor can I underſtand, that he made ſcruple at any of thoſe Cates, which were cook'd by a Hand, that had been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and held up againſt him in the field. Whatſoever his <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> were, he <hi>was himſelf</hi> ſtill

But <hi>Murder,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Parricide</hi> is a <hi>Fury,</hi> which keeps the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in a continuall Alarme, and preſents unto all the Senſes, objects of <hi>horrour</hi> and approaching <hi>vengeance.</hi> The Hiſtory is known of <hi>Nero,</hi> who never could endure a <hi>clap of Thunder,</hi> after the <hi>murder</hi> of his own <hi>Mother</hi>; but crept even <hi>under his Bed,</hi> or into the <hi>cloſeſt Corner</hi> he could poſſibly find, at the <hi>noiſe</hi> of it. And I need not enlarge that ſtory of a Prince, who hearing Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſinging in his Palace, fancied they ſung it clearly, That <hi>he was his Fathers murderer,</hi> and therefore cauſed them to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued and beaten downe.

               <p>I muſt acknowledge, that I expected with this, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſhould have been charged with the Death of his elder Brother Prince <hi>Henry</hi> alſo: for I know, <hi>That</hi> had a place in the firſt rude draught of the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his Crimes, which was <hi>compos'd</hi> in the <hi>Army.</hi> But the <hi>Houſe</hi> remembred, <hi>his Majeſty</hi> was but <hi>twelve years</hi> of <hi>Age,</hi> and ſo that was expung'd.</p>

Have but a little patience, to eye their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards all men they have had to deal with. In relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the King, Have they not broke the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> wherein they have ſworne to beare faith and true <hi>Allegiance</hi> to His Majeſties perſon, and to defend the ſame againſt all Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, &amp;c?

               <p>In relation to the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> How ſtrangely have they falne ſhort of their Truſt?

Another Parliament muſt be call' within theſe three years; and the Kingdome is ſo totally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that it is Ten to one, but That would attaint the Members of This.</hi> Many of them, who are <hi>Fathers,</hi> have by their <hi>Power</hi> and Intereſt already brought in, not onely their <hi>eldeſt Children</hi> (ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57533:17"/>
in their Nonage, and Children indeed) but <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> as the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> who hath three of his owne Sons in the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> They were entruſted by the people (I trow) to eaſe them of their <hi>Grievances,</hi> eſtabliſh the <hi>liberty</hi> of their <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſettle the <hi>propriety</hi> in their Eſtates: yet let me beſpeak them in the words of one, that hath loſt his bloud in their ſervice, <hi>Mr. Lilburne</hi> by name, <hi>I challenge them to ſhew one Act, they have done for the benefit of the people.</hi> We feel their little finger heavier then the Loynes of the <hi>King</hi> with all his <hi>Predeceſſours.</hi> They have brought us from the <hi>Government</hi> of one <hi>King,</hi> who was bound up by law, to the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> of 5 or 600 of themſelves, nay every petty Committe-man, every inſolent Officer, whoſe Will and Luſt is their Law; ſo into an Aegyptian Vaſſalage, a condition worſe <hi>then that of the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of France,</hi> of <hi>the Boores in Flanders,</hi> of <hi>the Slaves in Turkie,</hi> (to uſe a mans word, of their owne ſide.) What can we call our owne, if one of the <hi>Grandees,</hi> or his Friends mouth waters after it?

This <hi>last Army</hi> had the ſame doome; but they tooke better Courage, and knew their owne ſtrength. The <hi>Scots</hi> (however ſtroakt with the name of Brethren to this day) were ſerv'd with the ſelf-ſame ſauce, and put to retreat (faſter then was for their Eaſe) from <hi>Newarke</hi> toward their own Confines, with a great Body of Horſe at their heels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>City</hi> (unto whoſe bloud and treaſure they owe their bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whatever they have) rings again of their breach of Truſt and faith with them. Inſtead of <hi>Signall marks of the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> their <hi>Priviledges, Recompences for all their offices of love.</hi> Their <hi>Works</hi> are demoliſhed.

Their <hi>Trades</hi> decayed, threatned to be quite ruined. Their late <hi>Lord Major</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> (ſome of which were their faſteſt friends and Zelots) impeached for their lives upon no ground. Their whole <hi>Common Councell</hi> menaced. Divers of their <hi>Ableſt Members</hi> marked out already for deſtruction. Nay, the whole City kept in continuall feares of fire or ſword, or other violence by them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſembly-men</hi> and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> give no better accompt of their faith toward them neither. How did they tickle them at the beginning of theſe troubles with Engagements and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for a <hi>Church-Government</hi> to their content, making them a <hi>glorious Clergy,</hi> eſtabliſhing a free and full <hi>maintenance for Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Ministers</hi>?

               <p>We will not twit them with their deceitfull <hi>Ordinances, of ſelf-deniall,</hi> (which onely broke the ice to ingroſſement of all Places and Offices of profit into Members hands or their Confidents to Diſtribution of at leaſt 300000l. of our Eſtates amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) Of <hi>Accompts</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> (by which they have encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their expences many thouſands without mention to perfect, or call any man to refund) Of <hi>hearing complaints againſt bribery and injuſtice of their Members</hi> (whereby they may take notice of the Perſon that dares queſtion any of their Houſes, and after they have worried him there, by a fruitleſſe and chargeable attendance, find ſome advantage to break his back) nor many ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Nor yet ſtop they there, in falſifications of their owne; but they <hi>compell others to break their Oaths</hi> and <hi>Promiſes.</hi> (I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now of thoſe Oaths they force upon the Conſciences of ſuch men, as had rather truſt God with their Soules, then them with their Bodies and Eſtates) They have compelled their owne ſide to break thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Engagements,</hi> which they had ſtruck up; witneſſe the <hi>Ceſſations in York-ſhire,</hi> made by the late Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and that in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> Nay, themſelves entertain'd, and by their <hi>Ministers</hi> perſwaded ſome Hundreds of Men taken Priſoners at <hi>Brainceford,</hi> and diſmiſs'd by the <hi>King,</hi> upon their

               <p>Laſt of all, Is it not a great part of their Quarrell againſt the King, that they cannot enforce him to forget his Oath, whereby he ſtands obliged to defend the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>her Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>? that he will not yeild <hi>up the Laws of the Land,</hi> to be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modell'd according to their Luſts, and the <hi>Power to protect his Subjects</hi> (which he is bound by Oath to do) into their hands, that they may oppreſs them at their pleaſure? how infinite is this Argument?

               <p n="1">1. That a particular <hi>Toleration</hi> had a former preſident, even in Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (whom they never durſt accuſe for a favourer of Papiſts) in thoſe Articles of Marriage, which were conſented to, with the Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> Where, by the way, you may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in her time, Maſter <hi>Stubs,</hi> a Lawyer, but a great Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, and one Maſter <hi>Page</hi> had their hands cut off, for writing a Tract againſt that Match, which they had entituled, <hi>The Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of a Child of God with the Son of Antichrist. Camb. Elizab. An.</hi> 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if the Intelligence were true (which theſe Accuſers take from an ordinary <hi>News-monger</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi>) of an univerſal Toleration agreed upon, it was <hi>Intuitu majoris Boni.</hi> The <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> was to be reſtored again, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> to be re-enſtated in <hi>their Poſſeſſions</hi> upon that Condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this was King <hi>James</hi> his Act, not King <hi>Charles</hi> his, who was onely paſſive therein, and to whoſe hand theſe Articles were beaten before his comming into <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. Whoſoever knows the Cuſtome of the <hi>Court,</hi> knows it to be no ſtrange matter of Truſt with a <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in any ſudden emergency, when there cannot be recourſe unto the <hi>King</hi>; eſpecially when there are generall <hi>Instructions</hi> left, and ſometimes the very matter made ready, the forme only referred to his diſcretion. Nay further, there are ſome of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> can teſtifie, how familiar it is for a <hi>Secretary</hi> of State to entruſt the ſame with his owne <hi>Secretaries</hi>; and how impoſſible it is to diſpatch buſineſſes of <hi>haste</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuch remedy. I have heard, the like is not unuſuall with his <hi>Excellency the Lord Fairfax,</hi> and other Great Commanders, to give their Servants of Truſt, leave to ſubſcribe their names for them, in matters of common concernment, I am ſure Col. <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayring</hi> the <hi>Paſſe-maker,</hi> (<hi>which was the best Trade he ever drove</hi>) in time of greateſt danger to the City and affrightment alſo, left his <hi>Hand and Seale</hi> with many of his Servants, to fill up with the names of ſuch Perſons, as they ſhould think fit. Nay, but doe not the <hi>Houſes themſelves</hi> daily ſo, or more in matters of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, by their Power delegated unto the <hi>Keepers of the Great Seale, Privy-Seale,</hi> and their ordinary <hi>Courts of Justice,</hi> their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State,</hi> and perſons officiating in Truſt under them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he were a notorious favourer of Papiſts, His Majeſty might likely not know ſo much of him; Servants being generally ſtudious to conceale their faults from their Maſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If His Majeſty did know it, yet Places of Truſt have been often delegated by Princes to ſuch as have been of a Perſwaſion contrary to theirs, whom they have found Perſons capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Even Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelfe did ſend the Viſcount <hi>Montacute</hi> upon an Embaſſy to <hi>Spaine,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to juſtifie the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> though he were a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as <hi>Camden</hi> hath it in <hi>her Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas it is added, the King would not leave any ſuch with his Parliament:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Caſe is different, if it be meant, with them for paſſing

               <p n="2">2. There was no need in ſo ſhort an abſence of His Majeſty, whileſt Bills are ſo long in debate, before they come to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

               <p>But the Plot to cut all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> throats is ſo brim-full of Malice, that it confutes it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <head>That Charge Anſwered.</head>
               <p>To the firſt, The <hi>Principle</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> holds out, was ever taken for Truth heretofore.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All his <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> in this, all <hi>Soveraigne Princes</hi> in other <hi>States</hi> have made claime hereto, (and for ought I have heard, were never queſtioned before for it.) To paſſe by King <hi>James</hi> and all others which might admit exception, Hear what Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaith, <hi>Although Kings and Princes Soveraigne, owing their Homage and ſervice only unto Almighty God, the King of all Kings, and in that reſpect not bound to yeild account or render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Actions to any other but God their Soveraigne, yet (though among the most ancient and Chriſtian Monarchs, the ſame Lord God hath committed unto us the Soveraignty of this Kingdome of England, and other Dominions, which we hold immediately of the ſame Almighty God, and ſo thereby accompt only to his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,) We are, notwithſtanding this our Prerogative, moved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, &amp;c.</hi> In a Declaration of the cauſes moving her to give aſſiſtance to the Netherlands, printed by her own Printer, 1585.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lawyers</hi> of the Kingdome have conſtantly taught us the ſame, who call the King <hi>Caput &amp; Principium Parliamenti, Pater Patriae,</hi> the <hi>Head and beginning of his Parliament,</hi> the <hi>father of his Country</hi>; who alſo tell us expreſſely, <hi>Omnis ſub Rege, Ipſe ſub nullo, niſi Deo. Non eſt inferior ſibi ſubjectis,</hi> and <hi>Rex non habet ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem, niſi Deum, ſatis habet ad panam, quòd Deum expectat ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem.</hi> The King <hi>hath no Peere in this</hi> Land, and <hi>he cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The <hi>Regality of the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is immediately ſubject to God, and to none other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This very <hi>Parliament</hi> hath made a tacite acknowledgment hereof, as well as all others, by taking the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> by making their Addreſſes to the King under the notion of his <hi>leige</hi> men, and moſt <hi>humble ſubjects,</hi> and by their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Petitions.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57533:23"/>4. It hath been the practiſe of all Ages, and was of this preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> to decline <hi>the King,</hi> even in thoſe things which had been acted by his Commands, and to fall upon the <hi>Miniſters</hi>; according to the ſenſe of that Law Maxime, <hi>The King can do no wrong.</hi> It were ſtrange now, that the Children might call the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to an account, The Heele lift it ſelf againſt, or the Members queſtion the Head, The Subject over-top the Soveraigne. The Fable hath a good Morall, and I doubt is verified in our times. The Taile of the Dragon once made that pretence of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the Head; but having obtained the liberty to Lead, after a great deale of toyle led all the Body into a ditch. But this being granted and proved, how will the conſequence enſue? It is not the exemption from Accompt, which makes a Tyrant, but owning no Law, making his Will and Pleaſure to be the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of all his Actions. There is no State, wherein there is not an <hi>ultimate Judicature,</hi> which is not to be Accomptable. By this rule all Government ſhould be Tyrannous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That both <hi>Houſes</hi> can make no Law, they themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I am ſure the Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> in his fourth booke, Printed by their own ſpeciall Command, doth often. That they can declare a Law is againſt reaſon. If the <hi>King</hi> be neceſſary to the making, doubtleſſe he is alſo to concur in the Interpretation, otherwiſe to what purpoſe doth his Councell ſerve? But to arrogate a Power to <hi>declare</hi> a Law, contrary to the evident ſenſe or interpretation received ever ſince it was made, even though a hundred or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, is a monſtrous uſurpation, and the greateſt evidence of a <hi>Tyrannicall</hi> ſpirit, that is poſſible. If they have a power to interpret only according to the evidence of the letter, or former acceptation, where then is the Priviledge? and what need there be a quarrell?</p>

               <head>The Improbability of this Charge.</head>
               <p n="1">1. This cannot be eaſily admitted for a truth, That the <hi>King</hi> ſhould hate a <hi>Parliament</hi>: if you conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was an <hi>Advocate</hi> for them in his <hi>Fathers</hi> time, and by his Endevour procured many good Laws for them in his days, which was <hi>confeſſed</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as you may find in the <hi>Journall</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to give them ſatisfaction, he preſſed his Father againſt his Reſolution and Reaſon to begin a War with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and obtained it: though King <hi>James</hi> like a Prophet told him, <hi>That it was not their Hate toward the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>nor their Zeale to the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Cauſe, which moved them to put him upon that ſuit, But a deſigne to bring him into a</hi> Nooſe; <hi>that being in diſtreſſe by reaſon of it, they might deſert him, and then make their Markets of the Crowne</hi>; And he did particularly acquaint him with the ſteps and Gradations, which they would proceed in; firſt queſtion and ſtrip him of his <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> then bind his hands from making other Proviſion for himſelf; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bring him upon his knees to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since his <hi>Reigne,</hi> never any <hi>King</hi> called more <hi>Parliaments</hi> then <hi>He,</hi> for ſo ſhort a ſpace, notwithſtanding thoſe <hi>twelve years</hi> Intermiſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> never offered more <hi>compliance,</hi> or performed more <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> then <hi>He</hi> did.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, few <hi>Kings</hi> have teſtified a greater deſire of <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with,</hi> or of <hi>condeſcention</hi> to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> then <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> hath done by this:</p>

               <p>To the firſt particular, I anſwer: 1. By way of Conceſſion; that <hi>Parliaments</hi> were under long diſ-uſe.</p>
               <p>But 2. that it might be out of ſome fore-ſight and ſenſe of this tumultuous Spirit in its ſecret workings, of which the <hi>King</hi> might think by <hi>abstinence</hi> and <hi>diet</hi> to correct their <hi>Luxuriancy.</hi> It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no hate to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> to deſire it might contain it ſelf in the bounds of its ancient <hi>moderation</hi>; and ſo a fair <hi>correſpondence</hi> be maintained between the <hi>Crowne</hi> and the <hi>People.</hi> And this Judge <hi>Hutton</hi> in his <hi>Argument</hi> could not chuſe but touch upon, if you pleaſe to peruſe him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding this reaſon for it, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had made an acknowledgement hereof as of an Errour, engaging himſelf to redreſſe it for the future.</p>
               <p>Nay, 4. did apply himſelf to that particular way, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves propoſed, a <hi>Trienniall Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Further yet, when <hi>that</hi> gave not <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> by a <hi>law</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this preſent <hi>Parliament</hi> to the length of their own deſires.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Herein <hi>His Majeſty</hi> did no more then all his <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> Look upward, and you will find it practiſed.

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57533:26"/>2. The <hi>King</hi> did never Diſſolve any, but upon their own <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers</hi> and for <hi>mutinous deportment</hi>; and then it was <hi>providence</hi> to cure an <hi>evill</hi> in the <hi>beginning,</hi> and <hi>cruſh</hi> a <hi>ſerpent</hi> in the <hi>ſhell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This very <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> doth at this time entertaine within their walls, one Inſtrument of the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, I mean Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> whoſe falſe <hi>ſuggestions</hi> were the <hi>occaſion</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> Breaking it up. If you have not heard the <hi>ſtory,</hi> then take here the plain truth of it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Parliament was willing to give the</hi> King a ſumme, <hi>in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of</hi> Ship-money; <hi>and an offer was made, ſo the</hi> King <hi>would relinquiſh his title thereunto of</hi> ſix Subſidies. His Majeſty <hi>was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to comply, and in order thereunto gave Sir</hi> Hen. Vane <hi>and others a command to ſignifie ſo much unto the Houſe. But Sir</hi> Henry, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the directions, demands and inſists on</hi> Twelve. <hi>Whereupon, the Houſe is put into ſome diſtemper; which Sir</hi> Henry <hi>repreſents unto His Majesty with the utmoſt Aggravation, and ſome Addition too, whereupon His Majesty</hi> Diſſolves it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Searching of Pockets, and afterwards Impriſoning, Anſwered.</head>
               <p>To this we give this accompt, 1. That it was no <hi>Breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,</hi> when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was diſſolv'd. The <hi>Elements</hi> are but of ordinary uſe, <hi>extra rationem Sacramenti</hi>: by that time they were reduced to their proper <hi>ſphear</hi>; and why may not the <hi>King</hi> upon reaſons of <hi>State,</hi> ſend to ſearch the <hi>Pockets</hi> and <hi>Cloſets</hi> of any private man? when he found the <hi>correſpondence</hi> between his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>himſelf</hi> to be <hi>ſhaken,</hi> who could blame him to <hi>ſearch</hi> the <hi>cause of it</hi> to the bottome, that he might <hi>prevent it</hi> for the future?</p>
               <p>Though the King did impriſon them, it was in an Honourable way; he made them ſuch an Allowance, that Maſter <hi>Long</hi> hath profeſſed, he ſpent the King 1500l. there; after which rate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it might be of a Surfet, that thoſe died, who are obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Themſelves never made dainty of it to <hi>impriſon</hi> their <hi>own Members,</hi> during their <hi>Seſſion,</hi> without any <hi>cauſe expreſt</hi> in their <hi>Warrants,</hi> and without any <hi>Allowance</hi> for their <hi>ſubſiſtance.</hi> What

               <head>The Kings charging of the <hi>5</hi> Members, anſwered, and retorted.</head>
               <p n="1">1. This is true indeed, that the <hi>King</hi> did <hi>charge</hi> or <hi>impeach</hi> ſo many of the <hi>Houſe:</hi> but then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His Majesty</hi> had ſome reaſon ſure. Whoſoever reads the <hi>Articles,</hi> and compares the <hi>Conſequences,</hi> will find them high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and be convinced of their truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you conſider the <hi>Kings</hi> proceedings thereupon, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation of his own way and error in the <hi>proceſſe,</hi> if it juſtled with any <hi>unknown Priviledge,</hi> his deſire of their <hi>direction,</hi> and (when nothing elſe would give Content) his utter with-drawing of the <hi>Charge,</hi> and if you reflect withall upon what other <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> have done, what the Law gives out, to wit, <hi>There is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for Treaſon,</hi> you cannot chuſe, but admire his <hi>lenity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This is no more, then they have ſuffered, if not encouraged the <hi>Army,</hi> (their own Servants) to doe, unto double that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their <hi>Houſes,</hi> and ſome of the ſame <hi>Members,</hi> that had been charged by the <hi>King</hi>; and this too upon leſſe <hi>ground,</hi> if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all,</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="1">1. Though <hi>His Majesty</hi> went unto the <hi>Houſe,</hi> there was no <hi>aſſault</hi> made or intended by him, as far as can appear, without their Comment. It had been a deſperate attempt, with ſo few to ſet upon ſo many, and thoſe backt by ſo great a power, and

had ſeru'd themſelves ſo far into the affections of the <hi>City.</hi> If any wild <hi>expreſſion</hi> fell from the mouth of one or two of his <hi>retinue,</hi> why were they not ſeized on and queſtioned?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This hath been ſo often acknowledged for an Errour by him, yet ſtill objected by them, that me-thinks they might bluſh at this mention of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What did he doe therein, which themſelves had not been guilty of before it, and much out-done ſince? We remember the <hi>robustious Petition</hi> of the <hi>Porters,</hi> and we know at what rates ſome of them were <hi>hired,</hi> by what <hi>devices</hi> others were <hi>cheated thereinto,</hi> it being told them, <hi>it was a Petition, that Water-men ſhould be prohibited to carry Burdens.</hi> The <hi>Poaſting of Names,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>Members</hi> of different judgment to the fury of the <hi>madding Multitude,</hi> was a kind of <hi>Force</hi> ſure.

               <head>Bringing the Army to <hi>London,</hi> anſwered, and retorted.</head>
               <p n="1">1. None of thoſe <hi>Examinations</hi> (which we have read over, all of them) doe hold out clearly, that the <hi>King</hi> did intend to bring them up to <hi>London,</hi> onely to put them in a poſture for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was limited, according to the <hi>Fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome,</hi> and the <hi>Liberty of the Subject.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>That I may Anſwer theſe, I ſhall lay for a Ground, That all <hi>Graunts</hi> and <hi>Letters-Patents</hi> of the <hi>King of England</hi> are not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies</hi>; though concerning Trade, or Manufacture, or the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Subject, or be appropriated to one man or more, as <hi>Charters, Priviledges, to Cities, to Townes Corporate, to Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Companies of Trade, Cuſtome-houſe-officers, the Regiſters-office in Chancery</hi> (now enjoyed by Mr. <hi>Miles Corbet</hi> and <hi>Goodwin,</hi> two Members) the Clerks of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and many ſuch like; which were unqueſtionably uſed to be granted by the <hi>Kings</hi> of this Land, in order to the governing and well-being thereof. But thoſe onely, which are notoriouſly evil before, or diſcovered to be ſo after, and are not for the manner of granting them, but for the matter accounted invalid. And therefore many great things of high Concernment to the Common-wealth have juſtly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to this day do enjoy the warrant of Law and Authority, which were never confirmed by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> whilſt others of leſſe moment have troubled all the three Eſtates for an Act of <hi>Parliamnet,</hi> as Hunting the <hi>Hare,</hi> Paving of certaine Streets in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now we Anſwer. 1. That theſe were ſuggeſted by <hi>Citizens</hi> or men skilfull in thoſe wayes and Advantages, which might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to the reſpective Trades or Manufactures, and ſo redound to the benefit of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57533:30"/>2. That His <hi>Majesty</hi> did alwayes make reference of theſe to his <hi>Counſell,</hi> and to others learned in the Law, as his <hi>Attorney, Sollicitor general,</hi> and Maſters <hi>of Requeſts</hi> (as divers yet alive can teſtifie, and <hi>Judge Jenkins</hi> hath teſtified to the view of all the world) that they might examine the juſtice of them, and their proportion to the eſtabliſhed Laws, and that <hi>His Majesty</hi> hath often given ſtrict charge of great Caution even unto them in their determinations; by which meanes multitudes of Monopolies which were by <hi>Citizens</hi> and others daily repreſented and preſſed on, were rejected, and the Authors received a Check.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That even thoſe Grants, wherein there was no diſcoverable Inconvenience, but much benefit pretended to the Kingdome, were for the moſt part made but Probationers by him; whereas either in the Patent it ſelf there was limitation expreſſed, and a Proviſo for their revocation, if they appeared contrary to Law, or of damage to the Kingdome; or there was a Bond entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Parties entruſted unto that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That upon any complaint made againſt them he cauſed it to be heard (ſometimes did it Perſonally) at the Councell-Table, where the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Judges</hi> of his Privy Councell aſſiſted him; and about the beginning of the year 1640. when he found the Complaints to multiply againſt them, inſtead of hearing the Patentees, he diſanulled their Patents by Proclamation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That divers of them are continued untill this day, as the Poſt-office upon Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> of the Houſe. The Lord of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi> The Merchant Adventurers. The <hi>Greenland</hi> trade, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. That many of thoſe, who either ſit in the Houſes, or are in great Offices of truſt about them, and are their Favourites, were the Contrivers, and Inſtruments hereof, yet were never under queſtion; as Sir <hi>John Evelin,</hi> who had the firſt Monopoly of

               <head>The Generall Anſwer.</head>
               <p>That the <hi>King</hi> did not begin the War, may firſt be concluded from the <hi>improbability</hi> thereof:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Themſelves aſſoile the <hi>King</hi> from that <hi>fierceneſſe of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>inclination to war,</hi> when they make that Comment upon the Lord <hi>Digby's</hi> Letter, who writing to the <hi>Queen,</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſages, hath this for one, <hi>I have taken the hardineſſe to write unto His Majesty, according as his Affairs and Complexion requires</hi>; which they interpret to be a <hi>Mildneſſe of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a very vaſt <hi>diſproportion</hi> between his <hi>ſtrength</hi> and theirs: for 1. The <hi>Affections of the people,</hi> and the <hi>wealth</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> were all at their devotion; the <hi>King</hi> being looked on but a-ſquint (though cauſleſly) by his Subjects. 2. The <hi>Ammunition</hi> and <hi>Armes</hi> of the Kingdome in their power. 3. The <hi>Navy</hi> at
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57533:36"/>
their diſpoſe. <hi>What King</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>going to war againſt another, ſits not downe firſt, and conſiders whether he be able with his ten thouſand to meet him that commeth againſt him with his twenty thouſand</hi>? It could not have ſtood on this ſide <hi>madneſſe,</hi> for our <hi>King</hi> to harbour ſuch a Reſolution, to meet them, or ſet on them rather, that had I will not ſay 20000. but 200000. againſt his One.</p>
               <p>Secondly, granting their proofs all true, by what <hi>Logick</hi> doth it follow, that all this was done by the <hi>King,</hi> with an intention to leavy war againſt the <hi>Parliament</hi>? A <hi>Preparation</hi> may be for <hi>Defence</hi> as well as for <hi>Aſſault.</hi> We have not forgotten, that it was one of their <hi>own Arguments,</hi> whereby they preſſed for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kingdom into a Poſture of the <hi>Militia</hi> under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe <hi>they heard of great preparations in Spaine, France, Denmarke,</hi> and God knows where. At this time they themſelves doe fortifie <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> have farced thereinto a Garriſon of 3000 men, into <hi>Tinmouth-Caſtle</hi> 600. &amp;c. But would they be well pleaſed with that inference, <hi>Therefore they intend to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scots</hi>? If a Ship at Sea diſcover a Man-of-War, it is no Defiance to clear her Guns, open her Port-holes, let down her Waſt-cloaths, &amp;c. In <hi>Spaine,</hi> if one man draw his Sword, all the Company draw theirs alſo preſently, whatſoever the Occaſion be. I have heard of a Gentleman who never ſees another take up a Sword in his hand, to look on, to ſhew, to buy, but ſtreight he draws his owne; and gives this reaſon, <hi>Doe I know what the Devill may tempt him to</hi>? When His Majeſty perceived ſuch <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall</hi> and <hi>unſeemly Expreſſions, High and inſolent Demands,</hi> No ſatisfaction he could give <hi>accepted, Words</hi> uttered in his face, that <hi>he was</hi> not <hi>worthy to</hi> Reigne, and thoſe by <hi>Apprentices,</hi> and by the <hi>ſcum</hi> of the people, The power of the <hi>Parliament to Depoſe Kings,</hi> His indeſerts for that high Place, liberally in all Companies made the diſcourſe of their <hi>Confidents,</hi> yea of their own <hi>Members,</hi> The <hi>Militia</hi> not only <hi>demanded,</hi> but <hi>wrung</hi> out of his hands, His own <hi>Ammunition</hi> ſeized on, <hi>Towns fortified</hi> againſt him, The <hi>Navy diſpoſed</hi> of contrary to his deſires, Was it not then high time for him to look about him, to project his own Safety, to prepare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Storm thus hanging over his head? which if he had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to do, he muſt have caſt himſelf <hi>down at their feet</hi>; and ſo had

he made good what at the beginning of theſe Troubles (for want of other Accuſation) they ſpar'd not to beſpatter him withall, <hi>That he was but a degree from an Ideot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Proofs in particular,</hi> they are ſo frivolous, and yet have had ſuch frequent effectuall Anſwers in His <hi>Majesties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi> (which are to be ſeen in print, publiſhed by <hi>Husbands</hi> their owne Printer, and are ſo very well known among us) that I will ſpare both my ſelf and the Reader the paines to inſert them in this place.</p>

               <head>This Charge made good upon themſelves.</head>
               <p>But to lay the Childe at the right fathers doore, The truth is, though this War were the <hi>Hand of God</hi> upon us all for our Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, and the firſt Riſe of it were almoſt as unſearchable as the Head of the <hi>Nile,</hi> yet are there ſome Tracks, that infallibly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it upon the <hi>Houſes.</hi> If you will allow the <hi>firſt defiance</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the War, it was the <hi>Parliaments Remonſtrance</hi> (<hi>piget meminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe</hi>) ſent unto the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> which ſome of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt conteſted againſt, and among others upon this Ground for one, <hi>That it muſt be preſented upon the point of a ſword.</hi> If you make it to relate unto the <hi>firſt Guard,</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> raiſed that, when the <hi>King</hi> was in <hi>Scotland.</hi> If to the <hi>firſt violence,</hi> It came from the Tumults at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for juſtice on the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and for expulſion of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> acted by the <hi>Citizens,</hi> but incited and incouraged by <hi>Members</hi> of their owne <hi>Houſe</hi>; Beſides the Conducting of the <hi>five Members</hi> by a juſt <hi>Army</hi> to the <hi>Houſe</hi> by land, and beſieging as well as ſhooting at <hi>White-Hall</hi> by water.

Indeed, we muſt acknowledge, the <hi>King</hi> trod in their ſteps, ſometimes foote-hot, and moſt an end wrought by the Pattern, they had cut out for him.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing may further be cleared by the <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of their <hi>friends,</hi> that there could be no war; that it

was enough for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to raiſe an Army, the <hi>King</hi> would never be able to do it, or at leaſt ſo as to ballance theirs; and then he muſt lie at their Mercy.

               <p>Now to clear His <hi>Majeſty</hi> from the Charge of refuſing Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Peace, or Overtures to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It can hardly obtaine credence with a prudent man, that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould turne the deaf eare toward a <hi>just Peace,</hi> becauſe it was for his own Intereſt. Both ſides fought upon his ſcore; thoſe that died in the quarrell againſt him, were his Subjects. He was the poorer for the very Plunder and deſtruction, that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Enemies. He had three <hi>Crownes</hi> at ſtake. His eares and eyes were continually filled with the deſolations of his Country, &amp; the ſpoile of the people. In his owne Perſon he was ſtript of all the uſuall Comforts of his life, and for moſt part hunted as a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge upon the Mountaines,</hi> and in continuall danger. Whereas our Maſters at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> continually gain'd by that, which other men loſt by. How elſe were it poſſible, that they and ſo many of their <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> ſhould ſtart up into ſuch <hi>Estates,</hi> from the very dunghill, or a loſt condition? They were at little ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſome of them being of an Eſtate, twice or thrice ſold or morgag'd for more then the worth, others worth nothing. They <hi>made sport</hi> with the Relations of Burnings and Maſſacres, and heard them as ſome <hi>Romance,</hi> when themſelves ſate voting ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſnorting upon their downe-beds, feeding upon the delicacies of the Kingdome, dividing the ſpoiles of it among

themſelves, even at leaſt 300000. l. profeſſedly, (to ſay nothing now of Clandeſtine wayes, cleanly Cheates, Offices, &amp;c.) Beſides, they were well acquainted with that Maxime of <hi>Alexander of Parma, That when Subjects draw their ſwords againſt their Prince, they muſt fling away the ſcabbard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If you reviſe the pretended <hi>Petitions,</hi> you will find they were (for the moſt part) as great <hi>Reproaches,</hi> as ever otherwiſe were caſt upon the <hi>King,</hi> ſuch as muſt needs beget a <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their <hi>Anſwer</hi> in their very <hi>Fore-heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They were not <hi>Petitions for Peace,</hi> but rather <hi>Admonitions</hi> to the King to ſubmit, to deveſt himſelf of his ſtrength and power to protect his people, for to ſacrifice his friends, to caſt himſelfe upon their Mercy. Who could blame either them for making ſuch Petitions, or the <hi>King</hi> for denying them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you know the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Deſignes</hi> they drove therein, ſo well as we who ſate neere the Chaire, and ſometimes convers'd with the Councell, you would reſt fully ſatisfied, that they were rather to get wind of the <hi>King,</hi> to appeaſe the people, and winne their <hi>Affections</hi> by a ſeeming diſſembled <hi>Affection</hi> and purſuit of what they ſo much gaſped after; when <hi>God</hi> knowes, they never harbour'd the leaſt expectation or deſire of Condeſcenſion from the <hi>King</hi>; and that they made no bones to confeſſe among their <hi>Confidents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

Whereas they never yet made any, but ſuch as expected from him, 1. To ſacrifice his <hi>Honour.</hi> 2. To violate his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> 3. To give his faſteſt <hi>friends</hi> for a victime unto the fury of their Enemies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is too evident a truth, that whatſoever they pretended of an Inclination to a Compoſure or making up the Breach, it was but to <hi>baffle</hi> and gull the <hi>people. Ad populum phaleras.</hi> They were reſolved to hold the ſword naked, and to throw away the ſcabbard. How otherwiſe could they have proved ſuch <hi>deafe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to the many gracious Meſſages from His <hi>Majeſty</hi> (beſides the Propoſitions mentioned before?) How could they caſt behind their backs ſo many ſweet courting Letters, diſpatch'd one upon another? What Colour can they pretend, for their waving of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> interpoſure, when they made friendly offers of <hi>Mediation?

               <p n="3">3. Beſides it is not quite out of our Memory in this City, That when the generality of the better and wiſer Citizens were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> in a peaceable way to draw up a Petition for Peace, there were twenty or thirty men with drawn ſwords (of which <hi>Mainwayring's</hi> ſon was one) ſent in amongſt them to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and provoke them to a defence of themſelves, and to reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall violence, ſo that they might have ſome pretence to charge them with <hi>Mutiny</hi> and <hi>Riot</hi> (as was done by a ſcandalous and lying paper, afterward put forth by their Authority;) and that by <hi>killing</hi> ſome (as one was ſerved by <hi>Harvies</hi> owne hand) and <hi>impriſoning others,</hi> all ſuch hopes or leaſt Motions that way might
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57533:38"/>
be extinguiſhed. Nor have we forgotten, how divers <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire</hi> people, being aſſembled to like purpoſe, about the time of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> Treaty, were diſperſed by their Horſe, and ſome made Priſoners. We paſſe by many, but theſe are enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, who were the moſt reſolved againſt any peaceable Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Circumſtances of their Propoſitions clearly prove, that they were in a great <hi>fear</hi> leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould condeſcend (though they were never ſo unreaſonable) What elſe ſhould be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their limiting His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to ſix, to ten, to twenty dayes, but for fear leſt any further time and conſideration ſhould make him grant them? And what, of their requiring certaine numbers to be left to their mercy without any name, but by that means to amuſe His <hi>Majesty</hi> and keep him in ſuſpence, which of his friends ſhould be mark'd out for ſlaughter? And ſince the Armies march through <hi>London,</hi> What of their leaving all ſuch out of their Votes for Indempnity, as had any hand in that Meſſage of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 12. laſt, wherein he offered all that poſſibly could be offered, or in approbation of it? Obſerve, how they confeſſe (in their laſt Declaration for no more Addreſſes to the King) that their Propoſitions ſent to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> were the ſame in effect with thoſe at <hi>

The backwardneſſe of our <hi>Parliament</hi> to ſend any reliefe thither, which was evidenced by their diſputes and Punctilio's with the <hi>King,</hi> and indeed their denials to aſſiſt, without his perfect reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelfe to them, ſeizing money to the ſumme of 100000. l. to their owne uſe (though indeed they have paid it ſince, out of the Kingdomes purſe, upon the Clamour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and notice given of it by the <hi>King</hi>) imploying ſuch forces as were raiſed under that notion here in <hi>England</hi> againſt His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> Particularly the Regiment of <hi>Colonell Bamfield,</hi> of <hi>Chidley,</hi> and others, ſuſpending the Journey of the <hi>Earle of Leiceſter</hi> firſt, then of the <hi>Lord Liſle thither,</hi> a man of their owne Election, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his Commiſſion was almoſt expir'd, Pretending to ſend over ſuccours ſince, but letting them lie upon the Countries, untill they become intolerable, and then disbanding them as ſuper-numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, The Miſeries they expoſe their <hi>owne Army</hi> there to (of which they were ſoundly told by <hi>Captaine Cope</hi> lately, who charged them in the very Houſe <hi>with the death of Thouſands, with the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of more, and with ſtreames of Blood, which cry'd for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in that place.)</hi> To all which if you adde, 8. The fierce proſecution of <hi>Strafford,</hi> whoſe continuance in that place, and ſtrict diſcipline would have prevented that Inſurrection, or cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the ſhell. 9. Their withſtanding the ſending of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my out of the Kingdome which had diſcharged it of ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of rebellion. 10. The Profeſſion of divers of their Confidents, eſpecially in the Army, That <hi>they cannot fight againſt the Iriſh with a good Conſcience,</hi> That their quarrel is but to enjoy their Religion and Liberty, And 11. a ſpeech which was uttered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Rupture, by a true friend of theirs at <hi>Manidowne</hi> in <hi>Hamp-ſhire,</hi> when the <hi>Scots</hi> firſt came into <hi>England,</hi> What <hi>if this Kingdome ſhould riſe for their Property and Liberty, and</hi> Ireland <hi>take that Advantage, what will he be King of then?</hi> a ſhrewd ſpeech, though I beleeve the man had no fore-ſight of this Combuſtion, with many other Circumſtances. One would verily believe, the Buſtles in <hi>England</hi> and the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> were like <hi>Caſtor</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57533:46"/>
and <hi>Pollux, ovo prognatus eodem,</hi> hatch'd by a <hi>Common-Councell</hi> of <hi>Parliament &amp; Iriſh,</hi> and that they were mutually engaged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote each others Intereſt. But we muſt be ingenuous, and allow them better meaſure, then any they have yet allowed unto their <hi>Soveraigne.</hi> All we aime at, is but to open to the world, that there may be full as much, or rather a great deale more charged on themſelves, as to that Buſineſſe, then upon His <hi>Majeſty.</hi>

               <p>We are now in ſight of the ſhoare, and ſhall conclude with the buſineſſe of <hi>Rochel, which Towne (they ſay) they can fully ſhew, was betraied by the King, and ſo was there a fatall Blow given to the Proteſtant Cauſe in</hi> France; They tell us, <hi>how he lent divers of the Navy and Merchants ſhips to the King of</hi> France, <hi>to be imployed againſt thoſe, whom he was engaged to aſſiſt; And when ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders diſputed his Commands, he gave order to Sir</hi> John Pening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>to put them into the ſervice of that King, or elſe to ſinke them.</hi>

               <head>That Anſwered.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Herein they impoſe a blinde beleife upon us, we have little reaſon to take their bare word, (as we hinted before) whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is to deceive us, and who have done it ſo oft. We never yet could diſcover in them any ſuch Tenderneſſe, either in blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Kings</hi> Honour, or in covering their <hi>owne ſhame,</hi> as to conceale any thing, which was to their owne Advantage, or his diſgrace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How could his Maj. betray thoſe whom he had never taken into Protection, as at that time he had not done by them, Are they themſelves treacherous too, or have they betraied the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> againſt whom they ſent divers of the Kings Souldiers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Naſeby</hi> to be imployed in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſervice?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though it be acknowledged, that there were ſhips lent unto the King of <hi>France,</hi> yet it was not to that purpoſe, to employ them againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>; and the <hi>King of England</hi> was a ſtranger to the deſigne of the <hi>King of France</hi> therein. Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when that very Towne of <hi>Rochel</hi> was beſeiged by the <hi>King of France,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57533:47"/>
and ſome of his Subjects with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Montgomery</hi> had relei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, diſclaimed the Act, called them who did it Pirates, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhe would not protect nor afford them any ſupply. <hi>Camb. Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>King James</hi> in his life time had in effect promiſed aſſiſtance unto the <hi>French King</hi> againſt any of his Subjects, whatſoever were their Religion or their pretence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſame thing was done by the <hi>States of Holland</hi> at the ſame time, who lent unto the <hi>King of France</hi> twenty ſaile of ſhips (whereas ours were but ſeven) under the Command of <hi>Hauthain</hi> their Admiral, who did in the ſame manner demur at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, (being charm'd by ſome pittifull Letters from <hi>Rochel</hi>) untill the <hi>Rochellers</hi> treacherouſly and unawares ſurpris'd and burnt his <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi>; which rouz'd him up in good earneſt, and made him not onely ſet upon, but wholly diſcomfit them, by the helpe of our and other ſhips. Now it is very improbable, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would have conſpir'd againſt the Cauſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their owne Church-diſcipline, which the <hi>French</hi> held forth, if there had not been ſome other juſt cauſe of that War.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We might very well be tender in undertaking the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi>; for it is not quite forgotten, how Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſent over a conſiderable Army to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that upon Articles between them, which Army of hers was ſet upon and beſeiged by thoſe very men, whom they were come to defend, and expuls'd out of that Kingdome, and out of <hi>New-haven</hi> by the help of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (who by meanes of their ſuccours had gotten the better Compoſition with their own <hi>King</hi>) as you may read in Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> and others. Anno 1563.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>King</hi> did what was poſſible toward their releife, when he had the advantage of <hi>Hoſtility</hi> againſt the <hi>King of France</hi> (which he could not otherwiſe have done with any Colour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Juſtice or Policy) by ſending an Army to the <hi>Iſle of Ree,</hi> by ſending two ſeveral Fleets to their reliefe. If all ſucceeded not, that ought not to be laid in his diſh. For the Meanes onely are in mans power, God keeping events and Succeſſes in his owne. The <hi>Horſe is prepared againſt the day of Battell; but ſafety is from the Lord.</hi> It is very certaine, he did his utmoſt endeavour; I know thoſe who will teſtifie he gave the moſt earneſt Injunction poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57533:47"/>
for their Reliefe, <hi>though it ſhould prove to the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his whole Fleet.</hi> And it is obſervable, The grudge hereof hath not yet been forgotten by the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> which in a ſlye Revenge hath probably helped to raiſe this Devill of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine War in our Nation, and denied all conſiderable Supplies to the <hi>King of England,</hi> in theſe daies of his diſtreſſe; yea, though a <hi>Daughter</hi> of the <hi>Crowne</hi> and her numerous Iſſue be involved in the ſame Calamity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But to give you the beſt laſt, The truth &amp; Ground of the whole Buſineſſe will be made very cleare, and beyond all ſcruple by this following Narrative, which I have delivered from honeſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <hi>States-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Palatinate</hi> being wreſted from the <hi>Palſgrave,</hi> The <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> almoſt ruinated, Our <hi>King</hi> unable at that time by his own ſtrength to relieve them, there was a <hi>League</hi> propoſed and agitated between the Crowns of <hi>France, England, Denmark,</hi> the States of <hi>Holland and Venice,</hi> againſt the <hi>Houſe of Austria</hi>; and this in good meaſure was brought toward perfection, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the managery of the <hi>Duke of Buckingham.</hi> The wiſe Cardinall of <hi>France,</hi> making advantage of thoſe Traverſes, and taking Time by the fore-top, deals with the <hi>Duke</hi> for ſupply of theſe above-mentioned Ships. The <hi>Duke</hi> being <hi>Admiral,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming high upon his Maſters allowance, commands the L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> then Secretary of State, to write to <hi>Penington</hi> his <hi>Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall</hi> to put the Ships under the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, and Seales this Letter with the Signet. But <hi>Penington</hi> refuſing to do it upon ſuch Authority, the <hi>Duke</hi> himſelf as <hi>Admirall</hi> ſeconds the firſt Letter with his Command: which being likewiſe diſputed, a Letter was ſent with the <hi>Kings</hi> Name ſubſcribed, and ſigned with the <hi>Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignet,</hi> yet without <hi>His Majeſties</hi> knowledge (which was no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, conſidering the Signet is uſually kept by the Secretary, and that many Blanks are uſually and muſt of neceſſity be left in truſt with great Officers, eſpecially ſo great, as the <hi>Duke</hi> then was) Nay, I have been informed, that the <hi>King,</hi> being at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> when the Newes hereof was firſt imparted to him, and that by Sir <hi>John Penington</hi> himſelf, was in a great rage at it, and not without ſome difficulty reconciled unto the <hi>Duke</hi> about it.</p>
               <p>Is it now a rationall and juſt Inference to lay the Miſcarriage
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57533:48"/>
of <hi>Rochel</hi> upon <hi>His Majesties</hi> ſcore? Have they ſo much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward Strangers, and ſo little Juſtice toward their own rightful Soveraign? Are they ſo deeply affected with the wounds given to the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> through the ſides of <hi>Rochel</hi>? Would God they themſelves did not ſtab it ten times more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately by theſe their un-Proteſtant, un-Chriſtian, unparalell'd Proceedings, to the diſhonour of God, the Grief and Anguiſh of every good Soule, the Joy and unſpeakable Advantage of our common Adverſary of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>ANd thus have we examined the truth of their <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt <hi>His Majeſty</hi>; before we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, It will be worth while to examine a little the truth of what they declare for Themſelves; <hi>We ſhall uſe our utmoſt endevour to ſettle the preſent Government, as it may ſtand with the Peace and Happineſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> I ask, How can they ſettle the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without a <hi>King?</hi> If their Hornes ſhould prove as long, as themſelves are curſt, and <hi>God</hi> permit them to fill up the meaſure of their Iniquities, by the acceſſion of the Murder of this <hi>King,</hi> which we do even tremble to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet have ſome reaſon to believe they do deſigne, One of their Members having profeſſed as much, and offered himſelf a <hi>Felton</hi> for that fact, yet never ſo much as queſtion'd; And one <hi>Hall,</hi> being a Suitor for the Command of a Ship in their Navy, unto their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Admiralty, was accuſed for having ſaid, <hi>The Parliament were fooliſh, that they had not hired ſomebody to kill the King whilſt he was in the hands of the Scots</hi>: It was thereupon replied by Sir <hi>A.

And how will they be able to alienate the <hi>Crowne</hi> from that Royall Line? which

            <p>But grant, they may arrive at this <hi>Impoſsibility</hi>; What Peace or Settlement therein can this <hi>Kingdome</hi> expect from their hands, who have uſed us or rather abuſed us thus, whiles as yet they ſtood but upon their <hi>Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>; while they were no more then <hi>Probationers,</hi> or <hi>Candidates</hi> of <hi>Soveraignty?</hi> Our Peace muſt be to lie down quietly under their Pawes, while they like <hi>Harpyes</hi> do ſnatch away the <hi>meat</hi> out of our Mouths, like <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> feed upon our live <hi>bodies</hi>; whilſt (as a wiſe man ſaid, ſuch Statiſts uſe to do) they toſſe our <hi>heads,</hi> our very <hi>lives</hi> like <hi>Tenis-balls,</hi> to make them ſport withall.
