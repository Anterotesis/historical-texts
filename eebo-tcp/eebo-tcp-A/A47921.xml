            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ยง 1. WELL were it for this poor distracted <hi>Nation,</hi> were there less ground, than there is, for your Opinion, that it is not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Case of your Friend only, but of a great many (otherwise) Worthy and Eminent Persons, to be mis-led, and intoxicated, by the plausible pretence of a <hi>Free Estate,</hi> into a passionate Fondness, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a <hi>Popular Government:</hi> never distinguishing betwixt the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> of a <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> the mistake whereof (each for the other) has prov'd so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in this Age; nor calling to mind that it was the misfortune of those that surfeited of our <hi>Kingly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,</hi> and gap'd as impatiently after <hi>Novelty</hi> as any now adayes can do; to lose the substance of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Happiness,</hi> in persute of the <hi>Shadow.</hi> Nay, too too
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97418:3"/>
many, I fear me, there are, that sacrificing all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to their <hi>Mammon,</hi> Interest, do labour with all the Vigour and Artifice imaginable to create in the <hi>Multitude</hi> a loathing of their present <hi>Manna,</hi> and a fresh longing for their late <hi>AEgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian Leeks</hi> and <hi>Garlick.</hi> So that you are not to look upon my Endeavours to set things aright, as to this Point, to be the pure effects of my Compliance with your <hi>Desires</hi> for the satisfaction of your <hi>Friend,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a pressing and indispensable <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER your <hi>Friend,</hi> nor any other <hi>Republican</hi> will, I presume, maintain that a <hi>Free Estate</hi> (as they call it) is subject to no Violations; because woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will confute, and force them to confess either that a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> may <hi>Degenerate;</hi> or, at least, that the so much cry'd up Model of the <hi>Late Times</hi> was no <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> And they must not only renounce their <hi>Senses,</hi> but even the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Story</hi> also; which suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proves that <hi>Republiques</hi> have been <hi>sometimes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded with <hi>Usurpations; sometimes</hi> debauch'd and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas'd with <hi>Oligarchy; mostly</hi> (by reason of their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Divisions) <hi>subdu'd</hi> or compell'd to truckle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>Neighbouring Princes;</hi> but <hi>alwayes</hi> tormented with <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Convulsions.</hi> Nor, in truth, has that <hi>Party</hi> as yet been able to produce any <hi>Arguments</hi> but such as, in effect, beg the <hi>Question;</hi> by presupposing great <hi>Unity</hi> in the <hi>Coalition,</hi> great <hi>Probity</hi> in the <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and great <hi>Purity</hi> in the <hi>Exercise;</hi> which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, doubtless we should so little need to differ about <hi>Forms,</hi> that perhaps we should scarce need any <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all.</hi> Now for my <hi>Own</hi> part (on the <hi>other</hi> side) I abhor <hi>Bloodshed,</hi> and deem <hi>one</hi> Party in all <hi>Wars</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Murther;</hi> a Crime which as it cryes <hi>High</hi> for <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> so ought it to cry <hi>Lowd</hi> for <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>

into which blessed Path may <hi>This</hi> ballance us, that we be not again <hi>Balotted</hi> into a <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Blood:</hi> I plead for <hi>Liberty;</hi> not the <hi>Name,</hi> but the <hi>Thing;</hi> and design not to assert <hi>Tyranny,</hi> but <hi>Kingship;</hi> (as it relates to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land)</hi> to whose protection I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by my <hi>Birth,</hi> for the preservation of my <hi>Freedom</hi> in <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Estate;</hi> and That with more assurance, then possibly can be secur'd under the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Many;</hi> who scruple not commonly to term that <hi>Justice</hi> (and without <hi>Remedy</hi> too) which is <hi>down right Faction.</hi> So that with these thoughts about me I shall readily acknowledge (you may imagine) that even <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self is but as <hi>Earthen Ware,</hi> (tho' of the <hi>Finest</hi> and <hi>Strongest Sort)</hi> and liable to sundry <hi>Contingences; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the Heavens being compleatly Perfect.</hi> And in the Constitution of <hi>Governments,</hi> 'tis childish to think upon erecting <hi>Babels</hi> against the <hi>Deluge;</hi> but the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> must be, to <hi>embank</hi> against <hi>Floods,</hi> and <hi>enclose</hi> the best that may be against <hi>Trespassors.</hi> This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, I shall proceed to handle the <hi>Matter</hi> in debate, not <hi>Metaphysically,</hi> in <hi>Notions</hi> abstracted from their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> (a Pastime which our <hi>Platoniques</hi> much delight in) but <hi>Morally,</hi> and <hi>Reasonably;</hi> and enforce such <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> only as are <hi>plain, sensible,</hi> and <hi>appropriate</hi> to our own <hi>Countrey;</hi> leaving the <hi>Notional</hi> to our <hi>Book-men,</hi> whose <hi>Volumes,</hi> calculated for all <hi>Climates,</hi> swell big against the <hi>Evils</hi> of the <hi>Rule</hi> of MANY, or <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</hi>

immediate Relation to the <hi>Subject;</hi> and then apply the <hi>Premises</hi> to the Point in hand. This <hi>Island,</hi> now, is a large Continent, abundantly populous; and govern'd (I may say) by the Subordinate Influence of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry;</hi> who live plentifully, and at ease upon their <hi>Rents,</hi> extracted from the Toyle of their <hi>Tenants</hi> and <hi>Servants;</hi> and every one of them Acts the <hi>Prince</hi> within the Bounds of his own <hi>Estate,</hi> where he is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Absolute;</hi> his <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Labourers</hi> are in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his <hi>Vassals,</hi> his <hi>Tenants</hi> indeed are <hi>Free,</hi> but yet in the Nature of <hi>Subjects;</hi> whom he orders in his <hi>Courts,</hi> draws Supplyes from by his <hi>Fines,</hi> and Awes by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Fealty,</hi> to infinite Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The more his <hi>Mannors</hi> are, and the more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently he behaves himself (like a good <hi>Prince)</hi> the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is his <hi>Territory,</hi> and the more awful are his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> A Neighbour more <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Potent</hi> gives Cheque to his <hi>Inferiour</hi> Neighbour; and brings his <hi>Petty-Princeship</hi> into awe; <hi>He</hi> again being overaw'd by one that is greater and more powerful than himself in <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Friends.</hi> But none of these, with respect to his <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> will admit a <hi>Parity</hi> with his <hi>Inferiour Neighbours,</hi> much less with his <hi>Tenant</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</hi>

               <hi>These,</hi> upon the hopes of a <hi>Chimaera</hi> in the <hi>Brains</hi> of some: The word <hi>Liberty</hi> deluded us into <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> from 1648. to 1660. brought forth not less <hi>Payments,</hi> but more <hi>Servitude.</hi> And let them not hope to bring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their <hi>Cause,</hi> by alledging (as they did before) that they could never be permitted to foster up their <hi>Babe</hi> to full perfection; for that they will ever be opposed by all <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> men, who having once experimented the <hi>Evils</hi> of such a <hi>State,</hi> will be as vigilant and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious to keep it from getting footing among us again, as those that are <hi>otherwise,</hi> can be to bring it on. Beside that, you cannot have forgot, Sir, that from 1648 to 1653. they had it from the <hi>Nurse,</hi> and (had they stuck to their <hi>Pretences)</hi> might probably in five years time have set it upon its <hi>Feet;</hi> but they found the <hi>sweet</hi> (poor Wretches) of ingrossing <hi>Power</hi> to themselves: But then it could never have been of any long <hi>Continuance,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appear'd from the great scorn and bitterness that the <hi>Supporters</hi> of it were reproach'd with, when it was <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd;</hi> there was not so much as one <hi>Bloudy Nose</hi> in the defence of that <hi>High and Mighty State;</hi> but all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were held in the utmost degree of <hi>detestation,</hi> as they most justly deserved. And though these <hi>Rumpers,</hi> 'tis true, came <hi>twice</hi> into play, yet were they only made use of to serve a <hi>Turn,</hi> as being fit to be made a <hi>Property;</hi> for it was presently seen that it was not the desire of <hi>their Rule,</hi> but of a <hi>further change,</hi> that inspirited the <hi>People</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Army;</hi> and the <hi>Rump</hi> (as being next at hand) had no sooner mounted the <hi>empty Saddle,</hi> but (before they were warm in their <hi>Seat)</hi> they were again <hi>Unhors'd</hi> with a <hi>Publick Leave,</hi> as appear'd by the <hi>Bonefires</hi> (upon <hi>That</hi> Occasion) that might have lighted them to the <hi>Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> if they had dar'd to be seen among them.

            <p>ยง. 3.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97418:7"/>
most insupportably burthensome and odious to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> by their <hi>Quartering;</hi> and to keep them as much in <hi>action</hi> as possibly we could, we were fain either to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually amusing them with pretended Discoveries of some <hi>new-feigned Plot</hi> or other, or else to engage them in <hi>Forreign Wars.</hi> For the support of this Army (now) we were compelled to daily <hi>Contributions,</hi> besides great and innumerable <hi>Customs</hi> that were exacted, together with the <hi>Excise,</hi> (a <hi>Brat</hi> begotten in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with their <hi>State,</hi> which makes them <hi>free</hi> indeed, but then it is in <hi>Purse,</hi> not in <hi>Priviledge)</hi> a <hi>Tribute</hi> which no <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> durst demand, before they enforced us to pay it; which being ever before look'd upon as <hi>Poyson;</hi> we then took as <hi>Physick;</hi> though in that Age, it was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that no <hi>English-man</hi> would ever swallow it; and for the bare but necessary <hi>Mention</hi> whereof, in the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> that <hi>Grand Patriote</hi> (as they call'd him) Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> was by a <hi>young Spirit</hi> (not without great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause) call'd to the <hi>Bar;</hi> add hereunto the <hi>Benevolences, Sequestrations, five and twentyth parts,</hi> a <hi>Tax</hi> of <hi>fifty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies</hi> at once, (though the late King suffer'd so much by the demand of <hi>twelve</hi> only) <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Compositions,</hi> sale of <hi>Kings, Bishops, Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> and <hi>Delinquents Lands,</hi> the <hi>two parts</hi> of <hi>Papists Estates,</hi> nay a <hi>share</hi> of our very <hi>Charities</hi> to the <hi>distressed;</hi> over and above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Contributions</hi> that were levy'd. How was all this devour'd by the <hi>Army,</hi> whose Belly indeed was bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less? and yet what <hi>Arrears</hi> did we owe them just before the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Return?</hi> three Millions at least! Reform the <hi>Army</hi> we durst not, and our constant <hi>charge</hi> could not be less than two <hi>Millions yearly,</hi> to supply it; In a word, we never used to be in a worse condition, than when none would Rebel, because when the People were quiet we had no <hi>Lands</hi> either to <hi>sequester</hi> or to <hi>sell.</hi> Our <hi>Trade</hi> fell to nothing, our <hi>Traffique</hi> was interrupted, our

               <hi>Gold</hi> walk'd <hi>beyond Sea</hi> more freely than in our <hi>own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> and we lost no less than 2000 Sail of <hi>Ships</hi> in two or three years time: There was no <hi>settlement,</hi> but we were every day dancing after a <hi>new Whistle; ten Models</hi> we had in Proposal at one time, and every <hi>Faction</hi> ready with <hi>Blood</hi> to aver his own <hi>way</hi> to be the best. By our known <hi>Laws</hi> we could not be imprison'd, but by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proceeding in a <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>Justice;</hi> but under our <hi>free Estate</hi> (on the other side) upon the most slight sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of a spiteful <hi>Neighbour</hi> in Authority, we were presently seiz'd by the <hi>Serjeant at Arms,</hi> with his exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Fees! no <hi>Bail,</hi> no <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> no regular way of <hi>Justice</hi> to do us right! but, after a <hi>Twelvemonths</hi> stay in <hi>Goal,</hi> if we could make good <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> our selves to our potent <hi>Adversary,</hi> we might possibly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd; but without <hi>amends,</hi> or knowing of our <hi>Crime.</hi> Loe thus, while we cajol'd our selves with the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Freedom,</hi> we lost the <hi>thing,</hi> and became <hi>free,</hi> only to be made the most despicable of <hi>Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY <hi>this,</hi> Sir, you see that the <hi>Question</hi> might be decided in a few words, only by alledging the <hi>Inclination</hi> of the People to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as it is now established: For as no man can well be wrong'd with his <hi>consent,</hi> so neither is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to be oblig'd against his <hi>will.</hi> And indeed how should a <hi>Government,</hi> founded upon <hi>inequality</hi> and <hi>force,</hi> ever subsist <hi>without</hi> it? Or a <hi>State</hi> that must necessarily be the meer <hi>Adjective</hi> of an <hi>Army,</hi> become a <hi>Substantive?</hi> With as much <hi>Reason</hi> might I also object matter of <hi>Title,</hi> because the <hi>same</hi> Estate, with a <hi>flaw</hi> in the <hi>conveyance,</hi> or clogg'd with <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgments,</hi> is not surely of <hi>like</hi> value, as if it had been descended <hi>clearly</hi> from the <hi>great Grandfather,</hi> and were free from <hi>Claims</hi> and <hi>Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> But it shall be the next part of my Business to shew that the <hi>present establish'd Government</hi> (as it excellently
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97418:8"/>
complies with the <hi>Laws, Genius,</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> so it) comprehends all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in great perfection; and this I shall do as <hi>briefly</hi> as I can.</p>
            <p>TO demonstrate how it complies with our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> let it suffice, That <hi>(Monarchy,</hi> in these <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> being more ancient than <hi>Story</hi> or <hi>Records</hi> more venerable than <hi>Tradition</hi> it self) our <hi>Laws</hi> were born (as it were) under this <hi>Climate,</hi> habituated to this <hi>Diet</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> grafted into this <hi>Stock;</hi> and though we have (thanks be to God) forgotten our <hi>Norman,</hi> yet will it be very hard for us to learn <hi>Greek,</hi> much less <hi>Utopian;</hi> that in the late <hi>Usurper</hi>'s time, our <hi>Lawyers,</hi> with one Voice, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd him rather to assume the <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> to which they found all our <hi>Laws</hi> were shaped, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that of a <hi>Protector,</hi> unknown to the <hi>Law:</hi> That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing render'd the late <hi>Architects</hi> of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> more <hi>obnoxious,</hi> than that (notwithstanding their infinite <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi> in other things) they generally agreed in the <hi>necessity</hi> of subverting all our <hi>Fandamental Laws,</hi> in order to their <hi>Design;</hi> which Consideration (we are in <hi>Charity</hi> to believe) obliged the sober men of all Parties, the true <hi>Patriotes,</hi> (nay and even the chiefest <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Parliaments-Cause</hi> too) to unite themselves with the <hi>Royal Interest;</hi> as not enduring to hear of those violent and dangerous <hi>Alterations</hi> which they plainly saw a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> must necessarily introduce.</p>
            <p>FOR its complyance with our <hi>Genius,</hi> examine we (in the first place) the various <hi>Revolutions</hi> that have happened to this <hi>Island; Brittains, Romans, Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans;</hi> or (more <hi>nearly)</hi> the <hi>changes</hi> in their <hi>Descents</hi> from the <hi>direct Line</hi> to the <hi>Collateral;</hi> or (yet <hi>nearer)</hi> the <hi>times</hi> of <hi>Insurrection</hi> and <hi>deposing Kings, Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> (both the <hi>Seconds</hi> of the <hi>name)</hi> and we shall find

               <hi>King-ship</hi> still in fashion.

            <p>I COULD heartily wish there were at present no more reason, to be apprehensive of <hi>Popery</hi> coming amongst us, then there was in those days: But yet, let his <hi>Royal Highness</hi>'s <hi>Perswasion</hi> be what it will, this I'm sure of, that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> has deposed upon <hi>Oath,</hi> that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> were so far from <hi>saying</hi> or <hi>acting, Indifferently,</hi> as to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that in their <hi>Hellish Plot,</hi> they had mark'd him out also for <hi>Slaughter,</hi> with his most <hi>Royal,</hi> most <hi>Protestant Brother.</hi> Now the late <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Argyle</hi> was wont to lay it down as a <hi>Principle</hi> in <hi>Policy,</hi> That it was <hi>the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a wise man not to let the World know what Religion he was of:</hi> But (for my <hi>own</hi> part) I cannot in <hi>Charity</hi> but hope the <hi>best</hi> of a <hi>Person,</hi> (till I shall be convinc'd of the contrary, by more certain and positive Arguments, then any that I have yet been able to meet with) that has been so <hi>Lectur'd</hi> and <hi>Tutor'd</hi> by our late <hi>Glorious Martyr,</hi> (as well as by <hi>Experience)</hi> into a <hi>Veneration</hi> for, and a <hi>Perseverance</hi> in that <hi>Pure, Reformed Religion,</hi> the <hi>Principles</hi> of which he suck'd in with his very <hi>Milk,</hi> and in <hi>Defence</hi> of which his ever Blessed <hi>Father</hi> laid down his most precious <hi>Life,</hi> upon a <hi>Scaffold.</hi> You may read his words thus; <q>I do require you, <hi>(addressing to his present Majesty)</hi> as your <hi>Father</hi> and your <hi>King,</hi> that you never suffer your Heart to receive the least <hi>Check</hi> against, or <hi>Dis-affection</hi> from the <hi>True Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in the Church of England:</hi> I tell you I have try'd it, and after much <hi>Search,</hi> and many <hi>Disputes,</hi> have concluded it to be the <hi>best</hi> in the World, not only in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97418:15"/>
the <hi>Community,</hi> as <hi>Christian,</hi> but also in the <hi>special No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as <hi>Reformed;</hi> keeping the <hi>middle way</hi> between the <hi>Pomp</hi> of <hi>Superstitious Tyranny,</hi> and the <hi>Meanness</hi> of <hi>Phantastick Anarchy,</hi> &amp;c.</q> To this sence, spake he, when he had no <hi>more</hi> to speak. Nay, and so <hi>zealous,</hi> this way, was our <hi>English Solomon,</hi> (the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father) King James,</hi> that rather then any of his <hi>Progeny</hi> should ever come to be tainted with the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he made it his Prayer to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> that they might be taken out of the <hi>World</hi> first.</p>
            <p>AS to the apprehensions of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> I hope, by what I have already deliver'd in the <hi>Body</hi> of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> it is evident, that there is less ground to fear it, then many people might before imagine, for that it is next to an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility</hi> to introduce it. And, upon probable grounds, I perswade my self, that should the <hi>Duke</hi> ever have the <hi>occasion</hi> offer'd, yet would he be wiser then to make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the <hi>Experiment,</hi> knowing so well as he must needs do, that should the <hi>English Liberties</hi> be violated in the example but of any one single <hi>Person,</hi> the whole <hi>Nation</hi> would take it self to be concern'd upon <hi>that</hi> account, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it self ready for the <hi>Fetters,</hi> and, thereby, what with <hi>Fear,</hi> what with <hi>Hate,</hi> such a Storm would be rais'd, as might shake the surest <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and so very much has <hi>Majesty</hi> already felt by the <hi>Fury</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> that it will be chary (doubtless) of giving occasion to encounter it again.</p>
            <p>BUT 'tis farther <hi>Objected</hi> (it seems) that there is a <hi>Vindictive</hi> and <hi>Implacable Spirit</hi> in the Case. Now this is most manifest (indeed) that there have been <hi>Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to the <hi>height;</hi> but shall we therefore <hi>continue</hi> to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke,</hi>

Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> was so far from <hi>punishing</hi> any of the <hi>holy League,</hi> that labour'd, by all means possible, to <hi>keep</hi> him from his <hi>Right,</hi> and to <hi>murther</hi> him, that (on the <hi>contrary)</hi> he imploy'd those very Persons that were his <hi>main Opposites,</hi> in his <hi>Armies,</hi> in his <hi>Offices,</hi> and in his <hi>Councels.</hi> And what shall we say of <hi>King James,</hi> who sent <hi>Messages,</hi> made <hi>Vows,</hi> menac'd <hi>Revenge,</hi> and all to prevent that fatal <hi>Stroke</hi> from falling upon his <hi>Mother,</hi> (the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots)</hi> under <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> but to no effect. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Issue now; Shortly <hi>Q.

Acts he in the way of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge?</hi> No; he, like a <hi>wise Prince,</hi> feeling the <hi>Warmth</hi> of so <hi>Rich</hi> a <hi>Climate,</hi> is so passionate to confirm his own <hi>Greatness,</hi> that he not only <hi>forgets</hi> the <hi>Injury</hi> of his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but manages his great <hi>Affairs</hi> by the hands of those very Persons that were <hi>Contrivers</hi> of it; yet through <hi>Her Bloud</hi> did he derive his <hi>Title!</hi> Nor do we read of one of these <hi>Nobles,</hi> or their <hi>Issue,</hi> that suffer'd <hi>Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by any Resentment, upon <hi>that</hi> account. His <hi>wise Father</hi> also, that had been beaten into the knowledge of the <hi>English Spirit,</hi> writes thus: <q>Let no Passion, (my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97418:16"/>
Son) betray you to any study of <hi>Revenge</hi> upon Those whose Own Sin and Folly will sufficiently Punish theu, in due Time: Be confident that most of all <hi>Sides</hi> that have done <hi>Amiss,</hi> have done so, not out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> but <hi>Mis-information,</hi> or <hi>Mis-apprehension</hi> of Things.
