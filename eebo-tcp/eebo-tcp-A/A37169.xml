            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dr. Davenant's
OPINION
Anent the
Salt and Malt-Taxes
IN
ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>THE Doctor in his Eſſay, upon the probable Methods
of making People Gainers in the Ballance of Trade,
Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1700, after enumerating ſeveral
Taxes, and giving his Opinion anent the dangerous
Conſequences of heavy Impoſitions on Trade, ſayes <hi>page</hi> 95,
96. and 97. That, during all the War, there has been levied
here great Sums every Year, and many of the forementioned
Funds are to continue ſo long, that it will be ſeveral years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Annual Payments can be conſiderably diminiſhed, and
there is ſuch a Difference between a Twentieth, and an Eighth
or indeed a Twelth Part (which yet we ſhall not come to in
ſome time) as muſt inevitably affect the Nation's Trade and
the whole Body of its People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51018:2"/>
When their was raiſed no more than about a Twentieth
Part, there were great Sums of Money to circulate in Foreign
Traffick, and to Imploy in enlarging our Home-manufactures,
which two Fountains of our Wealth muſt be dry, when the
Springs, which hitherto fed them, are diverted and let into
another Channel.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce any of theſe new Revnues which do not
give Trade a deſperate wound; the Additional Duties on Beer,
and Ale, and the Tax upon Malt, are apparently a Burden u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Woollen Manufactures, affecting the Carder, Spinner,
Weaver and the Dyer, who all of them muſt be raiſed in their
Wages, when the Neceſſaries of Life are raiſed to them.
The Conſequences of which will be, that our Woollen Goods
muſt come at a Heavy and Diſadvantageous Price into the
Foreign Mercats.</p>
            <p>There is no Man will pretend, that high Cuſtoms are not
pernicious to our Commerce Abroad. A Nation is not Gainer
in the general Ballance of Trade, by the Dealing of a few,
who are able to Imploy in it great Stocks, ſuch may make to
themſelves an immenſe Gain, but they go but a little toward
Inriching the whole Publick, which ſeldom Thrives, but when
in a manner the Univerſal People bend their Thoughts to this
Sort of Buſineſs, when every one is ready with his ſmall Stock
and little Sum, to venture and rove about the World; of theſe
ſome proſper and others are undone: However in the way
of Merchandiſe, Men who do not Thrive themſelves, may
yet contribute very much to make their Country Rich, which
gets by the Dealings of all, and does not ſuffer by the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Conduct of here and there a Merchant. But when
the Cuſtoms are high, all theſe Undertakers, who all along
in <hi>England</hi> have made up the chief Bulk of our Trading Men,
muſt hold their hands, tho in Skill, Induſtry, Intentive Parts,
and Witt, they may exceed Merchants of more Wealth and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51018:2"/>
of a higher Rank. Nor is it indeed practicable for Men of
but a Moderate Fortune to deal at all, when more than triple
that Sum is neceſſary to have ready now to pay the King, which
formerly would have ſet up a Subſtantial Trader, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him in ſufficient Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But of all the new Impoſitions, none are ſo dangerous to
the very Being of Trade, nor ſo hurtful to all its Parts and
Members, as the high Duties lately laid upon Salt. Firſt,
They affect the Common People in the whole Courſe of their
Living, whoſe chief Nouriſhment is Bacon and other Salted
Fleſh, ſo that this Exciſe has an univerſal Influence upon all
Manufactures whatſoever. But the general Prejudice it may
bring to Navigation, is yet of a higher Conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page 100, he ſays,</hi> Reckoning long and ſhort Voyages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the principal Expenſe of fitting out a Trading Veſſel, is
Drink and Meat. The Exciſe and Duties upon Malt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, make Drink ſufficiently Dear to the Fraughter.
And the Duty upon Salt, makes Victualling a very heavie
Burden upon him; all which muſt end, in leſſoning our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
from time to time, for undoubtedly Foreigners ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
how dear Freight is with us, will Trade in their own
Ships as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>In Barrelling up Beef and Pork, we heretofore made
Uſe of <hi>St. Martines</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Oleron</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and with theſe Materials the Fleſh was beſt prepared,
both for Wholſomeneſs and long Keeping, our own Salt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Mixture being Fiery, Corroſive, and very Scorbutick.
As we are informed, the <hi>St. Martins</hi> and worſer ſort of <hi>French</hi>
Salt, from 1676 to 1688 was delivered in <hi>London</hi> at about 2 <hi>l:
5ſh: per</hi> Tun, and fourty Buſhels to the Tun, and that from
<hi>Oleron</hi> from 2 <hi>l: 10ſh:</hi> to 2 <hi>l: 15 ſh: per</hi> Tun. But now the very
Duty for 40 Buſhels of <hi>Oleron</hi> Salt amounts to 13 <hi>l: 6 ſh: 8 d:</hi>
beſide the 25 <hi>per Cent ad valorem,</hi> of which formerly the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51018:3"/>
Prime Coſt came to but 2 <hi>l: 15 ſh:</hi> at higheſt. The Duty
likewiſe upon 40 Buſhels of <hi>Lisbon</hi> Salt comes to 13 <hi>l: 6 ſh. 8 d.</hi>
of which the Prime Coſt was formerly at higheſt but 3 <hi>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10 ſh:</hi>
And as to our <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Limington</hi> Salt, which is now
generally made uſe of in Salting Beef and Pork for Trading
Veſſels, the very Duty for 40 Buſhels amounts to 6 <hi>l: 13 ſh:</hi>
4 <hi>d:</hi> which before the War the Prime Coſt came but to 3 <hi>l:</hi> at
the deareſt Mercat. In ſo much, that we are credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that a Merchant can Store himſelf in <hi>Ireland</hi> with Salt
Beef and Pork ready Packed up, almoſt as cheap, as he can
Buy the Salt in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that for long Voyages, the Merchant will either victual
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or ſalt his Beef and Pork on ſome Foreign Coaſt, as
he ſails along, where Proviſions ſhall be cheap: which muſt
be a great Damnage to the Landed Intereſt here: Or if he
does not ſo, Victualling will be ſo Expenſive to him, as to
make Fraught much dearer than ought it to be in a Country
that expects to thrive by Trade.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of all which will be, That the Body of
our Merchants muſt ly under a general Diſcouragement,
they will neglect looking after National Gain, which <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchants have perhaps heretofore as much conſidered in
their Dealings, as any Trading Men in the whole Commercial
World. They will have an Eye to nothing, but their own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Profit, &amp; ſuffer Strangers to go away with thoſe Gains,
which <hi>England</hi> was wont to make by Freight. From whence
it will follow, That we muſt decay in our Stock of Shipping,
and decreaſe every Year in the Brood of Sea-men; and when
this happens, we muſt no more pretend to ſuch a Naval
Strength, as hitherto has made us terrible to all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
