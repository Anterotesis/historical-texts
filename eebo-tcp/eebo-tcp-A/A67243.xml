            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
TERRIBLE OVT-CRY
against the
BISHOPS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His hath been one great Abuse in
<hi>England</hi> these many yeers, that such
Offices as have been of most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and weight, have commonly
been committed to Bishops and other
Spirituall men; whereby their devillish mischiefs,
and inconveniences have hapned in this Realme, to
the great dishonour of God, and utter neglect of
the flock of Christ, the which three be these.</p>
            <p>1. They have had small leasure to attend to their
Pastorall Cures, which thereby have been utterly
neglected, and left undone.</p>
            <p>2. It hath also puft up many Bishops, and other
spirituall persons in such haughtinesse, and pride,
that they have thought no Nobleman in the Realm
worthy to be their equall, and fellow; (whence
<hi>Hall</hi> in his Chronicle observes, 22. <hi>H. 8. fol.</hi> 184.)
that the Authority of Cardinall <hi>Woolsey,</hi> set the
Clergie in such a pride, that they disdained all men,
wherefore when he was fallen, they followed after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60730:3"/>
3. Where they by this means, knew the very
secrets of Princes, they (being in such high Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
have caused the same to be known in <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King could accomplish and bring his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
to passe in <hi>England.</hi> By this means hath the
Papacie been so maintained, and things ordered
after their wills, and pleasures, that much mischief
hath happened in this Realm, and others, sometime
the destruction of Princes, and sometime to the
utter undoing of many Common-wealths.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooper,</hi> both a Bishop and a Martyr of our
Church, delivers his judgement of the point, in
these ensuing termes: upon the 8. Commandment
page 78. For the space of 400. yeers after Christ,
(saith he) the Bishops applyed all their wit onely
to their own vocation; to the glory of God, and the
honour of the Realm they dwelt in; though they
had not so much upon their heads, as our Bishops
have, yet had they more within their heads, and the
Scriptures and Histories testifie. For they applied
all the will they had, unto the vocation and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Church whereunto they were called.
But our Bishops have so much wit, that they can
rule, and serve (as they say) in both States, in the
Church, and also in the Civill Policie, when one of
them is more then any man is able to satisfie, let
him do alwayes his best diligence. If he be so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for the Court, that in Civill causes he can
not be spared, let him use that vocation, and spare
the other. It is not possible he should do both
well.</p>
            <p>It is a great over-sight with Princes, thus to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60730:3"/>
charge them with two burthens. The Primitive
Church had no such Bishops as we. They had such
Bishops as did preach many godly Sermons in lesse
time, then our Bishops horses be a bridling. If it
be so now, let every man judge.</p>
            <p>If the fourth part of the Bishoprick remained to
the Bishop, it were sufficient, the third part to
School-masters, the second to poore, and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were better bestowed.</p>
            <p>If any be offended with me for this my saying,
he loveth not his own health, nor Gods Laws, nor
mans. See <hi>Bucer, de Regno Christi, li. 2. ca.</hi> 12. and
in his Apologie he saith: It is both against Gods
Laws, and mans, that Bishops and Clergie should
be Judges over any Subjects within this Realm, for
it is no part of their office.</p>
            <p>Who would put a sword in a mad mans hand?
Thus the good Prelate M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Latymer,</hi> who gave
over his Bishoprick out of conscience, (as <hi>Saxton</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> likewise did) and skipped for
joy, being divested of his Bishop-like habite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he felt his shoulders so light, and was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of so heavie a burthen. How many such
Prelates have we now in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now for the fault of unpreaching Prelates,
me thinks I could guesse what might be said for
excusing of them. They are so troubled with lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
living, they be so placed in Palaces, couched in
Courts, ruffling in their rents, daunting in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
burdened with Embassages, pampring
of their panches, like a Monke that maketh his
jubilie, munching in their mangers, and moyling
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60730:4"/>
in their gay Manours, and Mansions, and so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with loytring in their Lordships, that they
cannot attend it. They are otherwise occupied,
some in Kings matters, some are Ambassadours,
some of the Privy Councell, some furnish the
Court, some are Lords of Parliament, some are
Presidents, and Controulers of Mints. Well, well,
is this their dutie? is this their calling? are these
meet Offices for Priests? is it a meet Office for a
Minister of Gods word to be Controuler of Mints?
is this his charge? who controuls the Devill in his
Parish, while he controuls the Mint?</p>
            <p>As <hi>Paul</hi> said to the Corinths, 1. <hi>Corinth. 6. Is
there not among you a wise man, &amp;c.</hi> So say I to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
Is there never a Nobleman to be a Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
what a shame is this? must it needs be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late?
is there never a wise man in the Realm to be
a Controuler of the Mint? I speak it to your shame,
If there be never a wise man, make a Water-bearer,
a Tinker, a Cobler, a Page to be in that Office. Make
a mean Gentleman, a Groome, a Yeoman, make a
poore begger Lord President.</p>
            <p>The King hath a great many Wards; and there
is a Court of Wards, why is there not a Schoole
for those Wards? why are they not set to schoole
where they may learne, that they may serve the
King when they come to age; But there is Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
enough for these Offices. And now I would
aske a strange question, who is the most diligent
Bishop and Prelate in all <hi>England,</hi> that passeth all
the rest in doing his office? I can tell who it is. But
now me thinks, I see you listning, hearkning that I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60730:4"/>
should name him, will you know who it is? I will
tell you: It is the Devill: he is never out of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse,
he is never from his cure, he is ever in his
Parish: no lording, no loytring can hinder him;
ye can never finde him idle I warrant you: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the pack of them that have Curates, the
Devill shall go for my money. Oh all ye unpreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prelates, learne of the Devill, if you will not
learn of God; he will give you an example of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in your Office.</p>
