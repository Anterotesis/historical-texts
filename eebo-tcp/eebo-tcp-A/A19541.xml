            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ Lament. Ierem.</head>
            <q>
               <bibl>CAP. 1. 12.</bibl>
HAue ye no Regard, ô all ye that passe by the way? Consider, and behold, If euer there were sorrow like my Sorrow, which was done vnto me, wherewith the Lord did afflict me in the day of the fiercenesse of his wrath.</q>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the very reading or hearing of which verse, there is none but will presently conceiue, it is the voice of a party in great extremitie. In great extremitie two wayes: <note place="margin">A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> First, In such distresse, as neuer was any, <hi>If euer there were sorrow like my sorrow?</hi> And then, in that distresse hauing none to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him: <hi>Haue ye no regard all ye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be afflicted, and so afflicted, as none euer was, is very much: In that affliction to finde none to respect him or care for him, what can be more? In all our sufferings it is
<pb facs="tcp:21585:3"/>
a comfort to vs that wee haue a <hi>Sicut:</hi> that <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.13.</note> nothing hath befallen vs, but such as others haue felt the like: But here, <hi>Si fuerit sicut?</hi> If euer the like were (that is) neuer the like was.</p>
            <p>Againe, in our greatest paines, it is a kind of ease, euen to find some regard. Naturally we desire it, if we cannot be deliuered, if we cannot be relieued, yet to be pitied: It shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Iob 19. 21.</note> there be yet some, that are touched with the sense of our miserie, that wish vs well, and would giue vs ease if they could: But this afflicted here, findeth not so much, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other: but is euen as he were an outcast both of Heauen and Earth. Now verily a heauie case, and worthy to be put in this booke of Lamentations.</p>
            <p>I demaund then, Of whom speaketh the <note place="margin">Christes complaint.</note> Prophet this? of himselfe, or of some other? This I finde, there is not any of the ancient writers, but doe apply, yea, in a maner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate this speach to our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> And that this very day, the day of his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (truely termed heere <hi>the day of Gods wrath:</hi>) And wheresoeuer they treat of the
<pb facs="tcp:21585:3"/>
Passion, euer this verse commeth in: And (to say the trueth) to take the words strictly as they lie, they cannot agree, or be verified of any, but of him, &amp; him only. For though some other, not vnfitly, may bee allowed to say the same words: it must be in a qualified sense: for, in full and perfect proprietie of speach, He, and none but he: None can say, (neither Ieremie nor any other) <hi>Si fuerit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, sicut dolor meus,</hi> as <hi>Christ can:</hi> No day of wrath, like to his day: no sorow to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to his, (all are short of it,) nor his to any, it exceedeth them all.</p>
            <p>And yet, according to the letter, it can not be denied, but they be set downe by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,</hi> in the person of his own people, being then come to great miserie, and of the holy Citie, then layde waste, and desolate by the <hi>Chaldaees.</hi> What then? <hi>Ex Aegypto vocaui</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hos. 11. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Filium meum.</hi> Out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> haue I called my Sonne, was literally spoken of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people too: yet is by the Euangelist applied <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 15. Psal. 22. 1.</note> to our Sauiour Christ. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee?</hi> at the first vttered by <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet the same words our Sauiour ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:21585:4"/>
to himselfe, and that more truely and <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 46.</note> properly, then euer Dauid could: and of those of <hi>Dauids,</hi> and of these of <hi>Ieremies,</hi> there is one and the same reason.</p>
            <p>Of all which the ground is; that corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence which is between <hi>Christ</hi> and the Patriarches, Prophets, and People before <hi>Christ,</hi> of whom the Apostles rule is, <hi>Omnia</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.11.</note> 
               <hi>in figura contingebant illis:</hi> That they were themselues Types: and their suffrings, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running figures of the great suffering of the Son of God; which maketh <hi>Isaaks</hi> offering and <hi>Iosephs</hi> selling, and <hi>Israels</hi> calling from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that complaint of <hi>Dauids,</hi> and this of <hi>Ieremies,</hi> appliable to him; That hee may take them to himselfe, and the Church ascribe them to him, and that in more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of termes, and more fulnesse of trueth, then they were at the first spoken by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> or <hi>Ieremie,</hi> or any of them all.</p>
            <p>And this rule, and the steps of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proceeding by this rule, are to me a warrant, to expound and apply this verse (as they haue done before,) to the present occasion of this time; which requireth some
<pb facs="tcp:21585:4"/>
such Scripture to bee considered by vs, as doeth belong to his Passion, who this Day powred out his most precious Blood, as the onely sufficient Price, of the deare purchase of all our Redemptions.</p>
            <p>Be it then to vs, (as to them it was, and as most properly it is) The speech of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, as this Day hanging on the Crosse, to a sort of carelesse people, that goe vp and downe without any manner of Regard of these his Sorowes and sufferings, so worthy of all Regard. <hi>Haue ye no regard? ô all ye that passe by the way, Consider and behold, if euer there were sorrow, like to my Sorrow, which was done vnto me, wherwith the Lord afflicted me in the day of the fiercenesse of his wrath.</hi> Here is a Complaint, and here is a Request. <note place="margin">The parts.</note> A complaint, that we haue not: A Request, that we would haue the Paines &amp; Passions of our Sauiour Christ in some Regard. For first he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth (and not without cause) <hi>Haue ye no regard?</hi> And then (as willing to forget their former neglect, so they will yet doe it) he falleth to entreate, <hi>ô consider and behold!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21585:5"/>
And what is that wee should Consider? The Sorrow which hee suffereth: and in it, two things: The Qualitie, and the Cause. 1. The Qualitie, <hi>Si fuerit sicut:</hi> If euer the like were; And that either in respect of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> or <hi>Dolor meus.</hi> The Sorrow suffered, or the Person suffering. 2. The Cause: that is God, that in his wrath, in his fierce wrath, doeth all this to Him, which cause will not leaue vs, till it haue led vs to another cause in our selues, and to another yet in him; All which serue to ripen vs to <hi>Regard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two then specially we are mooued to Regard. 1. <hi>Regard</hi> is the maine point. But, because therefore we Regard but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because either we Consider not, or not aright; we are called to consider seriously of them. As if he should say, <hi>Regard</hi> you not? If you did <hi>Consider,</hi> you would: if you <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</hi> as you should, you would <hi>Regard</hi> as you ought. Certainely the Passion, if it were throughly <hi>Considered,</hi> would be duely <hi>Regarded. Consider</hi> then.</p>
            <p>So the points are two: The <hi>Qualitie,</hi> and the <hi>Cause</hi> of his suffering: and the dueties
<pb facs="tcp:21585:5"/>
two: To <hi>Consider,</hi> and <hi>Regard.</hi> So to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</hi> that we <hi>Regard</hi> them, &amp; him for them.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Haue ye no Regard? &amp;c.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O cease this Complaint, and to graunt this Request: we are to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: and that we may Regard, we are to Consider the paines of his Passion. Which, that we may reckon no easie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">The parties to whom.</note> matter of light moment, to doe, or not doe, as we list: First, a generall stay is made <note place="margin">O all ye that passe by the way, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> of all passengers, this day. For (as it were from his Crosse) doth our Sauiour addresse this his speech to them that goe to and fro, the day of his Passion, without so much as entertaining a thought, or vouchsafing a looke that way. <hi>O vos qui transitis!</hi> ô you that passe by the way, stay and Consider. To them frameth he this speech, that passe by: To them, and to them all. <hi>O vos omnes, qui transitis,</hi> ô all ye that passe by the way, stay and Consider.</p>
               <p>Which very stay of his, sheweth it to bee
<pb facs="tcp:21585:6"/>
some important matter, in that it is, of all. For, as for some to be stayed, and those the greater some, there may be reason; the most part of those that goe thus to and fro, may well intend it, they haue litle els to doe. But to except none, not some speciall Persons, is hard. What know wee their haste? Their occasions may be such, &amp; so vrgent, as they cannot stay. Well, what haste, what busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse soeuer, passe not by, stay though. As much to say, as, Bee they neuer so great, your occasions; they are not, they cannot be so great as this: How vrgent soeuer, this is more, and more to be intended. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this, is worthy the staying of a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It is worth the Considering of those, that haue neuer so great affaires in hand. So materiall is this sight in his accompt; which serueth to shew the exigence of this duetie. But as for this point it needeth not to be stood vpon to vs here at this time: we are not going by, we need not to be stayed; wee haue stayed all other our affaires, to come hither, and here we are all present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to haue it set before vs, that wee
<pb facs="tcp:21585:6"/>
may consider it. Thither then let vs come.</p>
               <p>That which we are called to behold and <note place="margin">Sorow.</note> consider, is his <hi>Sorow:</hi> And Sorow is a thing, which of it selfe Nature enclineth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as being our selues in the bodie which <note place="margin">Herb. 13. 3.</note> may bee one day in the like sorowfull case. Therefore wil euery good eye turne it selfe, and looke vpon them that lye in distresse. <note place="margin">1. Behold.</note> Those two in the Gospel, that passed by the <note place="margin">Luke 10. 32.</note> wounded man, before they passed by him, (though they helped him not as the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> did) yet they looked vpon him as hee lay. But this partie here, lieth not, he is lift vp, as the Serpent in the wildernes, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 14</note> we turne our eyes away purposely, we can neither will nor chuse, but behold him.</p>
               <p>But because to <hi>Behold,</hi> and not to <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 1. 11.</note> is but to gaze; And gazing the Angel blameth in the Apostles themselues, wee must doe both: both <hi>Behold,</hi> and <hi>Consider:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Consider.</note> looke vpon, with the eye of the Body, that is, <hi>Beholde;</hi> and looke into with the eye of the Mind, that is, <hi>Cosider.</hi> So saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here.

               <p>The aestimate whereof we may take from the second word, of <hi>Melting,</hi> that is, from his sweat in the Garden; strange and the <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 44.</note> like whereof was neuer heard or seene.</p>
               <p>No maner violence offred him in Body; no man touching him, or being neere him, in a colde night (for they were faine to haue a fire within doores) lying abroad in the ayre, and vpon the colde earth, to be all of a sweat, and that Sweat to be Blood; and not as they call it, <hi>Diaphoreticus,</hi> a thinne faint Sweat; but <hi>Grumosus,</hi> of great Drops, and those, so many, so plenteous, as they went through his apparell and all; and through all, streamed to the ground, &amp; that in great abundance; Reade, Enquire, and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Si fuerit sudor sicut sudor iste.</hi> If euer there were Sweat like this Sweat of his? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:21585:9"/>
the like Sweat certainely, and therefore neuer the like Sorrow. Our translation is, <hi>Done vnto me:</hi> but we said, the word proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifieth (and so S.

And sure it was so: For see, euen in the very next wordes of all to this verse, he <note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> complaineth of it, <hi>Ignem misit in ossibus me is,</hi> That a fire was sent into his bones which melted him, and made that bloody Sweat to distill from him. That houre, what his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings were, it is dangerous to define: wee know them not, we may be too bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of them. To very good purpose it was, that the ancient Fathers of the Greeke Church in their Liturgie, after they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted all the particular Paines as they are set downe in his Passion, and by all, and by euery one of them, called for mercy; doe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, shut vp all with his, <gap reason="foreign">

Sorowes and Sufferings felt by thee, but not distinctly knowen by vs, haue mercy vpon vs and saue vs.</p>
               <p>Now, though this suffice not, nothing neere; yet let it suffice, (the time being short) for his paines of Body and Soule: for those of the Body, it may be some may haue endured the like: but the sorrowes of his Soule are vnknowen sorowes: &amp; for them, none euer haue, euer haue, or euer shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the like; the like, or neere the like in any degree.</p>
               <p>And now to the third. It was said before, <note place="margin">3 Poena Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> To be in distresse, such distresse as this was, &amp; to find none to comfort, nay not so much as to regard him, is all that can be sayd, to make his sorow a <hi>Non sicut.</hi> Comfort is it, by which in the midst of all our sorowes, we are <hi>Confortati,</hi> that is, strengthened &amp; made the better able to beare them all out. And who is there, euen the poorest creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, but in some degree findeth some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, or some regard at some bodies ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? For if that be not left, the state of that partie is here in the third word said to be like the
<pb facs="tcp:21585:10"/>
tree, whose leaues and whose sruit are all beaten off quite, and it selfe left bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked both or the one and of the other.</p>
               <p>And such was our Sauiours case in these <note place="margin">1 Leaues.</note> his Sorowes this day, and that so, as what is left the meanest of the sons of men, was not left him: <hi>Not a leafe.</hi> Not a leafe! Leaues I <note place="margin">1 Withered leaues.</note> may wel call all humane Comforts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, where of he was then left cleane deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. 1. <hi>His owne,</hi> they among whom he had gone about all his life long, healing them, teaching them, feeding them, doing them all the good he could, it is they that cry, <hi>Not him, no, but Barabbas rather; Away</hi>

               <p>But these were but withered leaues. They <note place="margin">2 Greene leaues.</note> then that on earth were neerest him of all, the greenest leaues &amp; likest to hang on, and

               <p>But, leaues are but leaues, and so are all <note place="margin">2 Fruit.</note> earthly stayes. The fruit then, the true fruit of the Vine indeed, the true comfort in all heauinesse, is <hi>Desuper,</hi> from aboue, is diuine consolation. But <hi>Vindemiauit me,</hi> (saith the Latine text) euen that was in this his Sorow, this day, bereft him too. And that was his most sorowfull complaint of all others: not that his friends vpon earth, but that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from heauen had forsaken him, that neither heauen nor earth yeelded him any regard; but that betweene the passioned powers of his soule, and whatsoeuer might any waies refresh him, there was a Trauerse drawen, &amp; he left in the estate of a weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten tree, all desolate and forlorne. Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, too euident, by that his most dreadful crie, which at once moued all the powers in heauen and earth, <hi>My God, my God, why hast</hi>

               <p>It is strange, very strange, that of none of the Martyrs the like can be read; who yet endured most exquisite paines in their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes; yet wee see with what courage, with what chearefulnes, how euen singing they are reported to haue passed through their torments. Will ye know the reason? <hi>S Augustine</hi> setteth it downe, <hi>Martyres non eripuit, sed nunquid deseruit?</hi> He deliuered not his Martyrs, but did he forsake them? He deliuered not their bodies, but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke not their soules, but distilled into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dew of his heauenly comfort; an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant supply for all they could endure. Not so here, <hi>Vindemiauit me</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>Dereliquisti me</hi> (sayeth hee himselfe:) No comfort, no supply at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leo</hi> it is that first said it, (and all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie allow of it,) <hi>Non soluit Vnionem, sed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxit visione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The Vnion was not dissolued; True, but the beames, the influence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, and for any comfort from thence,
<pb facs="tcp:21585:12"/>
his Soule was, euen as a scorched heath ground, without so much as any drop of dew of Diuine comfort: as a naked tree, no fruit to refresh him within, no lease to giue him shadow without: The power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse let loose to afflict him: the influence of comfort, restrained to relieue him. It is a <hi>Non sicut</hi> this, It cannot be expressed as it should, and as other things may; In silence we may admire it, but all our words wil not reach it. And though to draw it so farre as some doe, is little better then blasphemie; Yet on the other side, to shrinke it so short, as other some doe, cannot be but with dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to his loue, who to kindle our loue and louing Regard, would come to a <hi>Non sicut</hi> in his suffering: For, so it was, and so we must allow it to be. This in respect of his Passion. <hi>Dolor.</hi>

               <p>What was done to Him we see. Let there <note place="margin">1. GOD.</note> now be a Quaest of Inquirie, to finde who was the doer of it. Who? who, but the Power of darkenesse, wicked <hi>Pilate,</hi> bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the enuious Priests, the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souldiers? None of these are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here. We are too low, by a great deale, if we thinke to finde it among men. <hi>Quae fecit mihi Deus.</hi> It was God that did it. An houre of that day was the houre of the <note place="margin">Luke 22. 53.</note> Power of darkenesse: but the whole day it selfe, is said here plainely, was the day of the wrath of God. God was a doer in it; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath afflicted me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God afflicteth some in Mercy: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Gods wrath.</note> in wrath. This was in his wrath. In his wrath God is not alike to all; Some he afflicteth in his more gentle and milde: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his fierce wrath. This was in the very fiercenesse of his wrath. His Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, his Sweate, and Cry, shew as much; They could not come, but from a wrath, <hi>Si fuerit sicut,</hi> (For we are not past <hi>Non</hi>

                  <hi>sicut,</hi> no not here in this part: it followeth vs still, and will not leaue vs in any point, not to the end.)</p>
               <p>The Cause then in God, was wrath. <note place="margin">2. Sinne.</note> What caused this wrath? God is not wroth, but with sinne; Nor grieuously wroth, but with grieuous sinne. And in CHRIST there was no grieuous sinne, Nay, no sinne <note place="margin">Not his.</note> at all. <hi>God</hi> did it, (the text is plaine.) And in his fierce wrath he did it. For what cause? For, God forbid God should doe as did <note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Annas</hi> the high Priest, cause him to be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without cause. God forbid (saith <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) the Iudge of the world should doe <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> wrong to any. To any, but specially to his owne Sonne: That his Sonne, of whom with thundring voyce from Heauen, he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth all his ioy and delight were in Him, in him onely he was wel pleased. And how then could his wrath waxe hot, to doe all this vnto him?</p>
               <p>There is no way to preserue Gods Iustice, and Christs Innocency both, but to say as the Angel said of him to the Prophet Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note>

               <p>Pity it is to see a man pay that he neuer tooke: but if he will become a Surety, if he will take on him the person of the Debtor, so he must. Pity to see a sillie poore Lambe lie bleeding to death; but if it must be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, (such is the nature of a sacrifice) so it must. And so Christ, though without sinne in himselfe, yet as a Suretie, as a Sacrifice, may iustly suffer for others, if he will take vpon him their persons; and so, God may iustly giue way to his wrath against him.</p>
               <p>

layd vpon him the iniquities of vs all. <hi>All, all, euen those,</hi> that passe to and fro, <hi>and for all this,</hi> Regard <hi>neither him nor his Passion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The short is: It was wee, that for our sinnes, our many, great, and grieuous sins, (<hi>Si fuerint sicut,</hi> the like whereof neuer were) should haue swet this Sweat, and haue cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Cry; should haue bene smitten with these sorrowes by the fierce wrath of God, had not he stepped betweene the blow and vs, and latched it in his owne body and soule, euen the dint of the fiercenesse of the wrath of God. O the <hi>Non sicut</hi> of our sins, that could not otherwise be answered!</p>
               <p>To returne then a true verdict. It is we, (we wretched sinners that we are) that are to be found the principals in this acte; and those on whom wee seeke to shift it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue it from our selues, Pilate and Caiaphas and the rest, but instrumentall causes onely. And it is not the executioner that killeth the man properly, (that is, They:) No, nor the Iudge, (which is God in this case:) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinne, <hi>Solum peccatum homicida est,</hi> Sinne onely is the murtherer, (to say the trueth;)
<pb facs="tcp:21585:16"/>
and our sinnes the murtherers of the Sonne of God: and the <hi>Non sicut</hi> of them, the true cause of the <hi>Non sicut</hi> both of Gods wrath, and of his sorowfull sufferings.</p>
               <p>Which bringeth home this our text to vs, euen into our owne bosomes; and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it most effectually, to mee that speake, and to you that heare, to euery one of vs; and that with the Prophet <hi>Nathans</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Tu es homo,</hi> Thou art the Man, euen <note place="margin">2.

               <p>But yet, what was the cause why Hee on <note place="margin">3 Loue of vs.</note> his part? what was that that mooued him thus to become our Suretie, and to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our debt and danger? that mooued him thus to lay downe his Soule, a sacrifice for our sinne? Sure, <hi>Oblatus est quia voluit,</hi> faith <hi>Esay</hi> againe, Offered he was for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Esa. 53.7.</note> cause, but because he would: For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he would, he needed not: Needed not, for any necessitie of Iustice; for no Lambe was euer more innocent: Nor for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny necessitie of constraint; For twelue legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of Angels were ready at his command: But, because he would.</p>
               <p>And why would hee? No reason can be giuen, but, because hee Regarded vs: (Marke that reason.) And what were we? Verily, vtterly vnworthy euen his least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; not worth the taking vp, not worth <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8</note> the looking after: <hi>Cum inimici essemus,</hi> (saith the Apostle) we were his enemies when he did it; without all desert before, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all regard after he had done and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all this for vs: and yet hee would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vs, that so little regard him. For when he saw vs (a sort of forlorne sinners) <hi>Non priùs natos, quàm damnatos,</hi> Damned as fast as borne, as being by nature children <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> of wrath, and yet still heaping vp wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of wrath, by the errours of <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5</note> our life, till the time of our passing hence: and then the fierce wrath of God, ready to ouerwhelme vs, and to make vs endure the terrour &amp; torments of a neuer dying death, (another <hi>Non sicut</hi> yet) When (I say) he saw vs in this case, hee was mooued with compassion ouer vs, and vndertooke all this
<pb facs="tcp:21585:17"/>
for vs. Euen then, in his loue he regarded vs, and so regarded vs, that he regarded not himselfe, to regard vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi> sayth most truely, <hi>Dilexistime Domine, magis qudm te, quando mori voluisti prome:</hi> In suffring all this for vs, thou shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst (Lord) that wee were more deare to thee, that thou regardest vs more, then thine owne selfe: And shall this Regard finde no regard at our hands?</p>
               <p>It was Sinne then, and the hainousnesse of Sinne in vs, that prouoked wrath and the fiercenesse of his wrath in <hi>God:</hi> It was loue, and the greatnes of his loue in <hi>Christ,</hi> that caused him to suffer these Sorrowes, and the grieuousnes of these Sorrowes, and all for our sakes.</p>
               <p>And indeed, but onely to testifie the <hi>Non sicut</hi> of this his Loue, all this needed not, that was done to him. One, any one, euen the very least of all the paines hee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, had bene ynough; ynough, in respect of the <hi>Meus:</hi> ynough, in respect of the <hi>Non sicut</hi> of his Person. For that which setteth the high price on this Sacrifice, is this; That
<pb facs="tcp:21585:18"/>
he which offereth it vnto God, is God. But, if little had bene suffered, little would the Loue haue bene thought, that suffered so little; and as little Regard would haue bene had of it. To awake our Regard then, or to leaue vs excuselesse, if we continue regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; all this he bare for vs: that he might as truely make a Case of <hi>Si fuerit Amor, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut Amormeus,</hi> as he did before, of <hi>Si fuerit Dolor, sicut Dolormeus.</hi> We say we will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Loue; if we will, here it is to Regard.</p>
               <p>So haue we the Causes all three: Wrath in God: Sinne in our selues: Loue in Him.</p>
               <p>Yet haue we not all we should. For, what <note place="margin">Our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by it. Perteines it not to vs?</note> of all this? What good? <hi>Cuibono?</hi> That, that is it indeed that we will Regard, if any thing: as being matter of Benefit, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing in a manner the world regardeth, which bringeth vs about to the very first words againe. For, the very first words which we reade, <hi>Haue ye no regard?</hi> are in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:21585:18"/>
Regard it no better? For these two, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining, and Regarding, are folded one in another, and goe together so commonly, as one is taken often for the other. Then to be sure to bring vs to Regard, he vrgeth this, <hi>Perteines not all this to you?</hi> Is it not for your good? Is not the benefit yours? Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of benefite, they perteine to you, and without them, Loue, and all the rest, may pertaine to whom they will.</p>
               <p>Consider then, the inestimable benefite that groweth vnto you, from this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loue. It is not impertinent this; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this; That to vs hereby, all is turned about cleane contrary: That by his Stripes, we are healed: by his Sweat, we refreshed: By his forsaking, wee receiued to Grace: That this day, to Him the day of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gods wrath: is to vs the Day of the fulnesse of Gods fauour, (as the Apostle <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 2.</note> colleth it) A day of Saluation. In respect of that hee suffered, (I denie not) an euill day: a day of heauinesse: But, in respect of that, which He, by it hath obtained for vs: It is, (as we truely call it,) A good Day, a
<pb facs="tcp:21585:19"/>
Day of Ioy and Iubilee. For it doeth not onely ridde vs of that wrath, which pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vs for our Sinnes: but, further it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that pertaine to vs, whereto we had no maner of right at all.</p>
               <p>For, not onely by his death, as by the death of our sacrifice; by the blood of his Crosse, as by the blood of the Paschal Lambe, the Destroyer passeth ouer vs, and <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 15.</note> we shall not perish: But also by his death, as by the death of our High Priest (for hee <note place="margin">Num. 15. 28.</note> is Priest and Sacrifice both) we are restored from our exile, euen to our former forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted estate in the lande of Promise. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as the Apostle sayeth) <hi>Non sicut deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, sic donum:</hi> Not to the same estate, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> but to one nothing like it: (that is) One farre better, then the estate our sinnes berest vs: For they depriued vs of Paradise, a place on earth: but by the purchase of his Blood, wee are entitled to a farre higher, euen the kingdom of Heauen: &amp; his blood, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the blood of Remission to acquite vs of <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 28.</note> our sinnes; but the blood of the Testament too, to bequeath vs, and giue vs estate, in
<pb facs="tcp:21585:19"/>
that heauenly inheritance.</p>
               <p>Now whatsoeuer else, this (I am sure) is a <hi>Non sicut:</hi> as that which the eye, by all it can see; the eare, by all it can heare; the heart, by all it can conceiue, cannot patterne it, or set the like by it. Pertaines not this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs neither? Is not this worth the regard? Sure if any thing be worthy the regard, this is most worthy of our very worthiest and best Regard.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we considered and seene, not <note place="margin">The recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of all.</note> so much as in this sight we might or should, but as much as the time will giue vs leaue. And now, lay all these before you, (euery one of them a <hi>Non sicut</hi> of it self) the paines of his Body, esteemed by Pilates <hi>Ecce;</hi> the sorrowes of his Soule, by his sweate in the Garden; the comfortlesse estate of his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, by his crie on the Crosse: And with these, his Person, as being the Sonne of the great and eternall God. Then ioyne to these, the Cause: In God, his fierce wrath: In vs, our heinous sinnes deseruing it: In him, his exceeding great Loue, both suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that for vs which we had deserued; and
<pb facs="tcp:21585:20"/>
procuring for vs, that wee could neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue: making that to appertaine to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which of right pertained to vs; and making that pertaine to vs, which pertained to him onely, and not to vs at all, but by his meanes alone. And after their view in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall, lay them all together, so many <hi>Non sicuts</hi> into one, and tell me, if his Complaint bee not Iust, and his Request most Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>

               <p>Truely the Complaint is Iust, it may <note place="margin">The maner earnest.</note> mooue vs: it wanteth no reason, it may mooue: and it wanteth no affection in the deliuerie of it to vs, on his part to mooue vs. Sure it mooued him exceeding much: for among all the deadly sorrowes of his most bitter Passion, This, euen this seemeth to bee his greatest of all, and that which did most affect him, euen the griefe of the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reckoning most men haue it in; as little respecting him, as if he had done, or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing at all for them. For loe, of all the sharpe paines he endureth, he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not: but of this he complaineth, of <hi>No</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21585:21"/>
                  <hi>Regard:</hi> That, which grieueth him most, that, which most he moaneth, is this. It is strange, he should be in paines, such paines as neuer any was, and not complaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of them, But, of want of Regard onely. Strange, he should not make request, ô De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me, or Relieue me: But onely, <hi>ô Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and Regard me.</hi> In effect, as if he said, None, no deliuerance, no reliefe do I seeke: Regard I seeke. And all that I suffer, I am content with it,: I regard it not: I suffer most willingly, if this I may finde at your hands, Regard.</p>
               <p>Truely, This so passionate a Complaint <note place="margin">The regard of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of it.</note> may mooue vs; it mooued all but vs: For most strange of all it is, that all the Creatures in heauen and earth, seemed to heare this his mournefull Complaint, &amp; in their kind, to shew their Regard of it: The Sunne in heauen shrinking in his light; the earth trembling vnder it; the very stones clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in sunder, as if they had sense and Sympathie of it: and sinfull men onely, not mooued with it. And yet it was not for the Creatures, this was done to Him, to
<pb facs="tcp:21585:21"/>
them it pertaineth not: But for vs it was, and to vs it doeth; And shall wee not yet Regard it? Shall the Creature, and not we? Shall we not?</p>
               <p>If we doe not, it may pertaine to vs, but <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, if.</note> wee pertaine not to it: It pertaines to all, but all pertaine not to it. None pertaine to it, but they that take benefite by it; and none take benefite by it, no more then by the brasen Serpent, but they that fixe their eye on it. Behold, Consider, and Regard it: the profite, the benefite is lost without Regard.</p>
               <p>If we doe not, as this was a day of Gods <note place="margin">The perill, if not.</note> fierce wrath against him, onely for regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs; so there is another day comming, and it will quickly bee heere, a day of like fierce wrath against vs, for not regarding <note place="margin">Psal. 90. 11.</note> him. And who regardeth the power of this wrath? Hee that doeth, will surely Regard this.</p>
               <p>In that day, there is not the most carelesse of vs all, but shall cry as they did in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>Domine, non ad te pertinet, si perimus?</hi>

               <p>Then, to giue end to his Complaint, let <note place="margin">2 The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Haue some Regard.</note> vs graunt him his Request, and Regard his Passion. Let the Rarenesse of it: The Neerenesse to vs: Let Pitie, or Duety: Feare, or Remorse: Loue, or Bountie. Any of them, or all of them. Let the Iustnesse of his Complaint: Let his affectionate maner of Complaining of this, and onely this. Let the shame of the Creatures Regard: Let our Profit, or our Perill. Let some thing preuaile with vs, to haue it in some Regard.</p>
               <p>Some Regard! Verily, as his sufferings, <note place="margin">I Our best Regard.</note> his Loue, our good by them are: so should our Regard bee, a <hi>Non sicut</hi> too, That is, a Regard of these, and of nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of these. It should be so: For with the benefit, euer the Regard should arise.</p>
               <p>But God helpe vs poore sinners, and bee mercifull vnto vs. Our Regard is a <hi>Non si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,</hi> indeed: but it is backward, &amp; in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary sense; That is, no where so shallow, so

short, or so soone done. It should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it should haue our deepest considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this; and our highest Regard.</p>
               <p>But if that cannot be had, (our nature is <note place="margin">2.

               <p>It is kindly to consider <hi>Opus diei, in die suo,</hi> The worke of the Day, in the Day it was wrought: and this day it was wrought. This Day therefore, whatsoeuer our businesse be, to lay them aside a little; whatsoeuer our haste, yet to stay a little, and to spend a few thoughts in calling to minde and taking to Regard, what this Day the Sonne of God did and suffered for vs: and all for this end, that what he was then, wee might not be; and what he is now, we might be for euer.</p>
               <p>Which, Almighty God graunt we may all doe, more or lesse, euen euery one of vs, according to the seuerall measures of his grace in vs, &amp;c.</p>
