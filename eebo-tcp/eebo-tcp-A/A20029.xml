            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Taken for <hi>Purge,</hi> a leafe stiept ouer night in a portion of white Wine or Rhenish, will giue a
<pb facs="tcp:25315:14"/>
mighty purge, deducing &amp; deriuing in short processe, humors of any combination and excrements of euery condition, <hi>Per loca conferentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Taken for <hi>Cure,</hi> the onely ashes thereof are profitable, and in most vse (no doubt) for greene wounds, vlcers, and olde sores of all sortes.</p>
               <trailer>These are the foure principall endes and vses of <hi>Tabacco.</hi>

               <head>And, as the Vse, so is the Application of Tabacco.</head>
               <p>First, when you take it by <hi>Pipe,</hi> mine aduice is, that you put into your box of prepared powder, one grain at the least, of the oile of <hi>Anniseedes,</hi> it will giue your powder a maruellous grace, and comfortable, both to the smell, and taste, of the taker, not only pleasant and delectable, but also profitable and commendable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to the daintier sort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when you vse it for <hi>Vomite,</hi> doe not, in any case, abridge, or restraine, the violent operation thereof, by apposition of any dilatory mixture: But, suffer it to expresse it owne force in action, <hi>secundùm libitum suum, &amp; vim innatam,</hi> for the more effectuall and speedier dispatch, of a surcharged stomacke, by reiectation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when you intend to <hi>Purge,</hi> omit not, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not, it will be very expedient, and no lesse conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
<pb facs="tcp:25315:14"/>
for you, and euery man of euery condition, the night before you take it, to infuse together with your <hi>Tabaccoes</hi> leafe in white wine, or other liquor, some prety portion of <hi>Synamon, Ginger,</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs</hi> brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, with two or three cheires of whole <hi>Mace:</hi> And (if you list) of <hi>Liquorice</hi> and <hi>Anniseedes</hi> likewise bruised, a small quantitie. These things are <hi>verè carminatiua,</hi> cordiall, <hi>&amp; Alexipharmaca,</hi> and wil make your <hi>Tabac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> to become <hi>medicamentum benedictum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, When you apply it for <hi>Cure</hi> of wounds, you must remember to reserue the burnt ashes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in your <hi>Tabaccoes</hi> pipe. Of the same, sprinckle into your greene wound, vlcer, or sore, and you shall see it performe strange and admirable effectes (as it were) <hi>vnum idémque,</hi> drying, cleansing, filling, and reforming the part and place affected, as shall apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Many men doe diuersly report woonderfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes, in this behalfe, brought to passe, onely by the vertue and operation of <hi>Tabacco.</hi> And some pretty helpes (I confesse) at home, haue I also seene there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to no small ease of diuerse, encouragement to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and tending chiefly to the inestimable praise of God, the Author of all gnod: Wherefore I wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with this <hi>Epiphonoema,</hi>
