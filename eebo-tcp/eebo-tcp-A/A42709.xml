         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Something offered to the Conſideration
of all thoſe who have a hand in putting
the late made Act, (entituled, An Act
to prevent and ſuppreſs Seditious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles)
in execution.</head>
            <head type="sub">For the ſake of ſuch who have any tenderneſs towards the
Innocent; and alſo for the information of all others, who
have had, ſhall or may have, a hand in putting in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the ſaid Act, I ſhall offer ſomething to ſhew, whom
and what Exerciſes of Religion are concerned in and by the
ſaid Act, and what not, According to the moſt true natural
genuine litteral ſenſe and meaning thereof, and no otherwiſe.</head>
            <p>I Shall begin with the Title and Preamble of the ſaid Act, and then
come to the Body of it.</p>
            <p>This Act is entituled, <hi>An Act to prevent and ſuppreſs Seditious
Conventicles.</hi> It ſeems, there is, or may be, ſeveral ſorts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
as the word <hi>Conventicle</hi> doth import, which is a conveening
of ſeveral perſons together for ſome end and purpoſe or other. Now
there may be a convening of perſons together for good ends, as there
may be a convening of perſons together for evil ends. There may be a
convening of perſons together honeſtly, and juſtifiably, upon a Religious
account; as there may be a convening of perſons together in order to
the ſowing or ſpreading of Sedition: which latter, this Act, by the Title
of it, ſeems to be made to prevent &amp; ſuppreſs, as appears by joyning the
explanatory word <hi>Seditious</hi> to Conventicle, viz. <hi>An Act to prevent &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi>
[<hi>Seditious Conventicles.</hi>] And this doth further appear by comparing
therewith the Preamble or Reaſon of the Act, which runs thus: <hi>For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
therefore of further and more speedy remedies againſt the growing and
dangerous practices of</hi> [<hi>Seditious Sectaries</hi>] <hi>and other diſloyal perſons, &amp;c.</hi>
Here the word [<hi>Seditious</hi>] is uſed again, and joyned to <hi>Sectaries</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34381:2"/>
other diſloyal perſons. Now the word <hi>Sectary,</hi> as it is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
doth import perſons of ſeveral opinions or practices in matters
of Religion, differing from the eſtabliſhed Religion of Nations, and
ſuch as for Conſcience-ſake cannot conform there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Theſe, as truly ſuch, <note n="†" place="margin">For to ſuch all the King's Promiſes of Indulgence are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the 26th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1662. which ſee more at large.</note> ſeem not to be the
perſons intended in this Act, but ſuch, and only
ſuch, as are <hi>ſeditious Sectaries,</hi> and under pretence
of tender conſciences, do at their Meetings contrive
Inſurrections, or ſow Sedition among the people;
So that both by the Title and Preamble this Act doth
pretend at leaſt to be made to puniſh <hi>ſeditious Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and to ſuppreſs their Meetings, and not to
puniſh the truly conſciencious, nor ſuppreſs the
Meetings of thoſe who meet together not under any colour, but <hi>really</hi>
and <hi>truly</hi> to worſhip God as he doth require and perſwade them in their
own hearts and conſciences.</p>
            <p>But as if the Title and Preamble were only ſpecious pretences of a
Law againſt ſeditious and diſloyal perſons, to colour over foul intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the body of the Act, which ſeems to look a quite contrary way,
and is ſo made uſe of, and runs thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be it enacted, &amp;c. That if any perſon, &amp;c. ſhall be preſent at any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
Conventicle or Meeting, under</hi> [<hi>colour or pretence</hi>] <hi>of any Exerciſe
of Religion</hi> [<hi>in other manner than is allowed, &amp;c.</hi>] The words [<hi>under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or pretence</hi>] ſeem to relate to the Preamble of the Act. But then the
matter of fact, or that which makes the Meeting unlawful, ſo as the
being preſent at it becomes an offence, ought to have been expreſſed to
be the plotting or contriving Inſurrections, or the doing of ſome action
or other, that might render the Meeting [<hi>a Seditious Meeting, under the
colour or pretence of Religious Exerciſe</hi>] which would then have held pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the Title and Preamble or Reaſon of the Act; and might
have been counted a reaſonable Law, as all Laws ought to be: For
<hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> according to the Law of God, is (or ought to be) the
ground or foundation of all Law. And that Law that hath not Right
Reaſon for its foundation, is null and void in it ſelf; and will never be
of, nor bear any authority over ſober and reaſonable men, nor anſwer
to the Witneſs of God in the Conſciences of the Tranſgreſſors. But
this not being ſuch, nor ſo to be underſtood, as the Judges and Executors
of the Law do declare, both by word and practice. It ſeems to be an
unnatural, unreaſonable and unequal Law, and not at all like what it
pretends it ſelf to be, Namely, <hi>An Act to prevent and ſuppreſs</hi> [<hi>Seditious
Conventicles</hi>] <hi>or to prevent the growing and dangerous practices of [Seditious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34381:2"/>
Sectaries</hi>] <hi>and other diſloyal perſons, who under pretence of tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
do at their Meetings contrive Inſurrections, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, as interpreted
and made uſe of by our reaſonleſs Judges, Juſtices and Executors of the
Law, it is ſo far from being what it pretends it ſelf to be, to wit, A
Law to puniſh the guilty, ſuch as pretend to one thing and do another,
that it's made uſe of to puniſh the <hi>Innocent;</hi> (to wit) ſuch as are really,
and do truly what they pretend themſelves to be and do, that is, are
truly tender in Conſcience, and do meet (not only under <hi>pretence</hi> of
Religious Exerciſe, but) <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> to worſhip God in a peaceable
quiet manner, (or, to uſe the Kings own words in the aforementioned
Declaration) <hi>do modeſtly and without ſcandal perform their devotion in their
own way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it ſeems that principally which makes the Meeting unlawful, is,
The Exerciſe of Religion, being [<hi>in other manner than is allowed by the
Lyturgie or practice of the Church of England, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>If it be ſo that the Religious Exerciſe it ſelf is that which the Law is
made againſt, and that, becauſe in the manner of it, it may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Lyturgy or practice of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> then this
doth make it further appear to be an unnatural and unreaſonable Law:
For, as there is no reaſon rendred, ſo there is no reaſon to be rendred,
for the making of a Law to limit or reſtrain all people in their Religious
Exerciſes to the allowance of the Lyturgy or practice of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> For the Lyturgy, upon which the practice of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> in this caſe ſeems to be grounded, hath at moſt but the ordering,
direction and preſcription of humane Authority for its eſtabliſhment;
But the True Religion, and Religious Exerciſe, that God accepts, as
well to the manner as to the matter of it, muſt be performed according
to the ordering, direction, preſcription and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of
God; and cannot (neither is there any reaſon why it ſhould) be limited
to the allowance or preſcription of the Lyturgy, or any humane practice
or invention whatſoever, eſpecially if it be true: As it was ſaid by
ſome Judges and Executioners of this Law, viz. <hi>That to worſhip God in
Spirit and Truth, is to worſhip God in other manner than is allowed by the
Lyturgie or practice of the Church of England.</hi> And if it be ſo, that the
Lyturgy and practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo far degenerated from
the Spirit of Truth, that neither the one nor the other doth ſo much as
allow of worſhipping God in Spirit and in Truth, as theſe men ſay, O
how can they blame thoſe that ſeparate from ſuch a Church, as from an
Harlot or menſtruous Woman, that a man cannot touch but he muſt be
defiled!</p>
            <p>If the manner of the Religious Exerciſe be that which makes the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34381:3"/>
Meeting lawful or unlawful, then it ſeems the chief force of the Act
is in theſe words (<hi>viz.) Shall be preſent at any Aſſembly, Conventicle or
Meeting, under [colour or pretence] of any Exerciſe of Religion, in other
manner than is allowed, &amp;c.</hi> And then the words [<hi>Colour or pretence</hi>] in
this place is not to be underſtood to look back to thoſe mentioned in the
Preamble, who under pretence of tender Conſciences do at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<hi>contrive Inſurrections, &amp;c.</hi> but to look forward to the manner of the
Religious Exerciſe, and then the word <hi>Colour</hi> is improper in this place,
which can no otherwiſe be underſtood, but to make the pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Exerciſe to be a colour for ſome evil action intended: but to
take the word <hi>pretence</hi> apart from <hi>colour,</hi> and then it may be underſtood
to intend no more than that which is beforehand declared or foreſhewn
of the intention of the Meeting; and in this ſence I am willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
and make uſe of the word <hi>pretence</hi> in what follows: And then
it is clear that the principal offence in the Law is, the <hi>Religious Exerciſe</hi>
it ſelf, and that in the manner of it.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral qualifications which muſt concur to make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
preſent at Meetings, Offenders againſt this Act; they are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>1. The Meeting muſt be <hi>under pretence of ſome Exerciſe of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That Exerciſe of Religion muſt be</hi> in other manner than is allowed
by the Lyturgy or practice of the Church of England.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>There muſt be</hi> five perſons preſent, over and above the perſons of the
Family.</p>
            <p>4. The perſons preſent muſt be of the age of <hi>ſixteen years or more,</hi> and
<hi>Subjects of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems this Act is not againſt all Meetings, but only againſt ſuch
Meetings <hi>as are under pretence of ſome Exerciſe of Religion;</hi> neither is it
againſt all Meetings under pretence of Exerciſe of Religion, but only
ſuch as are in <hi>private Families,</hi> and within the forementioned qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
For, 1. if the Meeting be under pretence of Religious Exerciſe,
yet if the Religious Exerciſe be in no other manner than is allowed, &amp;c.
this Meeting is not within the Act, although there be five perſons or
more preſent beſides the perſons of the family.</p>
            <p>2. If the Religious Exerciſe uſed, be in other manner than is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
if there be not five perſons or more preſent, of the age of ſixteen
years, and ſubjects of this Realm, this Meeting is not within the ſaid
Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> What Meetings then are thoſe within the Act?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such Meetings as are within all the qualifications, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of which are the two firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Meeting being under pretence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34381:3"/>
of Religious Exerciſe <hi>in other manner than is allowed, &amp;c.</hi> Then it ſeems
the <hi>manner</hi> of the Religious Exerciſe is the principal qualification that
makes the Meeting either lawful or unlawful; and that as it is either
allowed or diſallowed by the Lyturgy and practice of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Queſtion is,</hi> What Exerciſes of Religion, as to the manner of
them, are, and what are not allowed by the Lyturgie or practice of the Church
of England?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such Exerciſes of Religion as have preſcript forms or manners
for the exerciſe thereof, and no other forms or manners are allowed of;
Such Exerciſes of Religion, if not performed in the ſame form or manner
as is preſcribed, are in other manner than is allowed, &amp;c. But all ſuch
Exerciſes of Religion as have no preſcript forms nor manners but the
practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is, to leave all perſons to uſe their
own forms or manners, ſuch Exerciſes of Religion cannot be performed,
in other manner than is allowed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Exerciſes of Religion uſed in private families which have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
forms, are Baptiſm, the Viſitation of the Sick, and Adminiſtration
of the Communion (as they call it) to the ſick perſon, and others with
him. Now if any of theſe Exerciſes of Religion, or any other that have
preſcript forms, be performed in any other manner than is preſcribed,
at any Meeting where there ſhall be five perſons or more preſent, over
and above the perſons of the family, this Meeting is within the Act,
and the perſons preſent, if within the other qualifications, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Exerciſes of Religion that have no preſcript forms, are theſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> Preaching, Prayer out of Churches (ſo called) and Conference or
the like. There is no preſcript form of Preaching, no preſcript form
of Prayer in private (except as is before expreſt) no preſcript form of
Conference, but every man is left to uſe his own form or manner in all
theſe Exerciſes of Religion; So that theſe Exerciſes of Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be performed in other manner than is allowed, &amp;c. And then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
theſe Exerciſes of Religion, or ſuch like, are uſed, and no other,
that have preſcript forms, though there be five perſons or more preſent
over and above the perſons of the family, yet this Meeting is not within
the ſaid Act.</p>
            <p>If it be the practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to allow all perſons to
uſe their own forms or manners in ſuch Exerciſes of Religion to which
no forms or manners are preſcribed, then I query to all you Judges,
Juſtices &amp; Executors of the Law, what Exerciſes of Religion have been
performed in the Meetings of thoſe peaceable people, in ſcorn called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> whom you have ſo violently perſecuted under pretence of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34381:4"/>
ſaid Act, that hath been in other manner than is allowed by the Lyturgy
[or] practice of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> I ſay, ſhew us and the Nation
what they are, and how they have been performed in other manner than
is allowed, &amp;c. And if you do not (as ſure you cannot) then will not
the Nation, as well as we, ſee that you make the Law but a meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and colour, under which you execute your own wrath, enmity and
prejudice againſt the Innocent. And then it is time for you to ceaſe
your falſe and opprobrious language of <hi>Rebellion, Stubbornneſs</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to the Laws,</hi> to thoſe who are made ſubject in their ſpirits, not
only to the Law of God, but alſo to all juſt and equal Laws of men, and
ſee your ſelves to be thoſe <hi>ſtubborn, diſobedient</hi> and <hi>ſtiffnecked</hi> perſons, not
only againſt the Law of God in your ſelves and others, but alſo againſt
the Juſtice, Equity and Truth of the Laws of this Nation; and alſo the
very letter of the Law, under pretence of which you have injured,
wronged and ſpoiled ſo many hundreds, not only in their Liberties and
Eſtates, but very many of their Lives alſo. Oh ſurely the Lord will yet
again, as in dayes paſt, ariſe and plead the Cauſe of the Innocent and
Oppreſſed, and raiſe up the Spirit of Juſtice and true Judgment in this
Nation; and then in that day how will you be able to anſwer or make
ſatisfaction for the hundredth part of that dammage and ſpoil you have
made upon the Innocent! O therefore that you might hear and fear,
repent and do no more ſo, that the Judgment threatned you might
eſcape.</p>
            <p>But to return. I ſhall take it for granted, till it be denied, that it is
the practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to allow all perſons to uſe their
own forms or manners in ſuch Exerciſes of Religion as have no forms
or manners preſcribed: And then I ſay, firſt, to you in Commiſſion for
the Peace, or chief Magiſtrates of Corporations, that unleſs it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
or be proved to you, that there are private Meetings, where there
is ſome exerciſe of Religion or other uſed, that have preſcript forms,
and are uſed in other manner than is preſcribed, it is not lawful for you
to find or commit the perſons, preſent at ſuch Meetings, to Priſon, for
refuſing to pay Fines wrongfully impoſed on them; but rather protect
and defend the peaceable and quiet Meetings of ſuch, who at their
Meetings uſe no other manner of Exerciſe of Religion but ſuch as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Lyturgy [or] practice of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly. You of the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> who have ſworn to make your Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
free from fear, favour or reward, and to preſent <hi>the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,</hi> How can you with good conſcience
preſent any for being preſent at an <hi>Aſſembly, Conventicle or Meeting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour and pretence of Exerciſe of Religion</hi> [<hi>in other manner than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
&amp;c.</hi>] when nothing of the Religious Exerciſe, or manner of it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34381:4"/>
hath been proved to you; And if it hath, then ought you not to expreſs
the particular Exerciſe of Religion, with the manner of it, in the Bill
of Preſentment, that it may appear to others, as well as to your ſelves,
that it was in other manner than is allowed by the Lyturgy or practice
of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly. I ſhall ſay ſomehing to you of the</hi> Petty Jury, <hi>in whom the final
Judgment in this matter doth reſide: You take this Oath following;
viz.</hi> You ſhall well and truly try, and true deliverance make, between our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord the King, and the Priſoners at the Bar (whom you ſhall have
in charge) according to your Evidence. So help you God.</p>
            <p>It ſeems you are <hi>ſole Judges</hi> between the King and the Priſoners at
the Bar, as to the matter of Fact, and this you are to do <hi>truly, according
to your Evidence.</hi> Now when Indictments come before you upon the ſaid
Act, you are warily to conſider the Indictment, which ought to expreſs
the <hi>particular Exerciſe of Religion</hi> uſed at ſuch Meetings; but if it run
only in general terms, as hitherto they have done, that the perſons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
were preſent at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, at an <hi>Aſſembly, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
or Meeting, under colour or pretence of Exerciſe of Religion</hi> [<hi>in
other manner than is allowed by the Lyturgie or practice of the Church
of</hi> England.] You being ſworn to go according to your Evidence, you
ought to have clear and ſufficient Evidence in all the afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
particular qualifications; Alſo, that theſe very perſons <hi>have been
twice before convicted of the like offence before two Justices of the Peace, or the
chief Magiſtrate of ſuch Corporation where there is not two Juſtices of the
Peace, in due manner, and according to the form of the Statute in that caſe
made and provided;</hi> which muſt appear upon Record under their hands
and ſeals: which Record ought to expreſs the matter of Fact, with all
plainneſs and clearneſs; not in general terms, for that is not ſufficient,
but ought to expreſs the particular Exerciſe of Religion, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it, that it may appear to you, the perſons were duly convicted as
the Law requires. And this you are to conſider, that the <hi>matter of fact,</hi>
which ought to be proved to you, is twofold; the firſt and principal is,
That the Exerciſe of Religion uſed at ſuch Meetings was <hi>in other manner
than is allowed, &amp;c.</hi> elſe the ſecond matter of fact, to wit, <hi>the being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Meeting,</hi> can be no offence: which muſt be proved by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Religious Exerciſe uſed was ſome Exerciſe of Religion to
which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath preſcribed a particular form, and
notwithſtanding was performed in other manner than is preſcribed, elſe
it cannot be <hi>in other manner than is allowed, &amp;c.</hi> as is before expreſſed.</p>
            <p>If theſe things cannot be proved, you are perjured men that ſhall give
in your Verdict, that <hi>the Priſoners are guilty in manner and form as they
ſtand indicted,</hi> when the principal part of the matter of fact is not proved
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34381:5"/>
unto you. If the Judge ſhall ſay, as he uſeth to do, that having proved
that the perſons mentioned were at the Meeting, and that the Meeting
was upon a Religious Account: here is the matter of fact clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and there needs no more to find the perſons guilty.</p>
            <p>I ſay, and am ready to maintain it, That ſuch Evidence is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to prove the Indictment: For though this is matter of fact, yet it is
not all the matter of fact; nay, it's but the leaſt part: for the principal
matter of fact is the <hi>Religious Exerciſe,</hi> being <hi>in other manner than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
&amp;c.</hi> and if this be not proved, though the other be proved never
ſo clear, yet you cannot with good conſcience, according to your Oaths,
bring the perſons in guilty in manner and form as they ſtand indicted:
For conſider, the Indictment doth not only ſay, that the perſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
were preſent in ſuch a place at a Meeting, <hi>under colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Exerciſe of Religion,</hi> but alſo under colour or pretence of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of Religion <hi>in other manner than is allowed by the Lyturgy or practice
of the Church of England:</hi> and ſo ſaith the Act: But on the contrary,
ought to acquit or bring in the Priſoner <hi>not guilty of the Indictment,</hi> leſt
the Judgement and ſeverity of God (to whom alone in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
you are accountable in this matter) take hold of you, as it hath
done of ſome, who through fear have, contrary to their Conſciences,
conſented, with others, to the bringing-in the Innocent <hi>guilty,</hi> in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and form as they ſtood indicted: Witneſs <hi>Thomas Leader</hi> his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
in a Paper in print under his own Name, entituled,
<hi>The Wounded-Heart, or the Jury-mans Offence declared, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have written, I ſhall commit and commend to the Witneſs of
God in the Conſciences of all concerned, eſpecially you that may ſerve
of this Jury, that ſo you may ſee your own work more plain and clear
before you, and be left without excuſe.</p>
