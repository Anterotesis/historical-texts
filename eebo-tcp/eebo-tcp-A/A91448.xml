            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> under the Power of the SWORD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Edneſday the 6. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648. before eight in the morning, the Army ſent a
Party of Horſe and Foot to beſet all Paſſages and Avenues to the two Houſes
of Parliament to fright away the Members; yet many Members of us repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the Houſe, were ſeized upon, and carried Priſoners by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
into the Queens Court; nothing being objected againſt us; nor no Authority
vouched for it: Colonel <hi>Birche</hi> and Maſter <hi>Edward Stephens</hi> were pulled out of the
Houſe of Commons, as they looked out at the dore: at laſt the number ſhut up Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the Queens Court amounted to 41. And <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> came to us and avowed this
as the Act of the Generall, and Lieutenant Generall: So did Col: <hi>Hewſon,</hi> about 4 of
the Clock that day we were told by an Officer, <hi>that we muſt be caried to Wallingford-Houſe,
and ſo put into Coaches:</hi> But before this hapned, I ſhould have told you, That
the <hi>Sergeant</hi> of the Houſe of Commons was ſent with his Mace from the Houſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
our attendance there; and came into the Queens Court to us, but the Guard
would not let us out: He was ſent againe with his Mace for us, but then the Guards
upon the Houſe would not let the Sergeant come to us; at laſt the Coaches aforeſaid (to
put the greater ſcorne upon the Parliament) carried us all to Maſter <hi>Dukes</hi> Ale-houſe in
<hi>Hell,</hi> and there thruſt us in to ſpend the Night without any accommodation of Beds, &amp;c.
only C. <hi>Hewſon</hi> came to us, and offered it as a curteſie, <hi>that ſome of the Eldeſt ſhould be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to lie at home that Night, engaging to render themſelves the next morning by 9 of the Clock
at C. Hewſons lodgings in Whitehall;</hi> which was refuſed, it not being thought fit we ſhould
ſo farre owne an uſurped Authority. All this is done in purſuance of the Armies laſt
<hi>Remonſtrance</hi> and <hi>Declaration,</hi> and in ſubverſion of the KING, and His Poſterity, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
City, and Kingdome; the utter extirpation of all Law, Government, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and the converting of our wel-regulated Monarchy into a military Anarchy, with
a popular Parliament of the meaneſt of the Commons, onely at the beck of the Army:
I appeale to Heaven and Earth whether the attempt of <hi>Germin, Goring,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to bring up the
Northerne Army to London to over-awe the Parliament;</hi> which attempt onely was then
voted <hi>Treaſon:</hi> whether the Tumult of Apprentiſes at the Parliament dore, ſo ſeverely
proſecuted againſt the City, were comparable to this Rebellion: The Members ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
