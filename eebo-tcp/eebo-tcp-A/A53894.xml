            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>No Necessity of Reforming THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH Of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas there hath lately come forth a Book, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to give <hi>Reasons shewing the Necessity of Reformation of the Publike Doctrine, offered to the Consideration of the Parliament by divers Ministers of sundry Counties in England</hi>; being I have hitherto constantly believed the Publique Doctrine of our Church to be true and Orthodoxe, and have often blessed God for continuing me in the Faith professed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us since the Reformation, I did resolve to examine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, at my first leisure, the Reasons pretending to shew the Necessity of Reforming that Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Perusing that Part of the Book, which treateth of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with some diligence, I found not any one Reason which could in the least perswade me, that there is any such Necessity of Reformation of the publique Doctrine of our Church; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114792:3"/>
consequently did resolve, notwithstanding what is yet brought to the contrary, to continue in the Faith which I have hitherto professed, and not to repent of my Subscription to the Articles of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this private satisfaction of mine own Conscience, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a further consideration, that it is an undoubted dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of any Doctrine to be in a Necessity of being reformed, and fearing lest some, if not of the Parliament, to whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the Reasons are offered, yet of the People, for whose instruction they are published, might hereby conceive some sinister Opinion of the Doctrine of our Church, I thought it not unfit to give a publique account of my private thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Particular.</p>
            <p>But, lest any man may imagine that this writing of one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister against others might hinder that Union of all Parties, which, as at all times, so especially at this, is to be wished and embraced, I shall begin with this unfeigned Profession, that I do heartily and earnestly desire a full compliance, concurrence and union, with such persons as those Ministers who <hi>offer</hi> the <hi>Reasons</hi> professe themselves to be; that is to say, such as truly and unfeignedly will make good those words, [<hi>It is far from our thoughts to oppose or disparage Orthodox Doctrine, a well-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Liturgy, Rites for decency and order, Ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Apostolical Episcopacy, or due Rules of Discipline. We are for all these with truth, and against rigid impositions which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar a Christian of any liberty allowed him by Christ.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And lest this Publication might any way become, or be thought guilty of hindering or retarding that so much expected and desired Union, I have resolved to use my Pen with such brotherly temper and Christian moderation, as that there come not from me any provocation or the least Reflection either upon their Persons, their Parties or Perswasions; applying my self wholy and solely to a due examination and orderly discussion of their <hi>Reasons,</hi> weighing and trying whether they have in them any force to inferre the pretended Conclusion, and in case they prove not of that validity, discovering and declaring the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and weakness of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114792:3"/>Now the Proposition or Conclusion propounded and to be proved by them, according to the Title of their Book, and Front of the first Part, is this. <hi>There is a Necessity of the Reformation of the Publique Doctrine of the Church of England.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position I confesse to be the opinion of some men; for it is the Tenet of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I am assured that there is not one Papist who doth not resolutely maintain it: but that it is, or ever was, since the Reformation of the Church and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Articles, the Opinion of the <hi>Ministers of sundry Counties in England,</hi> still professing themselves Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I never yet understood.</p>
            <p>To this Proposition they have added an Appendage in these words, <hi>Reputed to be (but indeed not) established by Law.</hi> Which Addition must be considered in the laying down or fixing the Conclusion, to avoid all manner of misconception. In order whereunto, in the first place, I shall lay down this Assertion, <hi>Whether the Publique Doctrine be established indeed by Law, or whether it be Reputed onely to be established, there is no Necessity of the Reformation of it.</hi> And the reason of this Assertion in relation to the Appendage or Addition is clear; because the adding of these words <hi>Established</hi> or <hi>Reputed</hi> can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence at all upon the Reformation of the Doctrine. For if the Publique Doctrine be <hi>indeed</hi> established by Law, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, the establishment by Law cannot put it into a Necessity of Reformation; because no Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the worse by a Legall establishment: if the Publique <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> be onely <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to be established by Law, and be indeed not established, the Nonestablishment may put it in need of a Confirmation, but can put upon it no Necessity of Reformation: because the truth of the Doctrines of Religion dependeth not upon the Legall establishment.</p>
            <p>There is therefore a necessity of distinguishing these two conceptions of Reformation, and Confirmation of the Publique Doctrine. They are not more industriously confounded in their Treatise, then they must be carefully distinguished in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Wherefore I shall make my opposition distin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it in two Conclusions, the one opposed to the pretended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114792:4"/>
Necessity of Reformation, the other to the objected want of Confirmation. Of the first I shall treate resolvedly as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, to whom it properly appertaines to speake of Theologicall Doctrines, and shall take the leave earnestly to contend for the Faith of the Church; of the other I shall speake with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and submission to the Learned in the Laws, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the force of them better then I can with any modesty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do.</p>
            <p>Our first Conclusion then is this. <hi>There is no Necessity of a Reformation of the Publique Doctrine of the Church of England.</hi> This I here present by way of negation, opposing it to their affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not designing here to prove it, but onely to vindicate the truth of it from their objections, and to shew the invalidity of their Reasons.</p>
            <p>They begin to lay the Foundations of their Reasons thus. <hi>The Publique Doctrine of the Church of England, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received and insisted upon, is said to be contained in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> &amp;c. Where it is to be observed, First, that it is not said, All the Publique Doctrine of the Church is contained in the 39. Articles. Secondly, that whatsoever Publique Doctrine of the Church is not contained in the 39. Articles, is not so much as pretended to be in a Necessity of Reformation. So that if there be any Publique Doctrine not contained in the Articles, as I conceive they will confesse there is, that Doctrine is not onely clear from all their exceptions, but will serve also to invalidate something of them when they are brought against the rest.</p>
            <p>Their Reasons framed against the Publique Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Articles are laid upon two Foundations, upon the Doubtfulness and the Defectiveness of it; more Reasons of a Necessity of Reformation they pretend not to. For thus they assume, <hi>But these Articles are both Doubtfull and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</hi> First they endeavour to prove them Doubtfull at large; and when they have done with the Doubtfulnesse, they proceed immediately to the Defectivenesse, which having handled much more briefly they conclude their Treatise of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114792:4"/>As to their Reason grounded on their first Foundation it must run thus, <hi>Whatsoever is doubtfull is Necessarily to be reformed. But the Doctrine contained in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles is doubtfull. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctrine contained in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles is necessarily to be reformed.</hi> The Major Proposition is not by them expressed; neither is there any thing offered for the Proof or credit of it: And yet in some sense it may certainly be denied. But that is not so materiall. The very Minor Proposition, upon which the Reason mainly depends, hath no formall Proof annexed to it. For in stead of proving the Doubtfulnesse of the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, (which can be the onely pretence in this case of a Necessity of Reformation of Doctrine,) the Doubtfulnesse of the Confirmation of the Articles is onely insisted upon, in the two first Paragraphs, the Declaration of his Late Majesty 10. <hi>Caroli</hi> is rehearsed in the 3. Paragraph The sad consequences of the Continuation and Confirmation of that Declaration are urged by 7. severall Reasons, An Objection foreseen prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a Cure by taking away that Declaration is answered in two, Paragraphs, And more then this is not produced to prove that the Doctrine contained in the 39. Articles is doubtfull.</p>
            <p>To this I answer in Generall. Though the Articles had not been confirmed by Parliament, though the Declaration 10. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roli</hi> prefixed to the Articles were of evil consequence, though the Taking away of that Declaration would not give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if the Ministers be still tied to Subscription, yet it followeth not from any or from all of these that the Doctrine contained in the 39. Articles is doubtfull. For the Certainty of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine dependeth neither upon the Confirmation of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the Declaration of the King. The Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Articles was agreed upon, declared and set forth, some years before the Act of Parliament of the 13. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> many years before the Declaration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. If the Doctrine were doubtfull after the Act and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, it was doubtfull before; if it were not doubtfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be doubtfull after, because it is the same Doctrine both before and after, and neither the Act nor the Declaration is any part of the Doctrine or Articles. Here is no pretence of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114792:5"/>
any Doubtfulnesse in the Articles in themselves antecedent to the Act and Declaration, and independent of them. But unlesse they prove the Publique Doctrine it self to be doubtfull in it self, they bring nothing at all to prove a Necessity of a Reformation of it.</p>
            <p>According to the foundation of the second Reason grounded upon the Defectiveness of the Articles, their Argument must run thus. <hi>Whatsoever is defective is in a Necessity of being reformed. The Doctrine contained in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles is defective. Therefore the Doctrine contained in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles is in a Necessity of being reformed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, that they have not express'd the Major Proposition, much lesse have they brought any Reason to shew the truth of it; and that it is, in the sense in which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, untrue, is most certain. For it is not Necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any one or more Doctrines, onely for this reason, because they are not all Doctrines. Nor is any thing in it self therefore false or evil, because there is something else beside it true or good. Their Argument is the same with this. <hi>That to which any thing may be added must be reformed. But to the Publique Doctrine of the Church something may be added. Therefore that Doctrine which is professed must be reformed.</hi> They may as well inferre a Necessity of reforming the Gospel of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there may be something added to the Relations contained in it out of the Relations contained in the other Gospels: and thus every Evangelical Harmony would be a Reformation of each Evangelist. There is a large difference between Addition and Reformation. A defect supposes the Necessity of one, not of the other. Were therefore that proved by them which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, it would no way inferre the Conclusion, because that is not proved which is implied for the illation of it, and without which the Conclusion cannot follow. For if it be not Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that whatsoever is Defective should be Reformed, then he which proves onely that any Doctrine is defective, by want of Addition of other Doctrines to it, doth not prove that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to which the Addition should be made, must of Necessity be Reformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114792:5"/>If therefore I should answer no more then this to either of their Arguments, what hath been already said were sufficient to shew, that there is no Reason produced in that Book which doth or can prove the Necessity of a Reformation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But to give yet fuller Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to leave nothing unanswered which hath the least appearance of Opposition: I shall endeavour to occurre to all Particulars which may seem to inferre the Doubtfulnesse of the Doctrine, or the Defect of the Articles: omitting nothing which can be brought out of that Discourse to prove either.</p>
            <p>In relation to the First, it is most certain that the two former Paragraphs concern only the Legal Establishment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall be considered and refuted in my 2. Generall Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The 3. Paragraph onely reciteth part of the Declaration of 10 <hi>Caroli</hi> 1. Prefixed to the Articles, and that is there recited onely to shew the Inconveniences supposed to flow from it. As yet therefore there is nothing brought to manifest the Doubtfulnesse of the Doctrine: and if there shall appear to be any thing it must be contained in the 7. sad Consequences, as they call them, which are mainly and directly intended against the Declaration of that pious King and blessed Martyr, but obliquely strike at the Articles themselves and the Doctrine contained in them. Whatsoever therefore is contained in them to that purpose I shall examine, and clearly shew that is of no Validity to prove the doubtfulnesse of the Publique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>sad consequence,</hi> as they call it, speaks only of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Ministers from liberty to interpret the Articles, which is certainly far from proving the doubtfulness of them: for the Interpretation may be prohibited as needless, because of the Certainty, Evidence, and Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icuity of the Doctrine. As for the <hi>Notorious truth</hi> mentioned by them, whether it be a <hi>truth,</hi> or whether it be <hi>notorious,</hi> it is equally unconcerned in this proof, and may prove the Doubtfulness of the Publique Doctrine as much if it be false.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>sad consequence,</hi> presenteth nothing but the same complaint of want of Liberty to expound the Articles applied
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114792:6"/>
to a certain Particular Doctrine contained in the 16. Article, which is, <hi>Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptisme is sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now certainly this is in it self a most sound, certain, infallible, plain, and perspicuous Doctrine, and being so, the want of liberty to interpret one term of it, <hi>deadly sin,</hi> cannot render it Doubtfull. For interpret it which way you will, either say all sins are deadly, or say all sins are not deadly, it will be equally true, that <hi>Every deadly sin is not the sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> In the like manner, Whether we may fall from grace totally and finally, or whether we cannot fall from grace totally and finally, which hath been a great doubt; without any question, <hi>After we have received the Holy Ghost we may depart from grace given</hi>; of that there hath never been any question. And so this Exception no way inferres the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Doctrine, but rather gives a Testimony of the great Wisedome and Moderation of the Church, which in Points doubtfull and controverted hath propounded onely that which with no sober man can be matter of doubt or subject of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>sad consequence</hi> addeth nothing to the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but onely a new Particular of the 20. Article in which their Liberty of Interpretation is abridged: whereas the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle it self takes away no such liberty; neither doth it become the more doubtfull by any such liberty being taken away by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of His Majesties Declaration. For whether the Church be taken for <hi>the Church Catholick,</hi> or whether it be taken for <hi>the Church of England,</hi> it is most certainly and undoubtedly true, That <hi>the Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and Authority in Controversies of Faith:</hi> which is the first Doctrine contained in the 20. Article. And in the same manner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it <hi>doth happen</hi> that the Church should ordain ought contrary to Gods Word, or expound one place of Scripture repugnant to another, or whether this do, or shall, never happen: yet it is a Doctrine most undoubtedly certain, That <hi>it is not lawfull for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to Gods Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.</hi> Which is the second Doctrinal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114792:6"/>
propounded in the 20. Article, and that, howsoever they would endeavour to interpret it, most indubitable.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>sad consequence</hi> presenteth the same objection of want of liberty to expound the 34. Article; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore insisted upon, because they conceive they have found <hi>a strange expression</hi> in it, and they cannot understand <hi>how a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be said to be ordained.</hi> This is the first Objection brought by them against any Part of the Doctrine contained in any Article; neither is the Objection properly against the Matter, but onely against the manner of Speech. And yet they were forced to mutilate the Article, before they could raise this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against it. For thus they print the words, <hi>Whosoever.... doth openly breake the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the word of God, and be ordained by common Authority, ought to be rebuked openly,</hi> and so they joyn the word <hi>ordained</hi> both to <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> whereas the Article speaks plainly and distinctly thus, <hi>and be ordained and approved by common authority,</hi> that is to say respectively, the <hi>Ceremonies ordained,</hi> and the <hi>Traditions approved.</hi> Thus if they please to take the Article entire, they will be so far from shewing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doubtfull, that they will not be able to find in it so much as <hi>a strange expression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>sad consequence</hi> seemeth much more to the purpose then the former; for here they endeavour to prove more then they undertook. The Design propounded was to shew the Doctrine doubtfull; here they undertake to prove it false. The Article accused is the 35. and the accusation is, that it teacheth, <hi>the Bookes of Homilies to contain a godly and wholesome doctrine and necessary for these times</hi>; from whence they say, it will necessarily follow, that he which subscribeth this Article <hi>must subscribe to false doctrines or assertions.</hi> That therefore which the Article saith is <hi>godly, wholesome and necessary,</hi> they say is <hi>false.</hi> The false Doctrines charged upon the Homilies are two. The first is pretended to be taken out of <hi>Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>Of the place and time of Prayer.</hi> That Homily therefore is charged with false Doctrine. To which I answer, that the second Part of the Homily, <hi>Of the place and time of Prayer,</hi> containeth in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114792:7"/>
it these two Doctrines. 1. <hi>Christians ought to be zealous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to come to Church.</hi> 2. <hi>God is grieved with them who despise or little regard to come to Church on the day set apart for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> In reference to each of these the Article says very true, that this Homily containes <hi>a godly and wholesome doctrine, and necessary for these times</hi>; and I can assure him whosoever subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it, shall subscribe in this to no <hi>false Doctrine</hi> or <hi>assertion.</hi> The words which they affixe to this Homily, and in regard of which they charge it with falsehood, are these; <hi>Pluralities of wives was by special Prerogative suffered in the Fathers of the Old Testament, not for satisfying their carnall and fleshly lusts,</hi> &amp;c. But it were very strange if these words should be produced in the Homily to prove the necessity of <hi>a place and time of Prayer</hi>; certainly the Church would set no such example to extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant preaching. Indeed there are no such words in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and the mistake is so plain, that I cannot see how <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ministers in sundry Counties</hi> could possibly concurre in it.</p>
            <p>But though the words objected be not found in that Homily by them mentioned, yet they may be in another, and so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse they are, and that in the page by them cited, which makes the mistake the more remarkable. But the Homily in which they are found, is <hi>An information for them which take offence at certain places of the Holy Scripture</hi>; and the onely Doctrine which that Homily undertaketh to defend is, that <hi>the people ought to read the Scriptures,</hi> which in it self is plain and true, and so of no ambiguity. Now the Objection made there to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was, that the People by reading the Scriptures were led into divers mistakes; and the Homilist in answer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection endeavours to prevent misinterpretations of some scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, particularly such as taught that <hi>the godly Fathers had many wives and concubines:</hi> the words then objected are but an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Custome of the Patriarchs in answer to an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction raised against the Doctrine propounded and asserted; and therefore though the Reason of the Exposition were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Doctrine is never the lesse true, never the more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and so long as that is true, as certainly this Doctrine, <hi>the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114792:7"/>
People ought to read the Scriptures,</hi> is most true, the Article bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to no false Doctrine in reference to this Homily, when it saith <hi>it containeth a godly and wholesome doctrine, and necessary for these times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Objection is taken out of the Homily <hi>of Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds,</hi> the second part. The Design of which Part of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is to shew, <hi>How profitable it is for a man to exercise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Almesdeeds</hi>; and particularly it proveth, that <hi>to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and charitable is a means to keep a soul clean in the sight of God.</hi> Which part of the Doctrine is grounded there on <hi>Luke</hi> 11.41. <hi>Give almes of such things as you have, and behold all things are clean unto you:</hi> and being thus stated and confirmed, for a further Illustration or enlargement, the Homily proceedeth to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate Authorities: in which accumulation if any prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, it cannot make the Doctrine false or doubtfull: and that is still plainly true which the Article holds forth, even in reference to the Homily <hi>of Almesdeeds,</hi> that it <hi>containeth a godly and wholesome doctrine, and necessary for these times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sixth <hi>sad consequence,</hi> presenteth the <hi>Queens Majesty as having the chief power in the Realme of England,</hi> and raiseth a strong doubt whether the 37. Article intend any power to any other person beside Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But certainly the Kings Majesty hath the same power in his Dominions, that the Queens Majesty had in her Dominions; there is no difference in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Sex, or if there were, it is not probable that the weaker sex should have the stronger power. The Article hath expresse reference to <hi>the Queens Injunctions,</hi> set forth in the year 1559. and those Injunctions take particular care, that no other <hi>duty, allegiance, or bond</hi> should be required to the Queen, <hi>then was acknowledged to be due to the most noble Kings of famous memory, King Henry the Eight, her Majesties Father, or King Edward the Sixt, her Majesties Brother.</hi> The words of the Article it self suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare that the Doctrine contained in it concerneth all the Kings as Kings. The Title in Generall is <hi>of the Civil Magistrates,</hi> and the words run thus, <hi>Where we attribute to the Queens Majesty the chief government, we give not to our Princes,</hi> &amp;c. shewing that what they gave to her, they gave to all the Kings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114792:8"/>
of <hi>England.</hi> Which will appear more plainly out of the first Latine Copy printed in the time of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the year 1563. read and approved by the Queen, the words whereof are these, <hi>Cùm Regiae Majestati summam gubernationem tribuimus, quibus titulis intelligimus animos quorundam calumniatorum offendi, non damus Regibus nostris aut verbi Dei aut Sacramentorum admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrationem,</hi> &amp;c. Being therefore the Article expressely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth and concerneth the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as they are the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> the mention of the <hi>Queens Majesty</hi> in the Article can make the Doctrine no more doubtfull, then it doth our allegiance in that Oath which was made 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> where the Heires and Successors of the Queen are to appoint who shall accept the oath, the words of which are, that <hi>the Queens Highnesse is the onely supreme Governour of this Realme.</hi> But I hope the Heirs and successors of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appoint that Oath to be taken in the name of the <hi>Queens Highnesse,</hi> but in their own. I therefore earnestly desire not onely that <hi>divers Ministers of sundry Counties,</hi> but that all the Ministers of all the Counties in <hi>England,</hi> would acknowledge and confesse that it is the undoubted Doctrine of our Church, that to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> their Heirs and Successors <hi>the chief government of all Estates whether they be Ecclesiasticall or Civil in all causes doth appertain</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the 37. Article expresseth it.</p>
            <p>The last <hi>sad consequence</hi> doth no way touch the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and consequently doth not prove them doubtfull, but onely suggesteth fears and jealousies, that if the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should be continued, <hi>we should have no setled or fixed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of England at all.</hi> It seemeth very strange to me that King <hi>Charles</hi> of blessed memory should be suspected of unsetling the Church, who dyed rather then he would make any alteration in it; and left this as a Maxime to His Son, that <hi>His Fixation in matters of Religion will not be more necessary for His Souls then His Kingdomes. Peace.</hi> It were very strange if His Declaration should threaten any alteration in the Doctrine of the Church, when those very words which they cite out of it as a cause of their fears, give the greatest assurance imaginable of the continuance and perpetuity of that which is already
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114792:8"/>
setled. For these are the expresse words so much feared and impugned by them, <hi>The Bishops and Clergy, from time to time, in Convocation, upon their humble desire shall have licence under our broad Seal, to deliberate of and to doe all such things, as being made plain by them and assented unto by Vs, shall concern the setled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England now established; from which we will not endure any varying or depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the least degree.</hi> What can be a greater assurance of a <hi>setled</hi> and <hi>a fixed doctrine</hi> in the Church? what words can more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily prevent all alterations of the Publique profession of faith? the whole power promised to the Bishops was onely for <hi>the setled continuance of the Doctrine and Discipline then established</hi>; the Doctrine then established is acknowledged by the same Declaration to be that which is contained in the Articles: the Bishops then were never to have any power from the King to make any alteration in the Doctrine of the Articles: and if any should suspect the Bishops had a design, or would ever attempt to alter the Doctrine in any particular, we were sufficiently assured, they should never have power to effect it, by the word of a King, who said of the doctrine established, <hi>From which we will not endure any varying or departing in the least degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I dispatched the seven <hi>sad consequences,</hi> so farre as they have in them any the least shew of proof of the Doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Publique Doctrine. For the rest of this part of the Discourse pretending to prove the Publique Doctrine Doubtfull, it consisteth in an Answer to an Objection, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Answer of it selfe makes clearly unnecessary and of none effect, all which hath been said by them against the Declaration of the King of blessed memory. The Objection is, <hi>The Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is no Law, and may be taken away.</hi> The Answer which they give is, <hi>that this will signify nothing, if Ministers be still tyed to Subscription.</hi> If this be true, to what purpose were those <hi>sad Consequences</hi> drawn from the Kings Declaration? For if the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it away will signify nothing of good, then the continuing of it can signify nothing of evil: for if it did, the removing of that evil would be good.</p>
            <p>The rest of that Answer is spent in arguing against the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114792:9"/>
of two Eminent Lawyers, which, because it hath no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Doubtfulnesse of the Doctrine, I may very well omit, and conclude with them, <hi>Thus much of the doubtfulnesse of the Articles,</hi> which they have much pretended, no way proved, scarce endeavoured.</p>
            <p>As for the second Part of their charge, the Defectivenesse of the Publique Doctrine, they endeavour to prove it by three severall Arguments. The First is brought from the 6. Article, the onely Article of all the 39. accused by them of defect in it self. Their Objection is this, <hi>The Article is defective in the not enumerating all the Books of the New Testament.</hi> And my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is plainly this, Though the Article doe not enumerate all, or any of the Books of the New Testament, yet the Doctrine of this Article is not defective; and my Reason is, because the Article describes them as well as if it did enumerate them, so that any man may rest as much satisfied with the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as with the Enumeration. As for Example, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth enumerate all the Books of the New Testament by name, Sess. 4. the Church of <hi>England</hi> not following that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil expresseth her self otherwise, saying, <hi>All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we doe receive and account them Canonicall.</hi> Now all the Books named in the Council of <hi>Trent, are commonly received,</hi> or they are not: if they be not <hi>commonly received,</hi> then I confesse the Article may be thought defective, but this, I suppose, our Brethren will not say, or if they doe, it is a known untruth: if they be all <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received,</hi> then hath our Article left none out in her descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, more then they have in their enumeration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they did or could name any one Book, which they could prove to belong to the New Testament, and yet is not <hi>commonly received,</hi> then they might charge the Article with defect, for it would want that Book so named and yet not received. But if they can name no Book of the New Testament which is not <hi>commonly received,</hi> then the Article containeth every Book of the New Testament which can be named; and if it contain all that can be named, it must contain all that can be enumerated, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it cannot be <hi>defective</hi> in the not enumerating. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114792:9"/>
I entreat our Brethren the Ministers of sundry Counties, that they will not preferre the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> before the Articles of our Church, where nothing materiall can be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to either.</p>
            <p>As for the doubts which have been in the Church of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of S. <hi>James,</hi> and the second of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> they make nothing against this description: for though they have been doubted of, yet they are now commonly received, and the Article embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all <hi>as they are commonly received,</hi> referring to the time in which the Articles were penn'd, not to the age before <hi>Eusebius</hi> wrote the History of the Church, and the Differences about the Scriptures. Now at this time the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and enumerated all the Canonicall Books of the New Testament, the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon the Reformation did no way differ from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Particular, but had in its Practice received and used all the same Books, and therefore needed no other way to denote them then by <hi>the Books of the New Testament commonly received.</hi> Where there was a difference between our Church and theirs, there, to make good the Reformation, it was necessary to enumerate the Books, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the difference could not be otherwise known; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have in reference to the Old Testament a Catalogue of the Canonicall Books, and another of the Apocryphall: but where there was difference neither with them nor among our selves, there such an Expression as might acknowledge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and no way prejudice the truth, was thought most proper. In the Article made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. in the year 1552. printed by <hi>Richard Grafton</hi> 1553. there was neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription nor enumeration of any Books of the Holy Scriptures: and therefore it is hard measure that the Church, in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1562. adding an enumeration of the Books of the Old Testament, and a Description of those of the New, for the supplying of a supposed defect, should be accused as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
            <p>The second Argument to prove the Defectivenesse of the Publique Doctrine is, that <hi>There are no Articles for discovering and condemning sundry points of Popery.</hi> To which my Answer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114792:10"/>
is, That if they meane no more then that which will discover a man to be a Papist, there is abundantly sufficient contained in the Articles to discover any man. For we may assure our selves the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will admit no man to their Society, who shall be ready to subscribe our Articles. This therefore, as to such a Discovery, can be no reall Defect, because we can need no more then what is enough.</p>
            <p>But if the Articles did want some Doctrines for the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Popery (which they doe not,) yet those which our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren mention cannot be wanted for that purpose. They signify a defect of such Tenets as are opposite to those of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and think that they, if they were setled, would discover Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whereas it is most evident that the deniall of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contrary to those of <hi>Arminius</hi> is no good or sound way to discover a Papist. If the Church of <hi>England</hi> had found out no other way to discover a <hi>Romanist,</hi> then the denying of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme,</hi> there would suddenly be Popish Priests enow to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse mine and all your Benefices. I look upon the <hi>Dominican Friers</hi> to be as great enemies of <hi>Armianisme</hi> as I or you are, and yet to be as much Papists as any are. I suppose no man thinks a <hi>Praedeterminant</hi> or a <hi>Jansenian</hi> to be inclining to an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and yet 'tis probable that the Major part of the Papists are of those Opinions. I therefore conclude, as a most evident and infallible truth, that the Articles are not defective in the way of discovering Popery or Papists, for that reason onely because they have not sufficiently express'd themselves against <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Argument endeavouring to prove the Defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Publique Doctrine is an enumeration of severall Common-places in Divinity, not comprehended in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. For so they argue, <hi>Those Articles contain nothing of the Creation, of Providence, Fall of man,</hi> &amp;c. and these they urge thus, <hi>All which the Scripture teacheth, and that as necessary; as appears by the comprizing most of them in the Apostles Creed.</hi> To which I answer, That this Argument containeth in it two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, neither of which can be made good; and yet if both were true, they could not prove that which they intend. The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114792:10"/>
first part of the Argument asserts, That <hi>the Articles contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Creation, Providence,</hi> and the rest of the Doctrines enumerated, at least 20. in number. Which is a manifest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: For it cannot be said that the Articles <hi>contain nothing of the Creation,</hi> when the first Article teacheth us that God is <hi>the Maker of all things Visible and Invisible:</hi> How can it be true that the Creation is <hi>comprized in the Apostles Creed,</hi> as they say, and not in the Articles, when the words of the Article speak as expressely of it as the Creed? It cannot be said that the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>contain nothing of the fall of man,</hi> when the 10. Article be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus, <hi>The condition of man after the Fall of Adam is such,</hi> and then goeth on to expresse the condition of man fallen. It cannot be said, that the Articles <hi>contain nothing of Sin, or the Punishment of sin,</hi> when the 9. Article giveth a full Description of <hi>Originall Sin,</hi> which is it self a sin, and the fountain of all other sins; when the 15. Article sheweth <hi>Christ alone to be without sin,</hi> and sin to be in every one beside him: when the 16. Article treateth of the nature of <hi>sin after Baptisme.</hi> When the second Homily (whose doctrine is approved by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) treateth at large <hi>of the misery of all mankind, and of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to death everlasting by his own sin.</hi> It cannot be said that the Articles contain nothing of <hi>Effectual calling,</hi> when the 17. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle treating of <hi>Praedestination to life,</hi> hath these words, <hi>Wherefore they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods purpose by his Spirit working in due season, they through grace obey the calling, they be justified freely, they be made sons of God by adoption,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly this is an <hi>Effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and that with something of <hi>Adoption.</hi> It cannot be said, the Articles <hi>contain nothing of Faith,</hi> when the 4. Homily, (the Doctrine whereof is confirmed by the Articles) treateth solely thereof, according to the Title, <hi>A short Declaration of the true, lively, and Christian Faith.</hi> Much lesse can it be said, they <hi>contain nothing of Repentance,</hi> when the 19. Homily intituled <hi>of Repentance,</hi> is expressely named Article 35. and the Doctrine acknowledged, which Homily treateth largely of that subject in three Parts. It cannot be suid the Articles <hi>contain nothing of the Law,</hi> when the 7. Article speaketh of the state of those
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114792:11"/>
which lived under the Law, of the cessation of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and Judiciall Law, and the continued obligation of the Morall Law. From these and others which I might yet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it appeareth, that it is not justly charged upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that they contain nothing of the Doctrines enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>As for the other part pretending a Necessity of adding or inserting those Doctrines or Heads of Divinity, because taught as they say, by the Scriptures <hi>as Necessary,</hi> which they prove onely thus, because, as they say, it <hi>appears by the comprizing most of them in the Apostles Creed.</hi> To this I answer, First, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly <hi>appear</hi> thereby. For granting that most of them were <hi>comprized in the Apostles Creed:</hi> granting that whatsoever is <hi>comprized in the Apostles Creed,</hi> is taught by the Scriptures <hi>as necessary:</hi> yet it no way followeth that the other Heads or Common-places not comprized in the Creed are taught by the Scriptures <hi>as necessary.</hi> For no Doctrine in the Creed can trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Necessity of it to another which is not in the Creed; or if it can, it must be by a Necessary consequence from it or Dependance of it. But if any one should argue thus, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Creation</hi> is <hi>comprized in the Creed,</hi> from whence it is esteemed <hi>as necessary,</hi> therefore the Doctrine of <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> which is not contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> must be equally esteemed <hi>as necessary:</hi> the Doctrines of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and the <hi>last Judgment</hi> are <hi>necessary,</hi> as contained in the Creed, therefore the Doctrines of <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Church-discipline</hi> are <hi>necessary,</hi> which are not contained in it. I say, if any one should argue thus, a man with modesty might deny the Consequence. If therefore most of the Doctrines mentioned were comprized in the Apostles Creed, yet it followeth not that all the rest were Necessary.</p>
            <p>Secondly I answer by a flat denyall. <hi>The most of those</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines mentioned are not comprized in the Apostles Creed. Which thus I make good. The Doctrines mentioned, as not at all contained in the Articles are these. 1. <hi>Creation.</hi> 2. <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> 3. <hi>Fall</hi> of man. 4. <hi>Sin.</hi> 5. <hi>Punishment</hi> of sin. 6. God's <hi>Covenants.</hi> 7. <hi>Effectuall calling.</hi> 8. <hi>Adoption.</hi> 9. <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:114792:11"/>
10. <hi>Faith.</hi> 11. <hi>Repentance.</hi> 12. <hi>Perseverance.</hi> 13. <hi>Law of God.</hi> 14. <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> 15. <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Lords day.</hi> 16. <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Divorce.</hi> 17. <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> 18. <hi>Church-government and Discipline.</hi> 19. <hi>Resurrection.</hi> 20. The <hi>Last Judgment.</hi> Which are in number 20. at the least. But the <hi>most part</hi> of these are not comprized in the Apostles Creed, except four or five be the <hi>most part</hi> of 20.</p>
            <p>I answer Thridly, that it seems to me a very strange Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to say that most of these Doctrines are comprized in the Apostles Creed, and nothing of them contained in the Articles; when the Apostles Creed it self is contained in the Articles, and two Creeds more, which have been generally looked upon as the Expositions of that Creed. For these are the words of the 8. Article, <hi>The three Creeds, Nice Creed, Athanasius Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles Creed, ought throughly to be received and believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being then severall of those Doctrines are contained in the Articles, being they are no otherwise proved to be necessary then because they are comprized in the Creed, being farre the major part of them are not to be found in the Creed, being all which are in the Creed must be contained in the Articles which contain the Creed it self, I therefore conclude the third Argument doth no way prove that the Articles are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
            <p>Again, being those are no more then these three Arguments brought to evince the Defectivenesse, and all these are answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being I have formerly shewed the invalidity of those which pretended to prove the Doubtfulnesse of our Doctrine, being there is no other Topick used beside these two of the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and Defectivenesse of the Articles, to prove the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Reformation, I therefore stick to my first Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>There is no Necessity of a Reformation of the Publique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus vindicated the Doctrine in it self, we shall now consider by what Authority it is established; having shewed that it wanteth not any Reformation, we will enquire whether it stand in need of any Confirmation. Certain it is, that the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114792:12"/>
Publique Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is reputed to be established by Law; but <hi>divers Ministers of sundry Counties</hi> tell us, that though it be <hi>reputed,</hi> yet <hi>indeed</hi> it is <hi>not so establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make way for as clear a Determination of this Question as I can, I shall shew all the ways by which the Articles of our Church have been confirmed, and then consider upon the whole, whether it amount to a Legall Confirmation or no.</p>
            <p>The first Articles of Religion framed since the Reformation were made in the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, in the year 1552. the Authority which they had was from the King, and from the Clergy. This appeareth by the <hi>English</hi> Edition, set forth by <hi>John Day,</hi> with this Title, <hi>Articles agreed upon in the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and published by the Kings Majesty,</hi> and more fully by the <hi>Latine</hi> Edition, set forth by <hi>Renold Wolfe,</hi> with this Title, <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi de quibus in Synodo Londinensi, Anno Dom.</hi> M. D. LII. <hi>ad tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendam opinionum dissensionem &amp; consensum verae Religionis firman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum inter Episcopos &amp; alios eruditos viros convenerat. Regiâ Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate in lucem editi.</hi> Which is also prefixed in <hi>John Day's English</hi> Edition before the Catechisme, published at the same time with the Articles, and in the <hi>English</hi> Edition of <hi>Richard Grafton</hi> set forth by it self; all which were printed in the same year, viz. 1553. Thus farre they went in the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and this was the Authority which those Articles had; and that might be sufficient, if no more were thought necessary.</p>
            <p>The same Articles of Religion, (with some alterations) in the Reviviscency of the Reformation, in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were again Ratified by the Authority of the Queen, and of the Clergy, as appeareth by the <hi>English</hi> Edition, set forth by <hi>Richard Jugge</hi> and <hi>John Cawood,</hi> whose title is this. ARTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLES <hi>whereupon it was agreed by the Arch-bishops and Bishops of both the Provinces, and the whole Clergy in the Convocation holden at</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>in the year of our Lord God,</hi> M. D. LXII. <hi>according to the Computation of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>for th' avoyding of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities of opinions, and for the establishing of consent touching true Religion. Put forth by the Queens Authority.</hi> A <hi>Latine</hi> Title to the same effect is praefixed to the same Articles of the <hi>Latine</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:114792:12"/>
Edition by <hi>Renold Wolfe,</hi> with this addition concerning the Queens Authority at the Conclusion. <hi>Quibus omnibus Articulis Serenissima Princeps Elizabeth, Dei gratia Angliae, Franciae &amp; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae Regina, Fidei Defensor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per seipsam diligenter prius lectis &amp; examinatis Regium suum assensum praebuit.</hi> Thus did they continue for above eight years, as they conceived sufficiently confirmed and established.</p>
            <p>The Articles thus established in the year 1562. were again Ratified and confirmed in the year 1571. as appeareth by two <hi>English</hi> Editions both set forth the same year by <hi>Richard Jugge</hi> and <hi>John Cawood,</hi> with the same Title before mentioned, and with this Ratification added at the Conclusion. <hi>This book of Articles before rehearsed is again approved, and allowed to be holden and executed within the Realme, by the assent and consent of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lady Elizabeth by the grace of God, of England, France and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. Which Articles were diligently read and confirmed again by the subscription of the hands of the Arch-bishops and Bishops of the Vpper-house, and by the subscription of the whole Cleargy in the Neather-house in their Convocation, in the year of our Lord God,</hi> 1571. The same Title and Ratification were printed with the Articles the same year in <hi>Latine</hi> by <hi>John Day.</hi> Thus were the Articles again established by the Authority of the Queen and the Subscription of the whole Clergy in Convocation.</p>
            <p>But all these Confirmations, though greater were never had before in matters of Articles of the Church, did notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not amount unto a full and formall Law, till it was thought fit that not onely the Arch-bishops and Bishops, and the Clergy convened in the Convocation should subscribe them, but that the same Subscription should be required of all the Ministers in all places of the Kingdome, and then these Articles were confirmed by a compleate Law, that is, an Act of Parliament made in the same year 1571. by the consent of the Queen, Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> 13. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 20. From whence my Second Conclusion in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Confirmation of the Publique Doctrine is this. <hi>The Articles of Religion of the Church of England are established by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114792:13"/>
the Law of England.</hi> Against this Conclusion so plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent our Brethren the Ministers of sundry Counties have made some Objections, but very short, contained in their two first Paragraphs, the first of which is this. <hi>It appears not that they were all or any of them confirmed by Parliament in the</hi> 13. <hi>of Eliz. forasmuch as they are not therein expressely inserted, nor so much as their number, but onely the Title-page of them mentioned. Nor is it known when the Originall is inrolled.</hi> For the Assertion it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the first words of this Paragraph, <hi>It appears not that they were all or any of them confirmed by Parliament in the</hi> 13. <hi>of Eliz.</hi> I shall evince the contrary, first <hi>ad homines,</hi> proving out of their own words that they were confirmed, which against them is sufficient. In their Answer to the Objection that the Kings Declaration may be laid aside, they urge that <hi>there is a necessity of repealing that branch of the Act so farre as it concerneth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription:</hi> But there can be no Necessity to repeal that branch of the Act, if neither all nor any of the Articles be confirmed by that Act, for the Subscription required by that Act, is express'd to be <hi>a Subscription to the said Articles</hi> and no other. Again, they argue thus against the Subscription: <hi>There is no more Necessity for Ministers to subscribe those Articles which that Act confirmes, then there is for others to subscribe to all other Acts of Parliament which doe concern them.</hi> In which words they plainly confesse that the Act confirmes the Articles: and certainly whatsoever is confirmed by an Act of Parliament, is established by Law. Again, these are their plain and formall words. <hi>The Statute doth require belief of every one of these Articles, when it enjoynes not onely Subscription, but an assent unto them, punishing all with Deprivation that shall affirm and maintain any Doctrine repugnant to them.</hi> Now if it be true that <hi>the Statute doth require belief of every one of these Articles,</hi> How can it be also true, that neither all nor any of them is confirmed by that Statute? These two Assertions are so different and contradictory, that they may well be pend in <hi>sundry Counties,</hi> as well as by <hi>divers Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Articles were confirmed by the Act of the 13. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> will thus appear. The Act begins thus, <hi>That the Churches of the Queens Majesties Dominions may be served with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114792:13"/>
Pastors of sound Religion, be it enacted by the Authority of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. Either therefore something is established concerning Religion in that Act, or nothing. If you say, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then first you charge the Parliament with folly, to make an Act for establishing nothing: Secondly, you make their determinations no way correspondent to their intentions: for they make this Act to the intent that the <hi>Churches might be served with Pastors of sound Religion,</hi> whereas the Act it self, you say, establisheth no Religion. If the Act did establish something in Religion, then it either established the Articles, or something beside the Articles. But it is most plain, that it established no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Religion beside the Articles, therefore it must be at last confess'd that it established the Articles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Those which are Learned in the Laws are certainly the best Interpreters of the Law, and know best what things are established by Law, and what not. Amongst them the Memory of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> with me is most precious, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to himself while he lived, and to his Sons since his death) and his Authority great with all. He therefore speaks in this manner, in the fourth Part of his Institutes, <hi>cap.</hi> 74. <hi>Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required by the Clergy is twofold; one by force both of an Act of Parliament confirming and establishing the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles of Religion agreed upon at a Convocation of the Church of England, and ratified by Queen Elizabeth under the Great seal of England.</hi> In the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therefore and Language of that learned Chief Justice, <hi>the Act of Parliament doth confirme and establish the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles:</hi> and those words I oppose to theirs, <hi>it appears not that they were all or any of them confirmed by act of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now consider the Reasons inducing them to deny this Legall Confirmation; which seem in the forecited Paragraph to be two. First, <hi>forasmuch as they are not therein expressely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, nor so much as their number, but onely the Title-page of them mentioned.</hi> To which I answer First, that this is the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which you us'd against the Articles for not enumerating the Books of the New Testament; onely here it is much weaker: for there it would have satisfied you if the names of the Books of the New Testament had been enumerated, though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114792:14"/>
the whole New Testament had not been inserted in the Article; but here nothing can satisfy but an express Insertion of all which is to be allowed. Secondly I answer, that it is not materiall what is actually inserted to conclude what is actually to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The Title of the Articles is inserted, and yet neither the <hi>sound Religion</hi> designed in the Preamble, nor the <hi>Subscription</hi> urged in the body of the Act, hath any reference to the Title: for there is neither any Religion contained in the Title, nor any Subscription required to it. But the Articles, which are not inserted, are affirmed by the Act, to concern <hi>the Confession of the true Christian Faith,</hi> and the <hi>assent</hi> and <hi>subscription</hi> are required unto them, not to the Title: Deprivation is denounced to all which shall <hi>affirme any Doctrine directly contrary or repugnant to any of the said Articles,</hi> not to the Title. We must not therefore look unto what is inserted, but what is intended, in the Act. If any Ministers had pleaded before the Lord Chief-Justice <hi>Wray,</hi> or <hi>Coke,</hi> that they were ready to subscribe to the Title of the Book of Articles expressed in the Statute, but not to the Articles contained in the Book, because they were not expressed in the Act, certainly they would have far'd as ill as he who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd them with a condition.</p>
            <p>As for the Number of them it is no way materiall, because though now they are known under the names and number of 39. yet then they were not so generally called. The Articles of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth were of another number, and those which were agreed upon 1562. had no number affix'd to them, neither in the <hi>English</hi> nor <hi>Latine</hi> Edition. They were not therefore then so well known by their number as by their Title, and the Act while it rehearseth the Title confirmeth the Book which was so intituled.</p>
            <p>Their second Reason upon which they deny this Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is delivered in these words. <hi>Neither is it known where the Original is enrolled.</hi> To which I answer First, that if the Original Copy of the Articles had never been enrolled, yet the Articles themselves had never been the lesse confirmed: and my Reason is, because the Act taketh no notice of the Articles as they were at first written, but as they were at that time prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114792:14"/>
For thus the Act speaks, <hi>That the Churches of the Queens Majesties Dominions may be served with Pastors of sound Religion, be it enacted by the authority of this present Parliament that every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son under the degree of a Bishop.....shall declare his assent and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to all the Articles of Religion, which onely concern the confession of the true Christian Faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in a Book imprinted, intituled,</hi> ARTICLES <hi>whereupon it was agreed by the Arch-bishops and Bishops of both Provinces and the whole Clergy in the Convocation holden at</hi> London <hi>in the year of our Lord God</hi> 1562. <hi>according to the Computation of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>for the avoiding of the diversities of opinions, and for the establishing of consent touching true Religion, put forth by the Queens Authority.</hi> These Articles were agreed upon in the year 1562. and then printed with this very Title, before by us transcribed out of that Edition. In the year 1571. Those Articles were reprinted, and then this Act was published, whether therefore the Originall were enrolled or not enrolled, the <hi>Articles comprised in the Book imprinted,</hi> and so <hi>intituled,</hi> were confirmed by the Statute.</p>
            <p>I Answer secondly, that the Enrollment of the Originall is not so obscure as they pretend. We know that there was an Originall enrolled, we can tell them how many pages that Originall consisted of, even determinately 19. we can assure them this was deposited with <hi>Matthew</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> we can tell them the day when it was done, viz. the fifth day of <hi>February</hi> in the year 1562. All which appeareth by the Postscript printed with the Articles in <hi>Latine</hi> in the year 1563. by <hi>Renald Wolfe</hi> the Queens Printer. The words are these, <hi>Hos Articulos Fidei Christianae, continentes in universum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendecim paginas in autographo, quod asservatur apud Reverendissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in Christo Patrem, Dominum</hi> Matthaeum Cantuariensem <hi>Archepiscopum, totius</hi> Angliae <hi>Primatem &amp; Metropolitanum, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chepiscopi &amp; Episcopi utriusque Provinciae regni</hi> Angliae, <hi>in sacra provinciali Synodo legitime congregati, unanimi assensu recipiunt &amp; profitentur, &amp; ut veros atque Orthodoxos, manuum suarum subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptionibus approbant, vicessimo nono die mensis</hi> Januarii, Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, <hi>secundum computationem Ecclesiae</hi> Anglicanae, <hi>millesimo quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentesimo sexagesimo secundo: universusque Clerus Inferioris domus,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114792:15"/>
eosdem etiam unanimiter &amp; recepit &amp; professus est, ut ex manuum suarum subscriptionibus patet, quas obtulit &amp; deposuit apud eundem Reverendissimum, quinto die</hi> Februarii, <hi>Anno praedicto.</hi> The Late Arch-bishop giveth testimony to the same in his speech deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Starre-chamber <hi>June</hi> 14. 1637. His words are these, p. 69. <hi>I sent to the Publique Records in my Office, and here under my Officers hand, who is a Publique Notary, is returned me the Twentieth Article with this Affirmative Clause in it; And there is also the whole Body of the Articles to be seen.</hi> To those therefore which know the Publique Records, (unknown perhaps to the Ministers <hi>of sundry Counties</hi>) it <hi>is known</hi> where the Originall is preserv'd. And this I conceive a sufficient Answer to their first Paragraph.</p>
            <p>Their second Paragraph to the same purpose is this, <hi>Of the</hi> 39. <hi>there were</hi> 36. <hi>of them set forth (yet not ratified by Parliament) the other were added by the Convocation in An.</hi> 1562.</p>
            <p>As for the Parenthesis of this Paragraph, signifying that the Articles made in K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. time were <hi>not ratified by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it no way opposeth them who thinke our Articles esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law: because no man imagines that our Articles were under the Consideration of any Parliament in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>The other words of that Paragraph are something doubtfully penn'd, and seem to be capable of two senses. First, that in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. there were but 36. <hi>Articles set forth.</hi> If this be the sense of their words, they are not true. For the Articles agreed upon in the year 1552. and set forth in the year 1553. that is to say, the Articles in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Raigne, if you look upon those which were printed by <hi>Renald Wolfe</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>John Day</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> you will find 42. Heads or Contents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out figures; if you look into the Edition of <hi>Richard Grafton,</hi> you will find not onely the Contents, but the numbers affixed to each Article to amount to 42. It is not therefore true that in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. there were but 36. Articles set forth.</p>
            <p>The second sense of the words of that Paragraph may be this. That of those 39. Articles set forth in the days of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> there were 36. set forth in the Raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114792:15"/>
in this sense their words are not true. For the 5. Article, <hi>Of the Holy Ghost,</hi> the 12. Article, <hi>Of Good works,</hi> the 29. <hi>Of the wicked which eat not the body of Christ in the use of the Lords Supper,</hi> and the 30. <hi>Of both kinds,</hi> these four are not to be found in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles set forth in the Raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. And if 4. of the 39. be not to be found, there cannot be 36. of the same 39. Wherefore I conclude, that I can find no sense in which those words are true; that, <hi>Of those</hi> 39. <hi>Articles there were</hi> 36. <hi>of them set forth in Edward</hi> 6. <hi>his raigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now being this is all which is objected by them against the Legall establishment of the Articles, being an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath propounded the same Articles, as a <hi>Confession of the true Christian Faith</hi> and <hi>sound Religion,</hi> and acknowledgeth any Doctrine <hi>contrary to the said Articles</hi> to be <hi>untrue Doctrine,</hi> and upon this acknowledgment and publike Declaration of the truth of the Faith and soundnesse of the Religion, hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all Ministers to <hi>declare their unfained assent to the same,</hi> upon pain of being deprived <hi>ipso facto,</hi> I conclude that the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are confirmed by the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having answered all the Objections endeavouring to prove a Necessity of Reformation, or Confirmation, of the Publick Doctrine of our Church, I earnestly entreat all these my Brethren in sundry Counties to advise with the more sober counsels of those of our Brethren who have lately declared that <hi>They take it for granted that there is no difference between us in matter of Doctrine.</hi>
