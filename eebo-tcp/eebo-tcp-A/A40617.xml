            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we look abroad in the World, and take a ſurvey of the Actions and Tranſgreſſions of Man-kind, we may obſerve that God very rarely ſuffers Sin to go Unpuniſhed even in this World: and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his Juſtice takes notice of the Sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> makeing good his own Word therein; <hi>that he that ſheddeth Mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed</hi>: yet ſo it is, that even this Sin is grown ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt us, that ſcarce a Week paſſes over our Heads, but we meet with one or other Inſtance of this Kind, it being looked upon as one of the firſt Principles of Honour amongſt the Sparks of the Age, to Vindicate the leaſt Affront, (or what they ſhall pleaſe to term ſuch) with a Stab or Thruſt.</p>
            <p>An Inſtance of this kind the following Relation will Furniſh us with. The Judges of <hi>Aſſize,</hi> Aſſigned to hold Pleas for the City and County of <hi>Norwich,</hi> having opened their Commiſion on <hi>Monday</hi> the 14<hi>th.</hi> Day of <hi>July</hi> Inſtant, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Windham</hi> hapning to be taken Violently Ill; the Buſineſs on the <hi>Niſiprius</hi> and <hi>Crown-ſide,</hi> both was Managed by the Right Honourable the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Montague,</hi> which occaſioned the diſpatch thereof to be of longer Continuance than otherwiſe it would have been; ſo that the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> could not be Diſcharged on the <hi>Saturday</hi> Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

but their Attendance was Adjurned till the <hi>Monday</hi> following: the Gentlemen of the County attending the ſame. Amongſt which Number Mr. <hi>Barney</hi> the Priſoner, and Eſquire <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> being Drinking together on the <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till about two of the Clock the next Morning: at which time, happening up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Diſcourſe that raiſed ſome Diſpute and Difference between them: Mr. <hi>Barney</hi> being a Perſon very Quarrelſome, Words aroſe between them, and increaſed to ſuch a height, that Mr. <hi>Barney</hi> Drew upon the <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and by 8 ſeveral Wounds in his Body: Four of which were found in his Back. the <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was Slain in the Place, and Mr. <hi>Barney</hi> endeavoured his Eſcape, but the Noiſe thereof raiſing the Houſe, the Gates were Immediatly ſhut; and the Purſuit was ſuch that Mr. <hi>Barney</hi> was forthwith Taken: and being for that Night Secured, the next Morning he was Committed to the Common-Goal: and the Monday following a Bill was peferred againſt him; the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> not being then Diſcharged, as aforeſaid; upon which they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in the ſame <hi>Billa vera.</hi> And coming the ſame Morning to be Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon, the Evidence againſt him was very plain that he both raiſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Quarrel; that he Diſhonourably Kill'd him, and that he was a very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious Perſon, and had before that time Wounded ſeveral Perſons, upon very ſlight Occaſions; it being very familiar with him when he wanted Moneys, if he asked any Perſon to accommodate him with a Supply, in caſe of a refuſal, he would threaten them with his Sword; and had Wounded ſeveral upon the like Quarrel.</p>
            <p>The Priſoner had very little to ſay for himſelf, only that he was in Drink: think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by one, to Excuſe another Crime; and that the Words that had paſſed between them, had provoked him into an Extraordinary Paſſion: in the Heat whereof, he had raſhly perpetrated a Crime for which he was extreemly ſorry: and for which he was not only ready to beg Pardon of God Almighty, but of the Relations of the Gentleman he had Slain. But this was not looked on as any thing of a Defence, but rather an aggravation of the Fact. So that the Petty <hi>Jury</hi> without ſtiring from the Bar, brought him in Guilty of the Indictment and Murder aforeſaid; whereupon he immediately received his Sentence: and a Rule was forthwith Iſſued forth for his <hi>Execution</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the firſt Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next enſuing, at the publick Market-Croſs in the City of <hi>Norwich.</hi> In expectation of which Sentence, he was remanded back to Gaol, where he now continues. Whence it may be obſerved as a Warning to others how they fall into the like Crimes: how juſtly the Judgment of God purſues the Criminal: and more eſpecially for thoſe Crimes which are Committed upon his own Day, which he hath ſet apart for himſelf, and for his Worſhip. Under a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, it is hoped the Priſoner will conſider his Condition, and prepare for the Sentence againſt him. Eſquire <hi>Beddingfield,</hi> was a Gentleman of great Worth and Loyalty, and well beloved by all the Gentlemen: it being atteſted in his behalf by divers Perſons of great Eminency upon the Tryal, that he was free from the Vices of the Age, and never given to Quarrels or Contentions; inſomuch that he is extreem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lamented by all the County, and none but acquieſſe in the Sentence as juſt upon the Priſoner: tho he be likewiſe one of a very Good Family, being the ſecond Son of an Ancient <hi>Baronet</hi> in that Country, and a Perſon of known Worth, Loyalty and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But the beſt of Men may often meet with unhappineſs in their Relations Grace, ſeldom running in the Veins of Generation: whence this may likewiſe be as a caveat to others how they bring Grief on the grey Hairs of their Parents, and put all Men upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring and ſerving their Creator in the days of their Youth, before the Evil days come, and the Years draw on wherein there is no Pleaſure: to haſten which days upon our ſelves is doubly a Sin: and that Perſon who is guilty thereof, eſpecially by the Crime of Murder may be looked on not only as Murderer of another but of himſelf, and at one ſtroke hazards his own Soul and Body at the expence of anothers Blood. From which Crime may the Grace of God be ſo prevalent upon us that we may not fall therein: nor ought the beſt of us be ſecure ſince, if we give way to our Paſſions and leave the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Gods Grace and Spirit, the Devil takes Advantage: and having the Rule and Sway over us, many times leads us into the paths of Deſtruction; and then leaves us Miſerably to expect his juſt Judgment upon us, and the Terro<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
