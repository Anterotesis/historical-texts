            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <salute>READER,</salute>
            <p>I Think it a greater theft to Rob the dead of their Praise then
the Living of their Money: That I may not appear Guilty of such
a Crime, 'tis necessary I should acquaint you, that there is a Play in
Mr. <hi>Shakespears</hi> Volume under the name of <hi>Titus Andronicus,</hi>
from whence I drew part of this. I have been told by some anciently
conversant with the Stage, that it was not Originally his, but brought
by a private Author to be Acted, and he only gave some Master-touches
to one or two of the Principal Parts or Characters; this I
am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and indigested piece
in all his Works; It seems rather a heap of Rubbish then a Structure.—
However as if some great Building had been design'd, in the removal
we found many Large and Square Stones both usefull and Ornamental
to the Fabrick, as new Modell'd: Compare the Old Play with this,
you'l finde that none in all that Authors Works ever receiv'd greater
Alterations or Additions, the Language not only refin'd, but
many Scenes entirely New: Besides most of the principal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
heighten'd, and the Plot much encreas'd. The Success an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
the Labour, tho' it first appear'd upon the Stage, at the
beginning of the pretended Popish Plot, when neither Wit nor
Honesty had Encouragement: Nor cou'd this expect favour since
<pb facs="tcp:62022:3"/>
it shew'd the Treachery of Villains, and the Mischiefs carry'd on
by Perjury, and False Evidence; and how Rogues may frame a
Plot that shall deceive and destroy both the Honest and the Wise;
which were the reasons why I did forward it at so unlucky a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
being content rather to lose the Profit, then not expose to
the World the Picture of such Knaves and Rascals as then Reign'd
in the opinion of the Foolish and Malicious part of the Nation:
but it bore up against the Faction, and is confirm'd a Stock-Play.
In the Hurry of those distracted times the <hi>Prologue</hi> and <hi>Epilogue</hi>
were lost: But to let the Buyer have his penny-worths, I furnish
you with others which were Written by me to other Persons La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
two of 'em were proportion'd to that Mad Season; For
when Ill Manners and Ill Principles Reign in a State, it is the
business of the Stage, as well as Pulpits, to declaim and Instruct:
That was my design when I Writ, and now Print 'em that the
Purchaser may not Repine at the Author or Bookseller for a hard
Bargain.</p>

            <l>Who for meer want of Mony staid in Town.</l>
            <l>As for Example, I my self was one.</l>
            <l>Shop-Keepers, wanting trade, were off o'th' hooks,</l>
            <l>And all day long sat casting up their books;</l>
            <l>Drew out their Debts, resolving all to Dun,</l>
            <l>As soon as e're you Gallants came to Town.</l>
            <l>Or else to Fox and Geese with Neighbour go,</l>
            <l>A game resembling much themselves and you.</l>
            <l>And Gamesters, who the rest o'th' year went fine,</l>
            <l>Now look'd out sharp, and Cry'd, come where shall's dine?</l>
            <l>Go to the I'avern, no attendance there,</l>
            <l>Except a Drawer snoring in the Bar.</l>
            <l>No Roaring-Gallant, nor no Punk that Sings,</l>
            <l>The litte bell but very seldom Rings.</l>
            <l>No Hurry nor no Noise as heretofore,</l>
            <l>No Crying, Speak t'th' Star, t'th' half-Moon Score.</l>
            <l>The streets are quiet too: All the Debauchees,</l>
            <l>Were Bullys pawning Whores, and bilking Coaches.</l>
            <l>The best on't was, things were not very dear;</l>
            <l>For Whores, 'twas the Cheap'st time of all the year.</l>

            <l>Pawn'd Rings and Pettycoats, hard shift they made,</l>
            <l>In hopes, at <hi>Windsor</hi> they might force a Trade.</l>
            <l>There Leiger Lav, I see some half a score</l>
