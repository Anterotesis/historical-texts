         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RIGHT HONOURABLE,
The Lady
Martha Cary.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Intereſt I have in the Book offered
to your Honour, by tranſcribing it into
Engliſh Language, has made me not leſs
careful of its proſperous coming into the World,
then the Author that gave it being. In order
whereunto, I think I have addreſs'd it to a
Lady, ſo perfect a Parallel to his Princeſs, that
if your Honour favour it, I ſhall not much appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the diſadvantage it has received in the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and conſequently the more need it ſtands in of
a great protection; I am not ignorant how ſevere a
cenſure this ſort of Writings undergoes from the
rigid judgements of ſome ſeeming Sages, who look
upon them no otherwiſe then as the Productions
<pb facs="tcp:60667:3"/>
and Entertainments of Idleneſs. But, I confeſs
with ſubmiſsion, I cannot underſtand with what
equity Recreations are allow'd to the Body, if thoſe
accommodated to the mind be condemned; nor why
Muſick, Peniture, Statuary, Ornament, and
Magnificence in Architecture, Gardening, and
the like, which certainly in a great meaſure conduce
onely to Delight and gratifie our Senſes, ſhould be
plauſibly judged of, if the innocent repreſentations
of noble Actions, and handſome Converſations,
which afford infinite pleaſure to the fancy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
recreate the minde, be decry'd as noxious,
or, at beſt, ſuperfluous. Such Cynicks may be
pleaſed to remember that <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> have
been ſeen upon the Theater. But it would be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter to evince againſt thoſe moroſe perſons,
that Delight is the leaſt advantage redounding from
ſuch compoſitions. For, not to ſay any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ground-work, which is generally ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
piece of Ancient Hiſtory, accurately collected out
of the Records of the moſt eminent Writers of old, the
knowledg of which is not to be miſpris'd; the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fictitious adventures is ſo ingenious, the incident
diſcourſes ſo handſome, free, and fitted for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of converſation (which is not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
accounted of greateſt importance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of humane life) the deſcriptions of the
paſsions ſo lively &amp; naturally ſet forth; yea, the Idea
of virtue, generoſity, and all the qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to accompliſh great perſons, ſo exqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated,
that I cannot content my ſelf with giving
<pb facs="tcp:60667:3"/>
the <hi>French</hi> that ordinary commendation of having
freed this kind of Writings from the incongruous
Chimaerical mixture of extravagancies and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities;
but I muſt alſo ſpeak it, (though I believe
with the envy or regret of many) that they have
approv'd themſelves the beſt Teachers of a noble
and generous Morality that are to be met with;
not preſenting us with a Carcaſe or Skel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ton, but
with a living, active, and (as I may ſo ſpeak) imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
virtue, as far tranſcending that which is held
forth in the gravity and formality of Precepts and
Definitions, as a living perſon does his own Picture,
which is deſtitute of Motion, of which (as a
great perſon obſerves) the better halfe of beauty
conſiſts, not to be expreſſed by the Art of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil.</p>
            <p>Now whether the Piece I preſent to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
deſerves to be ranked in the number of
thoſe I have Characteris'd, whether the Author
has done juſtice to <hi>SCIPIO,</hi> and whether I
have been very much injurious to both, is humbly
left to your Ladiſhips Judgement, which is ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
that as all Books which come into your
fair hands, find you an exact eſteemer of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
So this muſt receive its fate from your ſentence,
and accordingly be to other Readers acceptable, or
otherwiſe. If the Dedication of it ſeem too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,
I muſt acknowledge I was induc'd to it
by a natural, and ſo not eaſily reſiſtable, inclination;
being as well led by an ardour to teſtifie in ſome
manner the generation and eſteem I have for
<pb facs="tcp:60667:4"/>
things that are excellent by teſtifying it for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that is ſo, as by an Ambition to do the Booke the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He emulous conteſt of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> had
now brought the expectations of all the world
to an equall ballance. Theſe two proud Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
were fighting for the Empire of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
whil'ſt all the Nations of the ſame await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the deciſion of the important war, ſuſpended
their homages in the mean time, to render them
afterwards to that of theſe two powers, with
whom Victory ſhould ſide. During this ſtand of affairs, the event
hanging in the hands of Fortune, it happened that the Courts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
about <hi>Lephi</hi> were heard to Eccho with Exclamations of joy, and
there appeared between 10 and 12000 men approaching in haſte and
diſorder towards the Sea-ſhore, and expreſſing the greatneſſe of their
jollity and impatience by ſuch geſtures as ſeemed at the ſame time
very rude, and yet ſufficiently becoming. They ſtretched forth
their arms towards the Sea, and being driven by the impetuouſneſſe of
their precipitant paſſions in this poſture, ſeemed as if they endeavoured
to embrace a Fleet of Ships, which nevertheleſſe was at that time near
four Leagues diſtant from them. But the winde and their Oars in a
few moments overcame that way, and rendred them into the Rode,
where they preſently caſt anchor; which while they were doing, a
perſon of a very high and martiall aſpect ſhewed himſelf upon the
prow of a ſtately Veſſell, and this ſight did not more quiet the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of the <hi>Africans,</hi> then it augmented their rejoycings. For they
lift up their eyes and hands to heaven, and beholding that ſource of
their happineſſe, they ſhouted out with one voice (rather by inſtinct
then knowledge) That the <hi>Romans</hi> were no longer to be dreaded, nor
their <hi>Scipio</hi> eſteemed invincible. After which words they reſounded
forth the famous name of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> every one preſſing forward to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60667:5"/>
do reverence to this grand Perſonage as ſoon as ever he was disbark'd,
(for he it was that occaſioned this agreeable confuſion;) The eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their great paſſions, which is alwaies an enemy to order, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
all ſuch as was requiſite to be obſerved in the reception of
this Prince <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Africans,</hi> at length ſpake
to him; and after the firſt civilities which he could not perform but in
tumult, endeavoured to expreſſe ſuch reſpect to Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as
is patible to ſo conſiderable a perſon in the like occaſions. The great
<hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhewed many tokens of friendſhip to <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> and having
embraced him with a tenderneſſe, whereof his ferocity was not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very capable, he adviſed with him concerning what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be done in order to the peace and glory of <hi>Carthage.</hi> My Lord
(anſwered <hi>Bomilcar</hi>) I beſeech you to afford me a more private au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and it is poſſible (continued he with a lower tone) you will
underſtand that we have been more unhappy then Fame hath given
out of us, as accuſtomed as ſhe is to amplifie the things ſhe reports.
Upon this unpleaſing Preface, <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſignified that his pleaſure was
to confer apart, and every one retired out of reſpect: When the
Prince turning to <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> proceed (ſaith he) I beſeech you, and
being out of the reach of any other ears, unfold to me without any
reſervation the preſent eſtate of our Republicks affairs. Theſe words
enforced a ſigh from <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> who after a beginning which ſeemed
to promiſe a ſad Diſcourſe, told him, that he was too good a <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
to be able to deſcribe the great Conqueſts of <hi>Scipio.</hi> I ſhall
content my ſelf (continued he) with informing you into how deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a condition they have reduced us, and ſtruck ſuch an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the ſpirits of the <hi>Africans,</hi> that all our Neighbours fled for
Sanctuary to <hi>Carthage</hi> in ſuch multitudes as repreſented that City ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Rendezvous of all the whole affrighted world, then a ſecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to diſtreſſed perſons. Their multitude from which we might
have expected ſome advantage by the encreaſe of our Forces, in this
occaſion afforded us nothing but more trouble and perplexity, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that even the preſence of thoſe, which was at other times wont
to contribute to the publick joy, had in the preſent conjunction ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of ſo dolefull ſemblance, as ſerv'd rather to redouble our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
and fears. You may judge, My Lord, if theſe paſſions,
which are but too contagious of themſelves, did not receive new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours
by the concourſe of perſons already in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ected therewith. In a
few words, I can averr, that they cauſed ſo profound a ſilence to
reign in <hi>Carthage,</hi> that the poor City did in a manner appear as ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and deſert, as it was really populous. Moreover, theſe fatall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
had ſo ſtrange and confuſed influences, that they cauſed us even
to fear that which ought to have calm'd our diſquiets, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto us the clemency of <hi>Scipio</hi> more dangerous, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hen his valour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.
For the generall voice was, that this Roman had indeed
approved him a moſt valiant man in the defeat of <hi>Hanno, Siphax,</hi> and
<hi>Aſdrubal;</hi> but they added, that his gentleneſs, moderation, and other
virtues were ſuch as raiſed him above the rank of men, and made the
gods our Adverſaries ſo long as <hi>Scipio</hi> was our Enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is not
all, My Lord (continued <hi>Bomilcar</hi>) the Ghoſt of King <hi>Siphax</hi> added
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60667:5"/>
new terrours to our forlorn eſtate, and that dolefull ſpectre cauſed
ſuch fright and aſtoniſhment in the ſpirits of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that
we at length apprehended his deſign was to deſtroy us, either by the
decree of the Gods, or to have aſſociats in his miſery. But My Lord
(added he, beholding Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> with a ſomewhat leſs ſad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance)
I have not without reaſon preſented you this ample deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
and although it may ſeem I ought rather to have conceal'd our
weakneſſes and defects, yet I have been induced to uſe this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to unfold them, and diſcover the greatneſſe of our evils, to the
end I might afterwards manifeſt the proportion of the remedy we
have provided for them. This remedy is no other then the news of
your return, which hath been publiſhed in our City, during the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dejectedneſſe, as a means to reduce it to ſome order; and all our
people terming your arrivall the return of their happineſſe and glory,
have enforced themſelves to ſolemniſe the day with ſports and feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Yes, my Lord, your only reputation hath wrought this change;
nothing hath been heard ſince ſome dayes, in the mouth of the whole
world but your name; and by a kinde of tranſport, ſutable to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
our women cryed about the City, That now the whole Univerſe
ſhould be reſolved whether the Romans were able to reſiſt the renowned
<hi>Hannibal</hi> of <hi>Tresbia, Thraſymene</hi> and <hi>Cannae.</hi> Behold, My Lord, the
power of our reputation (added <hi>Bomilcar</hi>) and obſerve ſo great a
change proceeding leſſe from the ordinary levity of popular mindes, then
from the great aſſurance which our Citizens have in the valour of their
illuſtrious Prince. Whereupon I am come hither by order of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
who receiving certain intelligence of your affairs, and being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that you would ſhortly arrive at <hi>Leptis,</hi> commanded me to take
theſe Troops to augment yours, and aſſiſt you in landing, in caſe the
<hi>Romans</hi> ſhould take the opportunity to oppoſe it. But now as if Fortune
were weary of perſecuting us, we ſhall without obſtacle recover the
great prop of <hi>Africa,</hi> and with juſtice hope that <hi>Scipio</hi> as valiant as he is,
will appear no more invincible before the illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal,</hi> then thoſe
known Captains his Predeceſſors, <hi>Flaminius, Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi>
have already done. Your Language is too obliging (anſwered Prince
<hi>Hannibal</hi>) and the people attribute too much to my arm, Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
ſince pre-conception acts ſo ſtrongly in their ſpirits: I ſhall leave
them to their opinion; and I will either periſh (added he with a tone
ſomewhat more ſtrong and ſavouring of his noble fierceneſſe) but I
will make good ſome part of their hopes by my actions. I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
therefore to march againſt <hi>Scipio</hi> (continued he with the ſame
air) as I have formerly marched againſt the gallanteſt Chiefs of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it is poſſible it may appear that this <hi>Roman,</hi> whoſe name carries
ſo much terrour with it to the hearts of our people and Armies, will not
alwaies fight with favourable ſucceſſe, nor harraſſe <hi>Africa</hi> ſo furiouſly,
ſince the Sea is no longer between us. Scarce had <hi>Hannibal</hi> uttered theſe
few words, but he diſpatched <hi>Magar</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> both to confirm the
peoples joy there, and to provide ſuch things as were neceſſary to the
accompliſhment of the deſignes he had reſolved on; And turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
again towards <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> in the mean time that his Army unſhipt, he
continued conferring with <hi>Bomilcar</hi> to inform himſelf more exactly of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60667:6"/>
the forces of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and thoſe of the Enemy, and having learnt from
him all that could be known, he determined to encamp, the better to
keep his army from being ſeparated by quartering in ſeverall Villages;
to which purpoſe he made choice of an advantagious place for the <hi>line</hi>
and other conveniences, and began himſelf to remove the turf. This
example was of ſo powerfull incitement, that the works were ſuddenly
advanced, and a large entrenchment being finiſhed within a few dayes,
afforded the Troops of <hi>Hannibal</hi> all the ſecurity which could be wiſh'd
for in Towns, and reſtrained ſuch Souldiers as he had brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi>
from forſaking their colours, and withdrawing after the ſervice of divers
<hi>Campagnes.</hi> As ſoon as the circumvallations were completed, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
was deſirous to take a little repoſe in one of thoſe Tents which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for him; But when he earneſtly inclined himſelf thereto, he was
aſſaulted by ſo many violent inquietudes, that he was driven at length
to bemoan the impetuous incurſions of his anxious and penſive thoughts;
and this grand perſonage, as fierce and haughty as he was, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
capable of ſighing in the preſence of his beloved <hi>Aſpar,</hi> whom he
had retained alone with him in his Tent. Sometimes he expreſſed very
tender and ſenſible regrets; and ſoon after following the notion of his
inſolent ſpirit, he thundred forth reproaches againſt a Princeſſe of too
great rigour; and endeavoured, as it were, to break thoſe fetters which
he felt ſo burdenſome upon him; but within a ſmall while love prevailed
upon him to eſteem and term them glorious; and he was even driven to
calm his fierceneſſe, and make it comply with that imperious paſſion
which uſeth not to yield to any other. Alas! <hi>Aſpar</hi> (ſaid the Prince, as
ſoon as his agitations permitted him) <hi>Thomira</hi> is in <hi>Africa;</hi> but do you
beleeve ſhe hath changed her former humour by being removed into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
climate, and that thoſe weak conſiderations you ſpeak of can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
any thing upon a minde that hath reſiſted the rudeſt aſſaults of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
No, No, <hi>Aſpar,</hi> it is not poſſible: I ſhall meet with the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable
ſeverity, which I attempted ineffectually both in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at
<hi>Capua;</hi> My Princeſſe will never ſuffer her ſelf to become flexible, and I
know but too well, that ſhe will alwaies continue to be diſdainfull, and
thy Maſter be for ever miſerable: Ah! <hi>Hannibal</hi> (proceeded the Prince)
behold the worthy fruit of thy paſſion! Thou ſeeſt thy ſelf conſtrained
to come to be the defence of thy Countrey, after thou haſt fallen ſhort of
becoming Maſter of the Univerſe: Thou oughtſt to have marcht to
<hi>Rome</hi> after the battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> inſtead of retiring to <hi>Capua;</hi> and rather
have gone to give Laws in the Capitol, then to receive thoſe of a woman,
when Fortune had put the opportunity into thy hands of ſhewing all the
world, that it's intire conqueſt was deſtin'd to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But how
ſpeakeſt thou, O <hi>Hannibal</hi> (ſaid the Prince, checking himſelf the next
moment) Is this the reſpect thou oweſt to the Princeſſe <hi>Thomira?</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou not well, that thy ſervitude is worthy to be preferred before that
abſolute Empire whereunto thy ambition cauſed thee to pretend, and that
thy chains are of greater value then the moſt glorious Scepters? Yes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Thomera,</hi> (proceeded he) I have done that which I ought to do, when
I went to <hi>Capua,</hi> to adore you there; my affection was worthy of you,
when it admitted no other conſideration but you; and I could not give
a fairer Teſtimony of the eſteem which I have of the incomparable <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60667:6"/>
then by preferring her above the Empire of the Univerſe: But
further, Moſt excellent Princeſs, conſider I beſeech you, the greatneſſe
of my reſpects; I believed my ſelf more glorious, when proſtrate at
your feet, then commanding in the head of a triumphant Army: I have
never yeelded to any but to you, O <hi>Thomira;</hi> and if I have given bounds
to the extent of my glory, I have not done it but at your feet, my ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Princeſſe. But too ſevere <hi>Thomira</hi> (reſumed this paſſionate Prince)
I have brought my glory at your feet, without laying my Conqueſts
there; I have ſighed a thouſand times without being able to mollifie you,
and having as often found you averſe from compaſſion, obtained for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of all my pains, only the ſatisfaction of having ſuffered them
for you. Theſe and more were the complaints of this high-ſpirited
Prince; in which he was ſometimes gentle and ſubmiſſe, and anon hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by the impetuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity of his temper to reproaches and renuntiation of
his bonds: Sometimes he accuſed and exclaimed againſt the Princeſſe
<hi>Thomira,</hi> but oftner proteſted himſelf her adorer, and it may be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the minde of this great perſon wavering by ſo many divers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
did not appear ſtrong in this encounter but by the violence of its
agitations. At length it became ſeaſonable for <hi>Aſpar</hi> to employ his tongue
and endeavours in order to the calming of his Maſters diſquiets: My
Lord, (ſaid this faithfull Attendant to the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) I have
had much difficulty to reſtrain my ſelf from interrupting the courſe of
your Speech: You have not yet ſeen the Princeſſe <hi>Thomira</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi>
and nevertheleſſe conclude with aſſured beleef that ſhe is ſtill incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate.
I confeſſe I cannot in this occaſion but diſſent from you, and
I crave your permiſſion to tell you, that I am in no ſmall admiration,
that a great perſonage ſhould be afflicted with evils, which he frames to
himſelf to be perſecuted by them. Ah <hi>Aſpar</hi> (anſwered the Prince
<hi>Hannibal</hi>) how little am I capable of this kinde of weakneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you charge me? My unhappineſſes have a more reall foundation,
being the true effects of the obdurate, immovable humour of <hi>Thomira;</hi> I
undergo them, becauſe <hi>Thomira</hi> is inſenſible, or becauſe perhaps ſhe is
only ſenſible for ſome other; and I beleeve her chains, which I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
wear (after all I have ſaid of them) will be no other then my
perpetuall puniſhment. Under the allowance of your favour (replyed
<hi>Aſpar</hi>) I am bold to aſſure you, that I expect ſome alteration in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
A ſtrong conceit, which I know not well how to expreſs hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
me, that the Princeſſe <hi>Thomira</hi> will render her ſelf plyable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the greatneſſe of your ſervices, and to perſwade me to this
more effectually, it preſents it ſelf to my minde as a certain preſage the
Gods have ſent me for the conſolation of my Maſter. I forgive
all to your zeal (anſwered the Prince) but you know well that I am an
enemy to the lightneſſe which induces to give credit to preſages: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
I beleeve the Gods would inſpire them to the perſon concerned:
And ſince you ſay it is for my conſolation, do you conceive they are
deſtitute of other means to give me enjoyment thereof intire? And this
perhaps (interpoſed <hi>Aſpar</hi>) is the reaſon that the Gods have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
the ſecret to you, becauſe you would have been altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous;
and therefore have judged your ſoul not capable of this ſort
of impreſſions: and if the Gods cauſe advertiſements to be given you,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60667:7"/>
inſtead of effecting your abſolute ſatisfaction, it is for that they would
have you addreſſe to them, and bring you to confeſſe, that all your gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs
are too ſhort to afford you contentment of themſelves. In the
mean time (added he) if it be your pleaſure to be further lightned in the
matter, we will go and conſult at the Temple of the Sun, a few furlongs
diſtant from our Camp, and perhaps you will ſee that their anſwer will
confirm my good beleef: The Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> had no great inclination
to trouble himſelf with ſuperſtitions, although he was otherwiſe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner
of the worſhip which is due to the Independent powers; and if he
gave not credit to certain divinations, which finde admittance only in
vulgar ſouls, yet (notwithſtanding the miſreport of Fame) he bore a
veneration towards Oracles, and the admonitions delivered by them:
Wherefore he determined to go to the Temple where <hi>Apollo</hi> rendred an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
every day; and having ſpoken to <hi>Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> he went
forth of the Camp, accompanied only with his Attendant, and took the
way leading to the Temple, though he expected not much redreſſe to
his affairs. The Prince by the way muſed upon the ſeveral accidents of
his life, he recalled to memory ſome part of his Conqueſts: he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
victorious over the <hi>Olcadians,</hi> the <hi>Oretanians, Carpentanians, Iller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes,
Barguſians,</hi> and <hi>Auſetanes,</hi> of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules</hi> upon the
banks of the River <hi>Rhoſne;</hi> he remembred his Umpirage between the
Kings of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> and conſidered his paſſage over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> till
at length he found himſelf victorious over the Romans neer the <hi>Po</hi> at
<hi>Tretia,</hi> at the Lake of <hi>Thraſymene, Cannae</hi> and <hi>Herdon.</hi> He farther ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to behold his Army encamped before the proud <hi>Rome,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
in his fancy, his being at the head of two thouſand horſe againſt
the Gate <hi>Capena.</hi> But after having repaſſed over all theſe happy ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
he beheld all his affairs overturned at a blow, he durſt not ſo much
as think of the winning of Cities, but endeavoured to deface that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum</hi>
out of his memory, contenting himſelf with conſidering this great
revolution, to the end he might better judge of the greatneſſe of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which hath cauſed it. This laſt thought was enough to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
a ſpirit leſſe couragious; but ere it had no other effect then
the rendring that of the haughty <hi>Carthaginian</hi> more ſtern and reſolute,
whoſe great heart invigorating it ſelf to repell this ſemblance of reproach,
promiſed him more by the winning one ſimple field in <hi>Africa</hi> then by all
thoſe battels he had gained in <hi>Italy.</hi> Whereupon he employed his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
wholly upon the Idea of his Princeſſe till he arrived at the gate of this
proud Temple, whoſe magnificent Architecture deſerved ſome moments
from his eyes, had he not had a deſigne which took him off from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Inſomuch that he entred without taking any regard to the rich por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
of the Temple, and going directly to the Altar, he proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
before it with this prayer; <hi>Great Gods! I need not declare the occaſion
that brings me hither, ſince the profoundest ſecrets of my ſoul are open unto
you. I am not come to ſupplicate any favours from you, being of beleef that I
ought not to beſeech any from a Juſtice, which without expecting the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and prayer of mortals beſtows them on ſuch as merit to receive them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
if the curioſity we have in thoſe things which concern us be any wiſe
pardonable, be pleaſed to let me know, whether the Princeſſe which I ſerve, will
ever become compaſſionate and ſenſible of my miſery, and if I may at length hope
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60667:7"/>
to be happy after ſo long ſuffering for her. Hannibal</hi> having uttered this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
aloud, held his peace, and a few moments after a dreadfull voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
this obſcure Oracle;
<q>
                     <l>Thy happineſs ſhall bear its date,</l>
                     <l>From the declining of thy fate.</l>
                  </q>
Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriſed with this anſwer, and although
he was no more knowing of his deſtiny then before, he nevertheleſs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thanks to the Sun, and went forth of the Temple, muſing on the
obſcurity of his Oracle. But he had not proceeded many paces, when
turning towards his attendant, he required his opinion concerning the
interpretation of what they had heard; <hi>Aſpar</hi> (ſaid the Prince) do you
obſerve, that inſtead of the ordinary obſcurities there uſe to be in Oracles;
<hi>Apollo</hi> hath delivered me one with a contradiction in it? The God hath
well ſignified that I was unworthy of the favours I demanded, in that
he hath rather perplexed my minde, then enlightned it by his anſwer.
How do you expound it?
<q>
                     <l>Thy happineſs ſhall bear its date,</l>
                     <l>From the declining of thy fate.</l>
                  </q>
Do's he mean that the beginning and the end, which are two contraries,
are the ſame thing in my happineſs? or would he ſhew, that I am to
finde my ſatisfactions at the ſame time that I ſhall loſe them. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
would put my minde upon the rack, did I conſider it with that
attentiveneſs and anxiety which is requiſite to unfold it, or rather did I not
remit the care of that life to Heaven, whereof it reſerves the conduct to
it ſelf when it ſpeaks ſo obſcurely. It is very difficult, My Lord (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Aſpar</hi>) to conſider unpaſſionately thoſe things which concern
our ſelves; and it is ſo hard to ſee clear through thoſe inquietudes which
excite the paſſions, that I do not wonder you apprehend obſcurity in this
Oracle, being you judge of it, taking in the conſideration of your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and that we ſeldome are upright eſteemers of thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our particular concernments are included. Nevertheleſs (proceeded
he) if you pleaſe to follow me to dilate a little upon its interpretation,
you ſhall ſee that the intricacy of it is not ſo great as you believe, that it
is far more advantagious to you, then it promiſes at the firſt thought:
You know, My Lord (continued <hi>Aſpar,</hi> perceiving his Maſter to favour
him with audience) that we never taſte happineſs in its purity, that all
things in the world have their mixture and allay; and we too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that Fortune, which is believed to preſide over Events, beſtows
and takes back her benefits with the ſame perpetuall levity; So that we
never enjoy an intire and ſecure contentment. I ſhall paſs yet further,
and preſume to affirm, That if we were arrived at the compleateſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all thoſe goods which compoſe that felicity men ſo much talk of,
and never finde; I ſay, I ſhall dare to affirm, That we ſhould have ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
apprehenſions of falling from that happy eſtate, as would make
us capable of ſighing in the midſt of our delights; ſince the greatneſs of
our ſatisfactions, would be in ſome ſort, the meaſure of that fear we ſhould
have to loſe them. But, My Lord, the revolutions which you fear are
of a quality to afford you ſatisfaction, and make you paſs for the leaſt
unhappy of men. Yes, My Lord, this Oracle is the moſt advantagious
that could fall within your wiſhes; ſince it gives you aſſurance that the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60667:8"/>
end of one happineſs, ſhall be the beginning of another; whereas uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one misfortune is but the introduction to a greater, till we become at
laſt precipitated into an abyſs of miſeries. You know alſo, My Lord
(added he) that happineſs hath different kinds of appearances, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why ſhould you think it ſtrange to gain one ſort with the loſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was either ſatisfied, or ſeemed to be ſo with this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
but being as little inſtructed of the nature of the happineſs he
was to loſe, as able to conjecture of what kinde that was the fates had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
him, he reſolved to await the explication from the event with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
and being of an humour which did not permit him to fear much
the aſſaults of fortune, he alſo was not very capable of expecting her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with very eager inclinations. Having his minde poſſeſſed with
this thought, there appeared to his ſight ſomething of a glittering bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
Upon which turning his eye toward the way which croſſed his, he
beheld a Cavalier followed by four others, and advancing toward the
place where the wayes croſſed; the firſt of theſe unknown perſons did by
a nobler aire evidence himſelf the Maſter of the reſt, rather then by the
diſparity of his Arms; which although of ſilver, enriched with ſcales
of burniſh'd gold, and beſet with many jewels, did leſs draw the eyes of
<hi>Hannibal</hi> by theſe ornaments, then by the fierceneſs of his countenance,
and the gracefulneſs of his port. The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Prince would have
paſſed on after he had a little conſidered this ſtranger, but he was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
when he ſaw himſelf accoſted, and heard theſe words, I know by
your Armes (ſaid the ſtranger) that you are a <hi>Carthaginian;</hi> therefore
inform me if it be true that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is encamped within a few furlongs
of <hi>Leptis.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Prince who was accoutred with a very plain
ſuit of Arms, the better to paſs unknown in his ſhort journey, ought not
reaſonably to have been ſurpriſed with this diſcourſe of the ſtranger; but
he was ſo notwithſtanding in a great meaſure, and as he had not quitted
the heart of <hi>Hannibal</hi> by laying aſide his arms and harneſs, he could not
ſuffer theſe words, which he eſteemed not civill, and fiercely anſwered
thereunto; If you are of the friends of that Prince, and would ſerve
him, I will ſoon accord your demands in giving you the news of him:
I will not receive them on thoſe terms (replyed the ſtranger) and I am
—Shew then (interrupted the impatient <hi>Carthaginian</hi>) if your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
be ſufficient to merit this advantage, and know that a Prince that
hath ſuch friends as my ſelf, would perhaps take little care to gain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of your account. He ſaid no more, but drawing his ſword aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſtranger, who had ſoon drawn his, and being not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
him, contented himſelf to receive him with a very gallant and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
firmneſs. The other four Cavaliers, knowing the generoſity
of their Maſter, were conſtrained to be ſpectators of the combat, and
obliged <hi>Aſpar</hi> to be ſo by their example. Theſe two valiant warriours
dealt great blows to one another; which they warded with their ſhields
for a long time with much dexterity; till at length the ſtranger was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the right arm, and having drawn bloud from <hi>Hannibal</hi> by a hurt
he gave him in the left, he received at the ſame time a ſtroke that proved
the weakneſs of his curaſſe. Whereupon the ſtranger, who was one of
the braveſt perſons in the world, and had never been treated in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in his combats, perceiving his flux of bloud, changed all his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60667:8"/>
into fury, and flew upon his enemy with ſo impetuous a Violence,
that the great <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſtood in need of his whole force and skill. But
at length this haughty Prince being incenſed to finde a reſiſtance he uſed
not to meet with in his encounters, diſcharged from that arm (ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to many Nations) ſuch a heavy blow upon the head of the ſtranger,
that it made him reel, and would without doubt have born him from his
horſe, had not two of his Cavaliers ſpeeded to his ſuccour, while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two run to revenge him; Of which the firſt that lifted up his ſword
to ſtrike the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſoon received his death as a puniſhment of
his temerity in preſuming to attaque this great man; and the other, whom
<hi>Aſpar</hi> engaged, would have perhaps followed the fate of his companion
by a leſſe honourable hand, had he not ſuddenly cryed out for ſparing his
life, to go and provide with his companions for the preſervation of that
of his Maſter. The Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> cauſed <hi>Aſpar</hi> to retire, and went
himſelf to ſee in what condition his enemy was, and to offer the ſtrangers
all manner of aſſiſtance. He found that they had taken off his Helmet,
and perceived an aſpect compoſed of fierce and comely with ſeverall
marks of greatneſs. The ſtranger was not in ſo bad eſtate as was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and ſeeing his Enemy approach, he endeavoured to re-enforce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to go againſt him, but was reſtrained by his attendants, and arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf when he underſtood the intention of the generous <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
He was ſurpriſed with the good meene of this Prince, when he ſaw him
lift up the Viſour of his Caſque, and remarked in his Viſage ſo noble
and great an air, that he was as much aſtoniſhed therewith, as he had
been ill-treated by his valour. Valiant Sir, (ſaid the unknown perſon)
I wonder not that you are friend to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſince there is ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
between you in the moſt heroick of all qualities; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that Prince loves little of the world, if he love not ſuch perſons as
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I think if he had more friends of the like valour, he might
promiſe himſelf ſucceſs in <hi>Africa,</hi> more advantagious then thoſe his arms
have had in <hi>Italy. Hannibal</hi> is not ſo happy in friends as you imagine
him (anſwered the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) ſince you have refuſed to be of
their number; but however, if you pleaſe to go to his Camp, you ſhall
there receive ſuch treatment as ſhall reſtrain you from hating a man who
perhaps never offended you? Hate (ſaid the ſtranger) I honour his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and admire his high reputation too much to be guilty of ſuch ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but I told you before, I could not ſerve him, becauſe I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
on the contrary ſide. Nevertheleſſe, upon your word, I will go
to the Camp of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> provided you promiſe me I ſhall leave it at
my pleaſure, and that neither the knowledge of my condition, nor that
of my engagement for the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhall be any cauſe to retain me in the
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army, when it ſhall be fit for me to go ſerve againſt it.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> accorded the ſtranger his deſires, and having ſeen him mounted
on his horſe with one of his Attendants behinde him to hold him up, they
took the way to the Camp together. Theſe great Perſons had an extreme
deſire to know one the other, and view'd each other many times, to learn
that which they durſt not enquire of: but after they had marched ſome
time without any ſpeech at all, the ſtranger at length ended the ſilence to
render thanks to his Conquerour, and to deſire the knowledge of his
Name, who had ſo generouſly obliged him. Scarce had he began to

ſpeak, when he ſpyed a Body of Horſe making toward them with a large
trot, which he perceived were <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Wherefore, to prevent
being known by any of this Troop, he pul'd down the viſour of his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;

their Prince as his guard, and that the perſon with whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
was the great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but he approached with a very ſubmiſs
action, and told him obligingly that his ignorance had made him guilty
of a great miſtake; and my Lord (ſaid he) you could not have made
your ſelf known in a more heroick manner; your great ſtrokes ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

cauſed you to be taken for a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> yet I might have better known
by your actions, that you were the illuſtrious Prince of <hi>Carthage.</hi> But,
my Lord (added he) to take away a part of the regret which you may
poſſibly have for drawing your ſword againſt me, and to teſtifie to you
that I was not altogether unworthy to be treated favourably, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to you that I am King of a Realm ſufficiently large; and as ſoon
as I ſhall have taken a little repoſe, I ſhall let you ſee by the ſtory of my
life, that the quality of King poſſibly is not the thing which will moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
you. Upon this Declaration <hi>Hannibal</hi> redoubled his civilities, and
craved pardon of the ſtranger for that he had not treated him as he ſhould
have done, had he underſtood his true condition: My Lord (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) your ſelf only ought to have regreat for
meaſuring the ſword againſt a man that appear'd no more then a ſimple
<hi>Carthaginian;</hi> and if Fortune hath given me ſome advantage, ſhe hath
only plaid a new prank of her old game; and by a <hi>Caprichio</hi> ordinary
with her inclined to be your enemy, becauſe ſhe delights to overturn the
powerfull, and to favour me, beleeving ſhe ſhould raiſe a man whom ſhe
took for an ordinary Native of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Your Victories (replyed the
ſtranger) have no dependance on her, and your valour does alwaies ſo
aſſuredly produce its effects, that it is eaſie to judge it holds nothing from
the Empire of that inconſtant Goddeſs. Theſe two Princes continued
on their converſation in very obliging terms, and ended not till they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Camp. There <hi>Hannibal</hi> took all poſſible care
for the King whom he had wounded; he lodg'd him in one of his own
Tents; and cauſed him to be preſently dreſs'd by his beſt Chirurgions;
by whom he was informed to his great joy of the curableneſs of the
Kings wounds: inſomuch that he would go in perſon to give him aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the contentment he received thereby. Being there, he heard a
noiſe in his Tent, which obliged him to turn his eye about to diſcover
the cauſe; whereupon he ſaw <hi>Adherbal</hi> entring, who was a <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
of quality, and in no mean eſteem with him. The Prince had not
time to demand the cauſe which had ſo much moved him; for <hi>Adherbal</hi>
immediatly as he entred teſtified his ſurpriſe and joy, and following the
force of his impetuous humour: My Lord (cryed he) To horſe, <hi>Laelius</hi>
is ours, with a thouſand Talents, <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not contain from ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at this ſtrange introduction, and by and by looking ſeriouſly upon
<hi>Adherbal,</hi> Recollect your ſelf (ſaid the Prince) and ſpeak more clearly if
you would be underſtood. Although <hi>Adherbal</hi> was in favour enough
with his Prince, yet he was ſenſible he had committed a miſcarriage in
not delivering himſelf but by a tranſport; and after having made a low
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60667:9"/>
reverence as to crave pardon for his fault, he offered a more particular
diſcovery. <hi>Hannibal</hi> commanded him to ſpeak aloud, not ſeeing any
perſon in his Tent whom he might ſuſpect. Whereupon <hi>Adherbal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
a <hi>Numidian,</hi> who came from the parts of <hi>Vermina,</hi> to advertiſe
that <hi>Laelius</hi> was to paſſe within a hundred furlongs of <hi>Capſa,</hi> with onely
four thouſand men; that with thoſe few Forces he convey'd a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Preſent, worth above two thouſand Talents, which the Republick
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſent to <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> and that this <hi>Numidian,</hi> very well knew where
there was a convenient place to ſurpriſe the paſſage of the <hi>Romans:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Prince diſcourſed with the <hi>Numidian</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his advice, cauſed his Attendant <hi>Aſpar</hi> to be called, and whiſpering
ſomething in his ear, he commanded him to go forth and uſe extreme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
This order being given, he turned himſelf towards this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtranger, and proteſted that he could not reſolve to leave him, were
it not convenient to permit him to his quiet, and neceſſary for himſelf
from time to time to take care for the affairs of his charge. After this
complement, he went forth of his Tent, and betook himſelf to chooſe
out the beſt Horſe which <hi>Bomilcar</hi> had brought, to whom he gave the
command of them, and of ſeverall other Troops he added to form a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
being not willing to go himſelf in this expedition, either by reaſon
of his hurt, or out of ſome other conſideration. The Prince having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſuch orders as were neceſſary, retired to his Tent by the counſell of
the Chirurgions to take his reſt. He paſſed the Evening, and almoſt the
whole night with deviſing means to ſee his Princeſſe, ſo that he could not
ſleep till about the break of day, and waked not till very late. Which he
no ſooner did, but he remembred the promiſe of the wounded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, and
deeming that he might take this occaſion to learn his name and adventures,
he ſent to know in what condition he was. The meſſenger which went
to that purpoſe returned preſently with News that the King had paſſed
the night with very great unquietneſſe, that he had not fallen aſleep but
two or three hours ſince, and that the Chirurgions thought it not fit he
ſhould be viſited ſo ſoon. This anſwer obliged the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Prince, to
entertain himſelf a part of the day with <hi>Maharbal,</hi> and ſome eminent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
who were preſent at his riſing; and as he was telling them of the
news he had received of <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> he ſaw <hi>Bomilcar</hi> enter
accompanied by <hi>Adherbal,</hi> and the <hi>Numidian</hi> Courtier. <hi>Hannibal</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a deep ſadneſſe in the countenance of <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> and being deſirous
to know the occaſion, What (ſaid he obligingly) can <hi>Bomilcar</hi> be ſad when
he comes from fighting? I come not from fighting, My Lord, anſwered
<hi>Bomilcar, Laelius</hi> is retired to a fortreſs, which the <hi>Romans</hi> have poſſeſſed
for about a moneth, and being not in a condition to go force it, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
but leſs troubled for his retreat, then at the news which the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
of <hi>Vermina</hi> hath given me. But, My Lord (added <hi>Bomilcar</hi>) I moſt
humbly beſeech you to diſpenſe with me for relating it to you this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to permit me to acquaint you as late as I can with a misfortune, whoſe
greatneſs ſurpaſſes your power to redreſſe it. Theſe laſt words of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>
amuſed <hi>Hannibal</hi> extremely, and as the Prince deliberated what
reſolution he ſhould take, whether to be better informed, or to expect yet
ſome time, there came one to tell him that the King requeſted him to take
the pains to come to his Tent. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was glad of this means to break
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60667:10"/>
off his irreſolution, and although he had inward ſentiments of ſorrow,
yet he promiſed himſelf a kinde of conſolation from this viſit, beleeving
that the converſation of a ſick perſon would be melancholick and ſutable
to the humour that had ſeiſed him. The wounded King was aware of the
alteration of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and intereſting himſelf in that which afflicted this
great man, he demanded of him with much civility the cauſe of his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
'Tis not My Lord (continued he) the retreat of <hi>Laelius,</hi> I have been
told, which afflicts you, if it were, I ſhould be perhaps againſt my ſelf,
and partake in the ill ſucceſs you have had, although I am extremely
concerned in that affair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you ſhall know more at large by and by. No,
No, My Lord (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) 'tis not the retreat of <hi>Laelius</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
me, and ſince you deal ſo generouſly, and none elſe is privy to our
diſcourſe, I ſhall not ſcruple to tell you that <hi>Laelius</hi> is not in ſecurity but
by my means; and to lay my thoughts open to you freely, I beleeve it
is never fit to ſeek to fight with advantage in a ſingle combat; alſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that ſlights and artifices cannot paſſe in ſuch occaſions but for props
of weakneſs, and that generoſity ought to eſteem them either as a pitifull
ſort of aſſiſtance, or a means to ſteal a victory. But I reaſon after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner (proceeded he) when it is requiſite to preſerve my Troups
in a day of battell; and it ſuffices to tell you, that I have in a manner cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the retirement of <hi>Laelius,</hi> to ſhew you that I have employ'd the ſole
means that was left me to preſerve the moſt effective Troops of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
For in a word (added he) I ſhould have infallibly loſt thoſe which
I uſed in this ſervice, and loſt them even in gaining this ſmall Victory,
which in appearance I ought to have expected: for my ſouldiers being
become rich by the booty of this great prize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would without doubt have
deſerted me, and being almoſt all of this Countrey, they are ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the by-waies, that it would have been impoſſible for me to
have purſued after them; and perhaps I ſhould alſo have loſt thoſe I had
ſent to recover the others. Nevertheleſſe, I confeſſe, I ſhould have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
the forces of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but at the ſame time I averre, that it was
not expedient to hazard my Troops to attaque ſome of theirs which were
divided, and that it is better to preſerve my ſtrength intire, to the end I
may be able to fight the grand Army of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and one ſingle Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
render me Maſter of all the reſt. This is, in few words, the reaſon
which induced me to act after a faſhion not ordinary, and which may
make me paſſe either for a ſubtle Captain or a humorous contriver, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the diverſity of judgements which may reaſon upon my conduct.
Your conduct My Lord (anſwered the wounded Prince) is not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
conduct, and all the world knows, that your prudence hath cauſed
you to be regarded in battels as the Father of your ſouldiers; ſo effectual
hath it been to their preſervation. In reality every one hath believed that
your wit did not leſſe triumph in <hi>Italy,</hi> then your courage, ſince it hath
produced you many a Victory, and ſometimes furniſhed you with means
wholly extraordinary to avoid dangers, the eyes of all other mortals
would have conſidered as inevitable. But, my Lord, when you acted
like the Generall of an Army, it hath been in a gallant manner: for that
is truly to overcome like a man, when prudence beareth a part in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
as it is to overcome after the manner of brutes, when force alone
gives all the advantage. This prudence notwithſtanding, hath acted leſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60667:10"/>
then your courage in particular engagements, wherein you have alwaies
behaved your ſelf with an ardour ſo noble, that the world hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
been induced to beleeve, that you deſigned no other end of your
pains but the conſervation of others. For, in ſhort, to omit thoſe actions
whoſe glory dazles the ſight of the beholders, I will only mention your
exploits of yeſterday, and ſhew you that the retreat of <hi>Laelius</hi> affords e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that you know how to preſerve an Army, as the combat you had
with a Cavalier who might have been ſeconded by four others, ſhews that
you go not with very great precaution at ſuch time as only the ſafety
of your own life is concerned: and nevertheleſs, the condition which I
am in, manifeſts that you know how to overcome in all faſhions. Ah!
'tis too much My Lord (interpoſed the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) how do you
treat <hi>Hannibal?</hi> Do you ſerve your ſelf of ſome preoccupation of ſadneſs
appearing upon his countenance, to continue a diſcourſe which he ought
not to permit? and would you have him render himſelf unworthy of
your obliging expreſſions, if he ſhould ſhew himſelf capable of hearing
them? If your actions had leſſe ſplendor (replyed the King) you would
have reaſon to interrupt my diſcourſe, and your modeſty might with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
be offended: But My Lord in the eſtate wherein you are (continued
he with an obliging ſmile) you would have more difficulty to ſilence
thoſe tongues that are employed in your praiſes, then you have had to
perform thoſe fair actions which make them ſpeak. The King proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no further, becauſe he ſaw <hi>Aſpar</hi> was entred into the Tent, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards his Maſter to ſpeak to him. This perſon judging that he
ought to loſe no time, My Lord (ſaid he preſently to the Prince <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>)
I ſhall not render you account of what I have done, ſince the ſucceſs
hath manifeſted that I have fortunately diſcharged my commiſſion which
you gave me; but it is fit that I preſent you with news that will afford you
joy, and tell you that our Re-publick hath made alliance with <hi>Syria, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,
Bithynia,</hi> that levies have been made for us in theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
that King <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, with the Prince <hi>Perſius,</hi> and the
young Prince <hi>Nicomedas,</hi> have dis-engaged themſelves from their Troops
to be rather with you, and to loſe no opportunity of fighting. I have
met <hi>Magar,</hi> who came with all ſpeed to give you this advertiſement, but
being his horſe began to be no longer able to ſerve him, and mine was yet
freſh, he charged me to come with diligence to aſſure you that thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would be here within two or three hours, and that their Troops which
compoſe between ſixty and eighty thouſand men, and are commanded by
the Kings, <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Pruſia's,</hi> will reach <hi>Carthage</hi> within five or ſix daies.
The Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> was extremely ſatisfied with this News, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made his complement to the ſick King, took horſe notwithſtanding
his wound, and went to meet <hi>Antiochus, Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Perſeus,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by <hi>Maharbal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bomilcar,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable Officers of
his Army. He met the Princes about ſeven or eight furlongs from his
intrenchments, and firſt embraced the King of <hi>Syria</hi> with great proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and then alſo carried the Prince of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and the young Prince
of <hi>Bithynia, Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar</hi> took their turn to make their comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the Officers of each part ſaluted one another very civilly, but
with addreſſe, out of the reſpect which they owed to the preſence of ſo
great Princes, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the King of <hi>Syria, Nicomedes, Perſeus, Maharbal</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60667:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Bomilcar</hi> remounted their horſes, and putting themſelves at the head
of above a thouſand Officers, took the way towards the Camp. They
had ſcarce marcht a few moments, but <hi>Antiochus</hi> told the illuſtrious <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
that <hi>Aſia</hi> would not leſſe intereſt it ſelf in the important warre of
<hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> and the deſire which I have
had to be concerned in a quarrell of ſo great extent, hath brought me to
the famous <hi>Hannibal,</hi> under whom I ſhall venture my fortune and receive
his orders. <hi>Hannibal</hi> will receive yours, My Lord, (anſwered the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
Prince) and the great conqueſts you have made, and the name
of <hi>Great,</hi> the world hath given you, teach me ſufficiently that I ought to
follow the King of <hi>Syria</hi> to be conducted to victory; and if all that you
have done in <hi>Aſia</hi> (continued he) ſhould not evince you a tranſcendent
Martialiſt, yet that which you do in this conjuncture is ſo glorious to you,
and advantagious for me, that I am to ſeek for terms to expreſſe my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of it. For, My Lord, you take arms, without that the neceſſity
of your affairs obliges you to do ſo; you paſſe the ſea to ſeek warre, and
chuſe a ſide that is weak, and ſeems to have been abandoned by Fortune.
How therefore ſhall I ſtile theſe actions? Our enemies themſelves, what
can they ſay of them? Will not they be conſtrained to acknowledge, that
the <hi>Vertues</hi> are not alwaies <hi>Romans,</hi> and that the Nations, whom they call
barbarous, know how to practiſe the moſt heroick? What I do My Lord
(modeſtly replyed <hi>Antiochus</hi>) may be very differently interpreted, and
not only our enemies, but the moſt diſintereſted people from both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may ſay, that my proceeding is more politique then generous. 'Tis
not unknown (purſued he) that your Republique, and that of <hi>Rome</hi> are the
two greateſt powers upon earth, and that the greateſt part of Kings cannot
ſubſiſt but by protection of one of them, and conſequently that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to contribute to the rendring their ſtrength equall; ſince by that
means <hi>Carthage</hi> will alwaies bound the ambition of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the arms of <hi>Carthage.</hi> If one of theſe Republiques (proceeded
<hi>Antiochus</hi>) were not a powerfull obſtacle to the other, who would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to withſtand that which were Victorious? Who could bear up againſt
the force of <hi>Rome,</hi> if <hi>Carthage</hi> were overcome, or oppoſe <hi>Carthage,</hi> if <hi>Rome</hi>
were ſubdued? Should this happen, I believe few Princes could preſerve
their States. Wherefore it is requiſite that they league with one of the
ſides as ſoon as it grows weak, and contribute to that mutuall reſiſtance
wherein conſiſts all their ſecurity. You ſee My Lord (added the King
of <hi>Syria</hi>) what judgement may be made of my proceedings by thoſe
which do not know <hi>Antiochus;</hi> but I am ſatisfied that I come to ſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Prince who will judge more favourably of things, and have the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to believe it's no fear that makes me act in this conjuncture, and that
the breaſt of <hi>Antiochus</hi> is not very capable of giving entrance to that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
Rather (replyed the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi>) 'tis your own generoſity
that convinces him; and the King of <hi>Syria</hi> acts in a manner ſo noble, that
that conduct, which divers may term a Maxime of ſtate, cannot paſſe in
his eſteem for a ſentiment unworthy the greatneſſe of his courage. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
ending theſe words turned himſelf towards <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and gave him
many Teſtimonies of his acknowledgement, and proteſted to him that
the obligation which <hi>Carthage</hi> had to the King his Father was double, ſince
he had broken the alliance wherewith he ſtood engaged to the people of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60667:11"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and enter into confederacy with the Republick of <hi>Carthage.</hi> My
Lord (anſwered Prince <hi>Perſeus</hi>) the <hi>Romans</hi> are ſo puft up by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
of <hi>Scipio,</hi> that their pride ſeems to be inſupportable. The King
my Father hath thereupon conceived an averſion from them, and being
unwilling to partake as an Allie in the tyrannicall deſign of a people which
affects a univerſall Empire, he hath forſaken the league he had with them,
and contracted one with <hi>Carthage.</hi> Nevertheleſſe he could not ſatisfie
himſelf with this naked confederation, unleſſe he raiſed auxiliaries to his
confederates, and the eſteem he bears of the great <hi>Hannibal</hi> hath induced
him to come into <hi>Africa,</hi> to joyn himſelf in the war, and ſerve him with
his perſon. The Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> rendred thanks to him of <hi>Macedonia</hi>
by bowing of his body, when the Prince of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who all this while
view'd the great <hi>Hannibal</hi> with attention, began to ſpeak to him as ſoon as
he ſaw he might do it without interruption. My Lord, ſaid the young
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> I do not ſo well underſtand the deſign of the King of <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
as the Prince <hi>Perſeus</hi> doth the thoughts of the King of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> but

                  </gap>ght preſume to declare mine, after ſuch diſcourſes as perſons of
my age are not capable of, I could proteſt to you that I have ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the high renown of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that the eſteem I have for that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Prince hath brought me to his ſide and Army to learn the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
therein of a profeſſion, of which he is ſo excellent a Maſter. But
My Lord (continued the young <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) I am come only by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and without other reaſoning then what I have drawn from an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
motion: I have believed that I ought to eſteem the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
without conceiving a hatred againſt the Romans, which might be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and my heart one day reproach me as an effect of my fear. The young
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> pronounced theſe words with ſo pleaſing ferocity, that the
Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> was charmed therewith, and inſtantly felt that inclination
towards the Prince of <hi>Bithynia</hi> ſpring up in his breaſt, which he preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and cheriſhed there all the reſt of his life. Was it not generous enough
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> (anſwered the Prince of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>) to have benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
for me, without ratifying it to me by ſo fair effects, in forſaking
the pleaſures o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Cities, to expoſe your youth to the travels and dangers of
war? How do you treat me, My Lord! (interrupted <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) would
you have me be of a party, and do as they, which daring not declare
themſelves, are contented to aſſiſt the perſons whom they love only by
ſecret vows and wiſhes? No, No, My Lord, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> is none of thoſe
word-friends, he will make his actions ſpeak the ſenſe of his minde; and
if he leaves <hi>Bithynia</hi> in his fifteenth year, 'tis for that he believes the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Towns not honourable, when all the world is in the field: beſides
the age I am of (continued <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) being apt to receive impreſſions,
hath cauſed me to come to the great <hi>Hannibal</hi> to receive good ones from
him. Scarce had the Prince of <hi>Bithynia</hi> ended theſe words, but they
were juſt at the out-guards of the Camp. Into which being entred, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
received theſe generous confederates in the moſt magnificent of his
Tents, where he made them be ſerved with a very noble collation; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which they entertained themſelves with variety of diſcourſe, which
at length inſenſibly came to be concerning the wounded King. <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,

him, himſelf conducted them towards the generous ſtranger. The
firſt complements were very ſhort and conformable to the nature of the

the wounded King addreſſing to the King of <hi>Syria:</hi> You may judge (ſaid

nor am I much troubled to make an avowance thereof unto you, which
may ſpeak my ingratitude, So that at the ſame time I advantage the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of my Benefactour. Enemies of your quality (anſwered <hi>Antiochus</hi>)
will without queſtion be alwaies well treated by ſuch perſons as <hi>Hannibal;</hi>
and this Prince is ſo great a lover of virtue, that he teſtifies his eſteem of
it, whereever he meets it! I know not what <hi>Hannibal</hi> hath done (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) to be treated in this manner, and as little
whether you—He hath done ſuch brave things (interrupted the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
King inſtantly without ſuffering <hi>Hannibal</hi> to continue) that we ſhould
be raviſhed to know all he hath done: Ah! my Lord (added the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King) I ſhould be more particularly obliged to you then theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if you would do us the grace to cauſe the Hiſtory of your life to be
recounted unto us; ſince having been ſo frequent a Victor, I ſhould have
the conſolation to obſerve ſome occurrence, ſemblable to my late one, in
that recitall. Oh, my Lord (cryed <hi>Nicomedes</hi> with a pleaſing tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
make me know fully, that which I have ſo often admired. And
if I might be permitted, ſaid the Prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> to adde my prayers
to thoſe which ought to be more prevalent, I ſhould requeſt the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
My Lords, (anſwered the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> you demand ſo ſmall
a thing that I wonder you ſhould ask it with ſo much inſtance: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
you ſhall be ſatisfied, and <hi>Aſpar</hi> ſhall relate you what he knows of
my life. After theſe words the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> commanded his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
to be called, and in the mean while continuing the converſation
with the Princes, he told them, that in a little time they would perceive
that that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was ſo much talk'd of, was perhaps but little
known; and ſoon know the difference there is between the <hi>Hannibal</hi> of
<hi>Carthage</hi> and the <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the Princeſs <hi>Thomira:</hi> O beleeve notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
anſwered <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that the firſt, which is he you ſpeak of, is
ſufficiently known: and ſince few perſons know what is that renders him
different from the other, I conceive the impatience is reaſonable which I
have to know it. Yet I would not (replyed <hi>Hannibal</hi>) that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities
of my life ſhould come to the knowledge of the people: there
is a certain ſtupidity reigning amongſt them, which hinders them from
judging truly of things, and makes them condemn all they underſtand
not; and therefore it is not fit to diſcover that to them which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know but imperfectly; and ſince the loſſe of our libertie paſſes with
them for a weakneſs, and it is not neceſſary to encounter their Sentiments,
how unjuſt ſoever, I conceive it not within the rule of prudence to let
the multitude know what paſſes in the breaſts of great men who are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the crowd: Let them therefore only underſtand, if a man
hath Ambition, ſince that paſſion is not noble when it is not known, and
ought to produce effects of gallantry to be commendable. But the caſe
of Love is far different; this paſſion pleaſing it ſelf with making a ſecret
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60667:12"/>
of every thing; and it would be to commit a prophanation to divulge its
ſecrets to perſons who are incapable to guſt them in their purity. So that
there is I know not what of myſterious in it, which looſes its value as ſoon
as it becomes too much diſcovered; beſides that this fair paſſion not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but according to the diſpoſition of the perſons it ſubdues, it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for vulgar ſouls to believe that it can inſpire others with noble ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
at the ſame time that it inſpires them with low, and oftentimes
criminall conceptions. In which regard as I am very well pleaſed that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> paſſes in the apprehenſion of the people for only an Inamorato
of glory; ſo I am glad on the contrary that amongſt you, My Lords,
he is known to be the ſlave of the moſt excellent <hi>Thomira.</hi> Yes, My Lords,
I am not unwilling to let you know all the particularities of my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and although it renders me unhappy, yet I ſo much eſteem the fair
cauſe of that unhappineſs, that I account it my glory to have it known
to ſuch perſons as you; and I ſhall even finde conſolation, if you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
by what I ſuffer, the greatneſs of the reſpects I have for a Princeſs
who ought infinitely to be honoured. The Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> is ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
anſwered <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and I have heard ſpeak ſo advantagiouſly of
the beauties of her ſoul, that it is paſt my comprehenſion how ſhe could
refuſe her eſteem to the Prince of <hi>Carthage:</hi> and I comprehend leſs (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the young <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) how ſhe hath been able to retain that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
without proceeding to ſomething more tender. You are too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and I believe it not
difficult to comprehend, for what cauſe the Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> could never
reſolve to render <hi>Hannibal</hi> happy; ſince the firſt impreſſion ſhe received
of me was an impreſſion of hatred; and when I have endeavoured by my
ſervices to root out of her breaſt the averſion ſhe had againſt me, I have
perceived in this fair Princeſs ſo profound a ſadneſs, that I believed her
own grief would employ her enough to divert her from taking care for
that of another. But, My Lord, ſaid the wounded King, this profound
ſadneſs ought not to diſcourage you; for certainly the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
could not appear ſad before you, if ſhe had only hatred for you; and
the preſence of an enemy, of whom ſhe might revenge her ſelf by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him ſuffer, would not only not render her ſad, but be a means to
moderate all her diſturbances. Yet I proceed further, and believe that
<hi>Thomira</hi> is not ſad, but for that ſhe feels in her breaſt ſomething for you
very contrary to hatred, and is not afflicted but by the combat which is
in her ſpirit between a kinde of ſeemlineſs which acts againſt you, and
certain inclinations which are favourable unto you. Beſides I have heard
from the mouth of this fair Princeſs (by an adventure which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to you hereafter) ſome complaints which had ſomething of ſo ſweet,
ſomething of ſo tender, and ſomething ſo ſenſible and touching, that I
could not but accompany the tears I ſaw fall from the fair eyes of this
amiable mourner with my own. But My Lord, continued he, ſeeing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpar</hi>
enter, you may pleaſe to permit me to make that rehearſall, after we
have heard that which we expect from your attendant: And for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
no more to miſdoubt the ſadneſs of <hi>Thomira,</hi> you may believe, that
ſince the heart of this fair Princeſs gives entry to troubleſome paſſions, it
will not refuſe it to thoſe which enter with ſweetneſs and pleaſingneſs, and
even without any ones taking heed unto them. I ſhall do all that pleaſes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60667:13"/>
you, anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi> with an air wholly changed, and a countenance
which the Idea of <hi>Thomira</hi> afflicted had rendred extremely ſad: Yes, I
ſhall do whatever pleaſes you, and cauſe all the particularities of my life
to be related to you, and will learn no more then what you pleaſe to let
me know, whenever you think it ſeaſonable to inform me. <hi>Aſpar</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, turning to his Attendant) relate to the Princes all you know
of my life; but remember, that it is not fit your zeal ſhould tranſport
you in ſpeaking of your Maſter, and I forbid you all exaggerations
whereinto you are ſometimes carried. The Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> went
forth at theſe words making a low reverence to the four Princes. After
which <hi>Aſpar</hi> approached his illuſtrious Auditors, and having obſerved
their ſilence, himſelf alſo continued a few moments without ſpeaking to
recollect his Idea's, and put a kinde of order into his memory according
to the diverſity of times and the importance of the principall evincements
he was to relate, and then began his ſtory in theſe words.</p>
               <div type="history">
                  <head>The Hiſtory of Hanniball.</head>
                  <p>THe Prince whoſe life I am to repreſent unto you, hath atchieved
ſuch excellent exploits, and ſo little ordinary to the reſt of men,
that my recitall would ſeem prodigious, and filled with the exaggerations
which are forbidden me, did not you already know that I am to ſpeak of
the famous <hi>Hannibal:</hi> The praiſes which I am obliged to expreſs of this
great perſon, would appear with reaſon ſuſpected in the mouth of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick,
if all the world did not authoriſe them by the remarkable inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
it hath taken in the victories of my Maſter. The command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which I have received is very well pleaſing to me, My Lords, ſince
it gives me place to make the <hi>Elogium</hi> of <hi>Hannibal</hi> (ſo I call the ſtory of
his life.) But how agreeable ſoever the matter be which I undertake, it
nevertheleſs ſeems to me ſo great and difficult, that I may with juſtice fear
leſt my expreſſion be inferiour to it, and do not cloud the luſtre of thoſe
actions it would diſcover. But it is neceſſary that I obey, whatever the
event be. Yet before I enter upon my Subject, I conceive it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to tell you ſomething by the way, concerning the illuſtrious houſe of
<hi>Barſa,</hi> from which my Maſter is deſcended; as alſo neceſſary to declare
unto you how juſtly that houſe poſſeſſes the Soveraign authority it hath
in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and let you ſee he hath not without powerfull inducements
broken the alliance which we had made with the Republick of <hi>Rome.</hi> For
in truth I am obliged to convince the errour of thoſe Nations, who would
make <hi>Hannibal</hi> paſs for an Uſurper of the power he hath in <hi>Carthage:</hi> and I
ought alſo to ſhew that this Prince hath made war upon the Romans more
out of juſtice then ambition, to the end my Diſcourſe may at leaſt ſet
forth the equity of my Maſter, if it cannot ſufficiently repreſent both all
his fair actions and illuſtrious qualities. To ſpeak therefore of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the houſe of <hi>Barſa</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> it is convenient that by the way
I ſpeak of the foundation of <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſince this puiſſant Republick is not
more ancient then the illuſtrious Family of the <hi>Barſins.</hi> You know, My
Lords, that the fair <hi>Dido,</hi> daughter of <hi>Belus</hi> King of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> was
conſtrained to fly from <hi>Tyre,</hi> to eſcape the cruelty of her Brother <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcon,</hi>
who had treacherouſly murthered her Husband <hi>Sicheus;</hi> ſo that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60667:13"/>
happening to arrive at this part of <hi>Africa,</hi> which was called <hi>Zeugitana,</hi>
ſhe bought of <hi>Jarbas</hi> King of <hi>Getulia</hi> as much land as could be encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the Hide of an Oxe: whereupon cauſing the ſame to be cut into
ſmall thongs, it was very eaſie to encloſe a conſiderable circuit, wherein
ſhe made a City to be built which ſhe called <hi>Carthage,</hi> and in the middle
thereof raiſed that fair Cittadell, which we rightly call <hi>Byrſa,</hi> the word
ſignifying a Hide, The Government of this Cittadel was given to a great
Lord, who had refuſed to abandon the Princeſs <hi>Dido;</hi> upon which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the <hi>Africans</hi> not knowing the ſirname of that illuſtrious <hi>Tyrian,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him the Lord of <hi>Barſa,</hi> finding this pronuntiation more conformable
to their language then that of the word <hi>Byrſa,</hi> which being Greek was
uncouth to them. But afterwards this illuſtrious name became greatly
extended, ſince no ſmall part of <hi>Africa</hi> bears it. Behold therefore, in a
few words the originall of the name of <hi>Barſa,</hi> but I humbly beg your
permiſſion to dilate a little more that which I have to ſpeak, and to draw
from the end of the firſt Punick war the true cauſes of this ſecond, and the
lawfull authority of the <hi>Barſins.</hi> Nevertheleſſe I ſhall not relate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of that firſt war, the people and Nations that were concerned in
it, the ſeverall fields and battels, and the time it laſted, have rendred it
ſufficiently known to all the world: It ſuffices to ſay that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the <hi>Romans, Hiero</hi> King of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and divers other of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
waged it in <hi>Africa</hi> and in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and continued it four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years: You know alſo that it was compoſed after the defeat of <hi>Hanno</hi>
who commanded our Navy by a Peace, and an Alliance, which <hi>Amilcar</hi>
and <hi>Lutatius</hi> made between the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe
Generals they were, compriſing therein the King of <hi>Sicely,</hi> and the Allies
of either Re-publick. The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſtead of giving their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ſent ten Delagates; who adding hard conditions to the Treaty of
Peace, would oblige <hi>Carthage</hi> to pay a thouſand Talents above what had
been agreed between <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Lutatius,</hi> and ſtood upon great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to themſelves concerning Articles of Navigation and commerce. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>
could not ſuffer this oppreſſion, and having ſtill at <hi>Eryx</hi> his Army
which they could not yet overcome, put himſelf in a poſture to impoſe
the ſame condition on the <hi>Romans</hi> by a way more glorious. But at the
ſame time he received News that there was great troubles at <hi>Carthage,</hi> that
he was enjoyned to yield to the times, and to cloſe up a peace rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
then advantagious. Whereupon <hi>Amilcar</hi> was conſtrained to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Treaty with <hi>Lutatius,</hi> and to undergo after the concluſion of this
peace a war in his breaſt more cruell and inſupportable. He ſaw that the
honour of <hi>Carthage</hi> received a blot which ſeemed inextinguiſhable; he
knew the treaſure of this Re-publique was exhauſted, and perceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
conſtrained to live in peace with a people that cauſed theſe miſchiefs
which he was to ſuffer, without daring to pretend to bring a remedy unto
them after having ſigned the Articles. This was not becauſe the heart
of <hi>Amilcar</hi> had conſented to this peace; but that Prince knew that in an
affair of this nature, there is alwaies ſome party diſcontented, and that
it is enough that Treaties be made according to the accuſtomed formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without that one be obliged to know the inſide of the perſons that
make them. After he had ended this Negotiation, he paſſed with very
great diſquiet a part of the Night which followed that accord, till at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60667:14"/>
length Nature would repair the ſtrength which the agitations of <hi>Amilcar</hi>
had diſſipated, and cauſe this Prince to taſte a Dream more pleaſing then
the troubles which preceded it had ſeemed to promiſe; which dream was
continued without interruption till the approach of day. The fair Queen
<hi>Dido</hi> appeared in the Chamber of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> but ſo as ſhe ſeemed all cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with light, and ſhewing a countenance ſatisfied and ſmiling, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Prince that all apparitions are not alwaies dreadfull. This agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Spectre, did not leſs evidence its joy by its words, then by its geſture.
<hi>Amilcar,</hi> ſaid ſhe preſently to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General (as we have ſince
underſtood) <hi>Amilcar,</hi> chaſe away all that penſiveneſs and gloomy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
that afflicts thee; Thy wife hath this night made thee Father of
a Sonne, who will be the glory and ſtay of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Yes, <hi>Amilcar,</hi> thy
illuſtrious Son ſhall revenge our loſſes, and make the <hi>Romans</hi> feel, that
Tyrants are not alwaies ſecure; and that the revolt of <hi>Sardinia</hi> will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a mean to break the peace of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Beſide the intereſt of my City
(continued this bright Queen) I am to conſider that of my reputation,
which the <hi>Romans</hi> muſt endeavour to raſe out of the mindes of Poſterity,
to augment that of a Vagabond. Theſe malitious flatterers of a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Trojan</hi> (proceeded <hi>Dido</hi>) will aſſault my glory; and which is more,
dare to averre that I did not caſt my ſelf into the flames, but through an
exceſſe of love which I had for a ſtupid inſenſible perſon; although all
the world knows that I did that action, which will be ever deemed glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
only to avoid the purſuits of <hi>Hyarbas</hi> King of <hi>Getulia,</hi> who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to receive that faith, which I yet reſerved for the unhappy <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus.
Amilcar</hi> ſtarted and awaked at this part of the diſcourſe, and
thinking to return an anſwer to this great Queen, he perceived ſhe was
vaniſhed; although he beleeved he ſaw ſtill ſome glimpſes of fading light
in his chamber. This Prince being raviſhed with joy, inſtantly cauſed
himſelf to be made ready, to go and give orders for the imbarking of his
Troops, and having already prepared all that was neceſſary thereunto,
when he treated the peace with <hi>Lutatius,</hi> he was quickly in a poſture to
ſet fail; which he did within a few daies, and by a favourable winde came
happily to the Port of <hi>Carthage.</hi> All our principal Citizens repaired im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to him to teſtifie their partaking in his ſatisfaction; they congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated
the happy delivery of the Princeſs his Wife, and manifeſted for
the birth of <hi>Hannibal</hi> (for this was the Prince of whom the Queen <hi>Dido</hi>
ſpake) as much joy as the preſent eſtate of publick affairs could permit.
The Prince and they which ſaw the admirable Infant, were aſtoniſht at
the ſight, and preſaged ſuch great things from him, that even without
deſigne they made the horoſcope of this young Prince by ſuch exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The little <hi>Hannibal</hi> did not weep as other Infants of that age uſe
to do, but fixedly beheld all thoſe which ſtood about him, which raiſed
a conceit in thoſe that ſaw him, that even his firſt Infancie was fierce: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the firſt tranſport of joy for the birth of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the ſight of the
fair Princeſſes <hi>Aſdrubelea,</hi> and <hi>Magariſbe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60667:14"/>
learnt moreover, that thoſe Troops were compoſed of <hi>Africans, Gaules,
Spaniards, Greeks, Lygurians</hi> and <hi>Baleares;</hi> as alſo that their Leaders
were <hi>Spendius</hi> a <hi>Campanian, Matho</hi> a <hi>Lybian,</hi> and <hi>Autharic</hi> a <hi>Gaule;</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
he believed it no difficult matter to calm this Tempeſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he he determined to act like a Noble Patriot, and ſold all that he had
of value to diſcharge theſe <hi>male</hi>-contents, and by that means to appeaſe
the troubles in their birth. In order whereunto, there was one <hi>Giſcon</hi>
deputed to go to them, being a perſon well reſpected by thoſe Troops
which he had ſometimes commanded under <hi>Hanno:</hi> he was impower'd to
act according as he ſhould ſee requiſite, to grant the factious all they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be their due, and alſo whatſoever they demanded; So that the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> hoped a happy procedure of this affair, and conceived they
ſhould at length have reſpite after a warre which had not permitted them
any in four and twenty years. But alas, how appearances did abuſe use
and we ſoon found how lightly men embrace thoſe conceits which flatter
them: The offers of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> encreaſed the inſolence of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious,
who believed <hi>Carthage</hi> was fearfull when ſhe became indulgent,
and demanded the prices of thoſe horſes which they had loſt in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that
of corn which was formerly promiſed ſhould be ſent to the Army, and a
thouſand other things which were till then unthought of by them. <hi>Giſcon</hi>
conceded them according to the order which he had received, and as he
was upon the point of ſetling theſe hot ſpirits, <hi>Spendius</hi> whom I before
mentioned, the privy Leader of this pernicious Ligue, broke off all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
with <hi>Giſcon</hi> and <hi>African,</hi> and began that <hi>irreconcilable</hi> war.
This perfidious <hi>Spendius</hi> was once Servant to a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, but had
quitted his Maſter, and liſted himſelf in our Troops: Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he believed if the peace with <hi>Giſcon</hi> treated took effect, it would be
neceſſary to deliver him up, according to the Agreement between the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and that ſo he ſhould be puniſhed after the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
or the Laws as a Fugitive ſlave. This Conſideration moved him
to ward off his own unhappineſs with ours; and mounting upon a raiſed
Turf to be the better ſeen and heard, he ſuddenly uttered theſe words
to the Troups which were thronged together to hear him. My Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
behold the day which promiſes you all the advantages which you
can wiſh: 'Tis endeavoured to appeaſe you with a pittance of money, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you have been enforced to undergo the greateſt rudeneſs; Accept of
this money ſince it is in your power, and to get more let us march to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
as the ſource of riches. 'Tis thither, My Companions, we muſt
go to get ſupport to live in quiet the reſt of our dayes; 'Tis there where
<hi>Africa</hi> will ſtyle you her Deliverers, when we ſhall have overcome that
City, which would be her Soveraign Miſtreſs; In a word, that's the
place where we ſhall evidence that 'tis not ſafe to provoke a—Souldiery.
There is no doubt to be made of the ſucceſs of this Enterpriſe, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
for the Event; It is enough to tell you, that you are fear'd, to
let you ſee at the ſame time that you are Victorious. Take therefore this
money of <hi>Giſcon,</hi> ſince it is due to you; ſeiſe his perſon, and all his train
of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> leſt they give our Tyrants notice of our deſigne; and
let us go carry them the Tidings thereof our ſelves, effecting it with ſixty
thouſand men. The Diſcourſe of the perfidious <hi>Spendius</hi> had but too
much power upon the mindes of this rebellious multitude, inſomuch that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60667:15"/>
                     <hi>Giſcon</hi> was immediatly clapt under a Guard, with ſeven hundred <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
who had convoy'd him; and the Law of Nations was violated in
the perſon of a Delegate, and ſuch a Delegate, who had not repaired
towards them but to give them ſatisfaction. <hi>Spendius</hi> being unwilling to
loſe this occaſion which he had ſo much deſired, divided his Troops into
three bodies, making the firſt of <hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Baleares,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Matho,</hi> the ſecond conſiſted of <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of whom
<hi>Autharic</hi> was Leader; the third, which <hi>Spendius</hi> choſe to command him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
was compos'd of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ligurians.</hi> This diviſion was but too
well contrived, and it ſuffices only to know the Scituation of <hi>Carthage</hi> to
conceive the pitifull eſtate whereunto we were reduced, I beleeve, you
know, My Lords, that our City is built upon a Cape, and conſequently
is advanced ſomething into the Sea; that it is on one ſide environed with
the waters thereof, and on the other ſide with a Lake, which together
almoſt give it the form of an Iſland: So that it adheres to the Continent
of <hi>Africa</hi> only by a tongue of Land; on one ſide of which <hi>Tunis</hi> is ſeated
which looks towards the Lake, and on the other is ſeen the City of <hi>Utica</hi>

Port of <hi>Carthage.</hi> This River is not altogether fordeable, nor wholly
Navigable, and the only paſſage is at the Bridge of the City <hi>Sephira,</hi>
which is further advanced into <hi>Africa. Spendius</hi> marched towards <hi>Utica,</hi>
with his forces, who were much augmented by the way; and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took order for drawing of a Trench, whileſt <hi>Autharic</hi> made preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the winning of <hi>Sephira,</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> betook himſelf to beſiege <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
Behold all our Revenues debar'd by the ſiege of theſe three Cities;
Behold alſo our Enemies poſſeſſing this tongue of Land I ſpoke of, which
only affords commerce with <hi>Africa,</hi> and three armies ready to be united
according as any enterpriſe ſhould require. But it is better to unwinde
my ſelf from this part of the ſtory, and ſilently paſs over all the cruelties
which the ſeditious exerciſed during the warre. It ſuffices to tell you,
that this irreconcilable war was more bloudy then can be imagined, the
Rebels gave no Quarter; they ſtoned all the priſoners, and put to death
all the Officers conſiderable they took, with exceſſive torments upon the
Croſs: In a word, this cruell warre was remarkable for more inhumane
actions, then ordinary war are eminent for generous Atchievements.
The great conduct of <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> was no advantage in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
and theſe two Heroes being deſtitute of Forces proportionable
to thoſe of the Revolted, were conſtrained to attend ſome ſuccours from
<hi>Sardinia;</hi> when (in the mean time News was brought, that all the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in that Iſland were cut in peeces, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
received into the moſt conſiderable holds. With this News was
joyned that of the loſs of <hi>Tunis, Utica</hi> and <hi>Sephira,</hi> it was alſo ſaid that
<hi>Hippo,</hi> which had been alwaies faithfull to us, during the war of <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> had opened its gates to the ſeditious; and
for a completing of our misfortunes, two dayes after we beheld from the
tops of our Towers an Army of about fourſcore or a hundred thouſand
men coming to beſiege us. Then it was that deſpair poſſeſſed the hearts
of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and this poor people reſolved to abandon the City,
ſince they had the Sea free to ſave themſelves, But <hi>Amilcar,</hi> whoſe heart
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60667:15"/>
was invincible, detain'd them, and told them, that affairs were not come
to ſo deplorable an extremity as to have recourſe to remedies of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He ſhewed them that they might receive ſuccours from Sea; that
they knew that <hi>Naura</hi> Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> had fifteen or ſixteen thouſand
men beyond <hi>Sephyra,</hi> with which he deſigned every day to break through
the Enemies and put them into <hi>Carthage;</hi> and at laſt (added he) they
ſhould alwaies have the ſame opportunity of embarking, ſince the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had no ſhipping. The Senate and the people were immediatly inſtant
with <hi>Amilcar</hi> to take upon him the care of this important affair, and all
with a common conſent put the Sovereign authority into his hands, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
rather to give their City to an illuſtrious Citizen, then to abandon it
to the Barbarians. The Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> was in great thoughtfulneſs, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and quaſhing deſigns in his mind, and felt inquietudes conformable
to the miſeries of his Country; inſomuch that I think in this diſtreſſed
conjunction any other ſpirit would have been broken but his. But at
length this great man, to whom nothing ſeem'd impoſſible, took a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to deliver <hi>Carthage;</hi> but ſuch a reſolution as was not leſſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
then the ſoul that fram'd it, or the miſeries unto which our
City was reduc'd. The Prince cauſed a Muſter to be made of all their
Troops, and found that the Souldiers and the Inhabitants could not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
more then thirty thouſand fighting men, of which he drew off twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand and embarked them, leaving the other ten thouſand to guard
the City. <hi>Amilcar</hi> had obſerved that there was a very ſtrong wind up,
and thereupon judg'd that that wind entring upon the mouth of the River
<hi>Machaera,</hi> did there increaſe its violence; being ſtraitned and incloſed;
ſo that by reaſon thereof, the current of the River being in ſome meaſure
repell'd, the tumultuous waves recoiling into the River, and driving
back the Channel, made the River Navigable. Wherefore the ſame night
the wind aroſe, he put his men upon the River, and went to unſhip his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
beyond the Enemies Camp in a place ſecure from diſcovery, from
whence he ſpeeded one to <hi>Narva,</hi> to injoyn him to come to <hi>Sephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
whence he was not far diſtant, aſſuring him by his Meſſenger, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
would be at the foot of the walls of that City in the head of twenty
thouſand men about break of day, <hi>Narva</hi> could not at firſt give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to what the envoy related, and if any other but <hi>Adherbal,</hi> whom he
knew full well had brought him theſe ſurpriſing tidings, he would not
perhaps have believed him; but at length he credited the meſſage and
exactly obey'd the Orders of <hi>Amilcar.</hi> Theſe two Princes loſt no time,
and determined to carry <hi>Sephira</hi> by ſurpriſe; in order to which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
caus'd Blinds to be provided, under which they advanced
Rams to batter the City; and they manag'd their enterprize with ſo good
ſucceſs, that the Gariſon being terrified by their attempt which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
miraculous, betook themſelves to flight at the firſt appearance of
a breach, and ran to give the Allarm to the Camp before <hi>Carthage:</hi>
whereupon <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Narva</hi> entred <hi>Sephira</hi> without oppoſition; and
after they had diſpoſed a Gariſon in it of about four thouſand men, they
advanced towards the Rebels Camp. The young <hi>Narva</hi> put himſelfe in
the Head of a thouſand <hi>Numidian</hi> Horſe, whom he choſe out to go and face
the Enemy, &amp; to endeavour to draw him out of his entrenchments to ſome
skirmiſhings. But as he advanced directly towards the Camp, he met
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60667:16"/>
                     <hi>Spendius</hi> followed by three or four thouſand men, whom a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
had lead towards <hi>Sephira. Narva</hi> was extreamly glad of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and turning himſelfe to ſpeak to the <hi>Numidians</hi> which he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
My friends (ſaid the Prince, with an aire that breath'd nothing but
encounter) you ſee we ſhall meet with what we go to ſeek after; let us
charge the Rebels, and make me know that 'tis not without cauſe that I
have choſen you forth, as the braveſt courages of my Troops. After theſe
few words, <hi>Narva</hi> caſt his eye toward the ſide of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and as if that
ſight had more powerfully animated him, he incontinently defied <hi>Spendius</hi>
with a great cry, and ran up to him with his Sword in his hand, but with ſo
much fierceneſs, that the enemies were daunted with it. <hi>Spendius</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
indeavoured to reaſſure both by words and actions, and received
<hi>Narva</hi> with a boldneſſe greater then his crime could have permitted. So
there became a bloody combate, and ſufficiently obſtinate and reſolved.
<hi>Spendius</hi> was wounded on the thigh; and the ſight of his blood augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his rage, he laid upon the generous <hi>Narva</hi> with ſuch fury as would
have been inſupportable to an ordinary valour: this of <hi>Narva</hi>'s was of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
nature then to ſee it ſelfe ſurmounted, and the Prince ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
his efforts at the ſame rate the Rebel renewed his, which drew
blood from the Traytor <hi>Spendius</hi> by two wounds in his right arm, and
evidenced the remarkable difference there is between actions of generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and thoſe which are animated onely by diſpair. At length, <hi>Spendius,</hi>
whom rage began to blind, and betray, took no further <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed to his guard
or the defect of his Arms, but inceſſantly aſſailing, and ſpending his fury,
gave place to the Prince <hi>Narva,</hi> to preſerve his judgement at the meaſure
he loſt his own. The generous <hi>Numidian</hi> was ſlightly hurt, but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
<hi>Spendius</hi> to diſengage himſelfe from the Combate, and with ſuch
valour continued on fighting, and was ſo vigorouſly ſeconded by his own
Troops, that the Enemies gave back, as ſoon as they had brought off their
perfidious General. <hi>Narva</hi> purſued them for ſome time, and made three
hundred of them priſoners, beſides that the appearance of the dead
ſeemed to ſhew that he had ſlain five or ſix hundred Rebels, and had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loſt about four and twenty of his own Cavalry. Soon after he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thoſe of his own, or the Enemies which were capable of ſuccour, to be
raiſed up and taken care for; the priſoners he gave order to be guarded
by ſome of his Troops, and went to joyn with <hi>Amilcar,</hi> who received
him with great acknowledgements and affection. The <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince
rendred him account of that which had paſſed, and modeſtly mentioning
his own actions, contented himſelf with telling him that Fortune had not
favoured Rebellion, and that the little he came from performing, might
in ſome manner ſerve for a ſuccesful preſage. <hi>Amilcar,</hi> notwithſtanding,
ſoon underſtood how the affair was mannaged from the mouthes of the
<hi>Numidians,</hi> and even from thoſe of the Priſoners: upon which having
embraced <hi>Narva,</hi> and ſtyled him the generous Deliverer of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians;</hi>
Ah, My Lord (anſwered the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince) I am but little
qualified for the bearing of that glorious Title, and you have too much
goodneſs to receive a relation favourably, which the <hi>Numidians</hi> have not
been able to make without the tranſport of that zeal which they have for
their Prince, and to give belief to the diſcourſe of a few Priſoners, who
to excuſe their defeat, chooſe rather to repreſent me as valiant, then to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60667:16"/>
paſs themſelves for cowards. Nevertheleſs theſe conſiderations do not ſo
far remove me from the quality of a Deliverer, as (that which my ſelf
have of being a ſlave. Yes, my Lord (continued he) I am a ſlave, but
'tis to the fair Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia.</hi> So that, My Lord, you perceive <hi>Narva</hi>
is unworthy of your Careſſes, you ſee that he does more againſt you, then
he is able to do for you, ſince the whole Republick partakes in the little
ſervices I render you, and that you alone are concerned in the offence and
preſumption I have been guilty of in caſting my eyes upon the divine
Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia.</hi> This crime hath notwithſtanding ſeemed not to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome;
and I ſhould not have confeſſed it in any other occaſion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
onely declared it in this, becauſe your affairs are in no condition to
give me hopes of a long life. So that I have thought fit to beg my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
upon a belief that I had not altogether bad grounds to deſire it, and
was loath to carry a crime longer about me, which I am upon the point
of waſhing away with my blood. <hi>Narva,</hi> in the cloſe of theſe words, was
caſting himſelf at the feet of <hi>Amilcar;</hi> but the Prince prevented him, and
having embraced him with greater tenderneſs then before; Generous
Prince (anſwered he) I am perfectly obliged to you, both for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
ſervices which you render to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the eſteem wherewith
you honour <hi>Aſdrulia.</hi> This latter Obligation, which is particular to my
ſelfe, produces more powerful reſentments in me; and as I have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
in it, I am ſorry it is not in my power alone to ſatisfie you, and that
<hi>Aſdrulia</hi> does not ſo abſolutely depend upon me, as to diſpoſe of her in
your favour, If the firſt words of <hi>Amilcar</hi> were pleaſing to the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Prince, the laſt ſeemed to him ſo ſurpriſing and fatal, that he changed
colour, and exclaimed with a tone that teſtified his ſadneſs and diſpair:
Ah! My Lord, you ought for my ſatisfaction to have better diſguiſed
this refuſal, and preſerved the life of <hi>Narva</hi> yet a little longer, ſince you
have judged it not unprofitable to your affairs. I do not conceive (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Amilcar,</hi> that you have reaſon to be affected as you ſeem, nor
that my expreſſions ought to have cauſed that alteration which I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your countenance. It is true, My Lord (replyed <hi>Narva</hi>) that I
ought not to be ſurpriſed when you refuſe me a Treaſure which I ought
not to have obtained; but it is alſo true, that the manner wherewith you
have refuſed me is not very ordinary; and I believe, if the Prince <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>
hath not power over the Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia,</hi> it is very difficult for him
to tell on whom ſhe depends. On the ſword of <hi>Narva</hi> (interpoſed the
prince <hi>Amilcar</hi>) 'tis that which hath this day began to break the fetters of
<hi>Aſdrulia;</hi> 'tis that which ſhall defeat thoſe Troops which appear to treat
her like a ſlave: in a word, it is that ſword which ſhall with more glory
win <hi>Aſdrulia,</hi> then if he obtained her onely by the conſentment of <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car.</hi>
For I could not juſtly affirm, that <hi>Aſdrulia</hi> depended abſolutely on
me, ſince ſhe is in a City beſieged, and that your valour hath even acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this day a new right over all the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The paſſionate <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
could not hear theſe words without caſting himſelf at the feet of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar,</hi>
to render him thanks; and the joy which poſſeſs'd him, carried
him beyond the bounds of moderation: he believed that an Army of
fourſcore thouſand men was not at all formidable, he term'd them a flock
of feeble ſheep which he would diſſipate; and his choler adding flame to
his love, joy, and hope, he was ſo much tranſported, that the blood broke
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60667:17"/>
forth of his wound with violence: which <hi>Amilcar</hi> obſerving, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſed the hurt of the brave <hi>Numidian</hi> to be ſearch't, and appointing
him to be removed to bed, began to exerciſe ſuch an authority as infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charmed the Generous <hi>Narva.</hi> The Chyrurgions aſſured him that the
wound of the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince was not at all dangerous, and being but
in his left arm, was no hinderance to the Princes from deliberating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their affairs. They determined therefore to grant both life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the Priſoners, judging it onely then fit to employ violent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
when gentle were unprofitable, and that clemency and hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
might melt and reduce the ſpirits of the moſt rebellious. Whereupon
they declared to the Priſoners, that they were at liberty, that they might
retire where it ſeemed beſt to them; and that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did not
fight but to defend themſelves, not to cruelly maſſacre the Troops which
had been dear unto them. The Priſoners raviſh'd with this ſo agreeable
and little expected ſentence, teſtified their reſentment of it by a great ſhout
of joy, proteſting that if they returned to their Army, it ſhould not be
but to ſpeak to the advantage of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and to ſollicite their
Companions, there to make peace with a people ſo courteous and noble.
To this effect they undertook the enterprize with ſucceſs enough, and had
undoubtedly brought the whole Army to have recourſe to the Amneſty
which <hi>Amilcar</hi> offered, had <hi>Spurius</hi> interpoſed an obſtacle thereunto by a
wickedneſs worthy of its Author. This Traytor judging that the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of <hi>Amilcar</hi> might withdraw the Rebels, caſt about to engage them
in the perpetration of a great crime, to raiſe in their ſpirits a perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
of pardon, and to fight like men that expect no quarter. Wherefore
he cauſed a kind of Tribunal to be brought, which was provided for
that purpoſe, and beholding all the Officers which he had ſummoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, he ſpake to them in this manner; My Companions, I eſteem
you too much, to be able to ſuffer to the prejudice of your Glory, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
report which is blown about the Army; I have, notwithſtanding my
wounds, enforced my ſelfe to come and advertiſe you of it, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
you with an expedient to teach all <hi>Africa,</hi> that they which are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for its liberty, are not capable of a ſordid thought. I have been told
(but I crave your pardon if I dare to ſpeak it as of my ſelf) I have, I ſay,
been told (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſince it is neceſſary you ſhould know it to ſuppreſſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture)
that you were upon the point not to quit your glorious under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
or retire home to your Houſes: but, that which is now ſtranger
then theſe, to deliver your ſelves up into the hands of your enemies. Yes,
my Companions, I have been told it more then once; and moreover, I
have been credibly aſſured, that a counterfeit goodneſs of <hi>Amilcar</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
you to take up this reſolution, and that the mercy he had ſhewn to
ſome of our Souldiers, was an invitation to this deſign: Do not you ſee,
my Companions (continued the Traytor) that this pardon is an effect of
the weakneſs, rather then of the Generoſity of our Enemies? They give
the ſame thing to day which they intend to take to morrow, and teach us
that they dare not injure thoſe of our party for fear of provoking us: in a
word, not being able to conquer by open force, they pretend accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; peace which would be at length more dangerous to us, then a cruel
War. This artifice is too courſe for your underſtanding, and your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
is too great to permit you to imploy the pity, rather then the ſtrength
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60667:17"/>
of your Enemies: You will, I queſtion not, be ſhortly in a condition to
Pardon your ſelves, and to puniſh, and rule in <hi>Carthage</hi> in your
turn. It is fit therefore that you demonſtrate your ſelves not baſe enough
to hope in the clemency of another: it is fit to offend our enemies, that
they may ſee that we fear not ſuch perſons as we provoke. You have <hi>Giſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
in priſon, one of your Tyrants; puniſh him and all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
that you have with him; revenge your ſelves for the miſeries they have
formerly made you undergo, and preſerve the right which force hath
given you to do juſtice, and to condemn your perſecutors.</p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe of the inhumane <hi>Spendius</hi> was followed with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
muttering of voyces, which ſeemed to be divided: but at laſt theſe
perfidious Auditors having given a cruel applauſe, ran inſtantly to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe
on <hi>Giſcon,</hi> and the ſeven hundred <hi>Carthaginians</hi> above mentioned, and
loading them with ſtrong fetters, they lead them forth of the Camp into a
little valley. Ah, My Lord (ſaid <hi>Aſper</hi> ſighing) how cruel is my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in repreſenting to me again the inhumanity of theſe revolters? yet I
will not deſcribe it to you, that I leave not an unpleaſing Idea in your
minds, but content my ſelfe to tell you that they ſtoned all the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
after they had firſt cut off their hands, and crucified their unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Leader, whereby he indured the moſt cruel torments that rage could
poſſibly ſuggeſt to Barbarians. <hi>Amilcar</hi> quickly received the news of this
cruelty, together with the particularities thereof, which I have paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in ſilence; and deſiring to render the laſt duties to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
he diſpatched a Meſſenger toward <hi>Spendius</hi> to demand their bodies. This
Traitor, either to follow his own perverſe inclination, or to yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
their ſpirits, anſwered that he would not render them: that all the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſhould be alwaies treated in the ſame faſhion; that there
ſhould not be ſecurity ſo much as for Envoyes and Meſſengers; and for
what concerned the Allies of <hi>Carthage,</hi> they ſhould be ſent back after,
onely their hands were cut off. This anſwer provoked <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
in ſuch manner, that theſe two Princes put themſelves at the Head of
their Army, to march directly againſt the Enemies, and to draw them out
to fight; for the Prince <hi>Narva</hi> was now perfectly cured: and I have
made (proceeded <hi>Aſper</hi>) my relation without diſtinction of times, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
being troubleſome by endeavouring to be circumſpect. The Princes
had not long marched, but they received intelligence that <hi>Matho</hi> &amp; <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric</hi>
were advancing with forty thouſand men; which news giving more joy
then fear to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Numidians, Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Narva,</hi> hoped
a very advantagious ſucceſs. The Armies were no ſooner in ſight, but
the Princes omitted nothing of that which experienc'd Generals ought
to do in the marſhalling and diſpoſing of their Troops, and contenting
themſelves to ſpeak in few words to thoſe whom they lead: Let us on my
friends (ſaid they) and revenge our Comrades; you are not going to fight
with valiant Enemies, you are going to charge baſe Murderers: but do
not flatter your ſelves, they are of thoſe baſe ones that give no quarter, and
ſo ought to oblige you either to dye or overcome, and to chuſe death in
the heat of a battel, not to ſuffer it afterwards by the tortures of Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Numidians</hi> anſwered with a great ſhout, that
joy and undauntedneſs made them ruſh forwards; and they went againſt
the enemy with countenances that promiſed nothing but Victories, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60667:18"/>
fought very valiantly. If the paſſionate <hi>Narva</hi> performed brave actions,
the Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> alſo, though ſomewhat more advanced in years, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
his part ſo well, that the Enemies were wholly defeated, <hi>Autharic</hi>
ſlain by the hand of <hi>Narva,</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> made priſoner by <hi>Amilcar.</hi> At the
ſame time <hi>Hanno,</hi> who commanded within the Town, made a fally out
upon the quarters of <hi>Spendius,</hi> where he got very great advantage, in ſo
much that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were upon the point to march directly to the
Rebels Camp to force their Trenches. But <hi>Amilcar</hi> reſtrained them, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to call a Council of War, wherein it was reſolved by the advice
of the Prince, to withhold the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and not to enterpriſe ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
the raiſing of the ſiege; but to entrench themſelves near the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Camp, and cut off all their Avenues. There was no delay to put
this deſign in execution, ſo that within a few dayes the Barbarians ſaw
themſelves encloſed between the City and <hi>Amilcar</hi>'s Camp; and though
on the other two ſides they had onely the Sea and a Lake, yet they were
deſtitute of Ships and Boats to do themſelves any benefit by them,
whereby they were reduced in a ſhort time to a ſtrange extremity, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
with an inconceivable obſtinacy the peace which was offered them,
there became ſo great a famine in their Camp, that they were conſtrained
to kill and eat all their Horſes of ſervice; they even eat thoſe which were
ſlain at the aſſaults which were made at ſeveral times. There cruelty reſted
not here, they murdered divers of their Companions which were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
inſtead of ſuccouring them, and were brought at length to cut the
throats of their ſlaves and eat them. <hi>Amilcar</hi> intended to let them periſh
by little and little; but the impatient <hi>Numidian,</hi> who deſired with all
ſpeed to ſee the Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia,</hi> was in the mind to attempt their lives,
which he did with ſo great valour, that being back'd by <hi>Amilcar,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by a ſally which <hi>Hanno</hi> made at the ſame time, there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Victory obtained. <hi>Spendius</hi> was taken priſoner, all his Troops cut in
pieces, except a few Souldiers that were drowned in the Sea and the Lake,
by which they endeavoured to ſave themſelves. After this defeat, the
Conquerors entered into the City, where they were receiv'd with all the
joy and acclamations wherewith important actions are wont to be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized.
And as they beheld <hi>Spendius</hi> and <hi>Matho</hi> who were led after the
Princes, they fell upon the Traytors, and tearing them in a thouſand
pieces, puniſh'd them for ſome part of their crimes. On the morning after,
there was a great Sacrifice celebrated to render thanks to the Gods. After
which <hi>Amilcar</hi> intended to recompence the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince, by giving
him his Daughter the fair Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia.</hi> I will not entertain you with
the deſcription of the Feaſts and publick rejoycings, nor hold you with
diſcourſe of <hi>Narva</hi>'s joy, or that of the Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia,</hi> nor of their
loves which preceded that Declaration which the <hi>Numidian</hi> Prince made
to the Prince <hi>Amilcar,</hi> as being not much to my ſtory. I ſhall onely tell
you, that upon the end of this War, which was termed Irreconcilable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it could never have ended but with the total ruine of one party, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,
Ulica,</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> put all their Gariſon to the ſword, and deputed
ſome of their prime Citizens to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to declare their return under
its Government. Soon after the Aſſembly of the Eſtates General was
holden, wherein it was ordained (that ſeeing the Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
very well ſerved the Republick, had ſold all his goods to diſcharge
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60667:18"/>
the debts of the publick, that he had even beſtowed the Princeſs <hi>Aſdrulia</hi>
his Daughter to acquit <hi>Carthage,</hi> of the ſervices it had received from
<hi>Narva;</hi> It was ordained, I ſay, that the Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the charge of Prince of the Senate which had been formerly
given him, and which he had made no uſe of, but to the quiet and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the City, even with the peril of his own life. After which the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of <hi>Sardinia</hi> was deliberated upon, it was believed, there could have
been no commotion in this Iſland without ſome forrain Abetters; and ſo
that it muſt needs be that the Romans had ſtirred up the Rebellion, which
they had made ſufficiently apparent, when they put themſelves into the
beſt of its fortreſſes. And being it was not permitted to abet the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
ſubjects of a Republick that was in league with them, the injuſtice
of the <hi>Romane</hi> proceedings was laid open; but without clear examination
of the nature of the offence which <hi>Carthage</hi> received thereby, becauſe
ſhe was not yet in a condition to demand reaſon of them for it. You ſee
therefore, My Lords, how the Illuſtrious <hi>Amilcar</hi> obtained the charge
which is ſo worthily executed by the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> at this day; and you
alſo underſtand the reaſons which have obliged my Maſter to make War
upon the <hi>Romanes;</hi> and that this is enough to authorize a digreſſion in
ſome meaſure, which poſſibly may have ſeemed too tedious. Now
whereas I have neglected to obſerve the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ference of times, you will not
wonder if I tell you, that the little <hi>Hannibal</hi> was now grown to be capable
of receiving ſome inſtructions, and that his excellent genius ſupplying
the defect of his age, he ſo well ſeconded the care of his Maſters, that he
gained the admiration of all the City. The Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> beheld theſe
fair beginnings with ſome pleaſure, and not wholly relying in the eſteem
of the people, who too forwardly admire any thing they find in perſons
raiſ'd above them, he deſign'd to educate the young <hi>Hannibal</hi> after a
clearly particular faſhion, and to lead him to the Army as into an Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Academy, where he might learn and practiſe the exerciſes which
ſhould be appointed him. Occaſion was not ſlow to preſent it ſelfe: for
the young Prince had ſcarce compleated his ninth year, when news was
brought to <hi>Carthage,</hi> that in <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Victones</hi> were revolted, and that
not content to refuſe the payment of the ordinary Tribute, they had
ſlain thoſe that were to exact it, and us'd all the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in the ſame
ſort, who had put themſelves into a poſture to maintain them. The Prince
<hi>Amilcar</hi> determined to go and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame theſe Rebels, and when all things
were in readineſs for this expedition; he would not ſet forth from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
till he had firſt rendred the Gods propitious. Wherefore he repaired
to the Temple to Sacrifice, and as he prayed to the Gods to protect the
intereſts of a juſt Dominion, and to give <hi>Carthage</hi> good ſucceſs in the
War which he undertook; At this word of War, the little <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
who had followed his Father, interrupted him, and by a young tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
which made him looſe all conſiderations: How? to the War? (ſaid
he with eagerneſs) I will go to it. <hi>Amilcar,</hi> notwithſtanding his attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at his prayers, was touched with this diſtraction, which appeared to
him as charming, as it was extraordinary, and thereupon calling to minde
the apparition of Queen <hi>Dido,</hi> with what ſhe had foretold of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and thinking on the loſs of a part of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the uſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pation of <hi>Sardinia</hi>
by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he conceived that it would give a ſtrong impreſſion of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60667:19"/>
hatred to his Son towards a people with whom he had in appearance made
a Peace, which he had very great cauſe to break. Whereupon he took the
hand of the little <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and cauſing him to lay it upon the Altar (as
all the world hath known ſince) <hi>Hannibal</hi> (ſaid he to him, will you ſwear
before the Immortal Gods to be an Enemy to the Romans who have taken
<hi>Scicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> from us? I will do it (anſwered <hi>Hannibal,</hi> with a
countenance beyond one of his age) and I ſwear by the great Gods,
(cryed he, turning his face towards the Altar) that I will be an enemy to
the <hi>Romanes</hi> to my laſt breath. <hi>Amilcar,</hi> after this Oath, and ſome prayers
which he made beſides, went forth of the Temple and retired to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
He was raviſhed with having ſeen in his <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſo fair tokens of
future greatneſs, and to injoy the pleaſure yet more, wherewith he could
not be ſatisfied, he cauſed him to be brought to him to conſider him atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.
But he was ſtrangely ſurpriſed, when he ſaw that ſadneſs had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from the viſage of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that young fierceneſs which was wont
to animate him, and obſerved a melancholly in it, of which he could not
have been capable of in the tenderneſs of his years. <hi>Amilcar</hi> careſſed the
little Prince, and demanded the cauſe of his diſcontent; to which he
urged him ſo preſſingly, that the generous youth anſwered him; Ah,
My Lord! I am an enemy to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and do not yet make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. <hi>Amilcar</hi> was tranſported with joy at theſe words, he kiſs'd his
dear <hi>Hannibal</hi> a thouſand times, and told him to comfort him, that he
was not yet in a condition to make War; that neither his Oath nor his
Honour did oblige him to an impoſſibility; and that he muſt expect
ſtrength from time to execute his generous deſigns. But, My Lord, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Hannibal</hi>) why do you delay to do it? I wait (replyed the Prince
<hi>Amilcar</hi> ſeriouſly) till the troubles of <hi>Spain</hi> be compoſed. After which
I intend to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> and I promiſe you to carry you thither. Soon
after the Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> performed what he had promiſed to the little
Prince; he lead him into <hi>Spain</hi> with him, to render him known and dear
to all the Troops which he commanded: and although the little <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
was yet uncapable to ſerve in Armies, and that ſome friends repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to his Father that that was not a fitting place to breed and frame
the manners of a young Prince; nevertheleſs, <hi>Amilcar</hi> liked better that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhould acquire an aire and deportment too free and fierce in an
Army, then to be accompliſht in the delicate politeneſs of <hi>Carthage:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
this conſideration which <hi>Amilcar</hi> had to render him wholly a Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
becauſe he knew him compleatly generous, the tenderneſs of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
love was ſo prevalent in this regard, that would not permit <hi>Amilcar</hi>
to be ſeparated from his dear Child, for whom he had an affection as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
as his hopes. I will not trouble you, My Lords, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the imbarkement of the Prince <hi>Amilcar,</hi> or his voyage, ſeeing he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Spain</hi> without any remarkable adventure: Nor will I detain you
with the converſations he took delight to make with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> &amp; the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
anſwers made therein by this little Prince; having ſo great matters to
rehearſe, that to avoid being extreamly prolix, I am conſtrained to paſs
over the pleaſant in ſilence. You ſhall onely know (continued <hi>Aſpar</hi>)
that the Prince <hi>Amilcar</hi> defeated the Rebell <hi>Victones,</hi> and reduced them
under the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> obedience; and likewiſe that he governed the
affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> in ſufficient peace during ſome years. It was about this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60667:19"/>
time that I was given to the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and at the ſame, that with
all the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> I admired the brave qualities of my Maſter. The
aſpect of this Prince began to ſeem very high, his eyes were filled with
a fire that may be truly termed Martial, his ſtature was comely, his geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
ſolid, although very active; but it may be juſtly ſaid, that all theſe
qualities gave place to the greatneſs of his courage, of which he gave ſo
glorious proofs, and his valour, although in the bloſſome was ſo much
admired, that <hi>Amilcar</hi> did not conſider him, but with greater tranſports
of joy then I am able to expreſs. For the <hi>Vectones</hi> having not continued
in their duty, but for want of power to quit it with ſtrength enough, had
alwaies in their hearts the ſeeds of Rebellion: and as people which are
tainted with this kind of malady; are like ordinary ſick perſons, who ſeek
reſt by toſſing up and down; ſo the <hi>Vectones</hi> ſtirr'd again, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they did in effect loſe that quiet by their revolts which they
imagined they ſhould obtain. Advertiſement was given <hi>Amilcar,</hi> that
within three or four principal Cities they had began to proclaim Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and being this word is apt to touch the hearts of people, and that
example is very powerful in this ſort of conjunctures, eighteen or twenty
of the beſt Cities of <hi>Spain</hi> did the ſame thing; ſo that in a ſhort while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Amilcar</hi> ſaw an Army of forty thouſand men upon him. Wherefore
the Prince took the Campagne with all the forces he could aſſemble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
not to give the enemies time to underſtand their own and increaſe
them, but reſolved forthwith to preſent them battel. It was in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
where <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſignaliz'd himſelf by a hundred gallant actions which
he performed at the Head of the Volunteirs. But I ſhould never come
to an end, if I ſhould reckon up all the places where he fought. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be brief, I muſt aſſure you that he fought every where, where his
preſence was neceſſary; and that whereſoever he fought, he animated his
party both by his voice and by his example, and beat down all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that made head againſt him. At length the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> put the
Rebels to ſlight, after he had ſlain fifteen thouſand of them. I ſay the
Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> My Lords, ſince it is certain that he carried this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by his conduct, and by his great courage. The Rebels rallied again,
and fought ſeveral times after, but the advantage continued alwaies intire
with us. During this war it may be ſaid, that my Maſter began to diſcover
thoſe fair accompliſhments and habitudes which now fill the mouthes of
the whole world. He never thought upon himſelfe till he had put every
thing elſe in order; he neither eat nor ſlept, but when time and the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of affairs permitted him: he oftentimes lay in the Corps du Guard,
but that which hath been obſerved for the moſt generous and ſingular in
this Prince, is, that in this War, and in all others, as without doubt you all
know, My Lords, he hath been alwaies the firſt to charge, and the laſt to
make the retreat. But, My Lords, I come at length to give you an account
of that bloody battel of <hi>Caſtel-alto,</hi> where the <hi>Vectones</hi> were abſolutely
defeated: but, alas! where we finiſh'd the Victory with the loſs of the
great <hi>Amilcar:</hi> This Prince not being able to ſuffer that <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhould
be expoſed to ſo great dangers, ruſh'd forward to partake with him who
was figting on all ſides; and after he had performed all that a valiant
man, and of an age leſs declining could have done, he was diſpatch'd with
three or four wounds which he received at the ſame inſtant, and could
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60667:20"/>
utter onely theſe words; Ah, <hi>Hannibal!</hi> I leave thee in danger! My Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
who had never caſt eye upon his enemies but to beat them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſound of this voice, turned his head, and ſeeing the great <hi>Amil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ar</hi>
fall under the Horſes feet, whom he loved and honoured infinitely, he
caſt himſelfe upon the ground to embrace him, and perceiving that he
was dead, he uttered all the reſenting words that tenderneſs could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
a Son with, and afterwards betook himſelfe to do all that rage could
enforce to, when in its greateſt extent. For having cauſed the body of
<hi>Amilcar</hi> to be carried to the Camp, and being become more terrible, and
cover'd all over with blood, he remounted his Horſe, and ſoon carried
terror and death to every place, where he diſcharged his dreadful blowes.
It is impoſſible, My Lords, to repreſent unto you, all that he did in this
fury; it is enough to let you know, that never any enraged Lion in our
<hi>Africa</hi> did ſo much as our provoked Prince did in this occaſion. At length
our enemies were cut in pieces, and the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
nothing that a man reſolved to periſh could attempt, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
but lightly wounded in three places of his body. After this general
defeat of the <hi>Vectones,</hi> which coſt us ſo dear, my Maſter cauſed the body
of <hi>Amilcar</hi> to be interred, with all the military pomp that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
But the tears of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were more glorious to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Prince, then any ceremony whatſoever; and 'tis credible this death
did ſo ſenſible touch our Souldiers, that it might have been conceived by
our Army, that the loſs of <hi>Carthage</hi> was involv'd in that of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> if
that Prince had not repaired it in leaving us the great <hi>Hannibal.</hi> For all the
Commanders and Souldiers remarked in my Maſter all the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> and had then ſaluted him General, if at <hi>Carthage</hi> it
had not been deemed convenient to make a kind of inter-raign by putting
the ſoveraign authority into the hands of the Prince <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> who was
Brother-in-law to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by marrying the Princeſs <hi>Magarisbe:</hi> for my
Maſter was look't upon as too young to manage the affairs of our Empire
You know without doubt, My Lords, that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> was ſlain three years
after his advancement, and that the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> was declared Prince,
of the Republick of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and Generalliſſimo of all its Armies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the canvaſings of <hi>Hanno,</hi> who was head of a contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
My Maſter was no ſooner raiſed to this great dignity, but he framed
a deſign not leſs noble and eminent, then the condition he was in, for not
contenting himſelf to go into <hi>Sicily</hi> or <hi>Sardinia</hi> to recover them, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to carry the War into <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; gain a conqueſt worthy of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in marching againſt the proud <hi>Rome.</hi> But being of a deep entendment,
he would not enterpriſe this War but upon reaſonable grounds, becauſe
his late Brother-in-law <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> had alſo made an alliance with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
of which the principal Article was, that the River <hi>Iberus</hi> ſhould
part both the Empires, and that the <hi>Saguntines</hi> ſhould be Neuters. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
to the end he might be better ſerved by his Souldiers, and not incur
the hatred of the people, made it evident that he had cauſe to complain of
the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> who had joyned themſelves to the intereſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what had been agreed, and drew forth his Army to march againſt
the <hi>Sag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ntines,</hi> declaring it his purpoſe rather to revenge the outrage,
then to poſſeſs himſelfe of the Territories of another: he ſaw notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that <hi>Rome</hi> would declare her ſelfe for a people that had declared
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60667:20"/>
for her, and that ſo the Romanes appearing invaders of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
he might repreſent them odious to the Nations which ſhould be infeſted
with this War, and might fight his Enemies with the aid and aſſiſtance
of ſeveral people, who would look upon him as a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ince injuſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued.
But in the firſt place, before he ſet upon the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
againſt the <hi>Olcades,</hi> who are ſcituated on this ſide the River <hi>Iberus.</hi>
I ſhall not recite you the particular adventures of this War; but onely
tell you, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> in four moneths conquered this Province, and
took the rich City <hi>Carteia,</hi> which was the Metropolis of it. From <hi>Carteia</hi>
he went to take up his winter quarters at New <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all the Commanders and Souldiers of his Army, commending the
vivacity and greatneſs of their courage; and thereupon making a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to them of all the ſpoiles, he yet more ſatisfied them then by all his
Elogiums. As ſoon as the Sun by his approaches began to chaſe away the
cold, which is wont to incommodate Armies: <hi>Hannibal</hi> took the field,
and cauſed his to march againſt the <hi>Vacceans.</hi> This Prince was too valiant
to meet with any great reſiſtance; ſo that he overcame the <hi>Vacceans,</hi> be
ſieged and took the great Cities of <hi>Hermandica</hi> and <hi>Arbacala;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo good ſucceſs, attaqued alſo the <hi>Carpen aines;</hi> But it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pains that my Maſter a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chiev'd this laſt enterpriſe; for their Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which conſiſted of a hundred thouſand men, was yet extreamly ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Souldiers, which were ſav'd of the <hi>Olcades,</hi> and by very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others which had fled from <hi>Hermandica</hi> and <hi>Arbacala.</hi> The Prince
<hi>Hannibal</hi> intended to refreſh and recruit his Army which was weakned
by ſeveral battels, and the Gariſons which he was inforced to draw out
of it: whereupon he deſigned to divide this Victory between his wit
and his courage; For making ſemblance to avoid the encounter, he paſſed
the <hi>Tagus</hi> unawares to the <hi>Carpentaines</hi> who were aſleep; and ſo well
managed his affairs, that about break of day the Enemies perceiving
our fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght, caſt themſelves immediately into the <hi>Tagus</hi> all in diſorder,
to purſue the Troops which ſeemed to fear them, and not to loſe this
occaſion of beating the great <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But if they deceived themſelves,
when they judged we had taken flight to avoid the combate, they did ſo
much more, when they believed themſelves able to overcome the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Prince of <hi>Carthage.</hi> For, my valiant Maſter no ſooner obſerved
the <hi>Carpentains</hi> diſorderly fording the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> but he placed forty
Elephants upon the bank to cruſh ſuch as ſhould endeavour to gain it:
after which he entered into the <hi>Tagus</hi> at the head of all his Cavalry, and
ſuddenly dyed the waters with the blood of his enemies: He beat down
and trampled on every thing that oppoſed him, and ſhewed that he was
not leſs invincible in this kind of field then in the ordinary. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to have one more ſolid, he gained the other bank of the River; and
there it was that he performed actions wholly miraculous, for he ſlew
the General of the Enemies, and at length compleated the intire over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the <hi>Carpentains,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Tagus</hi> wafted with its waters, the
firſt effects of his valour, and firſt marks of his Victory. Upon ſo many
glorious ſucceſſes, the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaw himſelfe abſolute. Maſter of
all that part of <hi>Spain</hi> which is on this ſide of <hi>Iberus,</hi> except the ſtrong
City of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> and that which belonged to their Juriſdiction:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60667:21"/>
wherefore he reſolved no longer to defer the ſiege of this City, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
his victorious Army towards it, he cauſed a Line and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rench
to be drawn about it. He determined to ſtorm this City in three places,
and accordingly appointed Quarters. My Maſter himſelfe would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
on that ſide of the plain where the walls were weakeſt, becauſe
he knew that all the choiſe of the youth of <hi>Saguntnm</hi> would be placed
to fight there, being commanded by valiant perſons, who had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the City, &amp; as the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> preferres the fighting at
hand blowes before all other; he hoped they would make ſallies out
at his place; and alſo that having more eaſily made a breach in the walls
which were not regularly fortified, nor flanked but upon one ſide with
a great Tower, he might ſoon obtain his enterpriſe by entering into the
City. <hi>Maharbal,</hi> Son of <hi>Himilcon,</hi> firſt Lieutenant-General, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that ſide which was next the Sea: for you know, My Lords, that
<hi>Saguntum</hi> is not very remote from it, and that the <hi>Saguntines</hi> who came
from the Iſland of <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> being mingled with the people deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>Rutilians,</hi> choſe this ſcituation as the faireſt and moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
that could be deſired, wherein he built a City. If I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſpeak a few words on this ſubject, I ſhall tell you, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum</hi>
was become extreamly puiſſant in a ſhort time: for if on one
ſide it had a moſt fertile plain, and of great extent; on the other ſide the
Sea ſupplyed it every day with new riches; beſides, that this Town af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
its eſtabliſhment, drew all the good Houſes of the Vicinage to it,
who were glad to go live with a people which had the reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well governed, and the urbanity of whoſe manners was according
to fame, in very great eſteem. But I muſt reaſſume my ſtory, and tell
you, that <hi>Anno</hi> ſecond Lieutenant-Generall, and <hi>Attaines</hi> King of the
<hi>Turdetaines,</hi> commanded the third quarter, which was on the ſide of the
mountain which ſeparates <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Celtiberians;</hi> and that we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by ſome Priſoners we took, that <hi>Lucius,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Celtibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
had put himſelfe into <hi>Saguntum</hi> with ſome Troops. We alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
learn'd, that there was entered into it a young <hi>Roman</hi> of great
quality, and very much courage, whom we were told was <hi>Regulus.</hi> I
ſhall not need to tell you that <hi>Lucius</hi> commanded the Quarter, which
my Maſter was to attaque; that the Prince of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> who was Prince
of the Senate of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> was to oppoſe <hi>Maharbal;</hi> and that <hi>Regulus</hi>
his command was to reſiſt <hi>Anno.</hi> If you pleaſe, all but the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which concern my Maſter ſhall be omitted, ſince it is his life that I
am recounting to you; and I conceive that it ſuffices to tell you, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the length of the ſiege, <hi>Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Anno</hi> fought very valiantly,
and with ſucceſs as various. Sometimes there was a breach made in the
walls of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> and the Citizens were cloſely aſſaulted; but ſoon
after, the <hi>Saguntines</hi> having repaired their walls, iſſued forth with great
alacrity and bravery, and attempted even to burn the Engines of the
<hi>Carthagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ans,</hi> after they had alſo beat them back to their Trenches.
But all theſe efforts were nothing to thoſe which paſſed between the
great <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the valiant <hi>Lucius;</hi> for I believe, never was any
Quarter ſeen either more boldly aſſaulted, or more vigorouſly defended.
My Maſter conceived much choler to find this reſiſtence; and to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60667:21"/>
end he might mate the <hi>Saguntines</hi> even in their own City, he cauſed a
prodigous Mactrine to be framed, which might over-power all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> &amp; which was to be impelled againſt the walles. While
this moveable Tower was finiſhing, the Prince <hi>Lucius</hi> ſallied forth in the
Head of five or ſix thouſand men, and came to defie my Maſter with
a confidence very warlike. The herce <hi>Carthaginian</hi> preſently put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Head of a number of his own, which was within a little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to that which <hi>Lucius</hi> had; and theſe two generous Princes ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a combate with ſuch valour, that their Troops remained almoſt
unmovable to regard them with attention. <hi>Hannibal!</hi> (cryed the
Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi>) you muſt either periſh or make <hi>Lucius</hi> periſh, to
facilitate the winning of <hi>Saguntum.</hi> I do not find much appearance of
the former (anſwered the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> fiercely) and my ſword
ſhall ſoon declare the reſt. They were too eager to continue longer, and
loſe the time they meant to imploy in fighting and victory. The Speares
which they made uſe of in the firſt brunt, were immediately broken in
a thouſand pieces, and their Horſes, although very ſtrong and robuſt,
were ſcarce able to hold up the firſt charge; that of the Prince <hi>Lucius</hi>
was a horſe of <hi>Lucitania,</hi> and that of my Maſter of <hi>Carthage.</hi> The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the <hi>Celtiberian</hi> Prince was indeed remarkable, but it was not
wholly equal to that of my Maſter; for after their mutual reſiſtance had
dured ſome time, <hi>Hannibal</hi> hurt <hi>Lucius</hi> in the right arme, avoiding all
his blows with an admirable addreſs. Nevertheleſs, the Prince of <hi>Celti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi>
who had deſigned to periſh or conquer, and ſpoke accordingly at
the beginning of the encounter, dealt his enemy ſo great a ſtroke that it
pierced his thigh, and even nailed it, as I may ſay, to the bow of his
ſaddle, wherein the ſword of the <hi>Celtiberian</hi> remained fixt, the Prince
not having force to draw it forth; for at the ſame moment, my Maſter
gave him ſuch a thruſt with ſo great adreſs, that his ſword meeting with
the defect of his cuirace, was ſheathed in the body of the Prince of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiberia,</hi>
and was alſo faſtned there either by the cloſure of his armes, or
the force of the paſs, that my Maſter abandoned it, being not willing to
loſe time in drawing it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orth. But on the other ſide, encouraging his
Horſe with his voice and his ſpur, he embraced his enemy, and ſhook
him ſo rudely, that he cauſed him at length to tumble between the feet
of the Horſes, where preſently there were ſeen iſſuing from him two or
three rivulets of blood. Upon this ill fortune of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the <hi>Saguntines</hi>
and <hi>Celtiberians</hi> aſſailed the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> vigorouſly; and either party
having put themſelves in order for the ready ſuccour of their Prince,
there immediately began a moſt bloody encounter. You wonder, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
My Lords, how theſe Troops could continue in ſight thus with
fighting; but your wonder will ceaſe, when you know that <hi>Lucius</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we learnt of a <hi>Saguntine</hi> priſoner) had promiſed that day the
Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> daughter to the Prince of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> to fight with
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> and that to ſhew that it was he that combated the Prince of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> he had prohibited all his Troops to ſet upon thoſe of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and injoyned them to be contented with defending themſelves in this
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>caſion. My generous Maſter had no ſooner obſerved the countenance
of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and that of the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> but in a manner he judged of their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60667:22"/>
deſign; and therefore giving order to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> little different
from that of <hi>Lucius,</hi> he began the fight which I have related to you. This
particularity, which was perhaps hitherto unknown to you, is not the
onely one of remark in this adventure; but that which was ſomewhat
more extraordinary was, that the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> bore away the ſword
of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the guard of which was enriched with Rubies, as that of my
Maſter, which <hi>Lucius</hi> carried with him, had the guard covered with
Diamonds. In the Camp and the City the wounds of theſe two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Princes were ſo reſented, that in a manner there was nothing done
during two moneths, and <hi>Saguntum</hi> was rather incloſed then beſieged:
not but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did continually labour againſt the wall with the
moveable Towre I ſpoke of, or in preparing battering Rams, and all
kind or Engines neceſſary to batter a City. The <hi>Saguntines</hi> on their part,
forgot not to repair their walls, and alſo to forge a ſort of weapon which
I had never till then heard of. For they invented a kind of Dart, which
they termed <hi>Falarick,</hi> the Spear of which was ſquare like that of a Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;
but that which was moſt admirable, was, that they covered the
point of the <hi>Falarick</hi> with certain Materials extreamly combuſtible; to
which they gave fire when they caſt them forth, whereby the motion
augmenting it into flame, they almoſt burnt all the Engines on which
the fire could lay hold. But this is not all the power of a <hi>Falarick,</hi> for
the Spear of it being three feet in length, it eaſily pierced the armes and
bodies of the Souldiers, and did not leſs amuſe them when it lighted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their bucklers: for the fire ſeiſed on them in ſuch ſort, that the
ſouldiers were inforced to quit them: and they did not onely in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
remain expoſed to the blows of their enemies, but likewiſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
terrour in their companions. After theſe two moneths were paſt, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which there was nothing but ſome ſlight on-ſets made, <hi>Hannibal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be in a ſtate to mount his Horſe: wherefore he reſolved to preſs
the City vigorouſly, and cauſed a rowling Tower which was new made
to be advanced againſt the walls, placing in the higheſt ſtory thereof Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapults
and Baliſts, and began to fight the <hi>Saguntines</hi> in their own City,
and ſhewed them a dreadful fortreſs which over-aw'd all their fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The <hi>Saguntines</hi> were aſtoniſhed at the ſight of this formidable
Machine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that not daring to appear upon the walls, they afforded time
to the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> to execute his enterpriſe. For he ſent five hundred
<hi>Africans</hi> with Pix-axes and Matocks to demoliſh a pane of old wall
which was not built with lime, but onely cemented with a kind of morter
made of earth. At the ſame time advertiſement was given my Maſter of
two Ambaſſadours which were coming to him from <hi>Rome. Hannibal</hi>
immediately ſent ſome perſons to the Sea-ſhore, there to attend their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
and to denounce to them not to hazard themſelves to paſs into the
Camp of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> for perhaps it would be dangerous for them,
ſince they were to traverſe a Country which was univerſally in combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
This is the naked verity of this affair, although ſome have preſumed
to ſay that my Maſter gave them audience. Nevertheleſs it is true, that
however the buſineſs was carried, the Romane Ambaſſadors had no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and were conſtrained to go to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
to endeavour to ſpeed better there. In the mean time, my Maſter,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60667:22"/>
who would loſe no time, cauſed his Rams to be drawn againſt another
pane of the wall, and batter'd it in ſuch manner, that it fell at length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſame time that the five hundred <hi>Africans</hi> beat down theirs.
Then the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſeeing the City open, ſhouted forth with ſo great
a cry as might have ſtruck dread and terrour into the <hi>Saguntines.</hi> But it
muſt be confeſſed that they fought with greater valour then before: and
I know not whether diſpair augmented their courage, or neceſſity cauſed
them to imploy their utmoſt powers; but however it were, I aſſure you
they did things beyond belief. <hi>Lucius,</hi> although yet feeble, appeared in
the head of them; <hi>Regulus</hi> haſtned to his aid; and theſe two valiant
perſons beating down the ruines of the walls and houſes, performed ſuch
gallant actions, as it may be thought that never in the like occaſions was
ground diſputed with more generoſity. But at laſt the <hi>Saguntines</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that their efforts did but defer the taking of their City without
being able to hinder it, they took ſo ſtrange a reſolution, that all Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will be aſtoniſh'd at it: For they ſeparated themſelves into two Troops,
whereof one did ſtill make ſome reſiſtance to my Maſter, while the other
repair'd to the great Court of the Palace, to prepare a great pile of wood
wherewith to burn whatſoever was precious in <hi>Saguntine.</hi> Theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men carried on their reſolution yet further, and not content to burn
their richeſt movables, they caſt themſelves into the fire, being driven
either out of exceſſive generoſity, or extream diſpair. This rage of the
<hi>Saguntines</hi> (if I may ſo call the paſſion which animated them) increaſed
that of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who ſaw themſelves deprived of the booty
which they had hoped; but it increaſed it in ſuch ſort, that never was
there ſeen ſo great a deſolation in a like rancounter. The Prince <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
was conſtrained during three or four hours, to behold many exceſſes,
which he could not hinder, but at length after he had put ſome order in
the City, he advanced to the Palace, whoſe Gates were thrown down,
whereby many <hi>Carthaginians</hi> crouded in. But ſcarce had they made a
few paces in the firſt hall, but there was preſented two Priſoners of a very
noble aſpect, which it was ſaid were <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Regulus. Hannibal</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
cauſed the Souldiers which environed them to retire; and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> attentively, he asked him what he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from an enemy whoſe life he had attempted, and who by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of War had now an abſolute power over his? I expect (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the generous Prince) with ſufficient indifferency, any thing that
can poſſibly befall me; &amp; without pretending to a favourable treatment,
I conceive I have deſerved death, in that I have not given it to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer
of <hi>Saguntum.</hi> Nevertheleſs (added he) if I may be permitted to
make one requeſt after this free confeſſion, I ſhould preſume. O <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
to beſeech your care of the fair Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> and not to ſuffer a
perſon wholly adorable to be treated without reſpect. She is in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
under the guard of an Officer whom I heard called by the name of
<hi>Magar,</hi> and whither ſhe was conducted by me, after I had reſtrained
her from the death ſhe would have inflicted upon her ſelfe. Behold all
that I requeſt (continued he) to dye intirely ſatisfied, as indeed I ſhall
do, if I learn before hand that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is not leſs generous toward the
Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> then he hath been valiant againſt the <hi>Saguntines,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60667:23"/>
and againſt a Prince who tenderly lov'd that poor people, My Maſter,
who is of a haughty humour, had much regret to ſuffer the former
words of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and not being able to conceive that ſuch language
ought to be uſed before <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he was at the point of falling upon
the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia.</hi> But this Illuſtrious <hi>Carthaginian</hi> moderated his
choler, to which his temper ſo much diſpoſed him by his generoſity, and
conſidering the young Prince, unfortunate, a priſoner, and withall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
he eſteemed him the more for it, and would not condemn in <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
ſuch ſentiments as ought to be generally approved. Moreover, he
knew that a Prince who was deſtinated to a Throne, ought never to act
otherwiſe then nobly; and that ſince <hi>Lucius</hi> gave markes of his great
courage even in his bad fortune, it was fitting to preſerve him to raign
one day in <hi>Celtiberia</hi> as a Prince truly worthy to govern ſo Warlike a
Nation. Whereupon after a little muſing, he was about to ſpeak to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
and <hi>Regulu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> but obſerving ſuddenly that they were all covered with
blood, and wounded in three or four places, he was ſenſibly touched
with it, and ſo putting them under the guard of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>herbal,</hi> he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that a particular care ſhould be had of them. Scarce had my Maſter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this Order to <hi>Adherbal,</hi> but <hi>Magar</hi> came to tell him that he had ſeven
or eight fair priſoners in a Chamber, where he had left the Captain of
the Guard to the King of the <hi>Turdetanes;</hi> but that amongſt thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
there was the faireſt perſon that ever eye beheld, and that ſhe was
ſaid to be the daughter of the Prince of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> prefect of <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
who was miſerably ſlain. Beſides (added he, with a tranſport which
he could not contain) I have ſeen this admirable Perſon; but I dare aſſure
you, My Lord, that I never ſaw any thing ſo fair, and that I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
even our fair Princeſs <hi>Saphoniſba.</hi> After this advantageous relation of
<hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Magar,</hi> the prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> intended to go to the Chamber
where the fair princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> was, to endeavour to adminiſter ſome
conſolation to the mis-fortunes he had cauſed. But ſcarce had the Guard
opened the door, but my Maſter was ſurpriſed when he ſaw the
Chamber ſo ſplendidly beſet, and underſtood that the King of the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detanes</hi>
had ſent his Guards to the Palace, as ſoon as <hi>Saguntum</hi> was taken
to ſecure the retreat of the fair <hi>Thomira</hi> from the inſolence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.
The prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> advanced a few ſteps in the Chamber;
but as ſoon as the priſoner-Ladies learnt who he was, the principal of
them came to caſt themſelves at his feet. My Maſter ſoon put himſelfe
to the trouble of raiſing them up, and perceiving the tears of theſe fair
Captives, he reſented (at leaſt as he told us afterwards) I know not
what agreeable emotion, which made him find more ſweetneſs in the
winning of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> then he had taſted in all his Victories. It is true,
this thought was of no long continuance; for caſting his eyes to the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,
on which the princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> was, he became as it were immoveable by
a ſudden aſtoniſhment, or by I know not what kind of extaſie which
ſeiſed upon him. This bed was covered with a pavillion of cloath of
Gold and ſilke, the colour of which was extreamly glittering, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to that of fire: but <hi>Thomira</hi> ſo powerfully drew the eyes of
the ſtanders by upon her ſelfe, that they could not be diverted to the
regarding of the richneſs of this Furniture. This fair princeſs was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60667:23"/>
laid upon the bed; and if we could conjecture that her ſtature was
comely, her countenance, which we ſaw without obſtacle, appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more lovely. Her colour was extreamly clear and delicate,
her hair as black as Ebenie, her eyes large and well faſhioned, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and of the colour of her Hair: and although <hi>Thomira</hi> held them
open, yet thy ſeemed to have their ſight retired into themſelves, either
by reaſon of a profound ſadneſs, or that they might behold nothing,
becauſe they could not ſee any thing but objects of ſorrow. If tears did
not fall from theſe fair eyes, no more did ſighes break forth of the fair
mouth of <hi>Thomira;</hi> but this afflicted beauty diſdained both ſighes and
teares, as Tokens too conformable to vulgar ſorrow. Beſides, theſe
Graces which I have mentioned in brief, chance contribute ſomething
to augment her comlineſs, as if it had been deſigned my Maſter ſhould
ſee it in its perfection; there was ſo agreeable a reflection of the colour
of the Pavillion, and the Pillow on which ſhe ſupported her ſelfe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the cheeks of this fair princeſs, that it ſeemed as if they received by
an innocent lone, a vivacity which they could not have naturally in the
condition this afflicted fair was in. In a word, this admirable beauty of
<hi>Thomira</hi> was not that vvhich moved moſt reſentment; but there vvas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
upon the divine countenance of a princeſs, of ſixteen or ſeventeen
years, ſo languiſhing an air, and ſo ſweet and charming a ſadneſs, that
all the hearts of the beholders were melted with the ſpectacle, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with a compaſſion more ſtrong and unquiet then is ordinarily felt
in caſes of moving pitty! Nevertheleſs we ſoon remarked the difference
between the deportment of my Maſter towards this charming object,
and the attention of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> which followed their Prince. For
the illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi> fixed his view ſo firmly upon the countenance
of the Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> that he was not able to turn it aſide; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was ſeveral times advertiſed of ſome ſmall diſorders amongſt
the Souldiers which his preſence might quiet, yet he could never reſolve
to leave the room, but anſwering as briefly as he could, he remitted all
affairs to <hi>Maharbal.</hi> But ſoon after notice was brought him, that <hi>Regulus</hi>
would not ſuffer his wounds to be ſearch'd, and proteſted confidently
that the Son of the unfortunate <hi>Atilius</hi> lik'd better to dye, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his cure from <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Chyrurgions. Let others be appointed
then to do it (anſwered the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi>) and as he who ſpoke to
him was exaggerating the averſion which that Roman had againſt all
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> my Maſter commanded him ſilence in a way ſufficiently
rough, and gave us to know, that he conſidered all theſe informations
and diſcourſes but as troubleſome diſtractions.</p>
                  <p>But he failed not ſpeedily to redouble his attention in beholding the fair
Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> as if he would repair the loſs of ſome moments which
believed he had miſployed: and this great man ſeemed ſo touched with
conſidering this lovly-ſorrowful, that we perceived an alteration both
in his countenance and geſture. His fierce aire became ſweetned by little
and little, and he found himſelfe inclinable to ſigh; by which markes of
his compaſſion, I obſerved that great ſouls are liable to the ſofter and
more tranquil paſſions. This Prince, as an evidence of his tenderneſs and
reſpect, durſt not ſpeak to the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon:</hi> and although he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60667:24"/>
any other tongue as well as his own, incapable to ſufficiently
expreſs his ſentiments, yet he found himſelfe conſtrained to requeſt one
of the <hi>Saguntine</hi> Ladies to comfort the Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
her in his name, that ſhe ſhould be treated with all poſsible reſpect.
This Lady diſcharged her commiſſion with joy, and being approached
to the afflicted Princeſs, told her all that ſhe thought effectual to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and calm her ſorrowes: Madam (ſaid ſhe, endeavouring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all her inward grief, by appearing a little ſatisfied) our miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
are not in that extremity which you believe, and the Prince which
hath cauſed them, hath the generoſity to mitigate them, and make us
hope much more then we durſt pretend to in the unhappy eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
he had reduced us. Do not conceive, Madam (added ſhe) that I
flatter my ſelfe in my miſery; the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> commanded me him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ſpeak to you in this manner; and for that he does not aſſure you
ſo much by his own mouth, it is becauſe in the condition wherein he ſees
you, he believes that you cannot hear it, not receive agreeably that which
he would offer unto you. Great Gods! Is <hi>Hannibal</hi> then in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
(cryed the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi>) Yes, Madam, anſwer'd my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he is; but it is to offer you all the honours and reſpects which are
due to perſons of an extraordinary merit. O Gods! (reply'd <hi>Thomira</hi>)
after which ſhe turned her face toward the contrary ſide, to avoid the
danger of ſeeing the perſon who had made her miſerable. <hi>Hannibal</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that his preſence might further augment the inquietude of
this fair perſon, with great reluctancy he went out of the Chamber,
having firſt commanded <hi>Magar</hi> to take care of the ſervice of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>
with much reſpect, and that all the Priſoner-Ladies might receive
civil treatment. But at the ſame time that my Maſter would leave <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>
to avoid inquieting her, the Idea of this afflicted Fair, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
him in ſo ſtrange a manner, that it was a great aggravation to it,
that he could not preciſely judge whether his inquietudes were really
pleaſing or perplexing. Whence comes it (ſaid he within himſelfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had given neceſſary Orders for the Troops and the City, and was
retired into a Chamber prepared for him) whence comes it (ſaid the
Prince) that I feel certain agitations which I never reſented hitherto?
whence comes it that the ſight of a few priſoners hath cauſed in me I
know not what kind of emotion which pleaſes me, and yet is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
altogether? Is it, for that I was not prepared to ſee things
not ordinary in the taking of Cities? Haſt thou not ſeen, O <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
the fair priſoners of <hi>Carteia, Hermandica</hi> and <hi>Herbacate,</hi> and many other
brave Towns which thou haſt reduced by thy arms? ſhall not thou ſee
the like in <hi>Italy?</hi> and doſt thou not intend alſo to ſee of them at <hi>Rome?</hi>
and this <hi>Hannibal</hi> who hath contrived the greateſt deſign that can fall
within humane invention; this <hi>Hannibal</hi> who is reſolved to attaque that
proud City, whoſe ambition is to paſs for the Queen and ſubduer of all
Nations; this <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who will either periſh or render himſelfe Maſter
of the world, is it fit for him to be touch'd with certain ſmall occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which have nothing of ſurpriſing or rare in them? No, no, <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
thou oughteſt not to be touched with them; it is enough that thou
ſheweſt ſome teſtimonies of compaſſion to the perſons whom thy Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60667:24"/>
make unhappy; but thou oughteſt not to expreſs an abject tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which is unworthy the heart and glory of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> This Prince
believed that he had taken a reſolution ſufficiently ſtrong to paſs away the
night with quiet; but after ſome moments of repoſe, the Idea of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>
returned into his imagination; but the Idea of <hi>Thomira</hi> perfectly
fair, afflicted, and that by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> This cauſed tender ſentiments to
ſucceed in my Maſters breaſt to thoſe former ſevere ones, &amp; repreſenting
to himſelf the princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> in the condition he had ſeen her, he
obſerved ſo many charmes in her eyes and countenance, together with a
languour ſo affecting, that the Prince had inſtantly certain tranſports,
whoſe nature he did not underſtand. But as this great man hath a ſtrong
ſoul, his mind would confirm it ſelfe againſt theſe ſorts of attaques,
which notwithſtanding were ſometimes not otherwiſe then pleaſing:
he believed that he did not well ſupport the glory of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when
he found himſelf of ſentiments which he judged not heroick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavoured to chaſe the Idea of <hi>Thomira</hi> out of his mind, &amp; extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
thoſe thoughts which ſeemed moſt conformable to his inclination.
Wherepon he repaſſed in his memory all the eminent adventures he ever
had atchiev'd, and gave himſelfe to think upon whatever glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
he had made; and conceiving theſe thoughts more generous then
thoſe concerning of <hi>Thomira,</hi> he filled his imagination with nothing but
battles, taking of Cities, Victories, and great exploits. Now it is (ſaid
he) that I acknowledge my ſelfe to be truly <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and I am no
longer that weak <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> that could think upon nothing elſe but
a diſtreſſed Damſel. Yes, <hi>Thomira</hi> (purſued he) <hi>Hannibal</hi> thinks no more
of you, he hath driven away that impertinence which began to tickle
him, and his mind is now ſtrong enough to reſiſt all your attaques. But
what ſaiſt thou, O <hi>Hannibal</hi> (reſumed he ſoon after) thou ſpeakeſt of
reſiſting the attaques of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and doſt thou not know that that
young Princeſs is in a condition rather to receive ſuccour from all the
world, then to hurt any whatſoever? What is that which blinds thee,
O <hi>Hannibal?</hi> is it that thou beliveſt there is any glory to be gain'd in
chaſing from thy imagination the Idea of a Princeſs who is abſolutely
fair and ſweet? and of a Princeſs, who inſtead of attaquing thee, is upon
the point of being cruſhed with the violence of thoſe ſorrows which
thou cauſeſt her? No, no, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> there would be as great inhumanity
in indeavouring to reſiſt ſuch attaques, as there would be weakneſs not
to reſiſt in a combate: therefore reſume that compaſſion which thou
termeſt weakneſs; and permit that gentle motion to act to its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
nor conſtrain thy ſelfe to preſcribe it bounds, which would not be
leſs condemnable then the exceſſes of other paſsions. Theſe various and
contrary thoughts, which ſeemed to deſtroy one another, poſſeſſed the
Prince during part of the night; after which he ſlept peaceably enough,
and for ſome hours injoyed a repoſe which the agitations that preceded
it, made him find more ſweet and comfortable. On the next morning,
aſſoon as the Prince was in a condition to be ſeen, he was viſited by
all the principal Officers of his Army: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>nibal received them very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
and had power enough over himſelf to ſhew them an air of his
countenance open and ſmiling. Nevertheleſs their preſence raiſed in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60667:25"/>
him a ſecret ſhame, when he recollected that a Prince who commanded
ſo many brave men, had during almoſt the whole night been engaged in
a combate of a very ſtrange nature, from which he knew not juſtly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was come off conqueror or worſted. But he was careful enough
to diſguiſe the diſcontentment he conceived for it, and ſpoke to <hi>Mahar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,
Hanno,</hi> and three or four other conſiderable <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who were
alſo in his Chamber, almoſt in the ſame manner he was uſed to do. He
informed himſelf of the health of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and of that of <hi>Regulus;</hi> and he
even adventured to demand the news of the Prince of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> without
fearing to give intimation of the great intereſt he had therein. My Lord, as
for this laſt (anſwered <hi>Maharbal</hi>) it could never be known exactly what is
come of him: ſome ſay that he caſt himſelf into the fire, to avoid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
under the power of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> but others on the contrary,
that he drew near the Pile, but could not be afterwards ſeen whether he
betook himſelf. For the wounds of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi> (continued he)
they are not at all dangerous: your Chyrurgions have very particular
care of the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Attanes</hi> have of the Roman
Prince, who would not owe his cure to <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But <hi>Regulus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
yet higher (added he) for he will not ſo much as treat for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and chooſe rather to dye a priſoner, then
to receive liberty from any one of a people, to whom he declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
even in his preſent condition, that he is an irreconcilable enemy.
He hath won to him one of his Guards, and ſent him to the King of the
<hi>Turdetanes,</hi> to beſeech you to take ſome courſe that he may be given to
him, offering him a Ranſome very conſiderable, as I have learnt from
the Meſſenger, who would not diſcharge this commiſſion without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing
me of it, and therefore came to inform me of all that concerns
the negotiation, and of the favourable anſwer of <hi>Attanes.</hi> Scarce had
<hi>Maharbal</hi> pronounced theſe laſt words, but the King of the <hi>Turdelanes,</hi>
of whom the diſcourſe was, entred into the Chamber of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> The
Prince of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> went five or ſix ſteps towards him to receive
him, and obſerved in his countenance very many tokens of trouble and
diſcontentmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. After the firſt words of Civility were over. <hi>Hannibal</hi>
obligingly demanded of the King of the <hi>Turdetanes,</hi> the cauſe of that ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which appeared in his looks; and <hi>Attanes</hi> having ſignified that he
would reveal it in private, <hi>Hannibal</hi> and he removed toward a large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the Room; My Lord (ſaid <hi>Attanes</hi>) I have a favour to requeſt
of you; but I have alſo juſt cauſe to fear, that you will have reluctance
to accord me it. I know, perhaps (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) what you would
demand of me. How, my Lord? (interrupted <hi>Attanes</hi>) do you know
what the favour is I come to beſeech you for? I believe I am not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
(anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) when I conceive that you pretend to a perſon
over whom I have power by the right of Arms: but you need not (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, perceiving <hi>Attanes</hi> to be more troubled) to teſtifie any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
for a thing which you ſhall eaſily obtain. <hi>Attanes</hi> thereupon made
a low reverence to the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and giving him thanks, inſtead
of the requeſt he had intended to make him, he proteſted that he would
be devoted to his intereſts to his laſt breath. It is moſt juſt (ſaid he) My
Lord, that I employ my life for you, ſince you do preſerve it to me, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60667:25"/>
render me happy by granting me the fair Princeſs, whom you have ſo
generouſly beſtowed on me, and without whom my life could have
been no other then a continual torment. Yes, my Lord, the princeſs <hi>Thomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
can alone render me happy; and ſince you do me the favour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
The Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> alone render you happy (interpoſed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) and is it that fair princeſs which you demand?
How, My Lord? (anſwered <hi>Attanes</hi>) are you ſurpriſed with hearing
the demand you prevented me from making to you? I conceived (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Hannibal</hi>) that you would have demanded <hi>Regulus</hi> of me, and
could not have imagined you ſhould have the ſentiments which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
for the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> after what you have done. For in brief,
your procedure is not effectual to perſwade it, and I believe it not much
more to gain the favour of <hi>Thomira.</hi> It is true, it is not very ordinary
to do as I have done (anſwered <hi>Attanes</hi>) But, My Lord, Love hath its
extravagancies as well as his blindneſs; ſo that without other deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then that which I drew from my diſpair, I believed that ſince my
cares, ſervices and reſpects, would onely cauſe the contempt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of <hi>Thomira,</hi> I was to take a courſe wholly contrary for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a contrary ſucceſs; ſo that I have novv a ſufficiently povverfull
means to vvin the heart of <hi>Thomira.</hi> Serve your ſelf then of thoſe means
(replyed the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> roughly) perceiving a hatred to riſe in
his breaſt againſt a man vvho pretended to intereſt in that of <hi>Thomira</hi>)
and demand nothing of me after this confeſsion vvhich you have made,
that you have taken arms to ſatisfie your paſsion rather then to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the concernments of <hi>Carthage.</hi> After this diſcourſe the tvvo Princes
rejoyned themſelves to <hi>Maharbal, Hanno,</hi> and the other Officers which
were with them; &amp; there was an obſervable of no little rarity, that all this
great company kept ſilence a conſiderable time together. <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
a diſcontentment upon him, whoſe nature he did not underſtand: he
ranſackt his whole ſoul over to find its cauſe, but was as far to ſeek as
before: for believing himſelf to be yet free from love, he could not
conceive that jealouſie ſhould beget theſe diſquiets of mind. <hi>Attanes</hi>
reſented a kind of repentance, which how piquant and diſquiet ſoever
it was, it argued a great diſtraction; and I conceive that in his inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he accuſed himſelf of having ſpoken too much before the fierce
and puiſſant Prince; and perhaps alſo he blamed himſelfe afterwards
that he had not ſpake enough, nor anſwered to the laſt words of my
Maſter. <hi>Maharbal, Hanno,</hi> and the reſt dared not to begin the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
either out of reſpect, or for that they took that time to ruminate
upon the cauſe of that which they obſerved upon the countenances of
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> and <hi>Attanes.</hi> But, My Lords, all this company kept ſilence,
as I told you; and when they began to break it, the converſation was ſo
irregular, that I ſhould be as troubled to deſcribe it to you, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were to make it. It is true, that it laſted no long time; for the
King of the <hi>Turdetanes</hi> not being able to ſupport the preſence of the
fierce <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after that which had paſſed between them, ſeparated
himſelf from them, and left the room, after he had performed the ſame
civilities he was uſed to do, although with an air that ſeemed extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forced. My Maſter, whoſe humour is haughty, conſtrain'd himſelfe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60667:26"/>
very little, and returned the King of the <hi>Turdetanes</hi> onely the civilities,
which he could not avoid making him, and whereunto ſeemlineſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him. After which he came up again to <hi>Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> but fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the impatience of being alone ſo much increaſe, he gaue ſo viſible
tokens of it, inſomuch that <hi>Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> making a low reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
went forth, and by their example obliged all the other officers to
do the ſame. My Maſter being alone, walked in his Chamber with large
ſteps, without well conſidering what he did, and caſt about in his mind
a thouſand different thoughts. But at length all thoſe Cogitations gave
place to thoſe which he had conceived againſt the King of the <hi>Turdetanes.</hi>
How, <hi>Attanes?</hi> (ſaid he to himſelf) doſt thou pretend to the heart of
<hi>Thomira?</hi> How? doſt thou pretend to the poſſeſſion of the faireſt perſon
that ever was? Ha, <hi>Attanes!</hi> do not flatter thy ſelf herein; thou ſhalt
never obtain the Princeſs <hi>Thomirr</hi> of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> but if you be obſtinate
in this pretenſion (continued he, following the violence of his humour)
that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> even that <hi>Hannibal</hi> of whom thou pretendeſt to obtain
her, ſhall carry fire and ſword into thy States, and tear out that heart
which dare inſolently to offer it ſelfe to the fair Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi>
Thus continuing ſeveral turns about the Chamber, he cauſed me to be
called, and doing me the honour to communicate his thoughts to me,
he would needs know thoſe which I had upon this occurrence. My Lord
(anſwered I) you bring me into a ſtrange perplexity; but ſince it is
your pleaſure to have me ſpeak, I ſhall do it ſincerely. I do not ſee (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
I) that you have cauſe to be ſo highly troubled as you are; for
ſince the Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> is of very great merit, you ought to be glad
in ſeeing her your Queen: and ſince the King of the <hi>Turdetanes,</hi> who
hath ſerv'd you, loves paſſionately the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> you ought
to be raviſh'd with joy, to reward the ſervices of <hi>Attanes</hi> by granting
him the fair <hi>Thomira.</hi> How, <hi>Aſpar?</hi> (replyed my Maſter roughly)
would you have me ſo weak as to abandon the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon?</hi>
Alas! have I not rendred her unhappy enough, without delivering her
into the hands of a man, againſt whom ſhe hath a manifeſt averſion,
which hath been juſtly augmented by the new cauſes he hath given her
at the ſiege of <hi>Saguntum!</hi> No, no, <hi>Aſpar,</hi> I will never do it; I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means to acquit my ſelfe towards <hi>Attanes,</hi> without giving him that
precious recompence: and I conceive <hi>Thomira</hi> deſerves to raign over
other people then the <hi>Turdetanes.</hi> Peradventure you reſerve the fair
<hi>Thomira</hi> for a greater Prince (ſaid I to him ſmilingly, with a liberty
which was oftentimes permitted me) and perhaps you have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiv'd
averſion againſt the King of the <hi>Turdieanes,</hi> but by reaſon you
have conceived ſome other matter towards the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi> I
think thou art become a fool, <hi>Aſpar</hi> (anſwered my Maſter, being much
provoked with my diſcourſe, but notwithſtanding enforcing himſelfe
to ſmile ſoon after for ſuſpecting me capable of ſuch dulneſs) but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me more, you ought to have told me in expreſs terms, That I am
enamoured on <hi>Thomira.</hi> It is true (added he more ſeriouſly then he
would) that I have very different ſentiments for this Princeſs, from thoſe
that I have for <hi>Attanes.</hi> But that ſome other matter which you mean,
without doubt maliciouſly, is no other then a compaſſion, which is really
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60667:26"/>
very tender, and an eſteem which I am obliged to have for a Princeſs
whom I believe the faireſt perſon in the World. It is free for you. My
Lord (replyed I with a little merriment) to give things what names you
pleaſe. Yet I have ſometimes heard that ſuch kind of ſentiments ought
to be termed love. Notwithſtanding, I ſhall call them as you pleaſe, and
chooſe rather not to well expreſs their nature, then to give them a name
which might ſeem to pleaſe. But, My Lord (continued I more ſeriouſly)
if I ſuſpect you capable of a paſſion which you call weakneſs, I charge
you at leaſt with a weakneſs which a thouſand illuſtrious examples have
authoriſed as noble; and if you believe you are incapable of it, it is, for
that in truth you underſtand better the conduct of an Army then the firſt
approaches of Love, which never enters into our breaſts, but under the
appearance of ſome other paſſion, and never dares own its true name till
it ha's rendred it ſelf abſolute Maſter of the ſoul. To give you therefore
the pleaſure of believing that it is become Maſter of mine (replyed my
Maſter with a half ſmile) I will go viſit the Princeſs <hi>Thomira;</hi> and
moreover I will not do it, till you have firſt ſent to know if it may be
without inſeaſonableneſs and inconvenience. I ſoon did what my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
appointed me, and underſtood that the <hi>Saguntine</hi> Ladies, who were
with the Princeſs, had anſwered, that the viſite would be not onely not
incommodious but of great advantage to <hi>Thomira. Hannibal</hi> had no
ſooner received this favourable anſwer, but he haſted to the Chamber
of the Princeſs; where, as the <hi>Saguntine</hi> Ladies who were her attendants,
came forward to receive him, there appeared ſo many tokens of ſorrow
upon their countenances, that my Maſter was much aſtoniſhed, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not to turn his head towards the bed of <hi>Thomira.</hi> He had not the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
even to require the cauſe of the ſadneſs he obſerved; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there would have been a long ſilence, if one of the Ladies to whom
the reſt ſeem'd to give place, had not begun to break it, and with a low
voice told to my Maſter, that the Princeſs was dangerouſly ſick: but,
My Lord, (continued ſhe in the ſame ſtrain) that which afflicts us moſt,
is, that the Princeſs will not admit of any remedies, and even refuſes to
take that which is preſſed upon her for the ſupport of life: ſo that we
are in danger of loſing the moſt fair and lovely perſon upon the earth:
and perhaps, yes perhaps (added ſhe, redoubling the violence of her
ſighes) we ſhall be ſufficiently unhappy to loſe her within a few hours,
if we may credit the fatal report which the Phyſitians have made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being terrified with theſe laſt words, continued as
it were immovable; and his ſoul was ſo overwhelmed with his ſorrow,
that the Prince ſeem'd deprived of the uſe of his ſenſes, and could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
utter theſe words, Ha, Madam, what ſay you? but afterwards when
his fiery temper had rendred him more diſpoſed to expreſs his grief by
tranſports, then complaints, he found himſelfe affected with I know not
what ardency to behold <hi>Thomira;</hi> and thereupon caſt his eye upon this
young, abſolutely fair and charming Princeſs, and ſurvey'd thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and charmes which were menac'd with approaching loſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<hi>Thomira</hi> as the greateſt, and yet moſt patient and innocent ſufferer
that he had ever ſeen. In a word, my Maſter beheld the fair <hi>Thomira</hi> in
ſuch a charming plight, as to be infinitely touch'd with her, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60667:27"/>
the violence of his paſſion. It is true, that this paſſionate Prince
not being able to ſuſtain this ſight long, turn'd himſelf towards the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that had ſpoken to him, and looking upon her with an anxious air,
No, no, Madam (ſaid he with an unexpreſsible aſſurance) the Princeſs
will not dye; but thoſe ignorant and odious perſons that threaten us
with ſuch a loſs, ſhall themſelves periſh before this happens. I will even
deſtroy every thing that does not contribute to the recovery of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and will do ſuch things as will amuſe all poſterity. After theſe
words, my Maſter made a few turns without ſpeaking, and then ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
approaching the ſame Lady, and laying hold of her arme without
knowing what he did. Madam (ſaid he) be ſtirring, give orders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
all, give all, command; Yes, Madam, command, but ſave the
Princeſs. After which, without expecting the Ladies anſwer, he ſtept
forward to ſee the Princeſs; but being no more able to bear the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of that view then at the firſt, he went forth of the Chamber, and
entered into a large Hall, where he walked for ſome time, and turning
himſelfe towards me, <hi>Aſpar</hi> (ſaid he) have you ſeen the Princeſs? and
can you wonder at my diſpair, having heard what hath been told me?
Will you ſay perhaps (continued he after a few moments) that I have
an affection towards <hi>Thomira?</hi> and will you not alſo confeſs, that I have
a paſſion for her which is infinitely above that love? This diſcourſe
ſtrangely ſurpriſed me, when I conſidered that at the ſame time the
Prince told me he neither was nor would be in love, he had ſuch ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
as not onely evidence, but tranſcend the ordinary ſtandard of that
paſſion; that at the ſame time, I ſay, he ſhould tell me he had ſentiments
infinitely above thoſe of Love. It is true, My Lord (anſwered I at
length, perceiving he expected my reply) that you are extreamly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
for the princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi> You may adde, <hi>Aſpar</hi> (interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he) that I reſent that which never any other perſon hath done; ſo
that Love which is a common and general paſsion, could never cauſe
me to have ſuch reſentments, nor produce ſo extraordinary effects. It is
true, My Lord (anſwered I) that Love is a common paſsion, but it is
alſo true that the ſoul of the prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> being no ordinary one: I
do not wonder that the moleſtations which a paſsion excites in it, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the place wherein they are excited. I did not continue on
my diſcourſe, becauſe I obſerved my Maſter was making towards the
Chamber door, to hear what was ſaid there: where, after a little heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
without being able to underſtand diſtinctly, he heard the princeſs
cry out, O the great Gods, moſt juſt and moſt good! is it not enough
for this infortunate Damſell, after having loſt her Father, and beheld
the deſtruction of her Country, but I muſt needs be obliged to him
who hath cauſed all theſe miſeries, and for whom I ought to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but averſion and deteſtation? And you pitileſs <hi>Nadalia</hi> (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the princeſs) would you have me protract an unfortunate life, and
that grief ſhould by long torments bring me that which my diſeaſe is
ready to afford me in a few hours? The impatient Prince could not
hear more, but entered into the Chamber, and approaching towards
the princeſſes Bed, wholly amorous and afflicted, Ah Madam (ſaid he)
will you then dye? will you dye, moſt excellent Lady? Yes, my Lord,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60667:27"/>
(anſwered the princeſs) and I am not ſorry that I ſhall do it in your
preſence, to acquit my ſelfe of the obligation I have to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in the
condition I am in, I can do no more for you then give you the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of ſeeing a Virgin dye, who hath made vowes againſt you, and
bewailed your Victories. Your complaints have been with reaſon (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Prince) and I wiſh I had rather loſt a thouſand lives then to
have cauſed them. Ah, my Lord, (anſwered ſhe) do not carry your
generoſity ſo far, unleſs it be intended as a piece of cruelty to me. Ah
Madam (replyed he) do not carry your deſign ſo far, unleſs you intend
it ſhould be fatal unto me. As they were upon theſe terms, one of the
Phyſitians came to preſent ſome kind of portion of <hi>Thomira,</hi> which ſhe
refuſed, not without a kind of pleaſingneſs; ſhe refuſed it with a certain
tranquillity of ſpirit, and a ſtedineſs of ſoul ſo heroical, that ſhe cauſed
in thoſe of the aſſiſtance a mixed paſſion of an extraordinary admiration,
and an extream diſpair. At length, while things were in this pitiful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
<hi>Nadalia</hi> came to my Maſter, and beſeeched him to permit that the
prince <hi>Lucius</hi> might be brought into the princeſs's Chamber. My Maſter
granted it at firſt, and ſoon after ſaw the prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> there, who
approached to the Princeſs, after his civilities to my Maſter, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the like, and retired into the Hall. <hi>Lucius</hi> beheld <hi>Thomira,</hi> and
<hi>Thomira Lucius,</hi> while both theſe illuſtrious perſons expreſſed their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
by their tears, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eing not able to do it with their Tongues. The

<hi>Lucius</hi> melted into ſome drops, accompanied with deep-fetch't ſighes;
whether it were that this mutual view was a new cauſe or grief grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then their power to ſuſtain; or whether there were ſomething more
tender and touching then the great miſ-fortunes which had already fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out, and were leſs proper to pierce the ſoul then to overwhelm it.
But, <hi>Nadalia,</hi> being willing to loſe no time: My Lord (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>)
the Princeſs is reſolved to dye. The princeſs reſolv'd to dye? (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
he.) How Madam? (ſaid he, turning to <hi>Thomira</hi>) will you
then be obſtinate againſt life? <hi>Lucius,</hi> I muſt be ſo (anſwered this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Beauty.) Muſt be ſo, Madam? (cryed <hi>Lucius</hi>) Ah, Madam!
what ſay you? ought you not to preſerve one of the faireſt perſons in the
world? ought you not to preſerve a life which is ſo precious and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to all that are devoted to you? Alas, Madam! (added <hi>Nadalia</hi>)
can you refuſe the prince <hi>Lucius</hi> that which he requeſts? And although
he were not ſuch as he is, could you, without being affected, behold a
young prince, who hath left the Court of the King his Father, to come
and embrace your quarrel; who hath ſpent his blood, and that of his
ſubjects for your intereſts? who hath adventured to grapple with the
moſt redoubled valour in the world? and in a word, a young Prince
who hath been ready to dye for you: Will you not be drawn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
your life at his requeſt? I perceive well, <hi>Nadalia</hi> (anſwered the
Princeſs) that I am culpable, and that I ſhall die ungrateful; but I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
perceive, that I am not culpable in any other reſpect, but becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e I
am a Woman, and becauſe I am weak; and for that not having
ſtrength enough of ſoul to preſerve an unhappy life; there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a neceſsity to dye, which would be a ſufficient contentment,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60667:28"/>
were it not troubled with the regret I have to leave ſuch perſons as are
deare unto me. I will not tell you (continued ſhe) in extenuation of
my crime, that if <hi>Lucius</hi> had dyed for <hi>Thomira,</hi> he ſhould onely have
ceaſed to be happy; whereas, if <hi>Thomira</hi> ſhould live for <hi>Lucius,</hi> ſhe
ſhould onely preſerve her ſorrow, to be perpetually tormented by
it; ſo that if there were no difference between the ſoul of <hi>Lucius</hi> and
mine, if there were none between the loſing a happy life, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
a miſerable (which yet there is not) although, I ſay, all this
were equal, yet were your demands too high for me to accord unto.
For, in brief, I ſufficiently find, that griefe acts much more ſenſibly
then joy, and that a perſon ſuffers more that is overwhelmed with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery;
then when he renounces ſome contentments which may betide
him during the courſe of a happy life.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words of the princeſs made it appear, that ſhe was not in ſo
weak a condition as ſhe head ſignified before, and that the diſquiets of
her ſoul did not hinder her from diſcourſing of theſe things with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and freedom of ſpirit, which yet could gain nothing upon the
minds of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia.</hi> The <hi>Celtiberian</hi> Prince beſeeched her
very earneſtly, and added reaſons to his prayers. <hi>Nadalia</hi> alſo did the
like: and as they ſaw that <hi>Thomira</hi> remained inflexible: Ah, Madam!
(ſaid <hi>Lucius</hi> to her, with a tone declaring both his grief and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair)
is it your pleaſure to have me dye: I will ſo, Madam; I will dye
immediately, to avoid the time of ſeeing or hearing that doleful fate you
threaten us with: and I queſtion not to find means to diſpatch my life.
I will furniſh you with them my ſelfe, My Lord, ſaid the generous <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,</hi>
and this Poniard (continue ſhe, drawing one from her ſleeve)
ſhall ſerve you to execute a juſt deſign, and afterwards ſerve my ſelfe
with it by following ſo glorious an example; for, in truth, if <hi>Thomira</hi>
dye, there is no reaſon for us to ſurvive her. My Lords, the Princeſs
implyes her pleaſure concerning our fates in her own reſolution not to
live; and therefore this Ponyard which was intended only to ſecure me
from the inſolence of the Souldiers, which is too ordinary in the taking
of Cities; this Ponyard ſhall be ſheathed in our breaſts, (alas! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
a while ſince?) by our fair Princeſs. It ſhall pierce none other
but mine, cryed the deſperate Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> with a terrible voice,
and running the bed of <hi>Thomira;</hi> And this <hi>Hannibal,</hi> this <hi>Barbarian,</hi> who
hath been able to reduce the adorable <hi>Thomira</hi> into the condition ſhe
is in, is minded to ſacrifice himſelfe as a Victim to eſtabliſh your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
repoſe. In ſaying theſe words, he laid his hand upon that of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,</hi>
and offering to ſeiſe upon the Ponyard; Ah, my Lord, ſaid <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira;</hi>
Ah, <hi>Lucius!</hi> Ah, <hi>Nadalia!</hi> you have prevailed, I will live that
you may, I will live that you ſuffer not a death which ſeems more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to me then that which I was going to ſuffer my ſelfe: I will do all
that you deſire I ſhould for the preſervation of a life, wherein you take
ſo important intereſt. Never was ſeen ſo ſpeedy and great a change as
that which theſe words of <hi>Thomira</hi> cauſed; all the tumultuous and fatal
thoughts which raigned before in the minds of thoſe preſent, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by this one ſentence: and hope, and joy, with the pleaſingneſs that
accompanies them, took compleat poſſeſsion of the ſame minds, after
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60667:28"/>
they had chaſed from thence all that is wont to withſtand and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to theſe amiable paſsions. At the ſame moment one came to aſſure
<hi>Thomira,</hi> that the Prince her Father had been ſeen taking the way of
the Sea-ſhore with a body of Horſe: and to make the face of things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
new, my Maſter pronounced aloud, that the Princeſs gave
liberty to <hi>Lucius, Regulus,</hi> and <hi>Nadalia;</hi> and not onely to all the
people of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> but even to all thoſe who had taken arms for her
intereſts. You may judge, My Lord, ſaid <hi>Aſpar</hi> to his Illuſtrious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
whether all theſe things together, and joyned with ſoveraign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did not produce a ſpeedy effect: and without holding you lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the deſcribing a malady wherein you can find nothing agreeable
beſides the fair Princeſs that ſuffered it, I ſhall content my ſelf to tell you
that the incomparable <hi>Thomira</hi> was within a few dayes in a condition to
leave her bed, and ſoon after alſo her Chamber. <hi>Aſpar</hi> held his peace
at this part of his Narration; either not preſuming to purſue it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Nadalia;</hi> for this fair Virgin, who a little before appeared full of zeal
and generoſity, was now wholly amiable and ſprightly; it is true, that
ſhe accompanied her joy with a certain fiercenes, which yet advanced her
beauty: And this will not be accounted ſtrange, if it be conſidered
that <hi>Nadalia</hi> was the daughter of <hi>Alcon,</hi> one of the principal Senators
of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

above all this, ſhe had a generous ſoul, as unqueſtionably you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
by that noble proof I have ſhewn ſhe gave during the ſickneſs
of the Princeſs. But if this lovely Virgin was wholly given up to joy,
after the recovery of <hi>Thomira,</hi> for whom ſhe had an extream tenderneſs;
my Maſter was ſo abandoned to the violence of his love, that he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to declare it to his Princeſs, both to comfort his minde, and to
direct his carriage for the future. He did me the favour, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to me his deſign; but I ſoon knew, that it was not ſo much to know
my ſentiments of it, as to have the ſatisfaction of ſpeaking of his Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<hi>Aſpar</hi> (ſaid he to me) do you not perceive that we had ſeen but
hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Princeſs before? Was it then poſſible to admire the majeſty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60667:30"/>
of her port, and the vivacity of her countenance? Could we, I ſay,
admire the brightneſs of her eyes, and that aire which inſtantly ſubdues
the heart, without that one can know the cauſe of that conqueſt, if it
were not that ſhe is well known, to be the moſt charming thing in the
world? ſo that it is certain, that whoſoever had had no love for <hi>Thomira</hi>
in her ſickneſſe, ought now to adore her. But to what purpoſe is it (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Prince) to have love and adoration for <hi>Thomira,</hi> if <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>
know it not? It is neceſſary to let her know it (ſaid he) and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe be ſenſible of what ſhe makes me ſuffer, or that I ſhortly dye at
her feet. But alas! wherein will it advantage me to let her know it, if
<hi>Attanes</hi> have the means to win her heart? He has no ſuch means (recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
he inſtantly) and I ſhould do you injury, my adorable Princeſs,
if I believed that <hi>Attanes</hi> could prevail upon your affection, after he
hath born Arms againſt you, having ſound you inſenſible before he had
committed that crime. Do not wonder <hi>Aſpar</hi> (continued he) that I
reaſon in this manner, having my ſelf alſo born Arms againſt <hi>Thomira:</hi>
for although there were no difference between the King of the <hi>Turdetans</hi>
and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> yet there would alwayes be in this, for that I was a
declared Enemy, and but acted as ordinarily Enemies do; whereas the
offence which hath been received from <hi>Attanes,</hi> hath a more ſurpriſing
and cruel appearance, as being received from a hand from which wholly
contrary treatment was expected. Beſides, that which may poſſibly
cauſe averſion againſt me in the breaſt of <hi>Thomira,</hi> may as well cauſe
eſteem; and that fair Princeſſe can never think of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he
was in the head of an Enemy Army, without perceiving at the ſame
time <hi>Hannibal</hi> victorious; and then, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is not a conqueſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unworthy of <hi>Thomira.</hi> Let us go then (added he, being moved
by violent and haughty humour) and make it ſeen that my Rivals are
as little formidable to me, as my Enemies have been hitherto in the head
of their Armies: Let us go tell the Princeſſe that <hi>Hannibal</hi> loves her,
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> adores her, that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who by his birth raigns over
one half of the world, and wears that by his ſide wherewith to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the other, and lay at the feet of the Divine <hi>Thomira,</hi> all the
Crowns in the earth. In ending theſe words, he went towards the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> with whom he found <hi>Nadalia,</hi> three or four fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of <hi>Saguntum, Anno, Magar,</hi> and <hi>Alorca,</hi> who was a Spaniard of
quality that had ſerved in our Army. My maſter immediately learnt
there, that <hi>Attanes</hi> could not obtain a ſight of the Princeſſe; and ſoon
after underſtood, that ſhe was pleaſed to walk upon a fair Turrace, which
was on the top of the Palace: <hi>Hannibal</hi> led the Princeſſe by the hand,
being raviſhed with joy at the opportunity: <hi>Anno</hi> lead <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and
<hi>Magar Alorca,</hi> and my ſelf attended upon the other Ladies which were
of this preſence. But this walk, which was imagined would have been
very pleaſing, was really ſad in its beginning; for the fair Princeſs of
<hi>Caſtulon</hi> could not behold from the Turrace, the ruines of <hi>Saguntum</hi>
without ſighing; which prevailed on my Maſter to ſigh with her, inſtead
of declaring his paſſion, as he had reſolved: So that he dared not open
his lips to her, ſeeing her perſiſt ſilent; by which teſtifying, that he
lived not but in her: He gave fair proofs of his paſſion, although without
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60667:30"/>
the diſcovery which he intended. Nevertheleſs, it was requiſite at
length for him to ſpeak; and ſo he proteſted, That <hi>Saguntum</hi> ſhould
never have been beſieged, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had known the fair <hi>Thomira.</hi> And
I ſwear to you, Madam (continued he) by all that is moſt ſacred, that
I am ſo far from attaquing any place which ſhould have the honour to
incloſe your divine perſon, that I ſhould have had veneration towards
it, and have loſt my life in defence of it: Wherefore I am minded to
make the utmoſt reparation poſſible; and by your commands, to render
<hi>Saguntum</hi> ſo proud and magnificent, that it ſhall ſhortly be the firſt City
of <hi>Spain,</hi> not excepting our new <hi>Carthage,</hi> for all the expence that <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
hath laid upon it.</p>
               <p>Alas, my Lord (anſwered <hi>Thomira</hi>) why is it that you have done
what is paſt before your eyes? or what induces you to do as you do at
preſent: For unfeignedly, my Lord, never did any perſon act ſo nobly
as you: And not to ſpeak concerning the offer which you make me, of
repairing <hi>Saguntum,</hi> or the life you have given to the Prince <hi>Lucius,</hi> or
the liberty which you have granted all the priſoners: I obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
yet more obliging and generous in your manner of acting; for
you would have me give orders for the repairing of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> you
give life to a Prince, who hath attempted upon yours; and whereas you
give life to <hi>Lucius,</hi> and liberty to the priſoners, you give both the one
and the other in my name, and treat your priſoner as a Soveraign. The
Princeſs (interrupted the paſſionate <hi>Carthaginian</hi>) whom you unjuſtly
call a priſoner, ſhall rule every where that I have power. And you
ought not wonder, Madam (proceeded he) beholding the princeſs with
eyes that ſpoke what his mouth was going to pronounce) that I give
life to a Prince who hath attaqued mine; ſince I adore a Princeſs
which hath wounded me much more dangerouſly, and gained a victory
over me, which never any perſon did before, nor ſhall any other
hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs was infinitely perplexed with this diſcourſe, ſhe could
not reſolve to miſtreat a Prince, to whom ſhe had ſo many and late ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations;
nor could ſhe reſolve to return a favourable anſwer to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all her loſſes: So that having continued ſilent ſome moments;
My Lord (anſwered ſhe) you onely heard that which obliges me to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you thanks, and interrupted me when I was come to tell you the cauſe
I had to complain of you: For, my Lord, if you are the Prince that hath
treated me very generouſly, you are alſo the ſame Prince that cauſed
many thouſand men to Periſh; you are the ſame Prince that brought
me into a condition of lamenting a hundred times a day, when I think
upon the Prince my Father, without knowing preciſely where he is, I
ſometimes imagine him in a fire, where he is devoured by the flames, and
if I can believe that he hath eſcaped that fate, then preſently I conceive,
that the priſon or grief, are ready to do that which the flames have not:
So that you may pleaſe to judge, my Lord, of the commiſerable eſtate
wherein I am; ſince, if on the one ſide, I owe you all, on the other I
am obliged to conſider you as my enemy: And I would the Gods had
pleaſed (continued ſhe, lifting up her fair eyes towards Heaven, from
which ſome tears ſlipt) that the loſs of my life could eſtabliſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60667:31"/>
of yours; you ſhould find I will ſoon give it with contentment,
and that at leaſt I know to do that out of gratitude, which you have
done out of pure generoſity. There is no need of that, Madam, replyed
the paſſionate Prince, being ſenſibly toucht with the tears of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
and it ſuffices me to hear ſome favourable words from your mouth
to—He could not proceed further, by reaſon of the coming of
<hi>Lucius Maharbal,</hi> and <hi>Adherbal,</hi> to do reverence to the Princeſs and to
him, having entered without deſiring permiſſion, becauſe the Terraſe
was a place where people walked ordinarily, and there was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
multitude there at that time. Whereupon the Princeſs was very
glad, and to the end <hi>Hannibal</hi> might no more have occaſion to be alone
with her, ſhe made ſemblance that ſhe had walked enough, and having
called <hi>Nadalia</hi> and the other Ladies, all the company entered into a large
and magnificent Pavilion at the end of the Terraſe, which was provided
with rich cuſhions and furniture within a few daies before. <hi>Thomira</hi> and
<hi>Hannibal</hi> were too ſufficiently taken up with their own thoughts, to be
able to begin the converſation immediately, ſo that the Prince of <hi>Celti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria</hi>
breaking the ſilence which had an aſpect of too much ſadneſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(ſaid he to the princeſs) I perceive well that you have been touched
with the view of ſo lamentable an object; but the ſoul of the Princeſs
<hi>Thomira</hi> is ſo firm, that I believe ſhe can with no great pain compoſe and
calm this kind of affliction. In ſincerity, <hi>Lucius</hi> (anſwered <hi>Thomira</hi>) I
would not upon any terms have ſuch a ſoul as you ſpeak of, and I had
rather be guilty of weakneſs then own ſuch a ſtrength as renders a heart
inſenſible.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> would not have you inſenſible (ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbal</hi>)
but he would neither have you permit your ſelfe to be ſo
ſenſibly affected with the ſight of ſome ruines, which in truth ought
to be no cauſe of admiration, after you have ſeen the things which
cauſed them: and for my ſelfe, Madam, added he in favour of the Prince
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> I could wiſh to ſee you above all paſsions, except ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which ſeems onely worthy to raign in your ſoul. It hath at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
the ſtrongeſt heretofore (anſwered the Princeſs) but a Victory
of the prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> added ſhe, ſighing, hath cauſed me to change
thoſe thoughts, and reſent a paſſion which I find more violent. It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to judge, ſaid the prince of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that there was a time
when Ambition was not onely the ſtrongeſt, but even the onely paſſion
which raigned in the breaſt of <hi>Hannibal:</hi> But, Madam, added he with a
lower voice, and beholding his princeſs, a victory of the princeſs <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>
hath made me quite diſcharge ſuch thoughts, and reſent a paſſion
which I find more violent. It is eaſie to underſtand, Madam, ſaid <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,</hi>
interrupting my Maſter in favour of the princeſs, and yet making
a handſome ſemblance not to take notice of his ſpeaking low, it is eaſie
to underſtand, ſaid ſhe, that grief is the violent paſſion which you have
reſented; but I beſeech you, Madam, chaſe it from your breaſt; for,
in truth, purſued ſhe with an air, expreſſing her contentment to divert
the Princeſs, I look upon grief as a thing ſo deformed and frightful,
and your ſoul ſeems to me ſo fair and noble, that I cannot longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their being together, or that a paſſion which makes ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60667:31"/>
ſhould have ſo excellent a habitation: beſides, without vanity,
added ſhe ſmiling, I cannot believe, but at leaſt I am ſomewhat more
amiable then ſadneſs, and upon that reaſon cannot endure that that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
the place, a little part whereof would render me the moſt happy
perſon in the world. You have no need then to doubt your felicity, my
dear <hi>Nadalia,</hi> anſwered the Princeſs, and it would be injuſtice to refuſe
you a heart you have ſo good a title to, and which cannot be
given you but with an extream ſatisfaction. You do me too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
replyed <hi>Nadalia,</hi> I render you a thouſand thanks, and proteſt to
you; that if I have demanded ſo valuable an advantage in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner, it is becauſe I believed, that had I demanded it ſeriouſly,
I might have been judged too ambitious: beſides, that to ſpeak the truth,
I have reſolved to turn all things to this air, the better to divert you; and
I beg the permiſſion of the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> to uſe this liberty. Ah,
amiable <hi>Nadalia,</hi> anſwered <hi>Hannibal,</hi> can you be guilty of ſuch injuſtice!
and do you not know that the Princeſs alone hath authority to permit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
&amp; command? Well, beautiful <hi>Nadalia,</hi> ſaid <hi>Anno,</hi> who had not ſpoken
till then, and had no attention or regard but for this lovely <hi>Saguntine.</hi>
Well, ſaid he, in favour of the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or rather in his own,
to cauſe <hi>Nadalia</hi> to ſpeak; can you give an account what paſsion it is
which hath rendered it ſelfe more powerful then ambition in the ſoul of
the Prince of <hi>Carthage?</hi> In verity, <hi>Anno,</hi> anſwered <hi>Nadalia</hi> with her
wonted pleaſantneſs, you are a very knowing perſon that conceive it
poſsible for me to know the ſecret of another. Declare your ſelfe (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe ſubtilly) if you would have me know yours. Ah, fair <hi>Nadalia</hi>
(cryed he, without well regarding in what preſence he was) how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſhould I be if you knew it! I know not, ſaid <hi>Hannibal</hi> to <hi>Anno,</hi>
whether <hi>Nadalia</hi> would find it difficult to know what you have in your
heart; but for my ſelfe, I know well that I take ſo little care to hide
what I have in mine, that ſhe may very eaſily divine it.</p>
               <p>You have there a great ſtock of generoſity, My Lord, which hath
been ſo advantageous to us, anſwered <hi>Nadalia,</hi> that we can be as little ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it as forget it. Ah, fair <hi>Nadalia,</hi> replyed <hi>Hannibal</hi> obligingly,
obſerving the pleaſure the Princeſs took in hearing the raillery of her
amiable companion, your earneſt offends me, and you give me cauſe to
think that I am not of the number of your friends, ſince you ſpeak to me
with conſtraine, and that you quit the pleaſantneſs you took a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
never to renounce. Without deceit, My Lord, I dared not to tell
you things as I imagine them: for I fancy them in ſuch an old guiſe
that I divert my ſelfe with the moſt ſerious and troubleſome, when they
are paſſed. So that when I reſolve in my mind the tranſports which
you had about fifteen or ſixteen years ago; for if you pleaſe to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
My Lord, purſued ſhe, you were in much choler againſt the ſickneſſe
of the Princeſs, not ſparing the Phyſitians who were declared enemies
of it, When, I ſay, conſider, all your tranſports, I cannot but believe,
that you took the Fever for an Army, or a City which you reſolved to
overthrow by force, or—Ah, cruel Lady! (interpoſed my Maſter)
why do you ſpeak of a thing which we ought to forget? I know, my
Lord, replyed <hi>Nadalia,</hi> the reaſon you would have it forgotten, tis becauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60667:32"/>
you promiſed me then to make me rule: judge then proceeded ſhe ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
if it does not concern me to remember it; and if, although paſt
miſ-fortunes were not pleaſures to me, as I have already told you they
were, I ought to forget a thing which touches me ſo importantly? I
ſhould not have forgot that which I had promiſed you, ſaid my Maſter
to her, and within a little time you ſhall ſee if I eſteem <hi>Nadalia,</hi> provided
in the mean time you content your ſelfe to rule in my heart. Sincerely,
My Lord, replyed ſhe, you do me to great an honour, but you may
pleaſe to permit me to refuſe it; for I like better to raign peaceably in a
little corner of earth, then with tumult in your heart. In brief (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe with the ſame ſmiling air) to tell you things as I apprehend
them, I conceive your heart is a thing to great and fill'd with Armies,
Provinces, conquered, and to conquer, that I cannot but tremble to
conſider the poor <hi>Nadalia</hi> in the midſt of that tumult. Moreover if it be
allowable to reaſon concerning hearts; from what I have heard ſpoken of
the Sea, I ſhould never be ſafe in yours; for I have heard our Mariners
ſay, that the greateſt Seas are the moſt tempeſtuous. Amiable <hi>Nadalia</hi>
(anſwered my Maſter, ſmiling after his manner) all theſe Armies, and
all theſe Provinces which frighten you are no longer in my heart; but you
will find ſo fair treatment there, that you will continue in it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and confeſs that that which I preſerve in it, is a thouſand times more
valuable then all that I have chaſed out of it; yea, then the intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the world. <hi>Hannibal</hi> purſued this diſcourſe, carrying a hidden
ſenſe along with it, advantageous to the Princeſs. And <hi>Thomira, Nada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
Lucius, Maharbal,</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> having continued the converſation
for ſome time, all this noble company retired. My Maſter was no ſooner
in his Chamber, but he ſent to call one of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mira</hi>'s Domeſticks, to
cauſe him to make a more exact diſcovery what he had began to tell him
concerning the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and the King of the <hi>Turdetanes.</hi> This
<hi>Saguntine</hi> related to the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that the Queen of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi>
Mother of <hi>Lucius,</hi> was ſiſter to <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntine</hi>
Senate, who was otherwiſe called the Prefect, and that his charge
notwithſtanding was no other then that of the Roman Prefects. He told
him alſo, that the princeſs <hi>Imilca,</hi> wife of <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> being dead ten years
ſince, <hi>Thomira,</hi> who was alwaies called the princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> as her
Father bore alwaies the title of Prince of the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> had been
brought up with the Queen of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> her Aunt, whereby there was
contracted ſo firm a friendſhip between <hi>Lucius</hi> and her, that they had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
no other appellations between themſelves but thoſe of Brother and
Siſter. That afterwards <hi>Lucius</hi> being become paſſionately inamour'd
of the princeſs of the <hi>Ilergetes,</hi> the worth of this Prince and the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
of <hi>Thomira,</hi> had ſo effectually prevail'd, that <hi>Lucius</hi> within a
a little time received as many tokens of eſteem and good-will from his
Princeſs as he could poſſibly wiſh: But, my Lord (added he) you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to threaten <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>guntum</hi> at ſuch time as preparation were making for
the mariage of the prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and the princeſe of the <hi>Ilergetes;</hi>
and you advanced againſt this poor City when theſe too illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were juſt ready to be ranked under the Lawes of <hi>Hymen.</hi> Upon
which the Prince <hi>Lucius,</hi> not willing to taſte theſe delights he had ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60667:32"/>
much deſired, while his Uncle and the illuſtrious <hi>Thomira</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
by a formidable Conqueror, came and put himſelf into <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
with four thouſand <hi>Celtiberians;</hi> ſince which there hath nothing
paſſed of which you have not ſufficient knowledge: you, I ſay, My
Lord, whoſe valour hath done all againſt us during the ſiege of this
City, as after the taking of it your Generoſity hath done all for us.
Concerning the King of the <hi>Turdetanes,</hi> proceeded the <hi>Saguntine,</hi> there
are very many things to be related; but I believe you will know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of him, when I ſhall onely have told you, that for theſe two
years paſt, this Prince hath been deſperately amorous of the princeſs
of <hi>Caſtulon;</hi> but <hi>Thomira</hi> never had any inclination to affect him; ſo
that <hi>Attanes</hi> joyned himſelf to your Army, induced perhaps thereunto
by his diſpair. It is true, that aſſoon as you were entered the City,
that Prince ſent his Guards for the defence of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and had it not
been for that care, I can aſſure this generous Princes had not ſurviv'd
the ſtorm. For <hi>Lucius</hi> had great difficulty to draw her away from the
Pile, into which ſhe would have caſt her ſelfe; and beſides however
calm and moderate ſhe ſeems, it is certain ſhe would have given her
ſelf another manner of death, if the Captain of <hi>Attanes</hi> Guards had
not aſſured her that her Father was living. Moreover, without this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the <hi>Turaetanes,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> who alone had power
to perſwade her to live, would without doubt have himſelfe periſhed
in the defence of this fair Princeſs. My Maſter was extreamly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with hearing that <hi>Lucius</hi> was not his Rival, and that <hi>Attanes</hi> was
one, but hated; and afterwards conſidering of the means to gain <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>'s
heart which <hi>Attanes</hi> had told him of about fifteen or twenty
dayes before, he demanded of the <hi>Saguntine,</hi> if it were true that the
King of the <hi>Turdetanes</hi> could not come to the ſight of the Princeſs.
There is nothing more certain, My Lord, anſwered the <hi>Saguntine,</hi> and
that which makes me believe that <hi>Attanes</hi> is yet more perplexed in his
mind then before, is this, that at the ſame time ſhe would not admit
him into her preſence, ſhe received <hi>Regulus</hi> very obligingly, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him all the honours and civilities he could expect. How? (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Hannibal</hi> a little troubled) is <hi>Regulus</hi> ſo well treated by <hi>Thomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra?
Regulus,</hi> who is no relation to <hi>Thomira?</hi> He is ſo without queſtion,
replyed he, although not ſo well as <hi>Lucius,</hi> who is the relation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
you underſtand; and it muſt be acknowledged, that if <hi>Regulus</hi>
be eſteemed, he deſerves it. For <hi>Regulus</hi> hath a very comely perſon, a
good genius, and a heart extreamly generous, and does all things in ſo
noble a manner; that excepting you, My Lord, and the prince <hi>Lucius,</hi>
I cannot ſay that I ever knew a Prince ſo well accompliſht. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
hath alſo cauſed very great care to be taken of him, as ſoon as ſhe
was in a condition to do it: ſhe hath viſited him two or three times, and
obligingly reprov'd him, for that he had adventured to come abroad to
give her thanks for the goodneſs ſhe had towards him. But, My Lord
(continued the <hi>Saguntine</hi>) it is ſincerely true, that they have ſpoken very
advantageouſly of you; &amp; that the princeſs blamed <hi>Regulus</hi> for deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to depart without coming to attend upon you: I confeſs, Madam,
anſwered <hi>Regulus, Hannibal</hi> is a brave perſon, generous, and in a word,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60667:33"/>
an Illuſtrious Prince; but when I conſider that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is a <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
I cannot reſolve to ſhew him civility: and I ſhall never do any,
to what perſon ſoever of a people whoſe onely name gives me horror.
Let him do what he pleaſes, provided he be gone (interupted <hi>Hannibal</hi>
roughly) and as he pronounced theſe words, <hi>Attanes,</hi> who came to
bid him adieu, entered his Chamber, and made him a Complement
ſo looſe and expreſſive of the trouble which the hatred of <hi>Thomira</hi> had
raiſed in his mind, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was more raviſhed with it then he
could have been with the moſt eloquent diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>My Maſter ſhewed many Civilities to the King of the <hi>Turdetanes;</hi>
aud when he repaid his viſit, he aſſured him that he would make it his
care to act for the good and advantage of his State. From <hi>Attanes,
Hannibal</hi> went to wait upon the Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> and by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
found her without other company then that of two of her Virgin-attendants.</p>
               <p>My Maſter was raviſhed with this occaſion, which afforded him
place and convenience to ſpeak to the Princeſs; but immediately as he
was going to take the benefit of it, he was diverted by a certain trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though no other then pleaſing, which hindred him from ſpeaking:
for he was ſeized with ſuch a joy, when he ſaw himſelf in a condition
that he might abandon himſelf to pleaſure, and behold without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
his fair Princeſs, that is eyes, his countenance and behaviour
ſpoke ſufficiently what his mouth could not. <hi>Thomira</hi> declared her
ſelf in no other then in the ſame ſilent faſhion, and modeſty producing
the ſame effect in her breaſt that tranſports did in that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſhe
da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed not to look up on this paſſionate Prince. This diſturbance cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her to bluſh: and that ſanguin and her fear rendring her more fair
and lovely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpoke ſo ſenſibly to my Maſter, that being carried by the
violence of his paſsion, he went to lay himſelf at her feet, without
conſidering that there were two Virgins in the Chamber; if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
who was ſurpriſed and diſpleas'd with it, had not hindered him
from doing it.</p>
               <p>About this time came one to make excuſes to the Princeſs on the
behalf of <hi>Nadalia.</hi> I will not receive them (anſwered <hi>Thomira</hi>) but
on condition that ſhe come inſtantly and make them her ſelf; and you
may tell her (added ſhe, turning to him that brought the meſſage)
that I complain extreamly of her. Madam (anſwered the <hi>Saguntine)
Nadalia</hi> will be conſtrained to ſee the Troops of <hi>Attanes</hi> march away:
for <hi>Alcon,</hi> who is juſt now arrived, hath ſomething of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to communicate to the King of the <hi>Turdetanes,</hi> that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for <hi>Nadalia</hi> to attend till <hi>Attanes</hi> be departed to ſee her Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But, Madam (proceeded he) there being great concourſe to ſee this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<hi>Nadalia</hi> being not permitted to ſpeak with you, hath had the
contentment to imploy that time in ſpeaking of you, with the Prince
of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> who as you know, is to go along with <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes:</hi>
and being they are not to go till an hour hence, <hi>Nadalia</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have the honour to ſee you till after that time. The Princeſs of
<hi>Caſtulon</hi> was deſirous to have drawn the diſcourſe out longer with
this man, both to have the pleaſure of hearing him ſpeak of <hi>Nadalia,</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60667:33"/>
and to hinder the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> from diſcovering to her the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
ſhe thought ſhe too well knew already. But then judging it
not to be ſeemly, ſhe began at length to ſpeak to the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
to the end he might not have time to entertain her with a paſſion that ſo
much diſpleaſed her, that ſhe could not reaſonably return a pertinent
anſwer unto it. My Lord (ſaid this fair Princeſs unto him) you will
permit me to make vowes for a Romane, and to wiſh that <hi>Regulus,</hi>
who is not yet perfectly cured, may not ſuffer harm by the voyage
which he undertakes. For truly, My Lord (continued ſhe to hinder
him from ſpeaking) although I had not a tender ſoul, yet I ought in
reaſon to intereſt my ſelf in the indiſpoſition of <hi>Regulus,</hi> ſince he ſuffers
it not but for having defended <hi>Saguntum;</hi> beſides that, my own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
are ſufficient inſtructers to me, to have compaſſion of thoſe
of another.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary, adorable Princeſs (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your compaſſion before a Prince, who deſires with all his ſoul
to be able to excite it in yours. You have for <hi>Regulus</hi> fair <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira;</hi>
have ſome, I beſeech you towards a Prince that adores you:
<hi>Regulus</hi> hath fought for you, <hi>Regulus</hi> hath received his wounds for the
intereſt of <hi>Saguntum;</hi> in a word, <hi>Regulus</hi> hath ſerv'd you. But, divine
Princeſs, if it be lawful to judge of actions according to the intention
of him that hath performed them, we may ſay, that you are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to <hi>Regulus,</hi> ſince he took arms rather againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
then to ſerve the princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and deſigned more to ſatisfie his
paſſion, then to aſſiſt <hi>Saguntum;</hi> ſeeing we know the other Romanes,
who had not the ſame intereſt, abandon'd it. The caſe of <hi>Hannibal</hi> is
far different; <hi>Hannibal</hi> acts not but for <hi>Thomira.</hi> If <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſuffers,
<hi>Thomira</hi> is the only cauſe that makes him ſuffer; and in a word, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
conſiders more the Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> then all the world together beſides.</p>
               <p>I know well, Madam, you will ſay I have ruin'd <hi>Saguntum,</hi> but I
can make out that even this ſerves to prove the greatneſs of the reſpect
which I have for you. I have beſieged <hi>Saguntum,</hi> becauſe it had leagu'd
it ſelf to my enemies party, contrary to the Treaty which had been
made, whereby the <hi>Saguntines</hi> were obliged to bear themſelves neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
in which, Madam, the reſentment I have ſhewn, ha's been juſt and
honourable: and you ought not to have any againſt me, ſeeing it was
not poſſible I ſhould diſoblige you at ſuch time as I had not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to know you. But ever ſince I received that happineſs, I have
acted after a manner wholly contrary: I have pardoned all the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntines,</hi>
I have changed my hatred towards that people into amity,
and ſo have not acted againſt you, but onely during the time I was
not capable of offending you. Therefore be pleaſed, divine Princeſs,
to have compaſſion on me, and do ſomething for a Prince who would
do all for you, and who demands nothing (added he with a tranſport
worthy of <hi>Hannibal</hi>) that you ſhould render him happy till he hath
rendred you the Soveraign of the world.</p>
               <p>After theſe words, my Maſter awaited the anſwer of <hi>Thomira,</hi> who
could not well reſolve to ſpeak; till at length finding her ſelf obliged
thereunto: My Lord (anſwered ſhe) I am conſtrained to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60667:34"/>
that it is very difficult to conſider the great qualities you are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of, and to receive the affects of your generoſity, without much
reſentment, and even (added ſhe bluſhing) without conceiving an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of them, and being glad you were pleaſed to manifeſt them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me. But, My Lord, I conjure you with all my ſoul to contain
your ſelfe within that eſteem, and not to paſs further, but renounce
that weakneſs which may in ſome meaſure ſoile the glory of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and perhaps will onely ſerve to render you unhappy, if it be true that
your happineſs depends upon <hi>Thomira.</hi> For if the Prince <hi>Edeſcon</hi> be yet
amongſt the living, you ought to expect nothing from me: he it is on
whom I depend, and to him onely it is requiſite that you addreſs. But
if his death (proceeded ſhe ſighing) hath rendred me Miſtreſs of my
own inclinations, I cannot favourably yeeld my ſelf to a Prince who
hath cauſed me ſuch a loſs. Ah! Madam, (interrupted he, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
by theſe laſt words) If it were ſo, I ſhould be an innocent cauſe
of it, and you could not be at all equitable, in puniſhing me for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence
which I would have bought off at the price of my life. Scarce
had my Maſter pronounced theſe words, but the Prince of <hi>Celtiberla</hi>
and <hi>Alorca,</hi> entered into the Chamber of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and ſoon after alſo
<hi>Hanno,</hi> leading <hi>Nadalia</hi> in his hand. After <hi>Lucius</hi> had diſcharged and
received the civilities uſual in theſe occaſions. How do you <hi>Nadalia,</hi>
(ſaid the Princeſs to this young beauty) preſume to come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a perſon whom you have incenſed? I acknowledge, Madam,
(anſwered ſhe) you have reaſon to be incenſed againſt me, if you
have any to be ſo againſt ſuch perſons that ſuffer, and that for your
ſake.</p>
               <p>But you may diſcharge your choler if you pleaſe (purſued ſhe with
her uſual pleaſantries) againſt me, and add one unhappineſs to another,
as if the poor <hi>Nadalta</hi> had not ſuffered enough during the time that ſhe
hath been deprived of the honour of ſeeing you. If you had ſuffered
as you ſay (replyed the Princeſs) you might ſoon have given your ſelf
a remedy. Sincerely, Madam, I have ſuffered very much (ſaid <hi>Nada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>)
but to tell you the naked truth, I have not ſuffered ſo much as I
believ'd I ſhould have done; for I have had ſome divertiſement in
beholding <hi>Attanes</hi>'s Troops march away. In truth (replyed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
ſmiling) you have had a ſtrange kind of pleaſure. How, Madam,
(ſaid this lovely Virgin) this pleaſure is greater then you imagine;
not for that I am of the humour of thoſe Ladies who croud to ſee the
arrival of Souldiers; for I ſhould find no pleaſure therein, unleſs they
came as the prince <hi>Lucius</hi> did into <hi>Saguntum;</hi> but I ſhould have the
ſame forwardneſs to ſee them march away; and methinks there is
nothing more agreeable then to behold the departure of an Army.
Nevertheleſs, it is true, that I have quitted this pleaſure to come to
a greater. You are then far from having one unhappineſs upon another
(anſwered the Princeſs) ſince you do not forſake one pleaſure but to
come to a new. You may judge of the greatneſs of it (replyed ſhe)
when you are aſſured that it gave me abſolute contentment, even at ſuch
time as I was abſent from you: and although it were ſhared between the
Prince <hi>Lucius</hi> and me, yet it is true (added ſhe ſoothingly) that it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60667:34"/>
was not comparably great to that which I receive at this preſent. I do
not doubt (anſwered the Princeſs obligingly) but you receive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
at the preſent, ſince you have the goodneſs to receive it when
you give me greater. Alas, Madam (cryed <hi>Nadalia</hi>) I am able to give
nothing to a fair and great Princeſs as you are; and I do not expect ſo
much as divertiſements. You are too modeſt (replyed the Princeſs)
but I preſume the prince <hi>Lucius</hi> will inform me what ſatisfaction it is
you have ſhared with him. <hi>Lucius</hi> (proceeded ſhe, addreſſing to the
Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi>) have you had the ſame pleaſure with <hi>Nadalia?</hi>
Yes, Madam (anſwered he) ſince we ſpoke of nothing but of you. I
am perfectly obliged to you (replyed the Princeſs) but ſhe pronounced
theſe few words with a kind of air ſo ſweet and charming, that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
was awakened from a profound amuſement, whereinto the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
he had made a little before had plunged him. In the mean time
<hi>Nadalia</hi> according to her agreeable humour, told the Princeſs that ſhe
was not ſo much obliged to the prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> as ſhe imagined;
for 'tis I (proceeded ſhe ſmiling) who am the cauſe that he ſpoke lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
concerning you then he would otherwiſe have done, having indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him thereunto by a promiſe that our next diſcourſe ſhould be of
the princeſs of the <hi>Ilargetes.</hi> How? fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> (anſwered my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter)
take care to what you ſay, and do not aggrandize the obligation
when you go about to diminiſh it; for, purſued he, you make ſhew
that a Lover took pleaſure in ſpeaking concerning the princeſs of <hi>Caſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
although it appears that that diſcourſe did defer another which he
was to make afterwards concerning the perſon whom he loved, ſo that
the prince <hi>Lucius</hi> found her diſcourſe agreeable, which moſt other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
would have eſteemed troubleſome and tedions: It is true, My
Lord (anſwered the fair Virgin) that I have not ſpoken according to
the rigour of verity; but it is alſo true, that in this particular my little
experience ſerves to excuſe me. Nevertheleſs I may poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that that which in your apprehenſion repreſents that diſcourſe
troubleſome, may render it extreamly agreeable. For ſeeing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to the prince <hi>Lucius</hi> to ſpeak concerning the Princeſs of the <hi>Iler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes,</hi>
provided he would firſt do ſo of the princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi> I may
ſay, that that promiſe was the cauſe of the diſcourſe that he made me
of her, and that the inducement being pleaſing, the conſequence could
not but be delightful. But I know not, My Lord (added ſhe ſmiling)
if I have not intangled my ſelfe with this effect and the cauſe. I would
to the Gods you were (ſaid <hi>Hanno</hi>) and that I were the cauſe, I would
entangle her after another faſhion, ſaid prince <hi>Lucius,</hi> for I am minded
to quarrel with her. Have you not committed an injuſtice, fair <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia?</hi>
for I am conſtrained ſo to ſtyle you, whatſoever enemy I am
to you; have you not, I ſay, committed an injuſtice in declaring that
I entered upon the diſcourſe of the princely <hi>Thomira,</hi> only as a preface
to that of the Princeſs of the <hi>Ilergetes?</hi> and can you be ignorant that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are always in a readineſs to give themſelves contentment without
the aſſiſtance of others, and that there needs no more but to think upon
the deſired object. Wherefore, fair <hi>Nadalin,</hi> I have not ſpoken of the
princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> but for her own ſake, without regard to your
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60667:35"/>
ſucceeding promiſe; and I conceive it more advantageous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
on the perfections of the beloved perſon, then to confine
them, and narrow them in language; ſo that a converſation of this
kind cannot but retrench ſomewhat of the pleaſure of a Lover, ſince
it ſeems to diſſipate ſome part of thoſe fair Idea's which are the onely
ſource of pleaſure during abſence, and which cauſe ſolitude to be more
deſirable then company and entertainment.</p>
               <p>As the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> had ended theſe words, and obſerved
that <hi>Nadalia</hi> offered no anſwer; How? <hi>Nadalia</hi> (ſaid he) anſwer you
nothing? without falſhood my Lord (anſwered this pleaſing Beauty)
you ought to have given me time to have deviſed a ſutable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
were I ſo skilled in Rhetorick, or rather (ſaid ſhe, ſmiling)
were I a lover, I ſhould ſpeak my own ſentiments as you have ſpoken
yous.</p>
               <p>All this doth not ſatisfie us (replyed <hi>Lucius</hi>) and it is requiſite for
you to defend your Cauſe after another manner, or to confeſs that
you have injuriouſly accuſed me. I ſhall never confeſs that, my Lord,
replyed ſhe, but ſhall rather chuſe to return you an anſwer of any thing
that comes next into my mind upon this occaſion. Wherefore I am of
opinion (proceeded ſhe, with her accuſtomed pleaſantneſs) and I know
not whether this may not be thought the defending of a cauſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
hath ſomething more agreeable in it then penſiveneſs &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
and ſince we cannot ſpeak but of that whereof we think it appears
that converſation affords a double pleaſure, &amp; thence that it is better to
ſpeak then only to ruminate in ſilence. Beſides that words have I know
not what of life &amp; quickneſs in them; and when any one ſpeaks advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
of the perſon we affect, there accrues this ſatisfaction unto
us of ſeeing our own ſentiments approved, and that joynt eſteem of
another authorizing our choiſe. And as for my ſelf, My Lord, (added
ſhe) I would not reſtrain my thoughts in the manner you mention;
for being they would give me nothing but melancholly, I ſhould be
glad to retrench a part of them, by letting them forth in converſation;
but if they purported gladneſs, I ſhould endeavour to increaſe it by
communication.</p>
               <p>Your Reaſons, fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> (replyed <hi>Lucius</hi>) give teſtimony of
your ſuperlative wit beyond mine; but they cannot perſwade me that
you have juſtice on your ſide. As for me (added <hi>Hanno</hi>) raviſh't with
joy to hear the diſcourſe of this amiable Damſel) I believe that it is
difficult to reſiſt the reaſons of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> as it is impoſſible to hold out
againſt the charmes of her beauty. My Maſter after this took his turn,
and expreſt himſelf much to the advantage of this fair <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> interreſſed her ſelfe ſo much in the praiſes that
were given her, that ſhe appeared more obliging with this tenderneſs,
then by all that ſhe could have ſaid her ſelf. <hi>Alorca,</hi> who began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to the Princeſs with an extraordinary zeal, and who teſtified
great alacrity in every thing that concerned either her ſervice or her
inclination, ſaid that <hi>Nadalia</hi> deſerved all that was ſpoken advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
of her, and yet all that had been ſpoken to her advantage was
not all that ſhe deſerved. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Alorca</hi> (anſwered <hi>Thomira</hi>) I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60667:35"/>
conceive it reaſonable that praiſes be applyed to ſome particular quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the perſon that is commended; but that which you have ſaid, is
ſo wide and at large, that it may be applyed generally to perſons of
much merit, and whom we cannot praiſe enough. But, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

You might ſay (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) that the Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> hath

                  </hi> worthy of her eſteem and affection, and ſo you would
ſignifie that which is it more particular and glorious to <hi>Nadalia.</hi> This
young beauty returned no other anſwer then a reverence which ſhe made
with a grace altogether charming: After which, conceiving it now time
to leave the Princeſs, ſhe made her a very pleaſing complement, and
very far from ceremony. <hi>Thomira</hi> embraced and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to his apartment, but <hi>Alcon</hi> who had awaited him, came to do him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,

and after ſome little times conference together, this ſage Senator with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
               <p>The next morning <hi>Lucius</hi> viſited my Maſter, and theſe two Princes

actions to that wherein they were ingaged, as I have related, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſiege of <hi>Saguntum.</hi> Theſe two Princes had ſcarce exchanged
theſe proteſtations of a true and inviolable amity one towards another,
but <hi>Maharbal, Anno</hi> and <hi>Alorca</hi> entered into the Chamber of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation that was made there, was agreeable enough, &amp; when
it happned to be inſenſibly fallen upon the paſsion of <hi>Anno,</hi> every one
ſpoke of the charmes that had given it birth. <hi>Anno</hi> would not make a
myſtery of a paſsion, it was his deſign to have apparent; and being a
great Gallant, and of a noble and open genius, he did not act after the
manner of thoſe cloſe Humoriſts, who believe they do things with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
and handſomneſs when they carry them ſecretly. He was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
there was nothing but what was comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for ſuch a perſon as <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and that he needed not be in fear of letting
that be known, which he was upon the point of declaring to <hi>Alcon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Whereupon he openly affirm'd, that <hi>Nadalia</hi> a perſon of ſo fair
accompliſhments, that it was glory to wear her Chains, and above
all, for my ſelf (added he) who know her better then any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> doth:
for how fair and witty ſoever you apprehend <hi>Nadalia,</hi> ſhe is yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond what you ſee. You have without doubt obſerved (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he) that ſhe hath uaturally an aire of fierceneſs; but I have
perceived that that fierceneſs do's no more then quicken her ſweetneſs,
which without this mixture would have ſomething of leſs brightneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60667:36"/>
I may alſo proceed, that in private converſation, this fair Perſon
hath ſhewed her ſelf more charming, then ſhe appeared in thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you heard her; and without giving me occaſion of preciſely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether ſhe be kind or ſevere, ſhe hath at leaſt made me know that
ſhe is the moſt charming perſon in the world. At this tranſport of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> could not contain themſelves from ſighing,
and yet were unwilling to anſwer, partly becauſe they had a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and partly becauſe they likewiſe were well affected to
<hi>Hanno;</hi> ſo that they contented themſelves with thinking it the violence
of this <hi>Carthaginians</hi>'s paſsion, that induced him to term <hi>Nadalia</hi> the
moſt charming perſon in the world, and hindered him from excepting
the divine <hi>Thomira,</hi> and the fair Princeſs of the <hi>Ilergetes.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
was continued for ſome time, till at length the diſcourſe fell
concerning <hi>Alcon,</hi> and the affairs of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> no perſon preſuming to
make mention of the princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> after which <hi>Lucius</hi> ended
his viſit, deeming it to have been of a reaſonable length. My Maſter
took this time to go to the houſe of <hi>Nadalia</hi>'s Father, whereunto he
was accompanied by <hi>Anno;</hi> for <hi>Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Alorca</hi> left them up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
the departure of <hi>Lucius,</hi> becauſe they underſtood at their firſt coming
to him, that he intended to viſit <hi>Alcon</hi> that morning. The Father of
<hi>Nadalia</hi> received my Maſter with all the reſpect and joy he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs;
and although he was a man of experience and great entend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet he could not ſo well manage his civil reſentment of it, but
that he aggravated it in ſuch terms as were too courtly, and not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
agreeable to the guſt of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Prince turned
the matter by with adreſs, and having anſwered very obligingly to
<hi>Alcon,</hi> he afterwards diſcourſed with him about the rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ration of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum,</hi>
and other affairs conformable to his genius. The <hi>Saguntine</hi>
Senator anſwered alwaies prudently: And for the reparation of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum.</hi>
My Lord (ſaid he) you ſhall ſee that I will act both like a man
whoſe duty it is readily to obey you, and as a Citizen, very zealous
for the good of his Country: ſo that in a ſhort ſpare of time, you
ſhall ſee a fair City, where at preſent there is nothing but the face of
ruines and deſolations. Yet amongſt theſe ruines, anſwered <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
are ſeen the faireſt things in the world: and if I wanted a witneſs to
confirm what I ſay, I believe <hi>Anno</hi> would not refuſe to be one. I ſhall
ever be of that opinion, My Lord (anſwered <hi>Anno,</hi> being well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had begun this diſcourſe) and if it be onely requiſite
but to ſpeak by experience to induce beliefe of what we ſay, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remains
no cauſe for <hi>Alcon</hi> to doubt of my words. The Father of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,</hi>
who had been a brave perſon in his youth, ſmiled at theſe words
of <hi>Anno,</hi> and anſwered that he was not at all ſurpriſed with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions;
for in our time (added he) we were wont to ſpeak advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
of Ladies in all places that we came into; and we ſpoke ſo
freely of them, that we ſoon ſpent our whole ſtock of expreſsions on
them. But there is this difference, replyed <hi>Anno,</hi> that in your time you
ſpoke indifferently to the advantage of all Ladies, whereas we have yet
onely commended thoſe of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> although we have made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
expeditions. I have nothing to anſwer thereunto, replyed the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntine,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60667:36"/>
and though I am of a City whoſe Ladies you commend, yet
I dare not oppoſe the praiſes which I eſteem extreamly juſt, ſince in
my conjecture they tend towards the Princeſs. Without doubt the
Princeſs deſerves more then we can give her, anſwered <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but
yet, ſaid <hi>Hanno,</hi> ſhe is not the onely one to whom they are due; and I
ſhould aſcribe ſome to <hi>Nadalia,</hi> even in the preſence of her Father, did
I believe I could do her perfect juſtice. Do not imagine (continued
he, immediately adreſſing towards <hi>Alcon,</hi> who was about to interrupt
him) that I ſpake flatteringly: I am not com but to beſeech you moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly
to ſuffer me to pretend to the honour of entering into your Alliance,
and to demand this favor of you in the preſence of the Illuſtrious Prince
of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Nevertheleſs I ſhal not repreſent to you the greatneſs of my
birth as means to obtain this honour, ſince few perſons are ignorant what
rank the houſe holds, whereof I am deſcended. But I ſhall content my
ſelfe with onely declaring my paſsion; and if I make this diſcovery
before I have rendered conſiderable ſervices to <hi>Nadalia,</hi> 'tis for that
I believe that all the ſervices which I ſhall ever be able to render her,
can never be worthy to gain me her heart. Wherefore I am expectant
of that from the goodneſs of <hi>Alcon,</hi> which I durſt never hope from
the inclination of <hi>Nadalia;</hi> provided nevertheleſs, that this fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
have no repugnance in following your ſentiments, if they be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
unto me: for to believe that in this caſe, hers ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to yours, is that which I ſhall never have the vanity to
hope.</p>
               <p>Although the propoſal of <hi>Hanno</hi> was extreamly advantageous to the
<hi>Saguntine,</hi> yet <hi>Alcon</hi> judged that it was not requiſite to anſwer expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and taking upon him as it were the port of a Senator, which ſeemed
to be conformable to that a Father is to have when his Daughter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in marriage, he anſwered <hi>Hanno</hi> that he was perfectly obliged
to him for the honour which he offered him, and whereunto he never
durſt have aſpired for <hi>Nadalia:</hi> he told him alſo, that he well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that his houſe was very Illuſtrious, that it had never given place
to any other but that of <hi>Barſa,</hi> and that the greateſt Kings of <hi>Africa</hi>
were oftentimes entered into his Alliance. But according to the cuſtome
(added he) of perſons of this age, who believe that too much conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
cannot be had in engagements of this nature, you may pleaſe to
take a few dayes to try whether you can continue in the good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you have for <hi>Nadalia;</hi> and for my particular, I ſhall employ my
ſelfe in deliberating upon the matter, and taking order for my affairs.
In the mean time I ſhall command <hi>Nadalia</hi> to have the ſame civility
and reſpect for you, ſhe ought to have for a perſon that deſigns to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe
her, and on whom, in appearance, ſhe muſt in a ſhort time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
Ah, happy <hi>Hanno!</hi> (cryed my Maſter) Yes, my Lord, I am ſo
(anſwered <hi>Hanno</hi>) and I am ſo much more, as I believed I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attain it; ſo that, my Lord, continued he, I beg your permiſsion to
caſt my ſelfe at the feet of <hi>Alcon</hi> to return him thanks. Upon which,
<hi>Hanno</hi> having ended theſe words, was caſting himſelf at the feet of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia</hi>'s
Father; but <hi>Alcon</hi> with held him, and proteſted that it was on
his part alone to render thanks, becauſe he was the onely perſon that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60667:37"/>
received advantage in this affair. The great Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
glad to ſee the ſatisfaction of the Father, and the lover of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia;</hi>
and being he had a great kindneſs for <hi>Hanno,</hi> and much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for <hi>Nadalia,</hi> in regard to her particular merits, and much more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of her being extreamly dear to <hi>Thomira,</hi> he reſolved
to contribute ſomething to the ſolemnity and glory of the Marriage.
Wherefore he promiſed <hi>Hanno</hi> the Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the remarkable actions he had performed in the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and charges had been laid upon him; and you ſhall know this day
(added he) in what faſhion I will acquit my ſelfe towards the lovely
<hi>Nadalia</hi> of a promiſe which I have made her. <hi>Alcon</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully
preſented their acknowledgements to my Maſter; and ſoon
after complemented one the other very obligingly, having obſerved
that the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> took pleaſure in the ſight, and that he deſired
not any of that cautious heed and circumſpection between them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
his preſence ſeemed to oblige. But at length, after ſome diſcourſe
together proceeding from the inſpiration of a true and ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>HAnnibal</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> left the <hi>Saguntine</hi> Senator, and came to the houſe
where we were lodged, and there my Maſter ſtayed <hi>Hanno</hi> to Dinner.
But they ſpake together apart for ſome time before they went to the
Table; and we obſerved that <hi>Hanno</hi> could not contain from expreſſing
himſelf extreamly ſatisfied, and that that converſation had been above
meaſure advantageous unto him.</p>
               <p>After Dinner the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> went to <hi>Thomira,</hi> where the
company was without queſtion very fair, ſeveral Ladies of <hi>Saguntum</hi>
being reſorted thither; and beſides them there was alſo <hi>Lucius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbal,
Alorca, Adherbal,</hi> and <hi>Magar.</hi> the converſation when it began
was extreamly agreeable, although ſufficiently ſerious; for <hi>Nadalia</hi>
did not ſeem to be ſo frolick and pleaſant this day as formerly. Every
one attaqued her; and when ſhe began a little to diſingage her ſelf,
ſhe became incomparably more intricated, till at length ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Hanno</hi> entering into the Chamber of the Princeſs. It is impoſsible
to expreſs the admirable effects the preſence of <hi>Hanno</hi> produced; it
ſuffices to tell that the fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> bluſhed aſſoon as ſhe firſt perceived
him, and preſently made him a more reſpectful reverence then ſhe
was accuſtomed to do. After which ſhe ſeemed to be ſo amuſed
and perplexed, that all the company reſented I know not what kind
of emotion beyond my power to expreſs; but <hi>Hanno</hi> was more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
affected with it then all the reſt, and felt himſelf almoſt extaſi'd
by a ſecret joy (as he related after) wherewith that ſight charmed him.
He alſo perceived that the red in the countenance of the fair <hi>Nadalia,</hi>
was different from that which ariſes from averſion or choler: for indeed
it was not difficult to <hi>Hanno,</hi> who was a lover, to make that diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how ever it might have been to the reſt of the company. For in
the like occaſions as this, Love is not ſo blind as men ſay; but on the
contrary it may be conceived, that a Lover reads very many things in
the air of the beloved perſon which are inviſible to one that is diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed,
although ſuch a one may generally judge more reaſonably in
all other concernments. But <hi>Hanno</hi> underſtood that it was onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60667:37"/>
painted that ſcarlet in his Miſtriſs cheek; and therefore perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no token of averſion or diſtaſte in the viſage of this fair Perſon,
he was ſo perfectly ſatisfied, that he continued a few moments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing what he was to do. Till at length approaching towards
<hi>Thomira,</hi> and making a low reverence to that Illuſtrious Princeſs, he
preſented her (as we knew ſoon after) the Gift of the Principality of
<hi>Oreta,</hi> which <hi>Hannibal</hi> beſtowed on <hi>Nadalia.</hi> If the Preſent which
my Maſter made, had not been of ſo great importance, yet the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
wherewith he did it, could not but be extreamly obliging; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that <hi>Thomira</hi> ſhould give the principality which <hi>Nadalia</hi> received
and that <hi>Anno</hi> ſhould onely ſeem to have taken care of the affair. All
that underſtood the thing were as ſtrangely ſurpriſed at the unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe
of it, as they were extreamly ſatisfied with the Gallantry.
The <hi>Saguntine</hi> Dames were not leſſe pleaſed with the matter, then any
other concerned perſon could be, and inſtead of envious ſentiments, at
the advancements of their equal, they teſtified onely a joy which
was remarkably ſincere and pure. But <hi>Thomira</hi> had not the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions;
the ſatisfaction which ſhe received was blended with ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of diſguſt: and if this Illuſtrious Perſon was pleas'd to behold
<hi>Nadalia</hi> ſuddenly preferr'd, ye ſhe could not but with impatience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
that <hi>Thomira</hi> was anew obliged to the Prince of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſhe refuſed a long time the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſing that into the hands of <hi>Nadalia</hi>
which <hi>Anno</hi> had put into hers, although ſhe did it with ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
which had nothing at all or rudeneſſe, but very much of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and civility. At length, ſhe told my Maſter, that things were
far better when they iſſued from their proper ſource, and ſo <hi>Nadalia</hi>
ought to receive from the hands of Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a gift which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to loſe ſomething of its value when it paſſed through theſe of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Maſter was not backward with his return, to tell the Princeſs,
that ſhe might give all, ſince ſhe was Miſtreſs of all: and although it
were not ſo, Madam (continued he) yet ought not I to cauſe this
preſent to paſs through your fair hands to make it more conſiderable?
Beſides, that I know not whether <hi>Anno</hi> would reſent it well, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia</hi>
ſhould receive a preſent from my hands. The Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi>
did notwithſtanding ſtill perſiſt in denial; but <hi>Hannibal</hi> was inſtant
with her with ſo much addreſs, and the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> added his
prayers thereunto ſo ſucceſsfully, that at length the fair Princeſs put
into the hands of <hi>Nadalia</hi> the Gift of the Principality of <hi>Oreta.</hi> This fair
Damſel was ſo aſtoniſh'd, that at firſt ſhe believed nothing of what ſhe
had ſeen. But when ſhe underſtood that it was the Illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi>
that made her ſuch a gift, and the Illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi> extreamly amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
ſhe at length believed, what otherwiſe ſhe could not have done;
and making a low reverence to the Princeſs, ſhe without vanity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the important Preſent which was made her, and then turned
to render thanks to the Princeſs. But <hi>Thomira</hi> giving her to know, that
it was the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to whom her addreſſes were due, ſhe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
offered her ſelfe to him; but he interrupted her, and told her that
he intended to have made a complement to her himſelf, after he had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60667:38"/>
demanded the permiſſion of the Princeſs. But <hi>Nadalia</hi> was no ſooner
out of the arms of <hi>Thomira,</hi> who embraced and kiſſed her with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
tenderneſs, but <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> made their comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto her: The Ladies likewiſe made theirs afterwards, as alſo did
<hi>Maharbal, Anno, Alorca, Adherbal,</hi> and <hi>Magar;</hi> ſo that the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
was ſpent in a very agreeable confuſion, and inſtead of <hi>Nada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>'s
ſpeaking, all the ſpeech was turned upon <hi>Nadalia.</hi> About evening
<hi>Alcon</hi> came to render thanks to the Prince of <hi>Carthage;</hi> he aſſured him
of an inviolable fidelity, and was ſo diffuſe and eloquent in extolling
the magnificence of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that it would be difficult for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it to you: He told him, that it belonged to none but to the great
Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> to make ſuch Preſents, and to make them to
perſons which could not deſerve them; So that, my Lord (continued
he) it cannot be ſaid that you recompence, but rather that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a largeſs, intirely pure and glorious. My Maſter, anſwered <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
very obligingly; after which this Senator preſented to him two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of a ſufficient comely aſpect, who were the Delegates of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi>
which <hi>Thomira</hi> would not admit, till they had firſt aſſured the Prince
<hi>Hannibal</hi> of their ſervices and reſpects. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhall alwaies receive
you (ſaid my Maſter to the Delegates embracing them) but he will
receive you as friends, not as Delegates; for 'tis our Princeſs alone
(added he, being carried by his paſſion) that ought to give audience
in what ever place ſhe be. He after made a thouſand civilities to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates,
and did not ſend them back, till he had firſt conferred on them
very magnificent preſents.</p>
               <p>The next morning my Maſter went to viſit the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi>
whereas the converſation came to fall concerning the Delegates of
<hi>Caſtulon, Lucius</hi> ſaid he thought it fit the Princeſſe ſhould make the
journey they came to beſeech her to. The people of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) have of long time deſired ardently to ſee her; and although it
were not ſo, yet we ought not to be averſe in removing the Princeſſe
from a place which cannot but appear to her very lamentable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate.
My Maſter was preſently of this opinion, it ſeemed ſo juſt
and advantageous to the repoſe of <hi>Thomira;</hi> ſo that <hi>Lucius, Alcon,
Nadalia,</hi> and the Delegates of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> made their propoſal the ſame
day, and obtained that of the Princeſs which they demanded. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it was not without many intreaties and inſtances, becauſe <hi>Thomira</hi>
alledged ſhe could not reſolve to forſake <hi>Saguntum,</hi> nor to go take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> at a time wherein ſhe knew not what was become of
the Prince her Father. <hi>Lucius</hi> did not fail to anſwer to every particular,
and to preſs his fair Couſin ſo far, that ſhe at length promiſed to depart
when ever it ſhould ſeem good to him. My Maſter had no ſooner learnt
from <hi>Lucius</hi> the reſolution of the Princeſſe, but he gave all orders
that were neceſſary, and cauſed all proviſions to be ſo diligently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
that within two days all was in readineſſe for this departure.
It were impoſſible for me to deſcribe all there was of ſplendid, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and pompous in this journey: it ſuffices to ſay that <hi>Thomira, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,</hi>
and ten or twelve fair Ladies of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> compoſed this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that <hi>Hannibal, Lucius, Anno, Alorca,</hi> and ſeveral other great
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60667:38"/>
                  <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Saguntine</hi> Lords, waited upon theſe Ladies, whilſt
<hi>Maharb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l, Adherbal,</hi> and <hi>Magar,</hi> conducted the Troops. But as it is
impoſſible to deſcribe exactly the gallantry and ſplendor of this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
ſo alſo muſt it not be tolerated to omit wholly this fair part of my
Narration in ſilence. Therefore I am bold to aſſure you, that never
was any thing ſeen ſo magnificent in Habil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ments, Chariots, Horſes,
and all kind of accoutrements that might adde luſtre to the Equipage.
<hi>Anno</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> were very gallantly cloathed, and the Princeſs who
had refuſed all care that was offered to adorne her, appeared notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
very comely and admirably fair, in a Gown of white ſilk,
guarded with a little broydery of ſilver. <hi>Lucius</hi> was very well adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
although he was abſent from the Princeſs of the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ergetes,</hi> and his
aſpect was ſo high and noble, that without queſtion he would have
born the glory away from all men, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had not been in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But without exaggeration, I may ſay that my Illuſtrious Maſter
appeared in this re-encounter, although it were onely a piece of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
ſomething above that which men ſeem to be; and his great
and fierce minde was yet more advantaged by the care he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his attendants to uſe in dreſſing him magnificently during his
voyage. On the day of the departure he wore a ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tely Coat of Arms
of purple, which the <hi>Tyrians</hi> had preſented him with, and which was
all embroidered with Pearls, and beſet with a prodigious number of
Stones of great price, which caſt a ſparkling luſtre on all ſides: his
head was not covered but with a ſmall Helmet, garniſhed with the
faireſt plumes that were ever ſeen in <hi>Africa:</hi> he bore a javelin in his
right hand, and on his left ſide a ſword enamelled with Diamonds, on
which he had not yet da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to put any Tokens of his love to avoid
the diſpleaſure of his Princeſs. That which admirably ſet off all theſe
ornaments, was a brave white Steed whereon my Maſter was mounted
for this day, which was ſo goodly and proud, that the like had ſcarce
ever been ſeen in our Countries, where notwithſtanding you know
are bred the goodlieſt Horſes in the world. To all this muſt be added,
that the Prince of whom I ſpake, was a young Conqueror, that had
filled the whole earth with the fame of his Victories.</p>
               <p>It would be alſo requiſite to deſcribe the aſpect which animated all
this bravery and imprinted reſpect, and oftentimes fear in the breaſts
of thoſe which beheld it, were it not ſufficient to ſay that I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the famous <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Of whom having thus largely dilated, I
ſhould be unwilling to reſolve to deſcribe the other perſons who were
of this company, were it not that I am obliged thereunto, and that I
conceive it neceſſary to inform you of ſome particularities, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comprehending of ſome great paſſages which I have to recount
you. You may pleaſe therefore to know, my Lords, That <hi>Alorca,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the departure of <hi>Attanes,</hi> commanded all the Auxiliary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roops,
and that notwithſtanding this employment, he was ſo wholly bent to
be near the Princeſs during all this voyage, that he left the conduct
of his Troops to the inferior Officers, and alwayes marched with
<hi>Hannibal, Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Anno,</hi> by the ſide of the chariot of <hi>Thomira,</hi> in
wich alſo <hi>Nadalia</hi> was with a fair Virgin of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> her Couſin. All
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60667:39"/>
the world believed at firſt, that this deportment of <hi>Alorca</hi> proceeded
onely from his ambition; but there were ſome perſons that obſerved
it ſo narrowly, that they ſoon ſuſpected a piece of the truth, and ſaw
that ambition did not raign alone in his ſoul. For <hi>Alorca</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of melancholly, and muſing at ſuch times as all the world di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
themſelves; and it is certain that he was the onely perſon that
never ſpake to <hi>Nadalia,</hi> againſt whom all the world had engaged to
endeavour the overthrow of a perſon who had appeared redoubtable
in the converſations which had been made at <hi>Sagunium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubject of them was likewiſe very agreeable, for <hi>Alcon</hi> who was
one in this journey, had given his word that the Mariage of <hi>Nada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
ſhould be ſolemnized at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> ſo that this fair perſon looking
upon <hi>Anno</hi> as a man deſign'd to eſpouſe her, and alſo eſteeming him
a perſon commendable for many noble qualifications; ſhe ſometimes
gave teſtimonies of the favourable inclinations ſhe had towards him.
Not that <hi>Anno</hi> had made very great progreſs in the heart of <hi>Nadalia,</hi>
the conqueſt of which was too difficult to coſt ſo little time, and ſo few
ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces: but it may be conceived that the worth of this <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
joyned with the commandment of a Father, had not acted without
ſome ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not entertain you, my Lords (ſaid <hi>Aſpar</hi>) with other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities
of this voyage, nor hold you in a relation of the commodious
reception of the whole company in all places, my Maſter having taken
an admirable order for all thoſe concernments: onely this you may
pleaſe to underſtand, that on the ſixt day of our travail we arived at
<hi>Caſtulon,</hi> where the people received the Princeſs and her Illuſtrious
Company with infinite rejoycings and acclamations: five or ſix dayes
were ſpent in Feaſtings and publick ſports, which the Princeſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to permit, notwithſtanding the abſence of <hi>Edeſcon:</hi> after which
ſhe took order for the affairs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and all that depended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But before diſpoſing of the charges ſhe had to beſtow, ſhe made
a complement to my Maſter, and told him that ſhe durſt not intreat
the great Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> to take into his hands the diſpoſal of them:
yet it is fit, my Lord (added ſhe with great civility) that I take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to offer ſmall things unto you; for if I expected till I could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
you with ſomething worthy of you, I ſhould without doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait
unprofitably. My Maſter returned the Princeſs thanks with much
reſpect; and if you will not, Madam (proceeded he) offer me things
which you judge not worthy of me, give me, I beſeech you, divine
Princeſs, ſuch as I acknowledge my ſelf unworthy of; that is, added
he ſighing, ſome proof of your goodneſſe, and ſome ſmall teſtimony
of your inclinations. <hi>Hannibal</hi> pronounced theſe words with an ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo
paſſionate, that <hi>Thomira</hi> was a little touched with them. And as ſhe was
about to anſwer him, and perhaps favourably too, the Prince of <hi>Celti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,
Alcon,</hi> and <hi>Alorca,</hi> interrupted her by entering her Chamber,
where was made afterwards no other then a General converſation. In
the mean time <hi>Anno,</hi> who was upon the point of becoming happy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to <hi>Alcon,</hi> whoſe apartment was in the Palace of <hi>Thomira,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
the favour of him to delay his felicity no longer. But aſſoon as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60667:39"/>
he had communicated this deſign to <hi>Nadalia,</hi> that fair perſon oppoſed
it, and conjured <hi>Hanno</hi> in terms ſo powerful, that it was impoſſible for
the paſſionate <hi>Carthaginian</hi> to reſiſt ſuch prayers. You may well judge,
<hi>Hanno</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) that 'tis not out of averſion that I oppoſe your
deſign: If I have yet any repugnance to become engaged for my whole
life, it is not by reaſon of any conſideration of yours; and I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
your propoſal terrible, but onely becauſe it muſt neceſſarily
ſeparate me from the Princeſs, and becauſe I have a certain humour
which is not yet diſpoſed to an engagement of this kind. Therefore
give me two or three dayes if you pleaſe, to reſolve my ſelf abſolutely
upon it, and I promiſe you that I will endeavour to ſerve the Prince of
<hi>Carthage;</hi> for in brief (added ſhe) I ſhall labour for the advantage of
the Princeſs, when I ſhall endeavour to overcome a ſcruple in her
breaſt, which is oppoſite to the happineſs of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and I ſhall have
the ſatisfaction to contribute ſomething to the contentment of a great
Prince, to whom I am importantly obliged: and to tell you the truth
(proceeded ſhe) I ſhould be glad that the Princeſs ſhould become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
firſt, to avoid the regret of having began to ſeparate myſelf from
her. <hi>Nadalia</hi> pronounced theſe words with ſo much grace, and a kind
of pleaſing freedom, that <hi>Hanno</hi> found himſelf cloſely encountred; he
was about to obey and rebel at the ſame time, and his irreſolution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to manifeſtly in his countenance, that <hi>Nadalia</hi> obſerved it. In
the name of the immortal Gods, <hi>Hanno,</hi> (replyed this fair perſon) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
me this—Ah, cruel <hi>Nadalia</hi> (interrupted <hi>Hanno</hi>) do not do
me the injury to believe that I will diſobey you. I have onely
one paſſion in my ſoul, which you have given birth to there; ſo that
the trouble which you obſerve is no Rebellion. it proceeds from that
paſſion alone which combates it ſelfe, and which would deem it ſelfe
weak, did it not act both for you in this occaſion and againſt you.
'Tis not that I am unreſolved to do all you require of me: but I might
accuſe you of having produced too many reaſons, where there needed
but one command. I will obey you in all things, <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doubt it, ſince I obey you in this occaſion.</p>
               <p>As they were in theſe terms, they beheld <hi>Alcon</hi> enter, who came
from <hi>Thomira,</hi> who having ſaluted <hi>Hanno,</hi> It is fit (ſaid he to him) that
according to the cuſtome of the world, I impart you ſome news which
will ſurpriſe you, and tell you that the Princeſs hath conferr'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> upon <hi>Alorca.</hi> But it muſt be confeſs'd (purſued he
with an air wholly ſerious) That this fair Princeſs, as young as ſhe is,
is the moſt judicious perſon in the world. She repreſented me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
reaſons which obliged her to chuſe <hi>Alorca</hi> to fill this charge: ſhe
gave me to underſtand, that there was jealouſie between the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Families of <hi>Castulon,</hi> which pretended to this imployment; &amp; that ſo
it was meet to intruſt it with a ſtronger, to extinguiſh that jealouſie; ſhe
alſo made me know, that ſhe was glad to have acquitted her ſelfe in any
meaſure towards the Prince of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which regard ſhe preferred
<hi>Alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ca,</hi> and that even before the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> becauſe he had ſerved
<hi>Hannibal</hi> without being obliged unto it; ſhe chooſe him, by reaſon of
his being a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and conſequently could not but underſtand bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60667:40"/>
then the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> in what ſort a people of <hi>Spain</hi> ought to be
governed: beſides, that ſhe believe'd <hi>Alorca</hi> would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in point of fidelity, becauſe, for ſome time, as you know, he
hath bent himſelf towards her with an extraordinary zeal. <hi>Hanno</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
an anſwer approving yet more the choiſe which <hi>Thomira</hi> had
made, and added many reaſons to thoſe of <hi>Alcon,</hi> and ſo ſpent his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
in ſpeaking of any other thing then the ſubject which induced to go
to the Father of <hi>Nadalia.</hi> But the amiable Daughter of <hi>Alcon</hi> began
immediately to act in favour of my Maſter; ſhe communicated her
deſign to <hi>Lucius,</hi> who approved it extreamly; and as he conceived it
advantageous to <hi>Thomira,</hi> he promiſed to concur on his part, and to
repreſent to his fair Couſin that ſhe ought not to be obſtinate in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of a thing which a thouſand reaſons ſhould cauſe her to accept. But
that which was yet more rare, was, that the ſame day alſo, the people of
<hi>Caſtulon</hi> began to talk that it was fit the Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> ſhould mary the
Prince <hi>Hannibal;</hi> &amp; there were ſome ſo bold as to go even into the Court
of the Palace, and ſay aloud, that the Princeſs, as judicious as ſhe was,
had no reaſon to refuſe for a Husband, the greateſt Prince of the world.
My Maſter himſelfe impoſed ſilence to them, which ſpake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and was ſo apprehenſive, that the bruit which was abroad, might
diſtaſte his Princeſs, that he made great liberalities to cauſe all zealous
perſons to hold their peace, which without doubt many other perſons
would have encouraged to ſpeak out in the like conjuncture. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
true, that <hi>Thomira</hi> was troubled at this indiſcreet zeal; that ſhe
was through diſcontent retired into her Cabinet, and if the preſence of
<hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia,</hi> who together came to wait upon her, had not been
ſome conſolation, ſhe would unqueſtionably have reſented much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſturbance.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> (ſaid ſhe) have you obſerved the levity
of the people of <hi>Caſtulon?</hi> and do you not remark that it ſeems they
have not been ſo deſirous to ſee me, and forward to receive me with
expreſſions of joy, but to render me this day more neerly ſenſible of
their inſolence. It is certain (added ſhe a little moved) that Princes
would be unhappy enough, if they were bound to follow the humour
of the people, and indeed more unhappy then their ſubjects; for theſe
have the ſatisfaction of being ſubject onely to perſons that act uſually
according to reaſon, whereas Princes would be obliged to follow the
ſentiments of the people, who ordinarily act onely by caprichio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and
conceit. Nevertheleſs, Madam (anſwered <hi>Lucius</hi>) this of <hi>Caſtulon</hi>
believes they have acted according to reaſon, and to your advantage;
although to ſpeak reaſonably, it is not fitting for people to attempt,
even commendable things, in tumult; and I believe their beſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
become criminal, when they are explicated in a ſeditious manner.
Wherefore we may conjecture that 'tis the manner of acting that hath
provoked you, and not the ſubject, which makes the people of <hi>Caſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
murmur: for, Madam, this being no wiſe diſadvantageous to you, I
cannot perſwade my ſelfe that it ought to be diſagreeable to you, I
ſhall paſs further, Madam (ſaid <hi>Nadalia</hi>) then the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi>
and aver that you ought to be glad of this tumult; and being you have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60667:40"/>
a ſcrupulous virtue (which, perhaps, you ought not to follow ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely)
there is reaſon for you to be ſatisfied, that there is occaſion to
believe that the prayers of your people extort a conſentment from you,
which you otherwiſe dare not give, and which beſides will inſtate you
in the regency of half the world. This is not all, Madam (continued
ſhe) let us conſider things in their true colours: Can you ſee in the
world a Prince more puiſſant, goodly, and that can bring you more
honour? And although the Illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhould not have done
what he hath to gain your eſteem, could you refuſe it him after that
which he hath done to day. For ſincerely it is very admirable, that in
your conſideration, he hath ſilenced the people who ſpoke not but in
his favour. How, <hi>Nadalia</hi> (interrupted the Princeſs) is it poſsible that
I ſhould owe an obligation of this nature to the Prince <hi>Hannibal?</hi> There
is nothing more true then what I have ſaid (replyed <hi>Nadalia</hi>) and it is
certain, Madam, that the generous Prince of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the fear he
had this bruit might diſguſt you, reſolved to extinguiſh it: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a matter of difficulty to effect, and that he could not think of ill-entreating
perſons that acted for his advantage, he hath accompliſh'd
it by ſo great liberalites, that one may ſay that the ſame time he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a whole people to hold their peace, he gave them a new ſubject to
talk of. But, Madam (continued he) if after a ſerious diſourſe. I
might be permitted to reſume a kind of air, for which I have often
been warr'd upon, I ſhould onely deſcribe to you the conduct of <hi>Alor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi>
he ſudenly hath appeared all pale and troubled; he trembled even
at his enterance into the Palace, at leaſt I have been told ſo, and ſaid
and did ſuch things as I am not curious to relate unto you; for did I
know them really; Madam, I ſhould know more then he doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged (replyed the Princeſs, all ſurpriſed with
this diſcourſe) that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is extreamly generous, and that that
Prince which was formerly repreſented to me all fierce and violent,
ha's tranſcendent civility in his actions. But it muſt alſo be confeſſed
that there is a kind of fallacity which cauſeth me to have theſe Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to that Prince, rather then to the perſons I might expect them
from; for ſetting aſide <hi>Hannibal's</hi> calming the bruit we ſpoke of, doth
it not ſeem that <hi>Alorca</hi> who hath both wit and courage, loſeth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of both in this occaſion, to the end <hi>Hannibal</hi> alone ſhould
oblige me? In verity I do not comprehend the intrigue of this manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but find ſomething in it not conformable to the wonted order
of things; and in a word, I believe that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is deſtined to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is great and ſurpriſing. My Maſter entered about the
end of theſe words, and underſtanding by <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the converſation, he did not afford the Princeſs time to thank
him, but rendered her his own remerciments for her ſingular good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and this with very much reſpect, and yet with as great fear, as he
ſhould have had, if he had excited the tumult which he appeaſed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid this paſsionate Prince, you have the goodneſs to take notice
of a thing of my doing, which a thouſand others might have done,
and yet do not obſerve that which is far greater in me; and which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60667:41"/>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> alone is capable of doing: Yes, Madam, a thouſand Princes
may ſerve you,a thouſand adore you, and a thouſand dye for <hi>Thomira;</hi>
but, divine Princeſs (added he with a tranſport) no perſon can adore
you in the manner that <hi>Hannibal</hi> adores you; he reſents for you that
which he alone is capable to reſent; and hath ſo great reſpects for the
Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> that he could imagine nothing greater, did not he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unceſſantly to the infinite merit which hath given them birth. The
paſſionate diſcourſe of my Maſter raiſed ſuch a freſh vermilion in the face
of the fair <hi>Thomira,</hi> who daring not to behold <hi>Hannibal,</hi> nor <hi>Lucius,</hi>
nor <hi>Nadalia,</hi> remained as aſtoniſhed inſtead of being able to anſwer.
Speak, Madam, ſpeak (ſaid the generous <hi>Celtiberian</hi>) but be pleaſed to
ſpeak in ſuch ſort that the prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> have no cauſe to accuſe you
of ingratitude. How, Madam? (added <hi>Nadalia</hi>) can you obſerve what
the Illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi> does for you and yours, without doing for
him that which even virtue obliges you to. Alas (anſwered the fair
<hi>Thomira</hi> (ſighing) who could have thought that <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi>
ſhould take the ſide of the prince of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> againſt the prince
of the <hi>Saguntines?</hi> We ſpeak to the advantage of <hi>Edeſcon</hi> (returned
<hi>Lucius</hi>) and to take away all pretext of refuſing that which we demand,
we ſhall agree that you act according to the ſentiments of the Queen of
<hi>Celtiberia:</hi> You are not ignorant what an extraordinary tenderneſs ſhe
hath for you: that ſhe hath alwayes been in place of a Mother to you;
and that ſhe will never be induced to do any thing which the Prince her
brother might diſapprove; ſo that, Madam, we ſhall ſend a diſpatch
this day to the King and the Queen of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> to let them know the
pretenſions of the prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and ſhall afterwards act according
to their anſwer. Not (added he) but that <hi>Edeſcon</hi> may come before we
have news from <hi>Celtiberia;</hi> for although he were gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſome
other potent Confederate to procure ſuccour againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he will
nevertheleſs not fail to come aſſoon as he ſhall know with what reſpects
<hi>Hannibal</hi> treats the Princeſs his Daughter, and to change his ſentiments
upon ſo apparant evidences that his enemies have changed theirs, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
yet further, and promiſe you to give you within eight days per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
intelligence of <hi>Edeſcon:</hi> For <hi>Alcon,</hi> on whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
this affair, demands no longer time to diſcover a truth, whereof he
hath already great conjectures.</p>
               <p>After theſe words <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> further importuned <hi>Thomira,</hi>
and at length did it ſo ſuccesfully, that ſhe became mollified and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.
My Maſter immediately caſt himſelfe at her feet, and uttered ſo
tender expreſſions, that ſhe was yet more affected therewith, then with
all that ſhe had heard. She offered to raiſe up my Maſter, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth her hand for that purpoſe, the paſſionate prince bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to kiſs it, and believed that for all his pains and ſervices he had now
received a recompence too glorious. But <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> had more
favourable judgements for him, and had no ſooner appeaſed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
who was diſguſted with the freedom of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but they told
her that ſhe ought to give the Prince leave to hope to be happy. <hi>Thomira</hi>
anſwered nothing, but gave ſuch teſtimony that ſhe began to have
ſome good will towards my Maſter, that her ſilence was interpreted an
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60667:41"/>
probation, and <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> received extream ſatisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
It is not neceſſary to ſpeak of the joy my Maſter reſented; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I am not able to repreſent his exceſs, I ſhall be contented to tell you;
that the ſame day a Courrier was diſpatch'd to the Court of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi>
a certain bruit was ſpread through the City of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> that the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of <hi>Thomira</hi> was concluded; and this rumour was the cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e that it
was afterwards publiſhed over all the world, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was married
at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> though none could ever tell the particulars of his marriage.
Upon which the whole City began moſt extraordinary revelling, ſo that
I ſhould have enough to ſpeak of the publick Sports and Feſtivals, with
the matches of racing and gallantry made thereupon, were I not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to deſcribe to you in the ſequel of my diſcourſe, all the bravery
and magnificence my Maſter ſhewed in <hi>Campania,</hi> where after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Canna,</hi> he went to find the Princeſs inſtead of going to <hi>Rome:</hi> for I
ſhall let you ſee that the delights of <hi>Cupua</hi> ſo much talked of, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
another thing from that which is reported, and that they would
have had nothing in them but Illuſtrious, had they not arreſted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
of my Illuſtrious Maſter. Nevertheleſs theſe divertiſements of
<hi>Campania</hi> could never intirely ſatisfie <hi>Hannibal;</hi> The Prince hath ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a thouſand times in the delicious <hi>Capua;</hi> and this great perſon, in
what place ſoever he was, could never taſte any contentments without
mixture, as you will ſoon ſee he was extreamly unhappy at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> at
the ſame time he believed himſelfe raiſed to a ſupream felicity. For as all
things were in the beſt poſture he could wiſh, and on the ſame day the
meſſenger of <hi>Lucius</hi> ariv'd, according to the account made of the way,
my Maſter went to wait upon the Princeſs, where he was with ſuch joy
as could be reſented by a young Prince, who hath very great Love and
Hope. He found onely <hi>Alorca</hi> in the Princeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Chamber, ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
himſelf leſs then if he had been in a great company (although
<hi>Thomira</hi> alone was to him inſtead of all the world) and permitted the
effects of his ſpirit to act with liberty, impreſſing upon his aſpect all
the tokens of an exceſſive joy.</p>
               <p>Well, Madam, (ſaid he, with ſome kind of quickneſs and life in his
air) will you have the goodneſs to follow the ſentiments of the Queen
your Aunt, and may I hope to be happy, if they be favourable unto me?
My Lord (anſwered the Princeſs) I am oblig'd to oppoſe them, if they
be ſuch as you ſpeak of. How, Madam, (replyed <hi>Hannibal</hi> immediately
in much trouble) will you reſiſt the ſentiments of the Queen of <hi>Celtibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
if they be advantageous unto me? Have you not conſented to my
happineſs, but only to let me be ovewhelmed at once with a loſs the moſt
dreadful and bitter in the world? I had many diſpoſitions (anſwered
<hi>Thomira</hi>) not to oppoſe very rigorouſly the requeſts of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia;</hi>
but I do not conceive I poſitively conſented to that which they
importun'd me for. An expreſs conſent, Madam (replyed my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter)
ought not to be expected from a Princeſs as you are; and I ſhould
be too happy to ſee you diſpos'd to accord me ſo much, although things
were in a condition requiſite to advance me to this glory. But, Madam,
(continued he) is it poſſible that you ſhould change ſo cruelly againſt
me? and that a Princeſs, ſuch as the divine <hi>Thomira,</hi> can act in a manner
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60667:42"/>
which ſeems to me indeed ſtrange and ſurpriſing. Perhaps you will not
be ſurpriſed with it (replyed <hi>Thomira</hi>) if you knew the reaſons which
oblige me to act in this ſort. I ſhall anſwer your reaſons, Madam (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
he) and I engage my ſelf to make it appear they cannot be
important.</p>
               <p>You would change your mind, without doubt (ſaid the Princeſs) if
it were expedient for me to diſcover them. Ah, Madam (interrupted
he) will you not diſcover them? My Lord (replyed ſhe) I muſt not
do it. How, Madam (cryed he, permitting himſelfe to his diſpair, and
the violence of his humour) muſt you not do it? you muſt do it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;
and moreover (added he fiercely) you ought to conſider who I
am; you ought to conſider that you have deſtroyed me, and that to
render ruine inevitable, you have the cruelty to ſuffer me to be ignorant
of the cauſe.</p>
               <p>After theſe words, the Prince perceiving himſelf not maſter enough
of his paſſion, went forth of <hi>Thomira</hi>'s Chamber, and retired to his
own, where he was during ſome time agitated with many contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes.
And, well, <hi>Thomira</hi> (ſaid he at laſt) as if the Princeſs had
been in the Chamber where he walked) well, cruel <hi>Thomira!</hi> unjuſt
<hi>Thomira!</hi> do you not conſider who I am? have you forgot what I have
done for you? and without reſpect to the Empire, I have over divers
Nations, or to the adoration I bear you, having been ready to dye for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you, you puſh me upon the precipice, and to enhance your cruelty yet
more, you adde all inhumane circumſtances to my inhappineſs: yes,

ſince you ſeem not to to raiſe me to felicity, but to precipitate me in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
into the greateſt of all miſeries, and imploy this terrible afterclap
as a new kind of puniſhm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t to torment me more ſenſibly. Are you

                  </gap>t knowing for
why? and are you not injuſt to keep me ignorant of the cauſe of my
unhappineſs, to the end I may have no power to addreſs it? The grief
of <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſpent it ſelf in this complaint, ſo that the Prince came to
himſelfe after a few moments, and demanded pardon of the princeſs,
and uttered with a calmer tone a hundred things contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
Fair <hi>Thomira</hi> (ſaid he) adoreable <hi>Thomira!</hi> I am culpable; and the
reproaches alone which I have raged againſt, render me worthy of a
thouſand deaths. I have dared to ſay that you ought to have regard who
I am, and did not conſider that I am a monſter come from <hi>Africa</hi> to
<hi>Spain,</hi> to the calamity of the faireſt Princeſs of the world: and though I
had done all things for you, had I done more then I ought; and ſhould
you have been obliged to me, ſince all I could have done, would have
but ſerved to appeaſe the ſorrow I have cauſed you. It is true, <hi>Thomira,</hi>
that you have promiſed me all, and afterwards denyed me all; but, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Princeſs, when you promiſed me all, you did me an act of Grace,
and I have therefore no reaſon to complain when you grant me nothing,
ſince you are not obliged to give me the Treaſure which I have deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and whereof I acknowledge my ſelf unworthy.</p>
               <p>This is not all my crime, fair <hi>Thomira,</hi> I have carried it further, and
murmured at my condemnation, when you would not declare the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60667:42"/>
for which I was condemned. Ought not I to conſider, O <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi>
that you always act with juſtice; and that being the Soveraign of
my life, you are not obliged to render me account of what you do, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when you diſpoſe of nothing but what is your own: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Thomira,</hi> I ſhall expiate my crime in your preſence, and waſh it
out it with my blood; if you refuſe me the pardon, which I ſhall ſue
for at your feet.</p>
               <p>He was going forth after theſe words; but it was told him, that
<hi>Alcon</hi> attended to ſee him, to communicate to him an affair of great
importance. Let him enter (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) which he had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, but the Prince demanded of him, if <hi>Thomira</hi> were inflexible.
My Lord (anſwered the <hi>Saguntine</hi>) I am come to tell you things that
will ſurprize you, which I had from the relation of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> while you
were with the Princeſs, You know (continued he) that <hi>Attanes</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
loves the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon;</hi> but you have not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
that that King cauſed <hi>Edeſcon</hi> to be carried away from <hi>Saguntum,</hi>
that he retains him at preſent, and pretends to give him protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you. But, my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ought not to be aſtoniſhed if <hi>Attanes</hi>
told you, he had a means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the heart of <hi>Thomira,</hi> ſeeing he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
he had the diſpoſal or that of <hi>Edeſcon.</hi> Let us go then (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>Hannibal</hi> impatiently) let us go draw the Father of my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
out of the hands of <hi>Attanes.</hi> But <hi>Alcon</hi> (added he, addreſſing
to the <hi>Saguntine</hi> Senator) may I believe what you relate? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more certain (anſwered <hi>Alcon</hi>) and I have engaged <hi>Attanes</hi> to
confeſs it to me: And if I have conferred with him concerning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Saguntum,</hi> it was to no other purpoſe, then to perſwade
him to remit the Prince <hi>Edeſcon</hi> into liberty: But this amorous King
could not be brought to reſolve it, and required time to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a preciſe anſwer. If to that which I tell you, I may adde my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture;
I ſhall dare to aſſure you, my Lord, that it muſt needs be,
that the King of the <hi>Turdetanes</hi> hath ſome covert Agent about <hi>Thomira,</hi>
who informs him of all that concerns the Princeſs: For within the time
that I undertook, we ſhould not onely have the conſentment of <hi>Edeſcon,</hi>
but that we ſhould have that Prince himſelf at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> within twenty
fifteen days: Within that time, I ſay, the Princeſs received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which in all likelihood <hi>Attanes</hi> hath cauſed to be written, and
which I took from the hand of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> to ſhew you.</p>
               <p>Ending theſe words, he preſented a Letter to the Prince <hi>Hannibal;</hi>
which ran in theſe expreſſions.</p>

would have me loſe her, ingrateful <hi>Thomira!</hi> unnatural <hi>Thomira!</hi> ſince
you are determined to beſtow your ſelf on my Enemies. I could never have
believed, that a Princeſs bred with ſo much care, ought to yield her ſelf to the

Ah, <hi>Thomira!</hi> if you are yet capable of this thought, conſider the juſtice

ſhortly informing me of a thing done, and of ſuch a thing as you never ought
to have done, but by my order. But I would to the Gods, O <hi>Thomira,</hi> that
this Letter might affect you, and divert you, from being drawn to ſo ſtrange

ſay, that I conceive your complaint not extremely well grounded:
Without doubt, <hi>Edeſcon</hi> knows nothing of the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>'s
pretenſions to his alliance; and he would never have written this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> believe notwithſtanding, my Lord (replyed the Senatour) that <hi>I</hi>
am eaſily able to bring to paſs all that I promiſe; for in ſhort, my
Lord, do you believe that <hi>Attanes,</hi> to retain <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> will draw upon
himſelf an Army of a hundred thouſand men, with the great <hi>Hannibal</hi>
in the head of it? and although that ſhould not be, is he in a condition
to be able to keep that Prince? So that is it poſſible for him to ſtick at
the giving of that, which he may ſoon be forced to ſurrender? and can
he imagine himſelf capable to withſtand you? For <hi>Edeſcon</hi> (purſued
he) <hi>I</hi> ſhall have leſs difficulty to win upon his minde; and that Prince,
I am aſſured, will be ſo raviſhed with the propoſal which I ſhall make
to him in your behalf, that he will eaſily forget all his loſſes; which to
ſpeak truth, are gloriouſly repaired in ſuch an illuſtrious Alliance. My
Maſter heard theſe words with an extreme ſatisfaction, and the paſſion
which poſſeſſed him, giving ordinarily more hope then fear, and above
all, to perſons of a high ſpirit, he felt all his penſiveneſs and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
diſſipated in a moment: And embracing the <hi>Saguntine</hi> Senator, <hi>I</hi>
ſhall owe all to you <hi>Alcon</hi> (ſaid he to him) and you may aſſuredly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
my acknowledgements. Go <hi>Alcon</hi> (continued he) and that this
day, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you, that you leave me no longer in an impatience, which
is inſupportable unto me. In the mean time, to follow and authorize
your counſel, <hi>I</hi> will put my ſelf at the head of a part of my Army, and
go by open force to obtain that of <hi>Attanes,</hi> which perhaps he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
you, if you have nothing but reaſons to urge him with. My
Lord (anſwered <hi>Alcon) I</hi> ſhall depart, ſeeing it is your pleaſure. Do
ſo immediately (replied <hi>Hannibal</hi>) and to ſecure againſt any notice to
be given to the King of the <hi>Turdetanes,</hi> prejudicial to us, our deſign
muſt not be communicated to any perſon. And for my ſelf (added he)
<hi>I</hi> ſhall diſcover it to none whatſoever, ſaving to the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi>
to whom I have very great obligations.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, my Maſter expreſſed ſome impatience; and <hi>Alcon</hi>
knowing that this Prince willed nothing but with earneſtneſs and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
left him, and went to provide conveniences for his journey. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
repaired to <hi>Lucius,</hi> and communicated this Deſign to him; and
the generous <hi>Celtiberian</hi> having long ſince proteſted that he would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, he was at length conſtrained to ſuffer this obliging Prince to
engage himſelf to joyn with him aftter the return of the Courrier, which
he had diſpatched to the Queen his Mother.</p>
                  <p>At his departure from <hi>Lucius,</hi> my Maſter was minded to viſit
the Princeſs; but he durſt not do it, and therefore reſolved to attend
till the Prince <hi>Edeſcon</hi> ſhould preſent him: So that without longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> we mounted horſe, and <hi>Alcon</hi> did not ſeparate from us,
till he had cauſe the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> to promiſe to do no act of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
before he knew his negotiations was unprofitable. The <hi>Saguntine</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:60667:44"/>
Senator had not ſooner put himſelfe upon his way; but <hi>Hannibal</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with <hi>Hanno, Magar,</hi> and three or four Officers, took theirs
toward the Villages which are upon the banks of <hi>Batis,</hi> between <hi>Caſtulon</hi>
and <hi>Hiſpalis,</hi> where were quartered a conſiderable number of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
My Maſter ſoon ſummoned them, and gave ſuch orders as he
thought neceſſary for the management of his deſign. He attended news
from <hi>Alcon</hi> in theſe parts about ſix dayes, and on the ſixt day a
paquet was brought him, when he was upon the point of going to bed.
It is eaſie to judge that the Prince inſtantly read what <hi>Alcon</hi> had written
to him, and that it was not without an extream joy that he underſtood
this Senator had acted with ſucceſs. He alſo learnt that the hatred which
<hi>Regulus</hi> had againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> had not been a leſs obſtruction

<hi>Attanes</hi> himſelf: ſo that my Maſter was aſſured that <hi>Edeſcon</hi> was upon
the point of coming to <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> that he was very glad to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
aright the things from <hi>Alcons</hi> mouth, which had been miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him; and towards the end of the Letter. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to expect more particular news within four dayes. <hi>Alcon</hi> came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to deliver them preciſely at the time he was to ſend them, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a perſon of a moſt high and majeſtick aſpect, whom
we ſoon knew to be the Prince of the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> My Maſter ran to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Edeſcon,</hi> which he did with ſo much reſpect and difference, that I
ſhould have difficultly believ'd what I ſaw, had I not preſently recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Edeſcon</hi> was Father of the princeſs <hi>Thomira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, my Lords (ſaid <hi>Aſpar</hi> to the Princes who liſtned to him) you
may pleaſe to permit me to paſs over in ſilence the particularities of this
enterview, and onely to tell you that theſe two Princes made a thouſand
reſpectful proteſtations to one another, and after that a thouſand excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for all they had done againſt one another, before their mutual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
and in a word, <hi>Edeſcon</hi> rendred <hi>Hannibal</hi> that which he thought
belonged to a Prince which reigned over all <hi>Africa,</hi> and part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and who was yet more conſiderable for his illuſtrious qualities,
then for the extent of his Dominion. Nevertheleſs all that <hi>Edeſcon</hi>
rendered, did not equal that which he received of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
which my Maſter had for the Prince of the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> were not
inferior to the paſſion he had for the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> by which I leave
you to judge of their intenſeneſs, and intimate to you the impoſſiblity
for me to be exact in this part of my Narration, if I would particularze
it. Theſe firſt Civilities being ended (proceeded <hi>Aſpar</hi>) wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
and ackowledgement ſupplyed the office of ordinary Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
the two Princes, with <hi>Alcon</hi> and <hi>Hanno,</hi> went to dinner, and each
of them after the repaſt, teſtified their extream deſire to return to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulon,</hi>
to ſee the fair Princeſs of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and the amiable daughter
of <hi>Alcon;</hi> wheref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re they all took horſe as ſoon as was poſſible, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
great tranſports of joy in their approaching near <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> that it
would have been hard to have diſtinguiſht the moſt ſatisfied perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60667:44"/>
them, excepting my Maſter. You will not wonder, my Lord,
(ſaid the Prince of the <hi>Saguntines</hi> to him of <hi>Carthage</hi>) that I appear
very much contented, if you conſider I am a Father, and that I am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the point of ſeeing a daughter, for whom I have an infinite tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Ah, My Lord, anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) expreſs, I beſeech you, all
that which contributes to your ſatisfaction; confeſs that the Princeſs of
<hi>Caſtulon</hi> is a perſon wholly miraculous, and omitting the goodneſs to
conceal what I have done againſt you, declare that you are going to ſee
that admirable princeſs, after three or four apparent hazards of loſing
her. My Lord (replyed <hi>Edeſcon</hi>) I ſhall never conceal that which is
glorious for you; and if I can forget any thing of your Victories, it
ſhall be onely the circumſtances which have been prejudicial to me.
Nevertheleſs I will think of thoſe circumſtances, that I may have the
ſatisfaction of conſidering with what generoſity you have afterwards
obliged us, and with what goodneſs you have treated <hi>Thomira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words of <hi>Edeſcon</hi> made my Maſter bluſh, as if they were meant
to reproach him that he had not done enough; and the name of <hi>Thomira</hi>
pronounced by a man who onely could diſpoſe of her, cauſed the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<hi>Hannibal</hi> almoſt to tremble, as fierce and as haughty as he is:
ſo great is the power of love above that of nature. Yet the great <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
anſwered him nobly enough; and this converſation having du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for ſome time, and <hi>Alcon</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> alſo ſpoken of the princeſs
<hi>Thomira,</hi> the diſcourſe fell afterwards to be of the amiable Daughter of
<hi>Alcon,</hi> which laſted till the company all alighted at a Village within
half a dayes journey of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> with intent to lodge there. The next
morning putting our ſelves again upon the way, <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not
moderate the paſſions which agitated him, and his love was accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with top great deſires, too great hope and joy, for him to be maſter
of it. So that yeelding himſelf to the bent of his impatience, he made
his excuſes to the prince of <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> and ſeparated himſelf from the reſt,
to ſee his Princeſs ſooner, and to give her the news, which could not but
be moſt agreeable unto her. At length, <hi>Aſpar</hi> (ſaid he, when we were a
little diſtant from <hi>Edeſcon</hi>) at length <hi>Hannibal</hi> is the moſt happy perſon
in the world; he ſhall ſoon ſee his Princeſs; but he ſhall ſee her with
the authority of <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> and in a ſmall time, <hi>Aſpar;</hi> yes, very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
he ſhall be exalted to the greateſt felicity the world is able to give
him. Yes, I ſhall immediately ſee my Princeſs (ſaid he, a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
after, with a tranſport of joy) I ſhall ſee that fair and adorable
perſon, and moreover I ſhall ſee her without fear of becoming unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
I ſhould never end, if I ſhould rehearſe all the paſſionate Prince
ſaid to me; for he ſpake ſo many things, and with ſo little connexion,
that it is impoſſible for me to remember them. In the mean time, we
ſpeeded with ſo much alacrity, that it was not long before we diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Towers of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and that ſight raviſhing <hi>Hannibal</hi> with joy,
augmented the quickneſs of our pace. It is not fit to detain you long
in this part of my diſcourſe, being I think my ſelf rather obliged to tell
you that we are arrived at <hi>Caſtulon;</hi> and if we arrived two hours ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
there then I believed we could have done, we did alſo find our joy
more augmented thereby then we thought it could have been. My Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60667:45"/>
haſtned to the Palace, and immediately demanded to ſee the Princeſs,
but inſtead of an anſwer, there was nothing returned him but ſighes,
and he perceived that no body dared to open their mouthes to ſpeak.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> remained confounded, and not venturing to ask what he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to know, he but too well underſtood that this ſilence ſpoke ſome ſad
accident. Nevertheleſs he would attempt it at length, and demanded
where the princeſs was, if ſhe were ſick, or not; and ſo peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded it to be told him, that one of the moſt confident of the
attendants gave him this information; My Lord (ſaid he to the Prince
<hi>Hannibal</hi>) two dayes are paſſed ſince we ſaw the Princeſs, and ſince we
cannot learn what is become of <hi>Alorca,</hi> who is probably with her. We
have ſpent (continued he) theſe two dayes in ſearch, but we have ſought
unprofitably, having found onely a veile of the Illuſtrious princeſs <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira.
Hannibal,</hi> as deſperate, as inſtructed by this diſcourſe: What?
ſhall I not ſee <hi>Thomira</hi> (cryed he, with a tone that fignified the trouble
of his ſpirit) How? is <hi>Thomira</hi> loſt? and ſhall I never more ſee that
Princeſs, whoſe very inſenſibility hath charmes in it, and who can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
render me happy? After which, as his fiery temperament rendred
him diſpoſed to violent paſſions, he walked ſometime without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word, and look't up to heaven, as if he accus'd it of his misfortune,
or rather as the only thing againſt which he thought he might diſcharge
all his choler. Then recollecting himſelfe, Ah, <hi>Hannibal!</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>Thomira</hi> flyes thee, and without doubt 'tis her hatred which cauſes
this accident that kills thee. But rouſe up, O <hi>Hannibal</hi> (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he with a higher tone, thou falleſt upon <hi>Thomira,</hi> inſtead of atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quing
the author of thy unhappineſs, and doſt not accuſe the perfidious
<hi>Alorca</hi> for the carrying away of the Princeſs. Knoweſt thou not, that that
divine perſon had not fewer charms for <hi>Alorca</hi> then he had for <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and that the difference of the proceedings comes not but from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the prince of <hi>Carthage?</hi> Yes, raviſher of my
bliſs, yes, perfidious <hi>Alorca</hi> (continued he) thou takeſt away <hi>Thomira</hi>
from me, thou loſeſt the reſpect thou oweſt her; and that which is yet
more perplexing, is, that perhaps thou enlargeſt thy crime further, and
treateſt a Prince with violence, who deſerves the adoration of all the
Earth. But I will purſue thee in what ever corner of the world thou
ſhalt hide thee: yes, I will go puniſh this thy attempt, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of tortures, revenge an infidelity beyond example. The impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of choler wholly arreſted his further ſpeech, and the Prince
being driven by the moſt ardent of all paſſions, walked about ſome
turnes without ſpeaking a word; and when he did ſpeak, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
heard from his intangled diſcourſe but reproaches and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings.</p>
                  <p>They which beheld this agitation of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> did not believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſufficiently aſſured of their innocence, they durſt not open their
mouthes in their own juſtification; and their ſilence, which was indeed
the effect of their fear and reſpect, ſeemed to my Maſter an evidence of
their crime: Come (cryed he to them) you complices of <hi>Alorca;</hi> come
you perfidious Traytors, let us go ſeek my divine Princeſs, and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
your offences ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed, if if I find not the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60667:45"/>
perſon it hath bereaved me off. He went forth at the end of theſe
words; and cauſing himſelf to be conducted to the place where <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>'s
Veil was found, he went thither with ſo great precipitance, that
we judged his flame did not leſs carry him, then it devoured him. When
he arrived at the place, his tranſports were redoubled, and he became
perfectly furious, he went a little diſtance from us, and uttered a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
imprecations againſt <hi>Alorca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would not abandon the Prince in this deplorable eſtate, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with him till we came to a little Wood, whither he went, that he
might totally permit himſelf to the violence of his paſsion, or perhaps
to act ſomething more tragical. He ſought, or perhaps caſually found
a covert place; where turning his eye at randome, or by ſome inſtinct,
inſpired by his choler, to finde ſomething on which he might diſcharge
it; he diſcovered an object that wholly arreſted his ſight and progreſs,
and rendred him almoſt immoveable: it was a man ſtretched along at
the foot of a great Oak, but it was that man who could onely detain
the Prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and give him an attention whereof he ſeemed to be
no more capable. My Maſter immediately knew him to be that <hi>Alorca</hi>
whom he ſought; but he obſerved him in a condition, rather to move
his compaſsion, then the effects of his cholar: For he beheld <hi>Alorca,</hi> not
as a Traitor, and a Raviſher, but grievouſly wounded, and the <hi>Alorca</hi>
whom he had heretofore eſteemed, pale, and covered with blood. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
being ſurpriz'd with this commiſerable object, found his choler
to rebate ſome of its violence; and when his reaſon was capable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with liberty: <hi>Alorca,</hi> ſaid he, thou art dead unqueſtionably in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Thomira;</hi> thou haſt fallen under the ſword of her raviſhers,
and ſhe hath been carried away by thy death: So that when thou haſt
loſt thy life to preſerve that which I love, <hi>I</hi> accuſed thee of of a dreadful
crime, and thou receiveſt this ſort of recompence from the unjuſt <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, purſued he, that thou haſt been advantagiouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced,
in dying for a Divine Princeſs; and this <hi>Hannibal</hi> who accuſed
thee of a crime, thou undertookeſt to puniſh, even this <hi>Hannibal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
thy glorious Deſtiny with envy. Well <hi>Aſpar,</hi> continued he, turning
towards me, is it not fit <hi>I</hi> dye, that <hi>I</hi> live not abſent from my Princeſs?
Dye, anſwered <hi>I:</hi> Alas, my Lord, you ought to live, that you may
go and recover the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> out of the hands of her Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers.
But, my Maſter replied, if <hi>Thomira</hi> hath conſented to her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away, and prefers her Raviſhers before the unfortunate <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
is it not expedient for me to dye, who am ſo loſtly amorous of her.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (replied I) if you love the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> in the
meaſure you profeſs, you ought not to dye, when ſhe lives contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and you would be injurious, to deſpair in this occaſion, if what I
have learnt be true, that it is meet for us to reſent the ſame paſsions which
the perſons do we love. Alas, <hi>Aſpar</hi> (interrupted my Maſter) thou haſt
either never loved, or never left the perſon dear to thee in this manner,
ſince thou art ignorant, that a Lover in ſuch a conjuncture, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
contrary paſſions to thoſe of the beloved perſon, at ſuch time as ſhe
is with his Rival.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60667:46"/>
Sccarce had my Maſter ended theſe words, but he beheld the Prince
<hi>Edeſcon, Alcon, Hanno,</hi> and <hi>Magar</hi> coming, with a great train follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. You ſee, my Lord (ſaid <hi>Hannibal</hi> preſently to the Prince
of the <hi>Saguntines</hi>) that <hi>Thomira</hi> is taken away from you: I cannot ſuſpect
any other then <hi>Attanes</hi> capable of this crime, but that <hi>Attanes</hi> ſhall ſoon
know whether <hi>Hannibal</hi> may ſafely be offended. Alas, my Lord (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Edeſcon,</hi> in whom ſorrow acted after another ſort) muſt I be
eternally unhappy? Can it not be that I know <hi>Thomira</hi> is in being, but
to have her paſs with me for a criminal? and muſt not I ſee my dear
Daughter, when I am ſatisfied of her innocence and vertue? Alas,
my Lord, anſwered my Maſter—after which he was ſilent, not daring
to continue his diſcourſe, out of a reſtraint not uſual with him; and
yet giving us to know by his countenance, that he deſigned to ſhew his
unhappineſſes incomparably greater then thoſe of <hi>Edeſcon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two Princes declared their grief a while, onely by ſilent looks;
ſo that <hi>Alcon</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> were conſtrained to ſignifie theirs alſo in the
ſame faſhion, being ſurprized with the like loſs; for <hi>Nadalia</hi> was alſo
carried away with <hi>Thomira.</hi> But it was at length eſteemed meet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and to cauſe the body of <hi>Alorca</hi> to be carried to <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him the duties of Sepulture. Whereupon they which went to lift
him up, perceived ſomething glittering upon the ground, and preſently
found that it was a ſmall Table-book, the cover of which was enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with jewels: This they inſtantly preſented to the Prince <hi>Hannibal;</hi>
but ſcarce had <hi>Edeſcon</hi> caſt his eye upon it, but he cryed, O Gods! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Tablet of my dear <hi>Thomira!</hi> upon which <hi>Hannibal</hi> offered it
to him with great reſpect: And <hi>Edeſcon</hi> having opened it, read theſe
words aloud, which he found in the firſt leaf.</p>

                  <p>The reading of this Letter, which contained things ſo little expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſurprized all thoſe that heard it; inſomuch, that the two Princes
ſeemed aſtoniſhed therewith; and ſilence would have poſſeſt the place
a long time, if amongſt the croud that had followed the Prince of the
<hi>Saguntines,</hi> there had not been heard a certain humming of voyces,
wherein were confuſedly mingled, the names of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Alorca,</hi>
with thoſe of <hi>Thomira</hi> and <hi>Nadalia.</hi> This murmuring noiſe, in ſome
meaſure drew <hi>Edeſcon</hi> out of his aſtoniſhment; who lifting his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven, and teſtifying greater ſorrow then admiration, O Gods,
cryed he, is it not enough that <hi>Thomira</hi> is ſnatched from me, but ſhe
muſt needs learn me her ſelf, that ſhe is unworthy the grief that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
for her.</p>
                  <p>Here, my Lord, purſued he, turning towards my Maſter, receive I
beſeech you this Tablet, I will keep nothing that may reproach me with
the faults of <hi>Thomira:</hi> Take this Ticket, which is addreſſed to you, and
conſider it as a thing that muſt cure your paſſion, and cauſe you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
a woman that is capable of making ſo free a declaration. Alas,
my Lord, interrupted my Maſter, how do you treat the Princeſs <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira?</hi>
is it becauſe ſhe is criminal, or for that ſhe hath ſome goodneſſe
for a Prince that adores her? and can you believe her too indulgent,
having ſuch goodneſs onely in the time that I am remote from her? He
uttered many paſſionate things of this ſort, to which <hi>Edeſcon</hi> gave mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating
anſwers: And that which was moſt rare, was, that in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Caſtulon, Hannibal</hi> on the one ſide rendred thanks to the Princeſs,
and was incenſed againſt <hi>Lucius;</hi> while on the other ſide, <hi>Edeſcon</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf in wrath againſt <hi>Thomira,</hi> and perfectly ſatisfied with the
Prince of <hi>Celtiberia. Hannibal</hi> was not onely enraged againſt <hi>Lucius,</hi>
he did not altogether ſpare <hi>Alcon</hi> in his affliction; but demanded of
him, if ever any thing was more unhandſome and offenſive then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> who acted cruelly againſt him, after ſhe had made
ſemblance to do him good offices with the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, my Lord, anſwered <hi>Alcon,</hi> all ſurprized and afflicted, I do not
apprehend clearly in this affair; but in what manner ſoever it hath been
carried, I cannot believe that <hi>Nadalia</hi> hath acted againſt you. To know
this, interrupted <hi>Hannibal,</hi> you need onely read the laſt words of my
Princeſs, and there will be no reaſon to doubt of it, after ſuch expreſs
terms, <hi>I ſhould not withdraw my ſelf from you, did not</hi> Lucius <hi>and</hi> Nadalia
<hi>force me ſo to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Alcon</hi> was by theſe laſt words too much perplexed to anſwer, my
Maſter was of a humour not to be eaſily ſilent in this occaſion; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he complained and threatned, till he was arrived at <hi>Caſtulon.</hi>
He was no ſooner in this City, but he immediately ſent Diſcoverers into
all places where his Princeſſe could be imagined to have paſt: Himſelf
alſo took horſe, to finde news of her, and learnt ſome the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſome perſons who had ſeen <hi>Lucius, Thomira,</hi> and <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and
two unknown men.</p>
                  <p>My Maſter was informed, that the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> had embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his fair Couſin upon the River <hi>Boetis</hi> to gain the Sea, and go ſeek in
<hi>Italy</hi> ſome place of ſurety againſt the power of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60667:47"/>
which Love and Ambition conſpiring together in the breaſt of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
this Prince ſuddenly chaſed away all his ſadneſs, and expreſſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a noble impatience to go ſpeedily into <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Thomira</hi>
and Glory ſeem'd to attend him: Nevertheleſs, before he took orders
for the affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> he declared his deſign to the Prince <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> and
proteſted to him a thouſand times, That whereas he intended to go in
ſearch of the fair Princeſſe of <hi>Castulon,</hi> it was not out of any hope to
be received favourably by her, but onely to draw her out of the hands
of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and afterwards to reſtore her into thoſe of the Prince <hi>Edeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi>
The Father of <hi>Thomira</hi> anſwered my Maſter, That he ought to
have a deſign more glorious; and then intreated him, not to deſolate
<hi>Celtiberia,</hi> as he had reſolved: which <hi>Hannibal</hi> accorded him, and had

                  <p>While theſe things paſt at <hi>Caſtulon, Aſdrubal Barſa</hi> arrived there: My
Maſter embraced this Prince with very great tenderneſs; and when <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
told him, that four <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſadors had denounced war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Carthage.</hi> We will carry it to <hi>Rome</hi> (interrupted he fiercely) and
we ſhall ſee whether the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> know not as well how to manage
it, as the <hi>Romans</hi> do to declare it. He ſaid no more to this affair; but
having preſently ended the converſation, he went to contrive and order
expediences for his voyage into <hi>Italy.</hi>

and hardy Souldier, determined with an admirable conduct, to provide
for the ſafety of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and to that purpoſe, ſent Thirty
thouſand <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> to defend the moſt conſiderable places,
and left a like number of <hi>Africans</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end theſe two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
might be better preſerved by two Nations; who at the ſame time
in both the one and the other, ſerved both for Garriſon and Hoſtage.
Having ordered many other things, neceſſary for the conſervation of a
Countrey which he was to forſake; and leaving <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> at new <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
he directed his courſe towards the <hi>Pyrenian</hi> Mountains, in the
head of an Army of a hundred thouſand foot, and twenty thouſand
horſe, and a train of fifty Elephants.</p>
                  <p>But being all the world ſpeaks the victories of the famous <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and I am entred upon a ſtory ſufficiently well known; if you pleaſe, my
Lords, to diſpence with me, I ſhall forbear to particularize the Battels
which my Maſter fought, and the Victories which he gained: Yet it is
meet to tell you, that he brought to his obedience the <hi>Ilergetes,</hi> the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſins,</hi>
and the <hi>Auſetanes;</hi> and having paſſed thoſe high Mountains which
ſeparate <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he left <hi>Hanno</hi> the charge of all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and to guard the paſſage of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand foot, and four thouſand horſe. After which, he made new
levies, to recruit that diminiſhment of his Army, and was eager of
having ſuch forces as might in appearance aſſure thoſe Conqueſts he
had made, from which he was obliged to be far diſtant.</p>
                  <p>When we deſcended into the Countrey of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> my Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
all acts of Hoſtility; and ſent Ambaſſadours to inform the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> that he intended to march as a Traveller, and not as an Enemy;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60667:47"/>
and that he was determined not to draw his ſword, till he were arrived
in <hi>Italy.</hi> Upon which he obtained a free paſſage; ſo that we marched
as far as the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> in no other diſturbance, then if we had marched in
the Territories of our own Empire: But we found a powerful obſtacle
at the paſſage of this River; for <hi>Regulus</hi> not prevailing with the <hi>Turde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>
to riſe againſt us, had paſſed into <hi>Gaul,</hi> to effect the like deſign
there, hoping he ſhould eaſily draw a Nation to take up Arms, who
paſſionately affected fighting.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Volcae,</hi> the <hi>Cavarians,</hi> with this <hi>Roman</hi> in the head of them, put
themſelves in a poſture to diſpute us the paſſage of the <hi>Rhoſne:</hi> But <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
deſigned to overcome by a ſlight, leſt the courage of the <hi>Gauls</hi>
might be a means to withhold him from embarraſſing <hi>Italy:</hi> Wherefore
he made ſhew that he would paſs the <hi>Rhoſne;</hi> and accordingly prepared a
good number of boats, but in the mean time he ſent <hi>Maharbal</hi> with
five and twenty thouſand men to foord it, at a Village where the <hi>Soanes</hi>
diſcharges it ſelf into this River.</p>

                  <p>Scarce was our Army landed on the other ſide the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> but we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that of the <hi>Romans</hi> was arrived at <hi>Marſilia,</hi> under the conduct
of <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> who you know was Father of that <hi>Scipio</hi> who hath
done ſuch glorious exploits in <hi>Africa,</hi> while my Maſter was abſent.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> ſent a <hi>Numidian</hi> called <hi>Micipſa,</hi> with five hundred horſe, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Enemy, and continued his march directly towards the <hi>Alpes;</hi>
having no other deſign then to arrive ſpeedily in <hi>Italy,</hi> both to ſee there
his fair Princeſs, and to caſt a greater terrour into the ſpirits of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
by fighting them in their own Country. But alas, toward the end
of the day, we beheld a part of our Scouts coming, who were re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ired
in diſorder, and ſeemed the moſt of them ſorely battered and hurt. My
Maſter ſoon informed himſelf exactly of all that had paſt; and it was
told, that they were beaten back by the Scouts of the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat they
were retreated, after they had loſt two hundred of their Companions,
ſeen <hi>Micipſa</hi> cut in pieces, and themſelves reduc'd into that eſtate as they
appeared. I ſent <hi>Micipſa</hi> (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) to diſcover the Enemy,
not to fight him.</p>
                  <p>Ah, my Lord (replied the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> that ſpake to him) when you
fully know this adventure, you will without doubt ceaſe to accuſe us, and
perceive ſomething ſo ſurprizing in it, that you will impute the ſucceſs
we have had, rather to the good fortune of the <hi>Romans,</hi> then to any defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience
or bad conduct of ours: For as ſoon (continued he) as we had ſight
of the Enemies Scouts, we made a ſtand on both ſides, the better to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
one another; ſo that <hi>Micipſa</hi> perceiving we had the advantage of
number, and alſo judging that we were not inferiour in valour to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
reſolutely charged them, thinking either to have the glory of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the firſt advantage in an important war; or to prevent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60667:48"/>
whom he ſaw already upon the point to come up to us. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
was at firſt furious and bloody, and when we had made our loſſes
equal, and our forces were not ſo, the <hi>Romans</hi> were upon the point of
flying; but on a ſudden a cry was ſet up amongſt them, <hi>O Gods! 'Tis
the Son of the General! 'Tis young</hi> Scipio! Theſe words, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by a loud joy, mixed with admiration, were no ſooner heard, but
we beheld in the head of them a young Prince, who peradventure had
not yet attained his fifteenth year: He was magnificently cloath'd, and
advantagiouſly mounted, but had no other arms then his ſword &amp; ſhield,
ſo that we beheld and admir'd his countenance at the ſame moment. But,
my Lord, if the aſpect of this young <hi>Roman</hi> appear'd to us on ſudden
marvellouſly noble, we ſoon felt that his arm was equally redoubtable:
He ſlew <hi>Micipſa</hi> with the firſt blow of his ſword he gave him; after which
he broke upon us, with a valour ſo prodigious, that if I had never ſeen
you fighting, I ſhould be hard of belief that it were poſſible for a man to
do ſo great actions of proweſs. In a word, my Lord, we endeavoured to
make reſiſtance, but ineffectually; and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo redoubled their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours,
that after the ſlaughter of 200 of ours, they at length inforc'd us
to ſecure our ſelves by retreat. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was diſguſted at this relation, and
began to have eſteem of the young <hi>Scipio,</hi> although he expreſt no tokens
of it, that he might not diſcourage his own Troops. From hence we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
onwards, always in a poſture to receive the <hi>Romans,</hi> till we arrived
at the banks of <hi>Durantia;</hi> where we had intelligence that <hi>Scipio</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked.
We paſt this River with great difficulty, and as we were entring
into the Frontiers of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> two Brethren. who were at conteſt
for ſoveraignty, came to the famous Prince of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whom they took
for Judge of their difference. <hi>Hannibal</hi> heard all their reaſons, and having
equitably ballanc'd them, he adjudg'd the Kingdom to the eldeſt, named
<hi>Brancus;</hi> from whom he received all manner of aſſiſtance in his paſſage
over the <hi>Alpes. Matales</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundian Gauls,</hi> came to joyn his
forces with my Maſters; and theſe two Princes afforded us many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
both of proviſion, ammunition and cloathing, of which we ſtood
in great need, to defend us from the vehemency of the cold, which in theſe
parts is in all ſeaſons inſupportable: upon this ſupply, our Souldiers were
not ſlow to undertake the climing of the <hi>Alpes;</hi> which notwithſtanding
they no ſooner looked upon, but they were ſurprized with terrour, never
any more frightful ſpectacle having been ſeen by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if on one ſide the
<hi>Alpes</hi> ſeemed inacceſſible, their tops being covered with ſnow above the
clouds, they appeared on the other as impenetrable, by preſenting to our
view a thouſand dreadful rocks, which broke off the ways of our paſſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ended their courſe with precipices: yet this was not the onely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
we were to combate with; for theſe mountains were poſſeſt by
a ſavage and cruel people, who would diſpute the way with us, and who
indeed peſtred us ſo violently, that we were conſtrained to creep to fight
them. Theſe Barbarians came in great troops, through by ways, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque
us unawares; ſometimes they fought with us at handiblows, but
moſt frequently their uſe was, to rowl great pieces of rock dovvn, vvhich
overvvhelmed and cruſhed our Souldiers, our horſes, and our Elephants:
nevertheleſs, our invincible Prince ſurmounted all theſe obſtacles; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60667:48"/>
avoided the firſt with covering himſelf with his ſhield, and cauſing
his Souldiers to make a halt every moment to recover breath, and to uſe
their arms offenſive. But, my Lord, I beg your permiſſion to omit this
troubleſome attempt; and come to tell you, that we arriv'd at length at
the top of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> nine days after we had began to mount them. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
diſcovering from the higheſt of theſe mountains, a plain of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
turned himſelf towards his Souldiers, and ſhew'd them the towns,
villages, meadows, and fruitful hills, with the pleaſant rivers, and in
ſhort, the moſt pleaſant Countrey of the world: Behold <hi>Italy</hi> (cryed he,
with an air of fierceneſs and joy) ſee it my dear friends, and conſider, that
'tis in theſe fair places where you ſhal ſoon finde the end of your labours,
and the recompence of your travels. As ſoon as the Prince had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
theſe words, the infinite multitude which compoſed his Army,
ſhouted out crys of joy to heaven, and we immediately remarked in the
faces of our Souldiers ſomething ſo gallant and confident, that we judg'd
they had forgot their wearineſs and incombrances, and that they had
heart enough to overcome thoſe which were behinde, and they appear'd
worthy to march under the Grand <hi>Hannibal:</hi> wherefore we began <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
with very much joy, which was notwithſtanding accompanied
with extreme pains; for inſtead of finding any track to paſs in, we ſoon
beheld a great icy precipice, and to ſpeak all in few words, I aſſure you,
that during our paſſage of theſe mountains, we ſuffered much more in
deſcending, then we did in our aſcent. I ſhall forbear to mention that
frightful Rock we met with, which was an obſtacle apparently never to
be ſurmounted; for without doubt you heard, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was inforc'd
to make his way through with fire and ſword, and ſo making ſuch places
acceſſible, which were far from being ſo, he ſeem'd to triumph over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and hath left to poſterity, the eternal marks of his grandeur. It is
enough to ſay, that after ſix days ſpent in deſcending, at laſt we arriv'd in
<hi>Ciſalpine Gaul;</hi> and after ſo many fights, ſo many rivers paſt, and ſo many
mountains climb'd over, we began to breathe with ſome ſweetneſs, and
to recover the ſtrength we had loſt. But having brought the Prince of
<hi>Carthage</hi> to theſe ſo much deſired places, I think my ſelf obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you in the next place, the diligence he imploy'd to know where
the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> might be, and what forces the <hi>Romans</hi> led againſt
him; yet I ſhall omit all but what concerns <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Thomira,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it not neceſſary to recount you the particularities of the War of
<hi>Italy;</hi> ſince without doubt, the great Princes before whom I ſpeak, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant of things which all the world talks of with aſtoniſhment.
Ah, <hi>Aſpar</hi> (interrupted the King of <hi>Syria</hi>) why ſhould you break your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to paſs in ſilence the great actions of your Maſter? And can you
(added <hi>Nicomedes</hi>) ſpeak of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> withour rehearſing his victories?
The ſick King, and the Prince <hi>Perſens</hi> had the ſame deſires, with <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> but they did not expreſs them, becauſe
they perceiv'd <hi>Aſpar</hi> about to reſume his diſcourſe, which he purſued in
this manner.</p>

the moſt diligent perſons that were about him to

to gain the amity of the people from whom he might receive

furniſh their utmoſt. But he had not the ſame facility in procuring
Alliance with a certain people ſcituate at the foot of the <hi>Alpes;</hi> ſo that
after ſome fights, my Maſter reſolved to lay ſiege to <hi>Turin,</hi> which is
the capital City of this Country. This place was of conſiderable
ſtrength; but being it was <hi>Hannibal</hi> that was againſt it, it was carryed
within a few days, and within a few more, when we advanced towards
the River <hi>Ticines,</hi> we learnt that <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> was arrived at <hi>Piſa,</hi> with
an Army which he had formed of the remnant of that of <hi>Manlius,</hi> which
was beaten by the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Our valiant Prince, who breathed after bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
was exreamly ſatisfied with this tydings; and knowing that a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
beginning preſages a glorious continuance, he determined to ſpeak
to his Army, to excite them to acquit themſelves manfully in the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which preſented it ſelfe. We had ſcarce heard the news of <hi>Publius</hi>'s
making a Bridge over <hi>Ticines,</hi> to paſs his Forces over to come at us, but
the fierce <hi>Hannibal</hi> would prevent him; and to the end he might be

Souldiers.</head>
                  <p>MY Friends, your valour is ſo fully known to me, that I think I ſhall
not ſurpriſe you, when I tell you the ſtate of the caſe is this, either to
dye or conquer. You obſerve how we are environed with the Alpes, the Po,
and the two Seas: and I ſhould ſay, we have no paſsage at all left us, did I
not know that we are owners of our Swords, that ſhall hew out our wayes, and
give us paſſage over the bodies of thoſe enemies that withſtand it. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
therefore that we either dye or overcome: but why do I mention dying?
there is nothing elſe to be done but to conquer; we muſt do it, and I look upon
you already as Victors. Are not you thoſe Troops which have won ſo many fields,
taken ſo many Cities, and who triumphant over ſeveral Nations, have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
a hundred Provinces, without being able to be ſtopt? If you are the ſame
Legions, who ſhall reſiſt us? ſhall the refuſe of an Army which the <hi>Gaules</hi>
have beaten to your hand? and can you believe this rallied crew have heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſtand you? Theſe, I ſay, who carry with them in all places the fatal
Image of their defeat, will they not tremble at your approach? Behold, my
friends, the difference there is between your ſelves, and the forces you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to engage; and I believe it ſufficient to tell you, that you are going to
charge them, to affirm in the next place that you are going to vanquiſh
them; ſince ſtrength and generoſity are apparent in the attaque, as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
nothing can be ſeen but a feeble reſiſtance, ſuch a reſiſtance as is not
made of courſe, but onely becauſe there is a constraint to to do it. Having
thus ſhewn you the advantages you have over your enemies, I ſhould come
next to the difference there is between the two Generals, but that I rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this particular to be determined in the encounter. Nevertheleſs I may
confidently ſay, that <hi>Scipio,</hi> how valiant ſoever he be, cannot infuſe life and
reſolution into Souldiers that yet know him not; as theſe Troops which are
known to him onely by their defeat, cannot afford him any hope. But <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
under whom you march, hath been a thouſand times witneſs of your brave
actions. He hath beheld you a hundred times at a breach, and hath there ſeen
you fight with ſuch valour, that you have carried all the Cities and Fortreſſes
which you ever attempted: &amp; how many times hath he ſeen you all covered with
blood &amp; duſt, bear down the whole Groſs of your enemies, &amp; gain moſt abſolute
battels? ſo that, my friends, I know you well, becauſe I know you moſt valiant;
and I ſee already upon your faces, that you will behave your ſelves as you have
accuſtomed to do, that is, that you will overcome. Beſides, have you not the
ſame <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the head of you, under whom you have alwayes come off
victorious; that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who instead of being unknown to you, as <hi>Scipio</hi>
is to his Forces, hath been bred up amongſt you from the ninth year of his age,
as your companion, rather then as your Prince? that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom you
have ſeen fight under the great <hi>Amilcar;</hi> In a word, that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom
you have beheld perform things which without queſtion have deſerved your
remembrance. Let us then go Conquer, my friends; let us march on to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and think not the recompence which attends you is mean, becauſe your
enemies are but little formidable; we ſhall recover <hi>Scicilia</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60667:50"/>
which the <hi>Romanes</hi> have uſurped from us; we ſhall gain <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, and
the conqueſt of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be followed with that of the Univerſe. But though
you ſhould not expect a reward of this importance, yet ought you not to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your Tyrants, who have made you pay Tribute during ſeveral years,
who have uſurped two fair Iſlands from you, who have demanded your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to be delivered up to them as a criminal, becauſe he ha's been too valiant to
put up their indignities? and, in a word, ought you not to go againſt ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as treat you like ſlaves, who would bound your Conqueſts in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
forbid you to paſs the River <hi>Iberus?</hi> Moreover, were not revenge the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
thing in the world, yet ought not you to act for glory? It glitters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes, &amp; you may behold how it courts and invites you. Let us on then,
my friends, let us go and receive the Crowns which ſhe hath prepared us.</p>

                  <p>This ſpeech produced the effect for which <hi>Hannibal</hi> intended it, and
all the Officers and Souldiers teſtified their reſolvedneſs, either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
or dye; and ſo eagerly expreſſed their deſires to be at fight; that
our valiant General improving this noble heat, put himſelf in the head
of them, and marched directly againſt the enemy, who by this time had
paſſed the River. But to hinder leaſt the people inhabiting there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
ſhould take the ſide of <hi>Scipio,</hi> my Maſter commanded out <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbal</hi>
with four thouſand Horſe to harraſe and waſt the Country of his
confederates; by which he ſtruck a great terrour round about, and
broke the deſign of divers who had bethought of ſiding with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
But both parties being ardently deſirous to engage, there was no
great delay before we met; ſo that the two Armies being within view,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> omitted nothing for the marſhalling of his Legions, of all that
lyes upon an experienced General to do. After which, he went from
rank to rank, commending ſome, and promiſing others, and ſo careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Officers, that he perceived their ardour inflamed to the higheſt
pitch of forwardneſs, and greatly ominous to the event. But it muſt
be acknowledged, that it was not to no purpoſe that my Maſter uſed all
this diligence, ſince he was to fight againſt <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> who in truth,
had all the requiſites of a great Captain. The fight which was ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced,
was a long time obſtinate on both ſides, and the victory very
dubious; but <hi>Maharbal</hi> on a ſudden (according to the order he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received
ſo to do) coming to charge the <hi>Legionaries</hi> in the flanke, the
enemies were put into diſorder, and my valiant Maſter made ſo good uſe
of it, that the Romanes began to abate their vigour, and to make onely
a faint reſiſtance. <hi>Publius</hi> not being able to endure this change, rode up
to the head of his men, to animate them by his example; but he was
ſoon forſaken; ſo that after he had behaved himſelfe with much gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and courage, he was at laſt wounded and made priſoner. You know,
without doubt, my Lords, in what manner he was reſcued out of our
hands; and you cannot but have heard related of all that the young
<hi>Scipio</hi> performed in this engagement. I do not believe (ſaid <hi>Antiochus</hi>
thereupon) that theſe Princes can be ignorant of it, ſince my ſelfe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far more remote from <hi>Italy,</hi> have underſtood the newes of it, and
afterwards heard that all the world talked of it with admiration. <hi>Aſpar</hi>
obſerving that his Auditor by their ſilence approved that which the King
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60667:51"/>
of <hi>Syria</hi> had ſaid, reſumed his diſcourſe in this manner. Seeing you
have known all the young <hi>Scipio</hi> did at this time great and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and in what ſort he delivered his Father, there remains nothing
more for me to acquaint you with touching this fight, but onely that
the Illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſought along time for the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s and <hi>Regulus,</hi>
whom he was inform'd was in the enemies Army, and ſo well redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his efforts, that doing all that the moſt valiant man could do, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
at length victorious. For the <hi>Romanes</hi> not being able to ſuſtain his
proweſs, and no longer animated by the young <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was taken
up in the recovering of his Father, they reſolved at length to retreat;
which they did within a little while, in order enough, although they
had loſt ten or twelve thouſand men, and left us compleat Maſters of
the Field.</p>
                  <p>My Maſter wanted no reaſon to be extreamly ſatisfied with this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
beginning; but as there is ſomething which never diſpoſes events
without the mixture of good and evill; this Prince was inforced to
ſigh after his Victory, and to think upon <hi>Thomira,</hi> inſtead of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with delight the defeat of his enemies. For, while the <hi>Romanes</hi>
were drawing out of the Field, thoſe who had been ordered to get infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Princeſs of <hi>Castulon,</hi> returned with no other tydings to
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> then that they could hear none of her, although they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Ports of <hi>Liguria,</hi> of the Tyrrhene Sea, and <hi>Scicily,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all care and ſearch at <hi>Piſa, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Capua.</hi> Alas, <hi>Lucius!</hi> (cryed
the paſſionate Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) thou imployeſt that life and liberty
which I have given thee to tear forth my heart! Ah, Traytor, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to wear the name of a Prince, didſt thou promiſe me thy friendſhip
for no other end but to have meanes to betray me? and muſt I be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unhappy by thee, when I triumph over all? And, you, fair
Princeſs! adorable <hi>Thomira!</hi> conſider, I beſeech you, the torment your
abſence cauſes the miſerable <hi>Hannibal</hi> to ſuffer; and being <hi>Lucius</hi> hath
had the preſumption to act contrary to your ſentiments, be pleas'd to be
incens'd againſt him, divine Princeſs, that ſo he may be puniſht for his
crime, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> who adores you, receive this kind of conſolation.
The Prince uttered a hundred paſſionate things more, and afterwards
made a hundred demands; but recollecting all that he either ſaid or
did to be unprofitable. Well, <hi>Thomira</hi> (ſaid he at length) I cannot
learn where you are, but I ſhall extend my Conqueſts ſo far, that it
ſhall be difficult for <hi>Lucius</hi> to find a ſanctuary: even all the Earth ſhall
be imployed to take you out of his hands, when it ſhall know that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
ſeeks the faireſt perſon of the world, and your divine aſpect ſhall
manifeſt you to be the perſon whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſeeks.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, the Prince, to effect things according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he had deliberated, went to provide for his advancing into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country; which as he was doing, he received intelligence that
<hi>Sempronius</hi> had left <hi>Scicily,</hi> and was coming with his Army to ſupply
the place of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was obliged to depart from <hi>Italy,</hi> to go and
command in <hi>Spain.</hi> I need not tell you in what manner <hi>Hannibal</hi> and
<hi>Sempronius</hi> met, or how they encountred; onely thus much, that this
valiant <hi>Roman</hi> was overthrown near <hi>Trebra,</hi> and that nevertheleſs by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60667:51"/>
his good conduct, he preſerved ten thouſand men of his Army. In the
mean time <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>Flaminius</hi> were created Conſuls at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the Commiſſion of managing the War againſt <hi>Hannibal</hi> falling to
<hi>Flaminius,</hi> and this fierce Conſul being hardy to temerity, he preſently
put himſelfe in the head of his Army, and without regard to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
prodigies which threatned him with the loſſe of himſelfe and his
forces, he advanced in great precipitation to come and fight us. My
Maſter uſed extream diligence to encounter him, and to draw near to
<hi>Rome;</hi> but being arrived at a certain paſſage, which is between the Lake
of <hi>Thraſymene</hi> and a Mountain; he poſſeſſed himſelfe of all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
places, and encamping on this ſide the Straites, ſent to waſte the
Country about, to the end the cryes of the people might ſpeedily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
<hi>Flaminius</hi> to their ſuccour, and cauſe him to come to the paſſage
of the Lake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flaminius</hi> came thither in the ſame manner my Maſter had foreſeen;
where having engaged his Army between the Lake and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
he ſaw himſelfe charged at an inſtant on ſo many ſides, that all his
Troops were defeated, and himſelfe loſt his life for having fought
with too much valour. Then it was that there was a great conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that ſorrow produced there the ſtrange effects, of
which you have without doubt been informed, and that in this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they were conſtrained to create a Dictator, to the end he might
provide for the affairs of the Common-wealth, and undertake the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
adminiſtration of it. During this while, Joy and Confidence
were the onely paſſions which animated our Souldiers. Nevertheleſſe
my Maſter intending to take <hi>Spoletta</hi> in his way to the ſiege of <hi>Rome,</hi>
he met with ſo great reſiſtance from the place, that he deemed it more
conſequent to raiſe the ſiege, and go and fight the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
their utmoſt efforts to deliver their Country from extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.
<hi>Fabius,</hi> who was the perſon created Dictator, took the Field
with all the force that he could gather; and when we learnt that
the <hi>Scipioes</hi> made great progreſſes in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>
(who had ſucceeded <hi>Flaminius</hi>) came to joyn their Troops to
thoſe of the Dictator: my Maſter, to hinder this Union, advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Fabius</hi> with an extream diligence. But it muſt be confeſſed that
the <hi>Romanes</hi> found their <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Fabius,</hi> as my Maſter himſelfe
acknowledged. For this prudent Dictator fought us after a new
rate; and being aſſured he had to do with a man extreamly valiant, a
perpetual Victor, and one who drives at the end of the War, he laid
his deſign to overcome without fighting him. In effect the wiſe <hi>Fabius</hi>
ſaw himſelfe invironed with <hi>Romanes,</hi> or confederates of the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
while we were in the middle of our enemies, and could hope no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
nor ſupplies either in Mony or Munitions, and that we were
conſtrained to go forth every day to forrage for ſubſiſtence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſeisd on all the fortreſſes by which he might hinder our courſe, to
the end hunger might in a ſhort time do that againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which all
the forces of <hi>Italy</hi> could not. My Maſter, whoſe intereſt it was, as much
to fight, as that of <hi>Fabius</hi> to detract it, attempted all poſſible means to
draw his enemy to battel. He carried himſelfe even to give out diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60667:52"/>
ſpeeches of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and put himſelfe in the head of ten
thouſand Horſe to defie him ſeveral times: but the Dictator never
quitted his reſolution to hold off, and gently admoniſht <hi>Minutius</hi> who
would have engaged, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> were as much concern'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
battel, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was obliged to give it. Whereby this conduct
of <hi>Fabius</hi> reduced us to a ſtrange extremity; for Corn failing us, and
our Camp being block'd up by the <hi>Romanes, Hannibal</hi> had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
to hear his Souldiers murmur againſt him, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that his whole Army was in danger to periſh miſerably. But as
this famous Captain was not leſs great i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>prudence then in valour, he
ſerved himſelf of a ſtratagem which poſterity will hereafter admire,
and which I cannot wholly paſs over in ſilence, although it hath filled
the whole Earth with talk.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, my Lords, but you have heard that <hi>Hannibal</hi> alwaies
uſed to cauſe good ſtore of Oxen to be kept continually in his Army,
for its ſupport, and ſo you will not wonder when I tell you, that we
had at this time two thouſand in our Camp; whereupon my Maſter
cauſed branches of Trees extraordinarily dry, to be faſtned to the
hornes of theſe beaſts in a very dark night, to which ſetting fire, he made
the Oxen be driven againſt the Corps du Guard of the enemy. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
were ſuddenly affrighted with the number of fires which they
beheld moving towards them, being ignorant what they might be;
but they were by and by far more terrified when the Oxen became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by the violence of the fire; broke in upon them, and beſides
the prodigious outrages they made, filled the hills with dreadful bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> in the head of the moſt expedite of his Troops,
followed theſe formidable Van-couriers, as I may call them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
by his valour what his prudence had ſo fortunately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
he opened a free paſſage to the reſt of his Army. <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
about the break of day recollecting themſelves from their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
attempted upon our Reare, but they were ſoon conſtrained
to retreat: for my Maſter, who was not wanting in any place where
his preſence was neceſſary, immediately accurred with a conſiderable
re-enforcement. After this happy ſucceſs, we carried the Town of
<hi>Grenia</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> where we found Corn and all ſort of refreſhment,
and learnt there that <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> did not accord well together,
and that the firſt was accuſed of too much ſlowneſs. <hi>Hannibal</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them yet more, and to render this ſlowneſs ſuſpected, ſent to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
all the brave Houſes of the <hi>Romanes</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> with prohibition
from medling with thoſe of <hi>Fabius,</hi> to beget belief in the enemies that
they correſponded one with another ſecretly, and that out of this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſideration, the Dictator had forborn to accept battel.</p>
                  <p>This deportment of my Maſter ſo much confirmed the party of
<hi>Minu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>us,</hi> that he was by authority of the Senate equalled in power
with <hi>Fabius;</hi> upon which this impatient Roman came to attaque us
with the Groſs of his Army, which without doubt would have been
utterly defeated, had not <hi>Fabius</hi> haſtned to his aid, to ſecure his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
But, my Lords, being I have hitherto obſerved no difference of
time to avoid your trouble, it may be permitted me to relate to you,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60667:52"/>
with ſemblable liberty, the memorable and glorious day at <hi>Cannae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
where the <hi>Romanes</hi> beheld all their Forces defeated, under the conduct
of the unfortunate and generous <hi>Aemilius,</hi> and that of the precipitous
<hi>Varro.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but the enemies were valiant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and likewiſe ſtronger in
number; but it muſt be confeſſed, that the great courage and excellent
management of my Maſter out-ballanced the inequality, and won us
that renowned Victory. For one of our principal Officers, named
<hi>Giſcon,</hi> underſtanding the prodigious numerouſneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that came to fight us, appeared wholly aſtoniſhed at the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
But, my Maſter, inſtead of abating his fierceneſs, was remarked
to have more alacrity and gaiety then he was wont to have, after the
loſſe of his Princeſs: wherefore he immediately went to Horſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
followed by the greateſt part of his Officers, poſſeſſed himſelfe of
a little riſing place, whence he diſcovered the two Conſul's Armies,
which were lately united to come up againſt him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> viewed all
this conjoyned multitude attentively; but all thoſe that were with him
expreſſed ſome kind of real admiration and aſtoniſhment, ſo that <hi>Giſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
addreſſing to him: Well, my Lord (ſaid he) do you not obſerve
that the number and ſtrength of our enemies is as great as I repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to you? It is true (anſwered my Maſter) but I alſo obſerve a
wonder, which you take no notice of: <hi>'Tis</hi> (proceeded he ſmiling)
<hi>that in the great multitude of men which we behold, there is not ſo much as
one of your name of</hi> Giſcon.</p>
                  <p>This anſwer cauſed all that heard it to take heart, and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſpread abroad in the Army, it was hoped that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would
be as invincible, as he appeared immovable by ſporting at the ſight of
ſo many enemies; and it was believed impoſſible not to conquer under
the leading of ſo grand a perſonage. The ſucceſs evinced that it was
not without reaſon their hopes were conceived. For <hi>Hannibal</hi> this day
performed all that the greateſt Captain could do, and might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the moſt valiant Souldier. Yet I ſhall omit to deſcribe to
you the ordering of the Armies, ſince undoubtedly you know that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> marſhalled his in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> were inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Sun, the Wind, and the Duſt. I ſhall only tell you, that my
Maſter would this day himſelf command the main battalia, that he
might be oppoſed to <hi>Aemilius,</hi> whom he knew to be the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Captain of the Romanes; and that this Illuſtrious <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
was in great danger of periſhing this day, which was the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of his life. For this fierce Prince being farre engaged in the Army
of the enemies, to find out <hi>Aemilius</hi> or the young <hi>Scipio,</hi> whom he knew
to be returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> was on a ſudden wholly abandoned by his
own; and <hi>Aemilius</hi> being wounded about this time, the Voluntaries
that fought near his perſon, alighted to ſuccour him, and likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others doing ſo too, my Maſter found himſelf plunged in the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rout of them, ſo that after a thouſand brave deeds, he was upon the
point of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ailing: but as he was in the midſt of danger, encloſed with
abundance of enemies, <hi>Ducarion,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Inſubrians</hi> and
the <hi>Ligurians</hi> of our Army, ran into his help with a Cavalier which we
did not then know, but whom we ſoon perceived to be one of the moſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60667:53"/>
valiant men of the world. For he exploited ſo manful actions, that
notwithſtanding two or three wounds falling on him, he got cloſe up to
my Maſter, and there fought on with ſingular vigour and ſpirit. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of reciting to you all that our valiant General did afterwards,
I conceive it not requiſite to ſpeak of the particularitys of this battel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is enough to acquaint you that we ingaged in it at <hi>Cannae,</hi> to let
you judge what importance the victory was which <hi>Hannibal</hi> won, and
how deplorably deſperate the loſs was our enemies ſuffered there: for
it is certain that they loſt betvveen ſixty &amp; eighty thouſand men that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi>
&amp; <hi>Servilius</hi> were ſlain, that <hi>Regulus</hi> vvas mortally vvounded, and
that there periſht ſuch a number of perſons of quality, that my Maſter
ſent the Senate of <hi>Carthage</hi> a large Veſſel of pure Gold, filled vvith
the Rings dravvn from the fingers of the Roman Knights, vvich we
found dead upon the place. Then it was that the pride of <hi>Rome</hi> vvas
abated, and that our enemies lookt upon themſelves as abſolutely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
beyond recovery; and that in our Army amongſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
cryes of joy, our Souldiers vvere heard cry out fiercely in the
height of their Victory, <hi>Away, Let us to</hi> Rome, Rome <hi>is our own. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
was raviſhed vvith joy, when he heard his Souldiers of themſelves
demanding to go vvhether he vvas minded to lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hem. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reſolved upon the ſiege of <hi>Rome,</hi> he deſigned not to defer it long,
and onely to afford his Forces a few dayes for their repoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
but being in need himſelfe of that, whereof he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the behalf of others, he cauſed his Armour to be unbraced,
and two or three wounds he had received to be dreſſed, which we had
the contentment to ſee were but ſlight, and that this Illuſtrious Prince
had not purchas'd the memorable field of <hi>Cannae</hi> at too great a price.
Yet he was obliged to take his bed by order of the Chyrurgions, where
inſtead of taking the quiet they believed he ſhould find, he cauſed me
to be called, to diſcourſe to me of the ſtate of his Affairs. And well,
<hi>Aſpar</hi> (ſaid he to me) with a fierceneſs mixed with ſomewhat of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
and melancholly) you ſee me Maſter of <hi>Italy,</hi> and I ſhall
within few dayes give Lawes to the <hi>Romanes;</hi> you ſee me vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
of my enemies; but alas! <hi>Aſpar,</hi> you alſo ſee me abſent from
my Princeſs: what joy would mine be (continued he) if I could
carry <hi>Thomira</hi> triumphing to <hi>Rome?</hi> what could I imagine wanting to
my felicity, were it poſſible for me to eſtabliſh the Throne of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in the Capitol, and from thence cauſe her to behold all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth ſubject to their Soveraignty. But the Traytor <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
puts an obſtacle to this felicity, which the <hi>Romanes</hi> could not do;
he deprives me of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and that falſe man makes me in a loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
when my Victories ſeem to preſent me with the poſſeſſion and

ſhall find vengeance for him, and have the pleaſure of puniſhing him
for his crime, without the diſpleaſure of <hi>Thomira,</hi> ſince he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it againſt the ſentiments of that adorable Princeſs. For (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

the wood of <hi>Caſtulon?</hi> and didſt thou not obſerve in it theſe obliging
words? (<hi>I was inclinable to ſatisfie you; and I might even tell you, were
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60667:53"/>
it not boldneſs, that it was with leſs repugnance then a perſon of my ſex
ought apparently to have in ſuch a caſe.</hi> If theſe words, <hi>Aſpar,</hi> oblige me
to render a thouſand thanks to my Princeſs; do not theſe other give me
all manner of cauſe to hate <hi>Lucius,</hi> and to purſue him to the utmoſt?
(<hi>I ſhould not abſent my ſelf from you, if</hi> Lucius <hi>and</hi> Nadalia <hi>did not force
me ſo to do.</hi>) Yes perfidious <hi>Lucius</hi> (cryed he) I will hate thee, and
purſue thee to the death; and this <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who hath defeated all the
forces of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall ſoon diſpatch a Traytor, and cauſe him to pay his
blood for the expiation of his crime.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould never end, my Lords, if I ſhould go about to repeat all the
words of this paſſionate Prince: It is enough that you know, that he
rendred a thouſand thanks to <hi>Thomira,</hi> and as often broke forth into
fury againſt the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia.</hi> He likewiſe paſſed the night with
inquietude, which followed the moſt glorious day of his life; and
while all the world rejoyced in his Army, he did nothing but revolue
in his minde, what means he might uſe to finde <hi>Thomira,</hi> ſo much was
this Princes love at this time above his ambition.</p>
                  <p>The next morning <hi>Maharbal, Adherbal, Giſcon,</hi> and divers other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Officers, came to his ſent; where having diſcourſed of very
many particularities of the victory of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> they fell to ſpeak
of the perſons of condition which had been ſlain or wounded in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel:
The number of them was found not to be great, and my Maſter
being ſufficiently informed thereof, he demanded news of <hi>Magar,</hi> of
whom he had a particular eſteem, and whom he had not ſeen ſince the
fight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magar</hi> is ſafe (anſwered <hi>Maharbal</hi>) and I aſſure you, my Lord, that
he came off with you, and that he would have made one in the honour
which we now receive, if a Souldier had not come to tell him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in private; which he did with ſuch eagerneſs, as gave us to think
it is a thing of no ſmall importance. But, my Lord, beſides the perſons
we have hitherto ſpoken of, there is yet a Cavalier, whoſe name I could
not exactly know, who is dangerouſly wounded, and who, I am told,
fought yeſterday very valiantly with <hi>Ducarion,</hi> in the head of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubrians.</hi>
Alas, <hi>Maharbal</hi> (anſwered my Maſter) I beheld this Cavalier
fighting my ſelf; I ſaw him do a hundred brav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deeds, and without
doubt he is the ſame Cavalier, who contributed very much to diſengage
me from amongſt the Enemies: So that I am obliged (continued he)
both out of acknowledgement and eſteem of his vertue, to go viſit him,
and offer him every thing that I ſhall judge reaſonable, when I know
him.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, <hi>Hannibal</hi> cauſed himſelf to be made ready, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatient of his bed, and conceiving he was in condition enough to
leave his chamber, went to the quarters of the <hi>Inſubrians,</hi> whither <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbal,
Adherbal,</hi> and my ſelf attended him.</p>
                  <p>He did not finde <hi>Ducarion</hi> in his Tent; but being entred into that of
the Cavalier he deſigned to viſit, he was ſo ſtrangely ſurpriz'd as ſoon
as he caſt his eye upon his countenance, that it is impoſſible for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
this rancounter: For he perſiſted a vvhile, as it vvere, unmoveable,
and by and by giving himſelf up vvholly to his choler: Ah, Traytor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60667:54"/>
(cryed he) thou ſhalt dye, and thou ſhalt never finde pardon, notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thou haſt ſerved in my Army.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vvords of my Maſter, joyned vvith his amazement, encreaſed
our curioſity; upon vvhich, dravving near by degrees, vve vvere aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
in our turns alſo, to finde that this vvounded Cavalier vvas the
Prince of <hi>Celtiberia.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Hannibal</hi> vvas perplexed vvith
a thouſand tumultuous thoughts: He threatned <hi>Lucius,</hi> he demanded
of him vvhere the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> vvas; and uttered if I (may
dare to ſay it) a thouſand different things at the ſame time. Perfidious
man (ſaid he to him, vvith a menacing tone) you are he that hath taken
<hi>Thomira</hi> from me, but you ſhall either dye, or tell me vvhere ſhe is.</p>
                  <p>The names of <hi>Traytor</hi> and <hi>Perfidious</hi> much ſurprize me (anſwered
<hi>Lucius</hi>) although they are given by a man blinded vvith the violence
of his paſſion: But to paſs by theſe vvords (added he, vvith a conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that ſeem'd to us very fierce and noble) I ſhall tell thee, O <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
that I have carried the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> away from thee; and if it
be ſo, that I muſt either dye, or tell you where ſhe is, I readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
my life.</p>
                  <p>This anſwer touched my Maſter to the quick; but being unwilling to
do any thing ignoble, he endeavoured to calm his paſſions: And then
beholding <hi>Lucius</hi> with a conſtraint upon himſelf; I know well (ſaid he)
that you underſtand to bear your ſelf generouſly, and I have already
ſeen that you know how to ſeem reſolute; but I ſhall alſo ſoon learn, if
when you are not in the condition I now ſee you in, you will be able to
retain this firmneſs of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>He went forth upon theſe words, feeling his paſſion encreaſe againſt
the force he uſed to repreſs it in his breaſt; and giving order to guard
<hi>Lucius</hi> carefully, took the way to his own quarters, and retired into his
Tent; into which he was no ſooner entred, but he look'd upon us with
an air that ſpoke his wonder: And turning on a ſudden to <hi>Maharbal;</hi>
Muſt you not confeſs (ſaid he to him) that you never ſaw any thing ſo
ſurprizing and intricate, as what we now came from? For at ſuch time
as I accounted <hi>Lucius</hi> my Enemy, he fought for me; and when I went
to viſit a Cavalier to whom I had an obligation, I found my Enemy in
the perſon of this Cavalier; but a cruel Enemy, an Enemy that ſpeaks
with boldneſs to me of the crime which he hath committed againſt me,
and outdares my choler, when it lightens but with juſtice. It is true
(added he fiercely) he hath hapned on the onely means there is to brave
<hi>Hannibal</hi> with impunity; and <hi>Lucius</hi> unarm'd, wounded, and in bed,
may do the things the greateſt forces of <hi>Europe</hi> have not been able to do
to this hour. But that <hi>Lucius,</hi> who can do all this by his weakneſs, will
not be always in the condition I have left him in; and perhaps I may
be allowed to revenge my ſelf not diſhonourably, and fight with an
Enemy, with whom notwithſtanding, many other perſons would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
in another manner: Yes, <hi>Maharbal</hi> (continued he) I will fight
with <hi>Lucius,</hi> I will imploy nothing but my ovvn arm to the puniſhment
of this treacherous perſon; and methinks I have already overcome him,
and conſtrained him to tell me vvhere the fair Princeſs of <hi>Caſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:60667:54"/>
I do not fully underſtand this adventure, my Lord (anſvvered <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbal</hi>)
yet I believe, if <hi>Lucius</hi> anſvvered you in a manner vvhich diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
you, it vvas becauſe you firſt treated him vvith the titles of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious</hi>
and <hi>Criminal;</hi> for in that he hath fought for you, it is an evidence
to evince him not your Enemy. Ah, <hi>Maharbal</hi> (interrupted he) its an
evidence to evince the contrary: Hath he not carried avvay <hi>Thomira</hi>
from me? and if chance hath occaſioned my ſeeing him in my Army,
did he not at firſt behold me vvith as great indignation, as he could
have ſhevvn, had I committed a crime more hainous then himſelf is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of? So that I perceive, <hi>Maharbal,</hi> you did not at firſt obſerve the
countenance of <hi>Lucius,</hi> ſeeing you vvonder that I ſuffered my ſelf to
be ſo tranſported againſt him.</p>
                  <p>It is true, he fought for me, but undoubtedly ſomething vve cannot
conjecture, engaged him in my Army: Nevertheleſs, I vvill grant that
it vvas onely for my intereſts he fought, and moreover, that he preſerved
my life; yet do not you underſtand, <hi>Maharbal,</hi> that he hath done more
againſt me in carrying avvay the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> then he could
do for me in preſerving the Prince of <hi>Carthage;</hi> ſince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ife is no other
then a puniſhment to me, vvhen I paſs it abſent from that adorable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
and that I am oblig'd and offended far more ſenſibly in the perſon
of <hi>Thomira,</hi> then in that of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this paſſionate Prince had ended theſe vvords, <hi>Magar</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Tent, and that vvith a countenance ſo ſatisfied, that vve preſag'd
good tidings from him. As ſoon as he had made his reverence to my
Maſter, he preſented the Guard of a Svvord to him enriched vvith Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
vvhich vve inſtantly knevv to be the ſame I have formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to you, and vvhich I told you, vvas firſt ovvned by the Prince of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and aftervvards by him of <hi>Celtiberia. Hannibal</hi> beheld this
rich Guard, vvithout ſignifying any vvonder at it, becauſe he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſeen <hi>Lucius,</hi> vvho he believ'd had loſt it. Upon vvhich <hi>Magar</hi>
began to ſpeak; I perceive, my Lord (ſaid he) that becauſe you come
from ſeeing <hi>Lucius,</hi> you regard not with joy that which I offer to you;
but I think not but you will be ſurpriz'd, when you are informed where
the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> is, and learn—Ah, <hi>Magar</hi> (interrupted <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>)
tell me in what place that Divine Princeſs may be found.</p>
                  <p>There are ſo many other things to tell you (replied he) that without
giving me time to hearken to them, that I defer not your ſatisfaction, I
am come immediately to conduct you to the Tent of a <hi>Gaul,</hi> where
you will be told ſo amazing paſſage, as you would unqueſtionably be
backward to believe, if you ſhould underſtand them from any other
mouth then his, that is moſt fit to recount you them.</p>
                  <p>Let us go then, <hi>Magar</hi> (interrupted he further) let us go (ſaid he) and
without word more, went preſently out of his Tent, directly to the
quarter of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> Although <hi>Hannibal</hi> was wounded, yet we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
without preſuming to tell him, that he was negligent of himſelf,
becauſe this Prince was ſo paſſionately bent to whatſoever he willed, that
we ſhould undoubtedly have ſpoken to no purpoſe; beſides that indeed,
the quarters of the <hi>Gauls</hi> was not far diſtant from the place where we
vvere; and that my Maſter vvas then to receive ſuch intelligence as much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60667:55"/>
imported the repoſe of his life. So we ſoon entered the Tent to which
<hi>Magar</hi> invited us; and the Maſter of it having done the ceremonies
of the greateſt honour, conducted the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> towards a
bed, wherein a wounded perſon lay. As ſoon as the man ſaw my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he ſighed, and then addreſſing his ſpeech to this Illuſtrious Prince
Ah, my Lord, (ſaid he) how can you indure the ſight of a man that:
hath betrayed you; that hath laboured to render you unhappy,
and in brief, done his utmoſt to deprive you of the Princeſſe of <hi>Caſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon?</hi>
I ſhall ſuffer your ſight (interrupted <hi>Hannibal</hi> impatiently) and
ſhall pardon you alſo, provided that you confeſs ingeniouſly, and tell
me where I may go ſee the Princeſs <hi>Thomira.</hi> You do me too great a
favour, My Lord (replyed the wounded man! and I proteſt to you,
that I ſhall immediately acknowledge it by my ſincerity, and tell you
without diſguiſement who I am, and what I have done. Know then,
my Lord, that people call me <hi>Malarcon,</hi> that I was born in the City of
<hi>Hiſpalis,</hi> and that I was poſſeſſed with an unſatiable appetite of heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up wealth, which I ſought to obtain by all means imaginable; ſo
that I likewiſe practiſed ſuch as were moſt unlawful, as often as I found
they were moſt profitable. Wherefore, my Lord, you will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
when I ſhall tell you all that I have done; and if it be true that the
paſſions find their excuſe in their violence, you will even have the
goodneſs to forgive me, ſeeing I have been carried to them by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
deſire of Riches, but ſuch a deſire as was unſatiable and overſwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all other conſiderations. I did not continue in long ſuſpence what
ſide to take during the war of <hi>Spain,</hi> immediately betaking my ſelf to
your Army; and without regarding that it was againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
you were to fight, I onely conſidered that it was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that
were to be plundered and pillaged. To this end I would have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
&amp; choſe <hi>Alorca</hi> for the perſon, to whom I rendered ſo many
little ſervices and diligences, that I drew his amity inſenſibly with his
truſt; ſo that <hi>Alorca</hi> being become deſperately inamour'd of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Caſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me, with the regret he had of having the moſt redoubted Rival in the
world.</p>
                  <p>How? (interrupted <hi>Hannibal</hi> in great wonder) was <hi>Alorca</hi> deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
amorous of the Princeſs of <hi>Castulon</hi> at <hi>Saguntum?</hi> He was ſo
moſt certainly, my Lord (anſwered he) and I have been in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment
a hundred times, that you never took notice of the
flame, which very many began to obſerve. But, my Lord, I crave
the favour of your attention to the ſequel of my diſcourſe, and you
ſhall underſtand things that will ſurpriſe you much more.</p>
                  <p>Ah, <hi>Malarcon</hi> (interrupted my Maſter again) may I believe that
<hi>Alorca</hi> dared love in the ſame place with <hi>Hannibal?</hi> But proceed (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he) and that without fear of my interrupting you. When the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Alorca</hi> increaſed his violence every day (replyed <hi>Malarcon</hi>) he
declared it to me conſtantly, but in ſuch terms as was not poſſible for
one to uſe, that is not poſſeſſed by the ſame paſſion that ſuggeſted
them to him. So that this paſſionate man beholding with a ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
all that you did at <hi>Sag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60667:55"/>
to act for <hi>Attanes,</hi> and injure you, and conſidering that King
as your Rival rather then his own, he went to him and aſſured him of
all manner of aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Attanes,</hi> who obſerved vvith vvhat heat <hi>Alorca</hi> ſpoke to him, eaſily
gave credit to that vvhich he ſaid: he accepted his offers, and then
making him a thouſand remerciments, diſcovered to him at length the
ſecret of his paſſion. He told him that he had cauſed <hi>Edeſcon</hi> to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away, but it was in ſo obliging a manner, that he expected any
thing from that Prince; upon vvhich <hi>Alorca</hi> departed from the King
of the <hi>Turdetanes</hi> with almoſt as great regret as vvhat he had heard him
ſay, as that which he ſavv you do every day. But, my Lord, without
particularizing all that <hi>Alorca</hi> told me, all that he did and ſuffered at
<hi>Saguntum,</hi> in the voyage from <hi>Saguntum</hi> to <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and alſo after his
arrival in that City, vvhich vvas aftervvards ſo fatal to him, it ſuffices
to let you knovv, that he almoſt loſt all heart vvhen the people of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulon</hi>
began to repine againſt their Princeſs for not giving you her
ſpeedy conſent, and that his regrets redoubled vvhen it vvas rumour'd
abroad that ſhe had given it to you. This excited him to deſign a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
wayes to break off your Marriage; vvhich ſoon after rejecting as
ineffectuall, he bethought himſelf at length of imploying the affection
of <hi>Attanes</hi> againſt yours in this occaſion. He therefore took me into his
Cabinet, and beholding me a while with unſettled looks, Ah, <hi>Malar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con!</hi>
(ſaid he) I am loſt; and I muſt either kill <hi>Hannibal</hi> this day, or
hinder him from marrying <hi>Thomira.</hi> I counſel you (anſwered I
to him in great amazement at his words) to effect your ſecond reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
rather then to kill the Prince of <hi>Carthage.</hi> It is requiſite then
(interrupted he inſtantly) that you ſerve me in the buſineſs, and that
without loſs of time you depart from <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and ſpeed away to the
King of the <hi>Turdetanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>Malarcon</hi> (proceeded) <hi>Attanes</hi> ſhall no ſooner have learnt
the newes that I write him, and you relate him with all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but he ſhall make work with <hi>Edeſcon</hi> in ſuch manner, that that
Prince ſhall denounce to <hi>Thomira</hi> that he in no wiſe conſents that ſhe
marry with a <hi>Carthaginian;</hi> and the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> being a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of very great virtue, will without doubt do nothing contrary to the
will of the Prince her Father. This diſcourſe of <hi>Alorca</hi> perplexed me
very much, and I could not ſee at firſt how the affair could poſſibly
ſucceed. But, my Lord, I am conſtrained to confeſs to my ſhame, that
a Casket ſtored with Money and Jewels, perſwaded me more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
then all the beſeechings of <hi>Alorca.</hi> Wherefore I left <hi>Castulon,</hi>
and uſed the greateſt diligence I could; and, as if the preſence of <hi>Alorca</hi>
had opened my eyes and my underſtanding, or rather being incouraged
by it to hope another from the King of the <hi>Turdetanes,</hi> I did much
more then my inſtructions impowered me to do. Yet it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
my Lord, to relate to you the effect of my negotiation, being I
know you ſaw the Letter at <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> which I brought thither from the
Prince of the <hi>Saguntines;</hi> but I now come to diſcover to you my great
crime in explicating that of <hi>Alorca.</hi> You remember, without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
my Lord, that the laſt time you ſaw the Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60667:56"/>
from her unſatisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and left her after a manner not ordinary
with you; upon which <hi>Alorca</hi> took hopes that then was the time he
might ſupplant you. But underſtanding the next morning that you
were gone from <hi>Caſtulon</hi> with deſign to take <hi>Edeſcon</hi> out of the hands
of <hi>Attanes,</hi> he conceived all his hopes ruined, and that he was no
longer able to obſtruct your pretenſions. Nevertheleſs, for all this, his
love and his jealouſie grew to ſo great exceſs, that ſeeing all was loſt
for him, he reſolved to hazard all; and ſerved himſelfe of a means
which was not leſs violent then the paſſions which inſpired it, and this
without conſidering into what ſtrange extremities he ruſhed. He lead
me forth to walk in a ſolitary place, to diſcover me his deſign, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prepared my mind by proteſting the violence of his love, and
the greatneſſe of the preſents he would make me, he told me he had
deviſed a way to cauſe an immortal hatred in <hi>Thomira</hi> againſt <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
and to render <hi>Alorca</hi> inſeparable from that fair Princeſs. But, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larcon</hi>
(continued he) to ſhew you that there will not be much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in bringing to paſs this deſign, which at firſt will ſurpriſe you, you
need but conſider that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and conſequently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to love, but inconſtant to what he affects, and faithleſſe in all
things.</p>
                  <p>You muſt alſo conſider that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is the moſt ambitious of men,
and ſo you will ſoon judge that its eaſie for his ambition to ruine his
love, eſpecially in the abſence of the perſon beloved: But, <hi>Malarcon,</hi>
the Princeſs <hi>Thomira</hi> will readily give credit to all that I ſhall tell her;
and although all I ſhall tell her of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſhould not be ſufficient to
perſwade her, yet how can ſhe imagine that <hi>Alorca</hi> intends at the ſame
time to deceive both <hi>Hannibal</hi> &amp; <hi>Thomira? Alorca,</hi> I ſay, who hath great
obligations both to the one and the other; and what appearance is there
that <hi>Thomira,</hi> who knoweth not the paſſion I have for her in my ſoul,
ſhould queſtion the uprightneſs of my relation, eſpecially when I ſhall
offer to quit the advancement I have in <hi>Spain</hi> to follow her fortune:
and, in a word, when ſhe ſhall ſee all that I do for her ſervice, without
imagining the aim of my actions. This diſcourſe (continued the
wounded perſon) gave me ſuſpition that <hi>Alorca</hi> had plotted ſome trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
againſt you, my Lord, and the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi> But I could
not comprehend by what way he deſigned to betray you, till, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me a Letter, Here (ſaid he) ſee the means to effect my deſign; and
being the Character of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> is neither known to <hi>Thomira</hi> or <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
behold that which muſt beſtead me in drawing this fair Princeſs
out of the power of my Rival, and to cauſe the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> to
be arreſted, who is the onely perſon that can diſcover and deſtroy my
enterpriſe. Ending theſe words, he put the Letter I ſpoke of into my
hands, in which I found ſomething ſo aſtoniſhing, that having in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
read it over more then once, I retain'd all the ſence, and near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very words, which were to this effect.</p>

him into a houſe upon the bank thereof, cauſed him to be arreſted by
the ſix men I ſpake of, who preſently zeiſed his ſword, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
performed all that had been appointed them.</p>
                  <p>I ſtaid in this houſe, to command in it vvhat vvas fit, vvhilſt <hi>Alorca</hi>

ſhe vvas vvont to reſort, vvithout other company then that of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,</hi>
and a fevv perſons neceſſary to attend on her. At this time <hi>Alorca</hi>
beſeeching the Princeſs to cauſe all her Attendants to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the entrance of the Wood, except <hi>Nadalia:</hi> He no ſooner ſavv
himſelf alone with theſe two fair Ladies, but he caſt himſelf at the feet
of <hi>Thomira</hi> (as I was afterwards told) and having prepared the minde
of that admirable Princeſs, by divers changes of his countenance, and
a certain rapture which I cannot expreſs: Alas, Madam (ſaid he to her)
that I ſhould ever be obliged to tell you the moſt deteſtable Crime that
can be imagined! I believe <hi>Alorca</hi> ſo little capable of commiting it
(anſwered the Princeſs, with a moſt charming ſweetneſs) that I wonder
at the changes that appear in you. You have reaſon, Madam (replied
he) to believe as you do: But if you knew the crime I am commanded
to perpetrate, you would yet judge me more unfit for it then any other.
At theſe words the Princeſs and <hi>Nadalia</hi> were very much ſurpriz'd, not
being able to imagine who could command <hi>Alorca</hi> to do any thing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy
of the nature of that he ſpoke of. But <hi>Alorca</hi> ſoon drew them from
this ſurprize, to caſt them into a greater: For addreſſing to the Princeſs,
I muſt therefore, Madam, ſpeak more clearly to you, and repreſent
<hi>Hannibal</hi> to you ſuch as he truly is.</p>
                  <p>Ah, <hi>Alorca</hi> (interrupted the Princeſs, being provoked by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
how do you ſpeak of a great Prince, and of a Prince which
hath none but illuſtrious qualities, and to whom we have ſo great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations?
You will ſoon ſee, Madam (replied he) how <hi>Hannibal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
all theſe obligations, with the Order he hath lately ſent me; and
if that <hi>Cathaginian</hi> hath treated you civilly, it hath been with reluctancy
and violence to his own fierce and cruel diſpoſition; and being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from you at a time he was diſſatisfied, and never ſeen you ſince, his
nature hath become more powerful then all your charms: So that his
ambition having regain'd its accuſtomed place, this proud <hi>Affrican</hi>
hath reſolv'd to bow no more under your Empire; and hath choſen to
that purpoſe, the moſt horrible precaution that can be conceiv'd. But
Madam (added he) I beſeech you ſpare me the pain of telling you the
buſineſs exactly, and read this Letter, which will inſtruct you in it;
and be aſſured, that <hi>Alorca</hi> will quit all, and hazard all to follow
you.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, he preſented to <hi>Thomira</hi> the Letter which I told
you of, wherein the fair Princeſs read near the ſame words I repeated to
you. In truth, my Lords (ſaid <hi>Aſpar</hi> to the Princes his Auditors) it
is moſt difficult to repreſent to you in what eſtate my Maſter found
himſelf, when <hi>Malarcon</hi> told him that <hi>Thomira</hi> had read the Letter of
<hi>Alorca:</hi> it is enough to tell you, that this Prince having quietly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the recital of all the Treacheries that had been done againſt him,
could not contain from trembling and agitation of minde, when he
fancied this pernicious Letter in the hands of his Princeſs. But being
the various tranſports of this Prince, did not interrupt the courſe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larcons</hi>
ſtory; I ſhall tell you, that he continued it in this manner: As
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60667:57"/>
ſoon as this generous Princeſs had ended reading the Letter, ſhe beheld
<hi>Nadalia</hi> with very great amazement: And then turning towards <hi>Alorca,</hi>
I am perfectly obliged to you (ſaid ſhe to him, with a perfectly-charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſweetneſs) for that you have had reluctancy to follow the Orders of
the Prince <hi>Hannibal;</hi> but <hi>Alorca,</hi> expect not any intreaties from me,
which would be unworthy of the ſpirit of <hi>Thomira:</hi> I am prepared for
all ſorts of events, and 'tis poſſible you may ſee that I am not guilty of
much weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Alas, Madam, what is it you ſay (cryed <hi>Nadalia</hi>) how? would you
dye? and can you believe <hi>Alorca</hi> capable of following your ſentiments?
or muſt you follow his, Madam? Yes, Madam, you muſt; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
you muſt immediately bethink you of quitting <hi>Spain,</hi> to go and
ſecure in ſome unknown place the perſon of the faireſt Princeſs of the
World. How, <hi>Nadalia?</hi> (anſwered the Princeſs) would you have
<hi>Thomira</hi> reſolve to flie? and inſtead of awaiting a glorious death at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulon,</hi>
go and carry her miſery from one Countrey to another? No,
no, <hi>Nadalia, Thomira</hi> will never reſolve on this; and you ſhall ſee, that
ſhee—Ah, Madam (interrupted <hi>Alorca</hi>) can you ſtill deliberate on
what you have to do? and will you not at length follow the ſentiment
of <hi>Nadalia?</hi> Can you imagine I expect to be prayed to do that which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought?</p>
                  <p>But my Lord (purſued <hi>Malarcon</hi>) in the mean while that in the Wood
of <hi>Caſtulon, Thomira</hi> is preferring death before flight; and that <hi>Nada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
and <hi>Alorca</hi> endeavour to overcome this generous Princeſs, <hi>Lucius</hi> by
little and little recover'd himſelf from the amazement, an adventure ſo
extraordinary had caus'd to him; for this Prince ſeemed at firſt ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
that he could ſcarce believe what he ſaw: He could not imagine
what cauſe could move <hi>Thomira</hi> to have him arreſted, and yet believing
that it was not but by order from that fair Princeſs that <hi>Alorca</hi> acted, he
ſuffered this rude treatment without complaining. But no ſooner had
he learnt what was the Commiſſion, we told him <hi>Alorca</hi> had received,
but he was extreamly perplexed, in conſideration of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
of attempting his utmoſt to eſcape out of our hands, and go
take care for the preſervation of his fair Couſin the Princeſs: But again
conſidering, that a man unarmed cannot without miracle, preſume to
maſter ſeven others with weapons, he intended to act after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to compaſs that by intreaties, which his valour would without
doubt, never have obtained. He addreſſed himſelf therefore to me,
as to him of all the reſt that guarded him, of greateſt advantage to ſerve
him; and promiſed me ſo many things above my hopes, that aſſaulting
me on that weak ſide <hi>I</hi> told you of, <hi>I</hi> was ſoon inclinable to do all things
for a Prince, from whom <hi>I</hi> might expect any thing; beſides that, <hi>I</hi> was
eaſily brought to a belief, that <hi>I</hi> was not obliged to be faithful to a
Traytor.</p>
                  <p>It is not much needful to tell you, my Lord, that after <hi>Lucius</hi> had gain'd
me, I reſtored him the rich Sword which was taken from him; or what
means <hi>I</hi> uſed to free the Prince out of the houſe in which he was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for you may judge, that ſince <hi>I</hi> gave all orders there, this laſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
was not of ſo great difficulty to me as the firſt. But <hi>I</hi> ſhall onely
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60667:58"/>
tell you, that I would not diſcover to him the treaſon of <hi>Alorca,</hi> leaſt
I ſhould thereby diminiſh the importance of my ſervice, and that I
went to attend <hi>Lucius</hi> to the Bank of <hi>Boetis,</hi> at a place where I had
provided a veſſel for <hi>Alorca,</hi> which I then deſtin'd to the Prince of
<hi>Celtiberia.</hi> In the mean time that I took my way along the <hi>Boetis, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
took his directly to the wood of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> where he was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
arrived (as I underſtood afterwards) but he terribly ſurpriſed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Spaniard,</hi> believing himſelfe betrayed, and that <hi>Lucius</hi> was
informed of the whole buſineſs, was inſtantly become deſperate, but
far more, when the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> told him that he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
all, and that he came either to break his pernicious deſign, or to
take away his life. So that <hi>Alorca</hi> being carried by his diſpair, drew
his ſword, and ran forcibly towards <hi>Lucius</hi> to kill him, or to dye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
by his hand, fearing death leſs, then that the Princeſs ſhould
come to know all that he had contrived againſt her. But as the Prince
of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> was upon the point of ſhewing the difference between his
own valour and that of <hi>Alorca; Thomira</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> haſtily told him
that <hi>Alorca</hi> was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> culpable, and by that means arreſted (as I may ſo
ſpeak) a part of his valour. Nevertheleſs the moderation of this
Prince was unprofitable; for <hi>Alorca,</hi> either driven by his unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny,
or rather blinded with his own rage, caſt himſelf upon <hi>Lucius</hi>'s
Sword, and extorted the puniſhment of his crime by running to his
death, which he received by full thruſt that pierced his body. The
generous Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> lamented the fate of <hi>Alorca,</hi> eſpecially
when he beheld tears falling from the fair eyes of <hi>Thomira</hi> and <hi>Nada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi>
But ſoon beth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomira</hi> a long time oppoſed the motion of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Nadalia;</hi>
but at length the prayers of theſe two dear perſons were ſo powerfull,
that this fair Princeſs conſented to depart, which notwithſtanding ſhe
did not, till ſhe had firſt left the Tablet wherein ſhe writ part of her
thoughts. Oh Gods! (cryed <hi>Hannibal</hi> then) how have I flattered
my ſelfe, and what miſinterpretation have I put upon the words of
<hi>Thomira?</hi> But there was the moſt appearance (added he) to induce
me to think ſo, being ingnorant of all that is now diſcovered to me, and
the words of that adorable Princeſs being theſe. (<hi>I was inclinable to
ſatisfie you, and I might tell you (were it not boldneſs</hi>) that it was with
leſs repugnance, <hi>then a perſon of my Sex ought apparently to have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
was ſilent after theſe words, and whilſt he was revolving in his
mind a thouſand different thoughts, <hi>Malarcon</hi> told him that <hi>Lucius,
Thomira, Nadalia,</hi> and the Man that had charge of the Princeſs's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
being arrived at the Banks of <hi>Boetis,</hi> they quickly imbarqued in
the Veſſel that awaited them. Into which <hi>Nadalia</hi> was no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but ſhe ſaid aloud in the hearing of a man whom we left on
ſhore, that we vvould go into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the end he might inform you
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60667:58"/>
ſo. Therefore vve plyed our courſe tovvards the mouth of <hi>Boetis,</hi>
vvhich by reaſon of our unreadineſs for a ſpeedy riddance, and the
winding of the River, we recovered vvith ſome difficulty; but vve the
rather choſe to do ſo, that vve might amuſe the ſearch of thoſe that
might purſue us.</p>
                  <p>But being this outlet of <hi>Boetis</hi> is not farre diſtant from the Pillars of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> vve ſoon gained the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> in another Veſſel in which
we embarqued at <hi>Gades:</hi> for, my Lord, I forgot to tell you that <hi>Alorca</hi>
had given me good ſtore of moneo, which he prevailed with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to be put in her Chariot, whereby we were in a condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
any thing. It pleaſed <hi>Lucius</hi> to command our courſe to be
ſteared towards the <hi>Baleares</hi> Iſlands, that we might paſs from thence
into <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> which was reſolutely refuſed by <hi>Thomira,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
ſhe would in no wiſe contribute to the ruine of that Country. It
is true (added <hi>Nadalia</hi>) that whatſoever the paſſions of <hi>Hannibal</hi> be,
he will fend to all places imaginable to give us ſanctuary, to enquire
news of the Princeſs; and whereas his nature is fierce, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
very formidable, it is to be feared he will deſtroy the Country
we ſhall ſecure our ſelves in, to fetch us out of it. We muſt then go
to <hi>Celtiberia</hi> (replyed <hi>Lucius</hi>) for beſides that I ſhould be guilty of
great weakneſs, if I ſought any other protection then that of the
King my Father, I ſhould be unjuſt if I ſhould bring ruine to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Country for the preſervation of <hi>Celtiberia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To avoid all you ſpeak of (anſwed the Princeſs) it is beſt we go
to ſome place, where in all likelihood he will not ſeek us. Ah, Madam
(replyed <hi>Lucius</hi>) it would be very difficult to know what place that
is. To know it (replyed <hi>Nadalia</hi>) I muſt tell you, <hi>Carthage</hi> is it; and
I am aſſured <hi>Hannibal</hi> will never think of inquiring after us thither;
beſides the other reaſons that oblige us to follow this Councel. For
being the Arms of <hi>Carthage</hi> are very redoubtable, there is ſo little fear
in that City, that in probability, There is no notice taken of ſtrangers
that paſs in and out of it every day. So that we may enter it without
being known to any who we are; and the vaſtneſſe of the place gives
us the ſame ſecurity of continuance for ſome time, we ſhall afterwards
follow new courſes according as events ſhall direct us. Although this
opinion of <hi>Nadalia</hi> was grounded on good reaſon, yet <hi>Lucius</hi> could
not reſolve to cloſe with it, judging it unbeſeeming a Prince to uſe
ſuch an obſcure low means for his ſafety: But <hi>Thomira</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi>
effected with their entreaties, that at length he conſented the Pilate
ſhould ſteer the Veſſel to <hi>Carthage.</hi> Accordingly vve arrived happily
at that proud City, and continued there a longer time then we at firſt
intended; till the inquietudes of <hi>Lucius</hi> obliged <hi>Thomira</hi> to depart
from thence, and repaſs into <hi>Spain;</hi> the Prince telling his fair Couſin,
that ſeeing <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in <hi>Italy</hi> (for by that time you were arrived
there) affairs without doubt would have a new face in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo
ſhe might go and reſide with the Queen of <hi>Celtiberia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons of <hi>Lucius,</hi> joyned with the regret he had to be abſent
from the Princeſs of the <hi>Ilargetes,</hi> induced <hi>Thomira</hi> to conſent readily
to the Princes deſires; whereupon we embarqued, with deſign to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60667:59"/>
that of the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia.</hi> But, my Lord, the time did not
favour our intention, and the wind had not befriended us above a few
hours, but we vvere overtaken with a furious Tempeſt which drave us
between <hi>Scicilie</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and at length into the Tyrrhene Sea.
This was not all our danger, my Lord; for as if one unhappineſs wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon another, the ſtorm had no ſooner ceaſed, but we ſaw our
ſelves ſet upon by two Pirates Ships. The valour of <hi>Lucius</hi> did, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
appear prodigious in this occaſion, although it would at length
have failed, if three <hi>Ligurian</hi> Ships, that ſuddenly came in ſight, had
not ſided with us and given us ſuccour. But, my Lord (continued <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larcon</hi>)
that I may ſhorten my ſtory as much as I can, I ſhall content
my ſelfe with telling you, that after we had given chaſe ſome while to
the Pirates, <hi>Lucius</hi> with much civility returned thanks to him that
commanded the <hi>Ligurians,</hi> who was a man of a ſeemly aſpect, named
<hi>Ducarion;</hi> and that this generous aſſiſtant having admired the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Port and valour of <hi>Lucius,</hi> treated him ſo obligingly, that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
us near as much with his civility, as he had pleaſed us with the
ſuccous he brought. <hi>Ducarion</hi> was in a little time after preſented to the
Princeſs of <hi>Thomira,</hi> to whom he ſpake in a very gallant ſtrain, and
made all the offers that might be in the like occaſions; It is moſt fit,
Madam (ſaid he) that you take a little repoſe, after your having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
much; and being all <hi>Italy</hi> is in Arms, I humbly conceive you
cannot be any where ſo agreeably as at <hi>Capua;</hi> for beſides that that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is a yet exempt from troubles, it is accounted the moſt lovely habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the world. <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Thomira</hi> conſented to the following
of this advice; upon which the generous <hi>Ducarion</hi> having conducted
us to the delicous <hi>Capua,</hi> bad us adieu, and betook himſelfe to ſerve
your intereſts, my Lord, which he told us he had imbraced againſt
thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not neceſſary to particularize the manner of our
living in the fair <hi>Capua,</hi> but onely to tell you, that we could not leave
it when we had made our reſolution to that purpoſe; for the War of
<hi>Scicily</hi> was on a ſudden enkindled at that time, by reaſon whereof the
continual ſcouring about of warlike Ships, made all free paſſage im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
<hi>Lucius</hi> therefore was conſtrained to abide in <hi>Campania,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

avoid expoſing the fair Princeſs of <hi>Castulon</hi> to new dangers. But, my
Lord, this Illuſtrious <hi>Celtiberian</hi> found himſelfe ſo perplexed when he
underſtood preparations were made to bid you a deciſive battel, that
<hi>Aemilius, Vano, Servilius</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> were united together to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you, and that all the world ſiding with your Army or the <hi>Romane,</hi>
the greateſt battel was expected to be given that had ever been yet ſeen
in <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that <hi>Lucius</hi> not being able to hold himſelfe in a delicious Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
while all the world was in Arms, he requeſted the Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi>
to permit his abſence from her for a few dayes, and not to retain him
ſhut up in <hi>Capua</hi> on ſuch a brave occaſion. For ſincerely, Madam (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he) I cannot continue with you, without diſhonour, at a time when
I am ſo little neceſſary to you; and perhaps, I may otherwiſe be not
unſerviceable; beſides, that to ſpeak all out, if you oblige me to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in <hi>Capua,</hi> I ſhall dye with ſorrow, vvhen I ſhall hear the fame of
thoſe that ſignalize themſelves in a memorable battel, vvhile <hi>Lucius</hi> is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60667:59"/>
making converſation with the Ladies in ſome Garden, or upon the
<hi>Vulturnus.</hi> I knovv vvell, Madam, that its poſſible I may periſh in the
occaſion I ſpeak of: but although that ſhould happen, you have about
you perſons faithful to you, and who will render you the ſame ſervice
which you can expect from me. Ah, <hi>Lucius</hi> (interrupted the Princeſs)
why have you the cruelty to ſpeak to me in this ſort? is it not enough
that you make a propoſition to me, which I hear with grief, without
proceeding to a thing that affrights me? and do you account it meet
ſuch a Prince as you ſhould fall in a croud of perſons, who are wont
to periſh in the groſs, without being known who they are? No, no, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
this muſt not be approved, with your favour; you ought to
have a more glorious deſtiny, and inſtead of receiving orders from
a <hi>Roman</hi> or a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> the command of ſeveral Nations await
you. That I may be worthy to command them (replyed <hi>Lucius</hi>) it is
requiſite that <hi>I</hi> do all that you forbid me, and go and ſerve in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> In the Army of the <hi>Carthaginians?</hi> (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>Thomira</hi>) Ah, <hi>Lucius!</hi> conſider <hi>I</hi> beſeech you what you ſay, That
of the <hi>Romanes</hi> (replyed he) is ſo ſtrong, that my heart would perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
reproach me with the choiſe I ſhould make of it; beſides, that
<hi>Ducarion</hi> being in the other, it is fit that <hi>I</hi> go and diſcharge a part of my
obligation to him. But, Madam (purſued he, perceiving <hi>Thomira</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to interrupt him) you need not fear my being known there, for
I ſhall be in the auxiliary forces commanded by <hi>Ducarion;</hi> I will not
appear but at the battel, and will return the ſooneſt I can with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and in ſhort, I ſhall for that end ſerve my ſelfe of all imaginable

                  <p>At length, my Lord (continued <hi>Malarcon</hi>) the enforcement of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>'s
reaſons and intreaties overcame the generous <hi>Thomira;</hi> ſo that the
<hi>Celtiberian</hi> Prince leaving me with his illuſtrious Couſin, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me this fair ſword, which, by reaſon it was once yours, was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

done for my ſelfe, I abandoned thenceforth all my pretenſions, and
bethought my ſelfe onely of making ſome ſmall eſtabliſhment to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a quiet retreat. Wherefore ſoon caſting my eyes upon the rich
ſword which was left in my hands, and conſidering there was on it the
value of more then thirty Talents in Jewels, and that I thought I had
ſome kind of right to wear it; I carried it away indeed, and departed
from <hi>Capua,</hi> vvithout advertiſing the Princeſs of my going. But as <hi>I</hi>
judged I might not find a better Sanctuary againſt you, my Lord, and
againſt the Prince <hi>Lucius,</hi> then an enemies Army very numerous, I put
my ſelfe into that of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> vvhere I thought I could ſell the
fair Sword I had vvith better advantage and ſecurity then in any other
place of the vvorld.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs I ſucceeded not in my deſigns, and being I arrived not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60667:60"/>
at the Camp of <hi>Aemilius,</hi> but when they were in readineſs to iſſue forth
of it to give you battel, I was obliged to bethink my ſelf of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
my prize, inſtead of ſelling it: Wherefore I repaired yeſterday
to a little field, about five or ſix furlongs from <hi>Cannae;</hi> where making
a ſmall hole under a great tree, which I eſpecially obſerved, I put my
rich Sword into it, apprehending it might occaſion my ſlaughter in the
rout, even by the Souldiers of our own party.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, I was conſtrained for my cure, and for my ranſome,
to ſend to ſeek this Sword, which I intended to have fetched my ſelf
after the battel: I am notwithſtanding, rather glad then troubled it fell
out ſo; for he that brought it by order of the <hi>Gaul</hi> Captain, here in
preſence, ſhewed it to <hi>Magar,</hi> whoſe ſervant he ſometimes was, either to
invite him to buy it, or to be informed by him of its true value. Upon
which, this <hi>Carthaginian</hi> knowing it, came immediately to ſee me, and
he was ſince the cauſe of your coming, my Lord, and that I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to diſcharge my breaſt of a thing which began ſtrangely to moleſt
me: For although I have cleanſed my ſoul as much as poſſibly hitherto
from all ſcrupuloſity, yet am I at preſent of another temper, and frame
to my ſelf a thouſand fears, when I begin to think of death, and to
think of it, as the thing of all the world the moſt terrible: And this hath
affrighted me ſo, as to be capable of giving you nothing but a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all I have done and ſeen; and if my ſincerity deſerves not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of my crimes, be pleaſed to remember, my Lord, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive
to it, that it is from me you are informed, that the Princeſs of
<hi>Caſtulon</hi> is at <hi>Capua,</hi> and that the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> is in your
Army.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Malarcon</hi> had done ſpeaking (purſued <hi>Aſpar</hi>) my Maſter look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him a while, unreſolved whether he ſhould return him thanks
or reproaches; but as this Prince conſidered that <hi>Malarcon</hi> was in bed
dangerouſly wounded, and moreover, that he had told him of <hi>Thomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
being at <hi>Capua:</hi> Live (ſaid he to him) but live to do actions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to thoſe of your former life. Upon which, the Prince being carried
by his impetuous humour, went forth without ſpeaking more; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of going to his own Tent, went directly to that of <hi>Ducarion;</hi>
whereto he no ſooner came, but he betook himſelf to embrace <hi>Lucius,</hi>
and did it with ſo much tenderneſs, that the Prince was amazed at the
change.</p>
                  <p>Be not ſurprized, <hi>Lucius</hi> (ſaid he to him) at the alteration you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in me; it is <hi>Hannibal</hi> whom you ſee, and not that Monſter who
would deſtroy the adorable <hi>Thomira;</hi> it is the true <hi>Hannibal</hi> whom you
behold, and the <hi>Hannibal</hi> that loves you, and eſteems you injuſt that
you have been able to believe him capable of the moſt abominable crime
that ever was committed: Yes, <hi>Lucius,</hi> I love and eſteem you, becauſe
you are generous, as you are allied to <hi>Thomira,</hi> and have always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſerved that Divine Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words of my Maſter augmented the aſtoniſhment of <hi>Lucius</hi> in
ſuch ſort, that this Prince was amuſed what to anſwer; ſo that <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
embracing him again, without heeding that they were either of them
wounded, told him, That he came from ſeeing <hi>Malarcon,</hi> and then re-Peated
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60667:60"/>
to him in few words, all that he had been informed: To which
<hi>Lucius,</hi> having always had eſteem and admiration for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave credit, and returned all his tenderneſſes and civilities; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
himſelf blameable, that he could believe <hi>Hannibal</hi> guilty, and
then declared many circumſtances which might induce that belief, and
excuſe it. But when he came to conſider in his minde the treacheries
and death of <hi>Alorca,</hi> and by what contingencies <hi>Hannibal</hi> had been
cleared, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e could not contain from lifting his eyes up to Heaven, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the providence and juſtice of the Gods, who had cauſed the ruine
of a Traytor, and afterwards made the innocence of an illuſtrious
Prince bright and reſplendent.</p>
                  <p>You may pleaſe to know, that after this, my Maſter having known
by the Phyſicians that it might be done without danger, cauſed <hi>Lucius</hi>
to be carried to his own Tent; where uſing all poſſible care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
over him, he propoſed to him to have <hi>Malarcon</hi> brought to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
to which <hi>Lucius</hi> would not conſent; either out of averſion to
ſee a man that had forſaken <hi>Thomira,</hi> or to ſignifie to my Maſter, that he
would not hear that confirmed from <hi>Malarcon,</hi> which he had learnt from
the mouth of the illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since therefore, <hi>Lucius</hi> (ſaid my Maſter to him) it is moſt certain that
<hi>Thomira</hi> is at <hi>Capua,</hi> as it alſo is moſt ſure that I adore that fair Princeſs,
I will defer the ſiege of <hi>Rome,</hi> and go ſtrait to <hi>Capua,</hi> and caſt my ſelf
at the feet of my Princeſs, and let her know the difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the true <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the perfidious <hi>Alorca.</hi> But
I am ignorant, continued he, in what manner to go, being I muſt not
go thither as an Enemy, and 'tis poſſible they will not admit me as a
Friend.</p>
                  <p>But I hope (anſwered <hi>Lucius</hi>) to effect that you be received as ſuch;
for, beſides that your victories put you in an eſtate of finding all things
eaſie, I have friends in <hi>Capua,</hi> who will without doubt act for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
Ah, <hi>Lucius,</hi> repli'd my Maſter, how ſhould I be obliged to
you? and what is it I can do to recompence ſo great a favour? But, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
continued he) I do injury to your generoſity, I know you will
act for me, although I am not in a condition to return you the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and that you will imploy your friends for my intereſts; in the mean
time, I am contriving to moderate the ardour of my Troops to go and
beſiege <hi>Rome,</hi> and to perſwade them, that the alliance of the <hi>Capuans</hi>
is of abſolute neceſſity to our ſucceſs in that ſiege.</p>
                  <p>My Maſter immediately fell to execution of all he had projected, and
prepared himſelf to go to <hi>Capua;</hi> and although he foreſaw all the world
would be aſtoniſhed at his ſo doing, and that he ſhould be charged with
want of skill to uſe his laſt victory; yet he choſe rather to ſatisfie his
love then his ambition; and to go and ſee the fair Princeſs <hi>Thomira,</hi> then
poſſeſs the proudeſt City of the World. But, my Lords, it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
to particularize to you the negotiations and ſucceſſes of <hi>Lucius</hi> in
this affair, being ſufficient to ſhew you in the ſequel of my diſcourſe,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Capua,</hi> and to relate you many other things, which it is moſt
likely you never yet heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſpar</hi> held his peace in this place of his Narration; and being it was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60667:61"/>
already late, the Princes that heard him, did not demand the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: Upon which he making a profound reverence, withdrew to
an aportment of the Tent, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t his illuſtrious Auditors in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the wonders he had recounted them: <hi>Antiochus</hi> admired the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Prince of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the ſick King was very much affected
with the greatneſs of his Love, <hi>Perſeus</hi> preferred his conduct above all
his other qualities, and the young <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> not being able ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eſteem the fierceneſs and noble haughtineſs of this Prince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that it ought to be granted, That Great men were, as it were,
Maſterpieces of Nature, made by her at ſeveral times; and that after
the ſame manner that ſhe produces Lyons amongſt Animals, ſhe brings
into the World amongſt Men, <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Hannibals,</hi> who ſhew
themſelves even in their infancy naturally Grand perſons. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
anſwered <hi>Perſeus,</hi> that the Valour which gives the title of Great,
cannot be natural; for ſeeing it is a vertue, is it not requiſite we be taught
wherein it conſiſts, leſt we continue in puſillanimity, or fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vice? I incline to the opinion of the Prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> ſaid the
wounded King, and I believe it is impoſſible we ſhould be naturally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant;
for Nature gives us knowledge of the danger, to the end we
might avoid it, and valour makes us know and contemn it. The Prince
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> replied the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> could have brought ſo concluſive
reaſons, that I ſhould willing ſide with him; but ſeeing the prince <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
is entring, added he, perceiving him at the portal, we have nothing
to do but to beſeech him to determine the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>I beg your pardon, anſwered <hi>Hannibal,</hi> with a very ſad air, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
not to decide the controverſie by my ſentence. But you muſt paſs
your judgement in the caſe, replied <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and let us know whether
we be valiant by Nature, or by Education. I conceive then, ſaid <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
that both the one and the other contributes thereunto, that Nature
gives us diſpoſitions, and thoſe are perfected by Education; for if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alone made us valiant, then puſillanimity would be a natural defect,
and conſequently unblameable; and if on the other ſide, inſtitution one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made us ſo, all ſuch as were brought up in the ſame manner, would
be equally valiant: So that I may ſay the ſame of Valour, which is ſaid
of almoſt all things in the world, in which it is requiſite that both Art
and Nature conjoyn, to exhibite an excellent piece.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, the converſation was broke off; and it being very
late by this time, <hi>Hannibal, Antiochus, Perſeus,</hi> and <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> ſaluting
the wounded King very civilly, paſſed to a Tent, where there was a
very magnificent repaſt provided for them; but as <hi>Hannibal</hi> appeared
very melancholy during ſupper, he was obliged by the requeſts of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>
to diſcover the cauſe of his ſadneſs: Upon which he recounted
to them in few words all that he had learnt from the Meſſenger of the
Prince of <hi>Vermina.</hi> He told them, That <hi>Maſoniſſa</hi> had at length mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Sophonisba,</hi> of whom he was deſperately amorous, and that that
ſaithleſs man, unworthy to bear the title of <hi>King,</hi> had afterwards poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
his fair Queen, to pleaſe <hi>Scipio</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> who did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this alliance.</p>
                  <p>This fatal news moved pity in the three Princes, for the Deſtiny of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60667:61"/>
the Queen of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and abhorrence of the King of the <hi>Maſſeſsitians:</hi>
But that which was moſt ſurprizing, was, that <hi>Antiochus, Nicomedes,</hi>
and <hi>Perſeus,</hi> being retired into their Tent, after a converſation very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,
news was brought to the <hi>Cathaginian</hi> Prince, that the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King was at the point of death, and that he was in the laſt deſpair,
which would undoubtedly conclude him, if he were not timely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Hannibal</hi> haſtned to the Tent of this deſolate Prince, and
was ſtrangely ſurprized, when he heard all his exclamations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
How! is <hi>Sophonisba</hi> dead! (cryed he) why have you ſuffered
this, O ye great Gods! Yes, as great as you are, you have been envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of the happineſs of the Earth, you have taken thence a Queen, which
merited our adorations, and who might have bleſt us in this world with
a felicity equal to yours.</p>
                  <p>Ah, my Lord, continued he, addreſſing to the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> as ſoon
as he was entered, I will live no longer, ſince the adorable <hi>Saphonisba</hi>
doth not: I am ſtill devoted to that fair Queen, I will dye to follow her,
I will no longer continue in the world, being I ſhall never more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that Divine perſon in it. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was extremely ſurprized with
the ſtrangers words, and the deep intereſt he took in the death of the
Queen of <hi>Numidia:</hi> but he was much more aſtoniſhed, when he beheld the
afflicted King reaching his hand to his wound, and that there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appearances but of an urter deſpair, and ſuch as would ſoon ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in death. <hi>Hannabal</hi> ſeiſed upon his arm, and endeavouring to
encourage him, uſed ſuch language to him, as he conceived ſerviceable
to his conſolation.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſaid he to him, attend a while the ſequel of my diſcourſe,
and you will underſtand what you have to do: The loſs of <hi>Sophonisba</hi>
determines me ſufficiently in that particular, interrupted the King ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
haſtily, and her death hath too aſſuredly concluded mine, to leave
you any place to oblige me to live. But when you ſhall know that the
King <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> hath cauſed her to be poiſoned, within a few days after
he had eſpouſed her, anſwered <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and that to pleaſe the <hi>Romans,</hi>
he deprived himſelf of that incomparable treaſure, of which he ought
to have known the value by the poſſeſſion of it, I believe you will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to revenge the fair <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> and not reſolve to dye till you have
taken away the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, added he, that I would incenſe you againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> and their
allies, I do not fear them, ſo much as to practice the withdrawing
of their generous Friends, by an Artifice mean and low, and I eſteem
you too much, to gain you that way. This fallacy, continued he, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the King anſwered nothing, would be a means more proper to
invite your ſcorn, then win your eſteem: I do not therefore ſpeak for
my own intereſt, when I ſpeak againſt <hi>Maſaniſsa;</hi> nor do I ſet forth
his crime to you, but as an unheard of cruel circumſtance of that miſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wherein you partake more then both the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi>
otherwiſe you could not be ignorant of the particularities which
are already publiſhed throughout all <hi>Africa,</hi> and you might have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſilent after theſe words, in attendance of the Kings
anſwer, who began to behold him with leſs diſquiet, though not with
leſs ſurprize; and at length anſwered, Ah, my Lord, what is it you
tell me of <hi>Maſaniſsa!</hi> that he hath murdered the adorable <hi>Sophonisba,</hi>
Ah, my Lord, how unhappy is my lot, that that fair Queen ſhould be
deprived of life by the hands of that wretched King? and that among
ſo many illuſtrious qualities, which rendred <hi>Sophonisba</hi> Divine, ſhe
had not alſo that of immortal, which was onely wanting to a perſon ſo
accompliſhed. No, no, my Lord, what you have told mens not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
but without queſtion you have been miſinformed, and the Queen
of <hi>Numidia</hi> is ſtill alive, if ſhe hath not ended her days by ſome other
accident.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, replied <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I have always ſo highly eſteemed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſsa,</hi>
that I have had great repugnance to entertain the belief of his
being capable of ſo black a guilt; and I am glad, continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, to chear
up the wounded King, that I finde my hopes any thing confirmed, that
that news is erroneous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> never merited your eſteem, replied
the King; but at leaſt, he was never capable of an ignoble thought:
For, my Lord, ſeeing it is requiſite you know the King whom you have
treated ſo generouſly, I muſt declare to you, that he is the <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi>
of whom you ſpeak: Yes, my Lord, I am that <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> whoſe life
hath been attended with accidents ſo ſtrange, that they have filled the
world with wonder: I am that Prince who hath loſt and recovered King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
who have confederated both with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and who have adored <hi>Sophonisba</hi> from the time I firſt had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to know her; and at laſt that <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> who hath been overcome
by the great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who hath been treated by him with civility al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
extraordinary; and that <hi>Maſaniſsa,</hi> who regulating his life
onely by that of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> expects with extreme impatience to know
the condition in which that adorable Queen is.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Prince was infinitely amazed to behold <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi>
in his Tent, and that <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> who was fallen off from the <hi>Cathagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
but preſently reflecting upon the great adventures which Love and
Honour had drawn that King into to break with <hi>Carthage;</hi> and alſo
conſidering him in a ſtate of pity, he encreaſed his civilities, inſtead of
diminiſhing them. <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> conſtrained himſelf to anſwer the careſſes
of the Prince of <hi>Carthage;</hi> but he acquitted himſelf in ſo forced a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> eaſily knew that he was ſtill ſtrangely diſquieted:
Ah, my Lord, anſwered <hi>Maſaniſsa,</hi> it is hard to be compoſed of ſpirit,
when there is hourly apprehenſion of hearing the moſt cruel and fatal
news confirmed, that I am capable of receiving: For what can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
more cruel then this accident? I have been afflicted for the loſs
of a Kingdom, but I have been alſo comforted with a belief, as it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively
hapned, that the <hi>Romans</hi> could re-inſtate me in that which the
<hi>Caathaginians</hi> had aſſiſted King <hi>Syphax</hi> my Enemy and my Rival to gain
from me. I have loſt all my relations, yet conceived nothing of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
or extraordinary in theſe misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord, I finde my condition far more unhappy, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
my ſelf bereaved of the fair Princeſs <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> to put her into
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60667:62"/>
the arms of my enemy, at the ſame time that the Prince <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had promiſed her to me, and that adorable perſon had given me
many teſtimonies of her eſteem and good inclination. Nevertheleſſe,
being I loved <hi>Sophoniſba</hi> more for her ſelfe then for my own ſake, I
found ſome contentment when I conſidered that I alone was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabe,
and <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> Queen of two Realms. Then indeed I did not
reſolve to dye, becauſe I lived more in the great Queen of <hi>Numidia,</hi>
then in the unfortunate King of the <hi>Maſſeſsilians.</hi> But the thought
of that illuſtrious Queens death, of this cruel ſeparation. Ah! this is
it, my Lord, that breaks the greateſt conſtancy, and ſubdues it to the
violence of the calamity; here the ſtrongeſt ſoul finds it ſelfe too
weak to reſiſt the ſtroke of fate. Yet there may be unfortunate perſons
of this kind, but none comparable to me, if theſe tidings be true;
and the Gods, yea, the Gods themſelves can add nothing to my pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</p>
                  <p>For, my Lord, as if it were not enough to loſe all that I love, I
am like to paſs for a wretched priſoner, and that of the moſt fair and
ſweet perſon that ever eye beheld; and my innocence will onely ſerve
to redouble my torment, when I ſhall conſider it buried in the ſame
Tombe with me, and ſo never being publiſhed, my memory become
odious to all Poſterity. Can you therefore imagine a misfortune
more great and ſtrange? Bethink your ſelves of circumſtances that
may augment it, if there be any ſuch; or confeſs that I am upon the
point of being the moſt unhappy of men. I confeſs (anſwered <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>)
that your caſe would be ſuch in the extremity, although you
would at leaſt dye with the ſatisfaction of being innocent; and I
judge that the true Author of this impiety would be farre more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>How ſay you? (interrupted <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi>) Can you believe that a
man who ſhould be ſo wretched as to commit this crime, would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to reſent the loſs of his reputation to the quick? Can you beleeve
he would be ſenſibly afflicted for the death of a perſon whom himſelf
had murdered? And do you not conſider that he would have even
ſome contentment, although unworthy and malicious, to have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that which he judged he ought to do, or which he had deſigned?
The Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> was willing to put off this converſation, which
ſerved onely to redouble the grief of <hi>Maſaniſſa;</hi> and not being able to
give him any hope after the intelligence he had received, he would
not be an occaſion to continue his diſpair. But <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> prevented him,
and beholding him a few moments with an aire wholly ſubmiſſive;
My Lord (ſaid he to him) I hope the illuſtrious <hi>Hannibal</hi> will grant

is impoſſible for me to live in the condition I am in, and permit me to

principal condition of it, which was the unknown Cavalier might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

you are perfectly cured, and not ſuffer you to undertake a journey in the

braveſt courages in the world, yet I had more regard to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a formidable enemy, then to hazard the life of a generous
Prince, by a conſent which I cannot give but to his prejudice. If you
expoſe my life to danger (replyed <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi>) by permitting me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
a journey in the condition wherein I am, you will infallibly
cauſe the loſs of it by detaining me longer in your Army. I ſhall then
do all that your pleaſure requires (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) but it ſhall be
with condition that you ſuffer me to conduct you, without parting from
you till you be in a place where your cure may be perfected. Ah, too
generous Prince! (<hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> anſwered) what thanks can I render you
that may be proportional to the obligations which I have to you: you
uſe too great ſolicitouſneſs towards a miſerable perſon, whom I ſhall

me through all places poſſeſſed by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> without giving
that illuſtrious Prince the diſturbance of leaving his Army for my

no more followers with me then will be neceſſary to ſerve you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
drawing ſo many Troops after me, as vvould onely ſerve to blaze

I am not ignorant of the power you have with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and I
know what generoſity you vvould have for <hi>Hannibal.</hi> But I confeſs
I would not be in a condition to imploy it, or to exact favours of this
nature from your goodneſs. Not that my humour vvhich cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Hannibal</hi> to be obliged, would give me repugnance to be ſo to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſsa;</hi>
but I have too much eſteem for the King of the <hi>Maſſeſsilians,</hi>
to ſuffer vvithout extream regreat, that he ſhould demand the liberty
of <hi>Hannibal</hi> from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and be pat to requeſt a thing from his
Allies vvhich vvould be greatly to their prejudice. Theſe are the
inducements (ſaid the <hi>Cathaginian</hi> Prince) which oblige me to go
vvithout noiſe. But in the mean time it is requiſit for me to leave you,
being 'tis very late, &amp; to conjure you vvith all my ſoul to moderate the
inquietudes of your mind, and conſider, that <hi>Maſaniſsa,</hi> vvhoſe great
ſpirit hath reſiſted the rudeſt aſſaults of fortune, ought not to be ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
vvith ſo violent a ſorrovv upon the naked relation of bad

                  <p>After theſe vvords, <hi>Hannibal</hi> vvould not permit <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> time to
make him his remerciments; but ſaluting him vvith very much civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
vvent forth of his Tent to return to his ovvn, vvhere before his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

vvounded King. If this generous Prince vvas ſenſible of the paſſion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60667:63"/>
of <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> for the fair <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> he vvas not ignorant of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had diſpoſed of this Princeſs in favour
of King <hi>Syphax,</hi> vvhilſt <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> vvas fighting for their intereſts in <hi>Spain</hi>
under the Prince <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> in vvhich regard he vvas forvvard in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for the conſolation of this unfortunate King; ſo that knowing the
relation he had received vvas in part but too true (although never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> vvas really culpable) he vvould not that any
perſon ſhould ſpeak to this afflicted Prince for fear of diſturbing the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
calm he had procured him by qualifying the relation of the buſineſs
tovvards the end of it. He had deſigned to accompany him for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end but to ſecure him from being aſcertain'd of the Tragedy; not
daring therefore to ſend any conſiderable company to attend him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he foreſavv that either that multitude would be too talkative, or
engage him to ſpeak too much, by laying ſome propoſition upon them,
which might give ground, to ſuſpect the importance of the priſoner
whom he remitted, and cauſe ſome diſſatisfaction in the minds of the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> He determined therefore to depart the next morning,
and not to forſake <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> till he were in the hands of perſons
to whom he might diſcover in what manner it was fit for them
to comport themſelves for the preſervation of his life. After which he
conſidered the death of the fair Queen of <hi>Numidia</hi> vvith tender reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and this ſad thought would have long time afflicted him, had it
not at length given place to thoſe which may be called ruling and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
in <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prince was too amorous of the fair Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon,</hi> and of
glory, to have any long meditations of other things, but of the means
to overcome the inſenſibility of <hi>Thomira,</hi> and the Army of <hi>Scipio.</hi> For
he ruminated in his mind of all poſſibilities to accompliſh theſe two
great deſigns; in which thoughts he was inſenſibly ſeiſed on by ſleep,
and paſſed the night with ſufficient quiet. The next morning he was no
ſooner accoutred, but he was ſurpriſed at the ſight of the King <hi>Maſaniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>
entering into his Tent, who was ſupported by <hi>Aſpar,</hi> and vvould
at firſt expreſs ſome kind of gaiety, and lay aſide his regret to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
in ſome meaſure vvith the generous Prince vvho had taken
care of his repoſe. <hi>Hannibal</hi> went tovvards him very civilly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſeating him, endeavoured yet further to repreſent to him the
danger to which he vvas going to expoſe himſelfe in the journey he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook;
he moreover added his entreaties to his reaſons; but could
not vvin any thing upon the mind of <hi>Maſaniſsa,</hi> vvho vvas reſolute for
departing to go to <hi>Zama,</hi> and to underſtand the nevvs of <hi>Cyrtha</hi> from

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60667:64"/>
that his return ſhould be within ſeven or eight hours. This done, he
came back again to <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> where notwithſtanding any reſiſtance
the King could make, <hi>Hannibal</hi> would not he diverted from accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
him to a great Town, which was about forty furlongs from his
own Camp: for this obliging Prince intended to inform himſelfe pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
of the names of <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi>'s Confidents, and to ſtay a while at
that place to write to <hi>Zama,</hi> to the friends of the King of the <hi>Maſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
that they might be advertiſed in what manner the news was fit to
be communicated to him, which he was going to learn. Wherefore
theſe two great perſonages went from the Army, ſoon after followed
onely with ten or twelve Cavaliers. Upon the way <hi>Hannibal</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by circumſtances in diſcourſe with <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> what his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were, and endeavoured to employ that knowledge to the benefit
of his quiet: and after that they continued there way, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the converſation which was begun at their firſt coming forth
of the Camp. The King of the <hi>Maſseſsilians</hi> employed his thoughts of
nothing but on the Queen of <hi>Numidia;</hi> in which he had notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome contenting moments, when he conſidered that the report of
fame publiſhing <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> for the poyſoner of <hi>Sophaniſba,</hi> and that
without any likelihood of truth, there might be no more reality in that
of the fair Queens death. But his affliction ſoon chaſed away theſe
thoughts as to beguiling, and becoming ingenious to torment himſelfe
with more violence, he repreſented to his fancy <hi>Sophonisba</hi> in all her
beauties, gallantry, and goodneſs toward <hi>Maſaniſſa;</hi> and then that
ſame <hi>Sophonisba</hi> dead, and that by violence and cruelty. Theſe laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
were ſo importune to this illuſtrious Unfortunate, that his
diſpair was increaſed by them; and if he had ſo much reſtraint as not
to evidence it before <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he may be thought to be ſo much the
more miſerable ſince by including ſo painful a paſſion in his heart, the
anguiſh became more bitter and inſupportable. But if dead <hi>Sophonisba</hi>

at length arived before they were aware at one of thoſe publick houſes,
which are by cuſtome appointed for the reception of ſtrangers, upon the

to write a Letter, which he ſent away immediately to <hi>Zama;</hi> the
Maſter of the Hoſtelrie, who was unfurniſh'd of proviſions in a houſe
too much expoſed to the paſſage of men of Arms, ſent to <hi>Capſa</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
for ſuch as he deemed convenient for the entertainment of his
gueſts, whom he judged to be of great quality; after which he came
to do reverence to the great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and told him that the Princeſſes
were not to paſs by till within two dayes. <hi>Hannibal</hi> did not apprehend
what this man meant; but the name of Princeſs exciting his curioſity,
he demanded what Princeſſes they were which were to paſs by within
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60667:64"/>
two dayes. I know not their names (anſwered the Hoſt) but I have
heard at <hi>Capſa,</hi> that there are two of them the faireſt perſons of the
world; and it may be added, the moſt happy too, notwithſtanding I
am told they ſeemed ſufficiently melancholly. For, my Lord (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he) conſider I beſeech you their good fortune; they are mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
received in all Towns through which they paſs, all Princes,
and the moſt powerful Kings indeavour to gain their favour; and I
believe if they were ſo minded, we ſhould ſoon have a general peace;
for to declare the outſide of the buſineſs. I have been aſſured that our
Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> is amorous of one of theſe Princeſſes, and the other is
the Miſtreſs of <hi>Soipio.</hi> If ſo, you may pleaſe to judge whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
not to be honoured univerſall; and that it may not be concluded
with verity, that the end of this War will eſtabliſh one of theſe Ladies
the ſurpreme Princeſs of the World.</p>
                  <p>But I demand your pardon, my Lord, if I have told you things
which in likelihood you know better then I have recounted them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
probable that, ſuch perſons as you are not ignorant of newes of this
Nature. It is true, (added he) you were pleaſed to command me to
relate them unto you; and that injunction ha's drawn me into the
ſame fault I was guilty of yeſterday before a young ſtranger, who
cauſed me to tell him the ſame matters, which notwithſtanding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
knew better then I, as farre a I conjecture. <hi>Hannibal</hi> anſwered,
that he knew nothing of this news, and that he was glad to learn it;
upon which, to get a further account, he inquired concerning this
young ſtranger, and demanded of Hoſt, if he knew who he was. I
know him not (anſwered he) but this I can affirm, that a man of more
comely aſpect was never ſeen; and that it was the late ſight of his
gallant perſon, that hinders me from being abſolutely ſurpriſed with
yours. Notwithſtanding I am much aſtoniſhed at the unuſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of two perſons at the ſame time to my houſe, whoſe goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences
ſufficiently ſpeak them to be very conſiderable. At the ſame
time (interrupted the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi>) is that ſtranger here at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
then? He is not here at this inſtant (replyed the hoſte) but he is
not farre diſtant, and I believe he is gone to repoſe himſelfe under the
Trees, which are about two hundred paces from the high-way, and
that he will continue there all the day, to avoid being known by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the houſe which is open to all the world; at leaſt this is my
conjecture, being he hath alſo cauſed his Horſes to be led thither. <hi>I</hi>
ſhall not moleſt him then (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>) and if his goodly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
gave me deſires to know him, the deſign he hath not to be ſeen,
hath deſtroyed them; and <hi>I</hi> will not retain a curioſity which might
diſpleaſe a man whom you have deſcribed ſo advantageouſly to me.
Scarce had <hi>Hannibal</hi> ended theſe words, when <hi>Aſpar</hi> entered his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
with a haſtineſs more then ordinarily; and told him that he had
ſeen five and twenty or thirty Cavaliers appear whom he judged to
be either <hi>Romanes,</hi> or of thoſe ſort of roving Souldiers, who in times
of War, without being friends to either party, are alwaies enemies to
ſuch as are not in a capacity to reſiſt them. For riding about all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
to diſcover if any party paſſed that way towards the War, he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60667:65"/>
perceived this Troop, which according to all appearances were no
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> It will be no bad counſell then (anſwered <hi>Hannibal</hi>)
to put our ſelves in a poſture not to be ſurpriſed. Go therefore, <hi>Aſpar</hi>
(added the Prince) and give order for all to be in a readineſs, and tell
them that <hi>I</hi> am going to Horſe. This order was as ſoon executed as
given; and the Prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiving that <hi>Aſpar</hi> had reaſon to
give him this intelligence, and that theſe Cavaliers were coming direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
towards him, having learnt by him whom the hoſte had ſent to <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
that there were people of quality at his Maſters houſe; he went forth
to them vvith nine others, caſting from his countenance a kind of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fierceneſs, which never abandoned this great man in contingencies
of this nature. Let us on, my friends, ſaid this illuſtrious <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
to the Cavaliers which followed him, and let us ſhew that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is
neither to be kill'd nor taken with eaſe. The wife of the hoſte, who
ran in a fright to the Gate of her Houſe to get into it, hearing theſe
vvords, and not finding the paſſage free at firſt, fled towards a ſhade of
Trees which was not farre diſtant from thence, where the handſome
ſtranger was ſeated upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

he inſtantly) there are about thirty Cavaliers come to aſſail and kill the
great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who hath not above ſeven or eight perſons with him.
The young ſtranger had no ſooner heard theſe words, but a noble ardor
animating his countenance, he leapt upon his, Horſe, and commanded his
Armour-bearer to do the ſame, and to ſpeed with him to the defence of
<hi>Hannibal.</hi> To defend <hi>Hannibal?</hi> (cryed the Squire) Alas, my Lord, I
beſeech you pardon me if I tell you, you are in a miſtake, and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
mean ſome other perſon then him you named. It is enough that
I have told you what I intend to do (anſwered the generous Stranger)
Ah, my Lord (ſaid the Squire again) will you fight for your Enemy?
No, no, you muſt not do it, notwithſtanding your magnanimity; but
be pleaſed to remember that the <hi>Hannibal</hi> you are going to defend, is
he who hath ruin'd your Country, who hath cauſed all the loſſes of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in a word, whom you ought to fight againſt as the moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable
of your enemies. I have conſidered all, that you tell
me (replyed the magnanimous Stranger, marching towards the place
where he was to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi>) but beſides I have
conſider'd, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is over powred by great inequality. The
Stranger ſo haſted in ſpeaking theſe words, that he ſoon reach'd the
place vvhere the fight vvas beginning, when the Squire endeavouring
again to divert his Maſter from his deſign; My Lord (ſaid he to him)
behold your enemy! vvhat courſe will you take? Dye, or ſave <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
(anſvvered the Stranger) Great Gods! (cryed the Squire, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his being accuſtomed to the Heroick actions of his illuſtrious
Maſter) is it poſsible that—He could not continue out his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for beholding his Maſter ruſh with an extraordinry impetuoſity
upon the enemies of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he ſeconded him to fight near his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
The valiant Stranger began to diſtribute death as ſoon as he began
to ſtrike; and the firſt (whoſe unhappy fall guided him to utter a blow
at him) loſt his life at the very inſtant that he attaqued that of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Stranger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> for his part fought like himſelf: but how great ſoever the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60667:65"/>
valour of this Illuſtrious <hi>Carthaginian</hi> was, yet it cannot be denied
but that of the unknown aſſiſtant cauſed admiration in this Prince by
actions wholly miraculous. Theſe two brave perſons redoubled their
efforts, and either of them ſtrived to call up all their ſtrength and
proweſs to the view of an emulous valour; and theſe two Heroes being
infinitely ardent of glory by the bent of their minds, they beheld one
another as rivals, and performed things ſo prodigious as do almoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
belief. That which was yet more rare in this conjuncture, was, that
they highly valued each the other without any diſpoſition to love mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
and fought with an intention ſo ſtrange, and yet ſo generous,
that the ſtranger expoſed his life onely to preſerve that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and this Prince alſo fought not but for the ſafety of the ſtranger; ſo
that being thus accorded, they beat down as many enemies, as they
dealt blowes, and within few moments of the thirty Cavaliers at the
beginning of the combate, they overthrew four and twenty, and put
the reſt to flight. But if theſe two Warriours appeared extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable,
yet they accuſed themſelvs in their own breaſts that they had
not done enough, and in the noble ardor which quickned them, they
believed, they had too few enemies to encounter, and oftentimes wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
there had been a greater number, as a more ample ſubject of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting
their proweſs in all its extent. Nevertheleſs there was ſome
difference remarkable in the manner of fighting between theſe two great
men, for choler animated the courage of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> but that of the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was a valour purely generous: and if the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> ſeemed
furious and terrible, the magnanimous unknown by a deportment much
heroical did not overcome more then was neceſſary to do, to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the Prince of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Wherefore he reſtrained himſelf from
purſuing the ſix Cavaliers which fled; and perceiving <hi>Hannibal</hi> making
after them; Stay <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſtay (cryed he) after which turning towards
his Squire, Let us on then (ſaid the generous Unknown) and either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
or diſpatch <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſince we may now do it without ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>This deſign is worthy of your ſelfe (anſwered the Squire) but my
Lord, although you are the moſt valiant man in the vvorld, yet you
ought to take notice that the match is not equal; for <hi>Hannibal</hi> hath five
Cavaliers with him ſtill. Thoſe five Cavaliers (interrupted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvn)
do not hinder <hi>Hannibal</hi> from being my enemy. They do not
without queſtion (replyed the Squire) but they make your enemy a
little too powerful; And 'tis becauſe he is ſo (ſaid the ſtranger) that I
intend to fight him, and that my heart prompts me to attaque him. He
ſaid no more, being he ſavv <hi>Hannibal</hi> at a little diſtance off him;
<hi>Hannibal</hi> (cryed he to him preſently) you muſt now turn your ſvvord

theſe words turned tovvards thoſe that were vvith him, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them not to ſtir, what ſucceſs ſoever he had in the combate he vvas

King made ſome impreſſion in the minds of theſe two Warriers; but

muſt trample a King under the feet of your horſes if you reſolve to
fight, and moreover a King indiſpoſed, and a ſuppliant, and one that
intreates you nothing but to preſerve each other. If theſe words were
powerful, the air of <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> was not leſs affecting, ſo that the two
Warriers were perſwaded, and beheld one another with leſſe animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
after which caſting their eyes upon <hi>Maſaniſsa,</hi> they ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
by their ſilence, that the King of the <hi>Maſſeſsilians</hi> was an obſtacle
whom they would not violate. At length the Prince of <hi>Carthage</hi> broke

that he had great vexation for the conſtraint which hindred him
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60667:66"/>
from fighting in the re-encounter, and he would without doubt have
paſſed over all conſiderations whatever to go after this valiant Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

himſelf with the hopes that this generous perſon would really acquit
his promiſe to make himſelfe known. Not that the haughty humour
of <hi>Hannibal</hi> was very capable to afford him ſatisfaction out of a naked
hope, but for that the Prince perceived he could not otherwiſe be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
becauſe <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> oppoſed his purpoſe more peremptor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

having known the ſtranger by the tone of his voice, and more
by reflecting upon his heroical proceeding. By which this King no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

<hi>Scipio.</hi> For it is the action of an Illuſtrious perſon to expoſe his own
life for the preſervation of that of a brave enemy; but 'tis the action of
<hi>Scipio</hi> alone to attaque the famous <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the manner vvhich he
did. So that I may ſay, <hi>Scipio</hi> comported himſelf like <hi>Scipio;</hi> and that

               <p>THe Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> (whom we muſt no longer term by
the name of Stranger, after his lately atchiev'd heroick
actions) continued his way towards <hi>Capſa,</hi> though with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
not to enter into that City, notwithſtanding it
had declared it ſelf neuter a little while before, and alſo
contributed towards the ſupport of the Roman Army. For being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
not to be known, he would not put himſelf into a City where ſuch
a world of eyes would have been upon him, judging it impoſſible to
eſcape meeting with ſome there that had ſeen him before, or heard of
him enough by fame to know him. Wherefore he determin'd to go
and ſpend the night in a houſe not far from <hi>Capſa;</hi> and as he was yet
in the grand Road, before he came to turn off into a leſs, which led to
that Houſe, he began to reflect upon the late adventure, which ſeem'd
ſo ſurpriſing to him, that he could not but teſtifie as much to his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant.
Ah! <hi>Flavius</hi> (ſaid he to him) is it poſſible that my eyes
have not deluded me, but really ſeen <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> with the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
of my enemies? that <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> whom I have loved with ſo great
ardor, and given a place to in my friendſhip, little different from that
which <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lius</hi> poſſeſſes. But 'tis undoubtedly true, I have ſeen &amp; heard
him ſpeak; and if I have not ſeen that <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> whoſe ſoul own'd none
but generous ſentiments, I have ſeen that <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> whom men report
to have poyſon'd <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> and who after the commiſsion of a crime
of that nature, may make no ſcruple of abandoning his beſt friends.
'Tis true, <hi>Flavius,</hi> I feel ſome kind of reluctant thoughts in my breaſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60667:68"/>
in favour of the King of the <hi>Maſſeſsilians;</hi> and though all the world
publiſhes already that he ſent poyſon to the Queen of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and my
ſelf have ſeen him with my enemies; yet there are a kind of contrary
motions in my mind, which check the paſsions the former induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might raiſe in me. Yes, <hi>Flavius,</hi> I feel ſome Favourable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
which will not permit me to condemn <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> without being
better informed, and without unriddling thoſe things, which perhaps
will ſerve to ſatisfie me, that this King is rather unfortunate then crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
For in truth, hitherto I have found no cauſe to repent me of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
plac'd my friendſhip upon any I have given it to; but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I have had the happineſs to ſee the Elections I have made of what
nature ſoever, generally approved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> ſtopt ſuddenly after theſe
words, and changed colour when he conſidered what he had laſt ſaid;
and then ſoon after turning towards <hi>Flavius:</hi> But alas (ſaid he to him)
if I have had this happineſs, I have withall had the happineſs of ſeeing
the election which is moſt glorious unto me, become that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
me the moſt miſerable of men. Yes, <hi>Flavius,</hi> continued he, the
paſsion I have in my ſoul for the adorable <hi>Aemilia,</hi> cauſes me to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that which certainly never any other did: and ſince the obſtacles
which are met with in the courſe of a paſsion like to mine (if yet 'tis
poſsible to finde any like it) ſince, I ſay, theſe obſtacles firſt were
capable to make men unfortunate, they never made any ſo deeply
miſerable as they have me. The amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> proceeded no further,
but beſtowing his ſilence in muſing, found a ſort of great ſatisfaction
in repaſſing over in mind all the ſweetneſſes he had taſted in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of the Illuſtrious <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and afterward in ſurveying all the
invincible obſtacles which had hindered him from being compleatly
happy. But while theſe thoughts poſſeſſed his mind, he beheld a ſlave
coming towards him, whom he preſently knew to belong to <hi>Laelius.
Scipio</hi> did not omit inſtantly to demand news of his friend, nor the ſlave
to ſatisfie him reſpectively in theſe terms: My Lord, My Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unaſſured in what place he might find you, by reaſon he choſe two
or three to change according to occaſion, is gone to a houſe not farre
from <hi>Capſa,</hi> where he thinks to meet you, and ſent me to that which
ſtands upon this way, to deliver you a Letter if I ſhould happen to
find you there. Upon which words the ſlave accordingly preſented a
Letter to <hi>Scipio</hi> from <hi>Laelius,</hi> which containeth as followeth.</p>

                  <p>This Letter, no queſtion, gave <hi>Scipio</hi> much ſatisfaction; and though
this Illuſtrious Lover did not believe the Princeſs of <hi>Hippona</hi> could
effect much in the obliging offer ſhe made, yet he reſented ſome glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from it, and ſpeeded forward more expeditiouſly. He next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
in what place <hi>Laelius</hi> was, of which the ſlave having ſatisfied,
and aſſured him he ſhould find his Maſter at a place not above five
or ſix furlongs from <hi>Capſa;</hi> he quickned his pace ſo diligently, that he
ſoon reach'd the place where the ſlave told him <hi>Laelius</hi> attended him.
Theſe two Illuſtrious friends had no ſooner expreſs'd and perform'd
all the ceremonies which a real and noble affection mutually incited
them to; but they continued on their paſſage, during which <hi>Laelius</hi>
told <hi>Scipio,</hi> that he ſhould that very evening have the happineſs of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the incomparable <hi>Aemilia.</hi> For ſhe alwayes departs (added he)
unexpectedly from the places where ſhe is, to avoid the expence which
would be made in all Cities where ſhe would be expected. So that you
will not be ſurpriſed if you ſee her two dayes ſooner then you believ'd.
But I know not whether you will not wonder when you ſee the fair
Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon</hi> with her, and the excellent <hi>Nadalia,</hi> for whom
<hi>Thomira</hi> hath a great tenderneſs, and who will without doubt inform
you of what ever you are deſirous. But ſince we draw near to <hi>Capſa,</hi>
continued <hi>Laelius,</hi> I conceive it not unfit to let you know the perſons
by whom you are to be entertained. Be pleaſed therefore to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that <hi>Magasba</hi> Prince of <hi>Capſa</hi> is a man of good years, and of a
very high ſtature; that he is endued with virtue, integrity and wit, but
hath ſuch a formall and regular way of civility, that 'tis ſomething
troubleſome to diſpence with his Complements. <hi>Palmira</hi> his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Daughter, whom the Prince of <hi>Hippo</hi> married a few moneths
ſince, as you know without doubt, is but ſeventeen years of age. Her
ſtature is not extreamly tall, her complexion very fair, her eyes black,
glittering and ſprightly, her mouth hath a great lovelineſs in it, and
her wit ſo lively and gallant, that it may be ſaid the houſe of <hi>Magasba</hi>
is as well provided of a remedy, as a diſeaſe in converſation. <hi>Laelius</hi>
had ſcarce ſpoke theſe words, but himſelfe and his Illuſtrious friend
perceiv'd themſelves in ſight of the Gate of <hi>Capſa,</hi> which lies on that
ſide the City; but they were aſtoniſh'd when they beheld a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
attending them at the Gate to ſee them enter, and afterwards
obſerv'd the Prince of <hi>Capſa,</hi> who undoubtedly had been advertis'd by
ſome belonging to <hi>Laelius,</hi> advancing with ſome of prime note in the
City, to receive the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio,</hi> who at that time fill'd the world
with the fame of his Victories and Virtues; and to do civility to
<hi>Laelius,</hi> who was really a worthy friend of the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio.</hi> But
if this reception troubled <hi>Scipio,</hi> whoſe moderation was averſe from
all pompe, this Illuſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> was much more perplexed when he
heard the Complement of the Prince of <hi>Capſa.</hi> For <hi>Magasba,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
would conform to the mode of Gallantry which was then in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
began immediately to make the Elogium of <hi>Scipio;</hi> He did not
fail to tell him that he was ſurpriſed with his goodly aſpect, what ever
excellent Idea he had fancied of him to himſelf before; he extolled
the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Cornelii,</hi> from which <hi>Scipio</hi> is deſcended; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60667:69"/>
then he fell to relate the principal actions which this famous <hi>Roman</hi>
had done in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to admire the Victories which he had gain'd in
<hi>Spain</hi> and in <hi>Africa;</hi> and in brief, told him all that could be deviſed to
perplex him. But when <hi>Scipio</hi> was going to divert the converſation
he ſaw himſelf driven into another perplexity not leſs inconvenient,
ſince he found himſelf obliged to make great remerciments to <hi>Magaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
for ſo are they conſtrained to do who have to act with perſons of
this humour: But as he was ready to return thanks to the Prince of
<hi>Capſa</hi> for perſecuting his friends, he was happy enough to behold
himſelfe at the Gate of his Palace, where the fair Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi>
received him after a manner far different from that of her Father. For
whilſt <hi>Magasba</hi> was gone to give ſome orders, he had bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of (for perſons of this humour have alwayes ſomething to do)
his amiable daughter entertained <hi>Scipio</hi> ſo admirably, that what ever
ſhe ſaid was far from affectation, or being too much ſtudied and fetcht
about, but was accompanied with a noble obliging and lovely air. My
Lord, ſaid ſhe to him ſmiling, I know not whether or no the Prince
have told you that his houſe is not handſome enough to be offer'd to
the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio,</hi> but I know I ſhall make you no complement
of that kind, but on the contrary promiſe to ſhew you in a little time
the handſomeſt things in the world. What I have ſeen already, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered he, are ſo handſome, that I am raviſh'd with the
ſight: But I ſhall be more too, Madam (added he) if you have the
goodneſs to honor me with a friendſhip of which <hi>Laelius</hi> hath given me
hopes. Yes, Madam, ſaid <hi>Laelius,</hi> I have told <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, <hi>Laelius</hi> (interpoſed ſhe pleaſingly) do not believe peace is ſo
ſoon made between us, but know I will not eaſily forget the injury
you have done me. How? Madam, anſwered <hi>Scipio,</hi> has <hi>Laelius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd
you? Yes, My Lord, replyed ſhe, and moreover he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged
you. And moreover, interpoſed <hi>Laelius</hi> ſmiling, I am glad I
have diſoblig'd you both, nor ſhall I readily repent of it. Alas! I beſeech
you <hi>Laelius,</hi> ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi> agreeably, be not ſo fierce, and know I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the intereſts of the fair Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> againſt you. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
added he, be not ſo fierce, addreſſing to this amiable perſon, it is
requiſite I know of what nature the offence is you ſpeak of, ſince I
am intereſted in it; and though I were not ſo, I ſhould notwithſtanding
be as ſenſible of it as a true friend ought to be of what concerns ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo fair and generous. You muſt know then, replyed ſhe, that <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
made a diſcourſe to me wherein he us'd all the reaſons he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
to perſwade me to act in your favour, with the illuſtrious <hi>Aemila;</hi>
but he did it with ſo much ardour, that I was in truth wholly incenſed
with it; for I account to intreat me with urgency to act for you, is in
a manner to take pains to make me to act reaſonably. Be pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to judge, My Lord, if there be not ſomething offenſive in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of <hi>Laelius.</hi> I find ſomething ſo much obliging in yours, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>Scipio,</hi> that I am rather inclin'd to render you thanks, then to be
in choler againſt <hi>Lelius;</hi> beſides, that what is in your opinion an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
being an offence of a true friend.</p>
                  <p>Alas, My Lord, cryed ſhe, do not deceive your ſelf, but believe the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60667:69"/>
offences of a true friend ought to be more highly reſented. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered <hi>Laelius</hi> pleaſingly, do you deceive your ſelf as little in
this matter, and believe I have done that which I ought to do. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your own cenſure, I have onely failed, in that I intreated
you urgently for ſuch a perſon as <hi>Scipio,</hi> and ſo it ſeems I did injury
to his merit and your generoſity. However, proceeded he ſmiling, I
muſt advertiſe you, Madam, who are yet but a new friend, that a
zealous and active friendſhip ſometimes makes us do things which
ſeem unprofitable, for fear leſt coming frequently to act with too
great circumſpection, we let ſlip ſome important occaſion of doing
a ſervice to a friend; or elſe leſt our friendſhip by becoming too nice,
do not alſo become lukewarm and languiſhing. So that, Madam, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he agreeably, if you have the happineſs of not being more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in what you have further to ſay, you will not cauſe me very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
enemies. Scarce had <hi>Laelius</hi> ended theſe words, but the Prince
of <hi>Capſa</hi> came to wait upon and conduct <hi>Scipio</hi> to his Chamber. <hi>Scipio</hi>
refuſed his ceremony as much as he could; but <hi>Magasba</hi> believing he
did it out of complement, perſiſted ſo inflexibly in his reſolution,
that <hi>Scipio</hi> was at length enforced to ſuffer himſelfe to be conducted,
what repugnance ſoever he had, to leave the amiable Princeſs of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po.</hi>
'Tis true, this illuſtrious <hi>Roman</hi> had the ſatisfaction of hoping he
might diſcourſe with <hi>Laelius</hi> in his Chamber concerning the divine
<hi>Aemilia;</hi> but he was much perplext, when being come thither, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasba</hi>
deſired alſo to conduct <hi>Laelius</hi> to another which was prepared
for him. <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> both deprecated his civility, and believed
he would not be ſo obſtinate to ſeparate them. But it fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
for this Prince whoſe ceremonies were unalterable bent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
them, would needs have <hi>Laelius</hi> leave <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Chamber, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it was unfit two perſons of ſuch high condition ſhould be
lodged incommodiouſly. The two illuſtrious friends anſwer'd, that
their friendſhip and their affairs would not permit them to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
But <hi>Magasba</hi> replyed ſmiling, and ſhaking his head a little, that
it was hard to deceive a man of his age, that he perceived well what
they pretended was but a fictious civility, and that they deſired to be
together, only that they might take up leſs lodging in a houſe wherein
a great number of other gueſts were expected. But they needed not
trouble themſelves in that reſpect; His Palace was larger and more
commodious then it ſeemed to be; and in a word, if there were a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for any to be badly lodged, it ought not to be either <hi>Scipio</hi> or
<hi>Laelius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe illuſtrious <hi>Romans</hi> endeavoured further to oppoſe the will
of <hi>Magasba;</hi> they preſſed him with reaſons, and importuned him
with intreaties: but all their inſtances were unprofitable, and <hi>Magaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
retain'd ſo obſtinately, whatſoever he ſet upon, that <hi>Scipio</hi>
and <hi>Laelius,</hi> after a ſilent beholding of one another, as to teſtifie how
diſguſtful ceremonies are, at length were ſeparated; and <hi>Laelius</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himſelf to be conducted. Indeed afterwards <hi>Magasba</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to let them breathe and come together; for after having made a
great complement alſo to <hi>Laelius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he left him, and gave him liberty to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60667:70"/>
go to the Chamber of his illuſtrious Friend, though not without a
fear continually of meeting or being followed by <hi>Magasba:</hi> ſo true it
is, that perſons of this humour, are troubleſome even in places where
they are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laelius</hi> was no ſooner in <hi>Scipio's</hi> Chamber, but they began to ſpeak
of the perſecution of <hi>Magasba,</hi> though without much inſiſting on it,
having many more pleaſing and important matters to diſcourſe of.
For <hi>Laelius,</hi> to moderate the grief of his illuſtrious friend, told him
all he conceived pertinent to appeaſe his diſcontents, and indeavoured
to perſwade him he was not ſo unhappy as he believed himſelfe to
be. For are not you aſſured after all, ſaid he to him, that <hi>Aemilia</hi>
loves no perſon to your prejudice; and when you were upon the point
of marrying that adorable Lady, did you not obſerve as many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of joy in her fair eyes as you could wiſh? and did not you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
in thoſe very eyes as many tokens of diſcontent as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of joy, when a ſurpriſing and dreadful obſtacle interven'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your happineſs? And therefore I conceive you have no cauſe to
afflict your ſelfe as you do. For if the gods ſeem to intend that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
ſhould marry <hi>Aemilia</hi>—Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted <hi>Scipio</hi>) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſay the gods intend it abſolutely, and that they have made it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evident. This evidence which frightens you, anſwered <hi>Laeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
confirms me; beſides, that we ſee no appearance that <hi>Hannibal</hi>
who is ardently amorous of <hi>Thomira,</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Aemilia</hi> whom
he never ſaw.</p>
                  <p>Alas! <hi>Laelius</hi> (replyed <hi>Scipio</hi>) you argue ill in the matter, ſince
you know not that the Gods when they intend to make themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
for the agents, are wont to make things come to paſs contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all appearance, to amaze humane wiſdome, and to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
'tis a ſupernaturall conduct which acts and makes uſe of means
which are remote from, and very often contrary to their end. But,
<hi>Laelius</hi> (added he) ſhould what you ſay be true, and ſhould there
needed onely commodious diſpoſition of affairs; yet do wee
not already perceive an accompliſhment to my unhappineſs? For in
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ief, if I have transferr'd the War into <hi>Africa,</hi> it has been rather
for reaſon of love, as I may ſo ſay, then for reaſon of ſtate: And
indeed <hi>Fabius,</hi> who thought meet I ſhould fight <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
had not fewer reaſons to make good his opinion, then I had to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
mine, which was, that it was beſt to carry the Warr into the
Country of the Enemy, But the Intereſt of my love being concerned
in the buſineſs, I ſpoke above my ordinary force, and at length carried
it from <hi>Fabius</hi> in that famous conteſt. But obſerve, <hi>Laelius,</hi> how the
Gods delude our conduct, and how they puniſh us when we in any
manner oppoſe what they have deſigned. For we have ſeen, ſince I
brought the War into <hi>Africa,</hi> to draw <hi>Hannibal</hi> thither, and by that
means to deprive him of all occaſions of ſeeing the divine perſon
which I adore, it is come to paſs by a ſtrange adventure, that <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
is come into <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> is arrived there alſo ſoon after,
as well it ſeems to behold that adorable perſon as to defend <hi>Carthage.</hi>
And what can you ſay to this <hi>Laelius?</hi> What have you to ſay to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60667:70"/>
requeſt made to me by <hi>Aemilia</hi> not to ſee her? which was the cauſe,
as you know, that I waited for her upon the way, to the end ſhe might
think it was chance that gave me the happineſs of ſeeing her? Alas!
My Lord (replyed <hi>Laelius</hi>) I beſeech you conſider the matter well,
and you will perceive that the requeſt of <hi>Aemilia</hi> is perfectly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and even advantageous unto you. For ſince that fair perſon
hath much inclination for you, and gives you no cauſe to fear your
Rivals can make any benefit by your abſence, it muſt be believed
ſhe made the requeſt which afflicts you, onely becauſe ſhe believed,
that being at preſent you cannot ſee one another but unfortunate, you
would live in leſs inquietude by being remote aſunder. And to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
to you (added he) that this judicious perſon acts with great
circumſpection, I need onely tell you, that amongſt all the <hi>Romanes</hi>
of quality, who offered themſelves to guard her, ſhe made choice of
<hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> who as you know, have leſs inclination to become
her Lovers, then all the reſt ſhe might have choſen. For you are not
ignorant, that <hi>Cato,</hi> (as young as he is) makes profeſſion of a wiſdom
which holds ſomething of inſenſibility, and that <hi>Regulus</hi> bears ſo
violent a hatred in his heart againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to believe a contrary paſſion can eaſily find room in it. Thus you
ſee, My Lord, you are not ſo unhappy as you believe your ſelf, in the
paſſion which you have for the admirable <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ſince that fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
acts both prudently and to your advantage. And if you are not
unhappy in the paſſion which you have for <hi>Aemilia,</hi> are not you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in that which you have for glory? For without going about to
give you my applauſes, and exciting you to interrupt me immedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
Is it not true, that you have not ſeen in Hiſtory any man that has
done what you have already? and if you come to vanquiſh <hi>Hannibal</hi>
in one deceſſive battlel, will not yours outſhine the glory of all thoſe
that have preceded you? Alas, <hi>Laelius,</hi> anſwered <hi>Scipio,</hi> I have yet
done nothing that intitles me to a great name; but for what you ſay
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> added he fiercely, <hi>I</hi> will either overcome him, or <hi>I</hi> will
not be in a condition after the battel of hearing that he has overcome
me. All the beginnings (replyed <hi>Laelius</hi>) are favourable to you; for
we ſee the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> are not confirmed by the powerful alliances
which they have made, nor even by the arrival of the great Captain
who has overcome us ſo often in <hi>Italy,</hi> when you were not our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
And therefore they are inſtant, as you know, about that brave
deputation they prepare in order to treat a Peace with you, or at leaſt
a truce, which may diſpoſe matters to ſome accommodement. For in
truth, added he ſmiling, they will have no more to do with you, who
are alwayes ſo obſtinate to carry the advantage; and they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in greater fear, when 'tis told them <hi>Scipio</hi> is coming to ſee them,
then our women ſometimes had, when it was told them <hi>Hannibal</hi> was
at the Gates. Beſides this (continued he ſeriouſly) you have gallant
Forces well diſciplin'd: You have ſeveral Romanes under you, who
deſerve to be Generals where-ever you are not; and you have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to be as much in quiet at <hi>Capſa;</hi> as to what concerns the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as if you were in the middle of your own Camp. You have alſo
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60667:71"/>
left your Lieutenants, <hi>Aemilius, Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Flaminius,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
there, whoſe prudence and courage is beyond all exception,
who are all good Souldiers, and great Captains, each of which bears
revenge in his heart for the death of an illuſtrious Father. As for
what regards the Auxiliary forces, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> has for his Allies <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>
King of <hi>Syria, Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, and <hi>Pruſias,</hi> King
of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> you have <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt, Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
and our brave and dear <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> cannot believe to have
committed the crime report accuſed him of. Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupt-<hi>Scipio)
I</hi> have ſeen <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> with <hi>Hannibal.</hi> With <hi>Hannibal!</hi> cryed
<hi>Laelius,</hi> and you ſeen him there? Yes, replyed <hi>Scipio,</hi> and thereupon
he related to him part of what had befallen him upon the way to
<hi>Capſa.</hi> But though he recounted the adventure with very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
yet <hi>Laelius</hi> diſcern'd cauſe enough to admire the heroical
comportment of his illuſtrious friend, when he conſidered with what
generoſity he had fought for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and with what generoſity he
afterwards undertook the combate againſt him. But having expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſome Tokens of Admiration for theſe two actions of <hi>Scipio,</hi> hee
told him he could give ſome light to the adventure of <hi>Maſaniſſa.</hi> The
King of the <hi>Maſſeſsilians</hi> and my ſelf, proceeded he, were at the head
of four thouſand men which you had given me to lead to <hi>Tacapa,</hi>
that they might re-enforce the Garriſon of a place whither <hi>Hannibal</hi>
perhaps might come in a few dayes. When we were not farre from
<hi>Tacapa, Maſaniſſa,</hi> who had alwaies a ſtrong paſſion for <hi>Sophonisba,</hi>
and was alwayes telling me of the charms of that fair Queen, deſired
to go to a little Temple of the Sun, which is not much diſtant from
<hi>Leptis,</hi> that he might there learn ſomething by the anſwer of the god,
which might give him ſome light in reference to what he either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
or feared. But for that he carried with him onely four or five
Cavaliers; 'tis likely the Scouts of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army might have ſet
upon him and taken him priſoner, And therefore you ought not to
wonder, added he, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> were ſeen together.
Since in all probability the Carthaginian craft may have treated the
King of the <hi>Maſseſsilians</hi> obligingly, to draw him to his party, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Hannibal</hi> &amp; <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> being both generous, generoſity may have
induced them to act in the ſame manner, as if they were really friends.
But, however it be, <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>Maſaniſsa</hi> will never withdraw himſelfe
from the intereſts of Rome; ſo that we have nothing to conſider of
but how to draw him out of the hands of our Enemies, either by ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
or exchange, that we may afterwards know the circumſtances
of <hi>Sophonisba's</hi> death, of which <hi>I</hi> cannot believe him culpable. Now
you ſee, added he, what reſolution you are to take in relation to the
King of the <hi>Maſſeſsilians;</hi> but for what concerns the intereſt of your
paſsion, the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> and my ſelf will be no unactive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
                  <p>As for your Army, <hi>I</hi> conceive you muſt expect to make a new
reſolution till after the Treaty of the Carthaginians, and in the mean
time you may well enough repoſe your ſelf upon the cares of <hi>Aemili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Flaminius;</hi> ſcarce had <hi>Laelius</hi> finiſhed theſe words,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60667:71"/>
but a great noiſe was heard in the Court of the Palace, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſlave of the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> entered into <hi>Scipio's</hi> Chamber to
advertiſe the two illuſtrious friends that <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who was not looke
for till two hours after was arrived, being attended with a ſufficient
train of Horſemen. Upon this ſummons <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> deſcended
down into a low Hall, where it was told them the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> was.
As ſoon as <hi>Palmira</hi> perceived them, ſhe teſtified the joy to them
which ſhe had for the arrival of <hi>Aemilia.</hi> And as <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> gave
her the hand to go meet that illuſtrious Roman Lady, and were come
into the fore-Court of the Palace, they beheld a number of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who being already lighted, had ranked themſelves on two ſides,
and holding the point of their Javelius downwards, ſeemed to teſtifie
by that reſpectfull action that ſome very conſiderable perſon was to
paſs by. And accordingly, immediately after, <hi>Palmira, Scipio,</hi> and
<hi>Laelius,</hi> were come forth of the Palace, they beheld the incomparable
<hi>Aemilia,</hi> and that with admiration, notwithſtanding they had been
accuſtomed to ſee her. For it muſt be confeſſed, the beauty of this
illuſtrious perſon had a ſurpriſing brightneſs, that immedeately and
perpetually charmed the ſpectators. Her ſtature was very hand ſome
and portly; her carriage had ſomething of facility &amp; Majeſty mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which might be eaſily obſerved at that time. For this admirable
Lady came forth from her Chariot as ſoon as ever ſhe beheld <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasba,</hi>
who did not fail to go meet her. But neither the ſtature nor the
carriage of <hi>Aemilia</hi> were the greateſt charmes ſhe had. For this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
perſon had the pureſt, livelieſt, and radiant complexion that
can be imagined. Her eyes were blewiſh, well open'd and very ſweet;
her mouth was the moſt lovely thing that could be lookt upon; her
Hair was fair and admirably gracefull; and of all theſe perfections
joyned together aroſe a ſurpriſing luſtre, as I ſaid before, or rather
certain beams irradiated forth which penetrated hearts, and exciting
love and pleaſure in them, whilſt they filled the mind with reſpect
and admiration: <hi>Aemilia</hi> then, being ſuch as I have deſcribed her,
and a thouſand times fairer, immediately ſtirred up a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes
in the breaſt of <hi>Scipio,</hi> which did not ceaſe to be violent
by being pleaſing. So that this illuſtrious Roman was every moment
upon the point to caſt himſelf at the feet of that adorable perſon,
and to teſtifie the greatneſs of his paſſion to her by his extraordinary
tranſports. But having a great ſoul and an infinite reſpect for <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
and time to repreſs his impetuous inclinations, he compos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and ſubdued the violence of his paſſion. He reſummon'd up
part of his reaſon, during the time <hi>Palmira</hi> was performing the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> which eſteem and affection ſuggeſted to her, which
ſhe accompanied notwithſtanding with a ſubmiſsiveneſs, which the
greateſt Princeſſes at that time ow'd to perſons of <hi>Aemilia's</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And whilſt <hi>Aemilia</hi> on the other ſide, according to her obliging
humour, return'd to <hi>Palmira</hi> all the expreſsions of goodneſs which
ſhe ought to a Princeſs of great merit, and a perſon whom ſhe lov'd
with tenderneſs. Not but that <hi>Aemilia</hi> alſo reſented ſome trouble at
the ſight of <hi>Scipio;</hi> for it was impoſsible to behold that illuſtrious
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60667:72"/>
Lover ſo amiable, paſſionate and fruitful, with inſenfiblility. But this
incomparable Lady having a firm ſoul, did not appear any thing at
all diſturbed at it; and if ſhe gave any tokens of that little commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which ſhe reſented, 'twas onely by a little more colour which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
in her countenance, and ſerv'd onely to render it more gracefull
and lovely. After having performed the civilities which this trouble
did not hinder her from doing, ſhe preſented a fair young Lady to
<hi>Palmira,</hi> who by her open and gallant air, and an agreeable and
ſprightly aſpect, was immediately known to be that lovely <hi>Nadalia,</hi>
ſo dearly belov'd by the Princeſs of <hi>Caſtulon.</hi> After which <hi>Palmira</hi>
beginning to ſpeak; In truth, Madam, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> with an
air perfectly agreeable, I do not wonder you have taken this faire
young Lady from the Princeſs <hi>Thomira;</hi> and I ſhould have no means
of acknowledging the favour you do me in making her known to
me: If I had not two illuſtrious Friends to preſent to you (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe, preſenting <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> to her) but two illuſtrious friends,
added ſhe ſmiling, whom perhaps you know already. Though I
were not my ſelf a Roman, anſwered <hi>Aemilia,</hi> yet I ſhould not be
ignorant of two Romans, whoſe valour has extended their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
throughout the whole world. Ah! Madam, anſwered the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<hi>Scipio,</hi> I ſhould be happy if you knew me by a quality which
is more glorious unto me, and which I eſteem much more then the
moſt excellent I can have beſides. You have ſo excellent (replyed
ſhe bluſhing a little) that you have no cauſe to complain, though you
ſhould be known by them without any diſtinction. But, <hi>Scipio</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſhe, to divert the diſcourſe) if you pleaſe to point me, I ſhall
preſent to you <hi>Palmira,</hi> two friends of mine. In ſaying which, ſhe
preſented two young Romanes to the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo,</hi> of which
the firſt, who ſeem'd to have ſome ſlowneſs in his deportment, and a
kind of coldneſs in his countenance, beſides ſomething of gravity
and ſeverity, was preſently known to be that famous <hi>Porcius,</hi> who
was not long before ſtyled by the ſurname of <hi>Cato.</hi> And the other,
whoſe aſpect was more facile and gallant, though he had ſomething
of fierceneſs in his countenance, was <hi>Regulus,</hi> Son of that unfortunate
<hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> whoſe death is ſo rumour'd in the world. After
theſe two Romanes had made their reverence to <hi>Palmira,</hi> they did
the like to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and were likewiſe embraced by <hi>Laelius;</hi> and then
all this illuſtrious Company entered into the Palace of <hi>Nagasba.</hi> This
Prince gave the hand of <hi>Aemilia, Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ead <hi>Palmira;
Cato</hi> and <hi>Regulus, Nadalia;</hi> and the Ladies that attended theſe three
fair perſons followed altogether with ſome Roman Officers, and
ſome of the moſt conſiderable inhabitants of <hi>Capſa.</hi> In which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they accompanied <hi>Aemilia</hi> to the door of her Chamber, when
being come, all the men made a profound reverence to that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perſon, and retired. <hi>Palmira</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> onely entered in with
that illuſtrious Romane; Yet they continued not long there, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome gallant and obliging diſcourſe, wherein <hi>Palmira</hi> did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to accuſe her ſelf of procuring the happineſs to <hi>Scipio</hi> which he
lately received; they went forth of the Chamber, having firſt called
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60667:72"/>
thoſe of <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s attendants, whoſe ſervice might be neceſſary unto
her. After which, <hi>Palmira</hi> offered to conduct the fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> into a
Chamber: but this young Lady having no need of repoſing her
ſelf, and onely rectifying ſomething about her head-tire, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into a low Hall, where they found <hi>Laelius, Cato,</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi>
who were walking there, whilſt <hi>Magasba</hi> lead <hi>Scipio</hi> into a Garden,
to ſhew him the handſomneſs of the Alleys, Statues, Grottoes, and
Fountaines. The converſation which was then made between <hi>Palmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
Nadalia, Laelius, Cato</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> was abſolutely pleaſing and
gallant; for theſe five perſons were of rare addreſs capacities, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs.
And what rendered this converſation more agreeable was,
that the greateſt part of their wits were different, and had their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
excellencies. Thoſe of <hi>Palmira</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> were gallant and
Noble; that of <hi>Nadalia</hi> ſprightly and mirthfull; that of <hi>Regulus</hi>
partaking of both; and <hi>Cato</hi> had in his ſomething ſo cold and ſevere,
that it was great pleaſure to ſee him in conteſtation with <hi>Nadalia,</hi> with
whom he did not not very often agree. But it being upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Hippo</hi> to paſs the firſt honours, ſhe conceived her ſelf alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to begin the diſcourſe, which ſhe did in theſe words, addreſſing
to the three Romanes which were with her: If you are deprived of
the happineſs of being with the illuſtrious <hi>Aemilia,</hi> the beauty and
wit of <hi>Nadalia</hi> will cauſe you to induce that loſs with leſs regret.
Alas! Madam, interrupted that admirable Lady, I beſeech you cauſe
not theſe perſons eyes to be turn'd upon me, where you are preſent;
and be pleaſed not to attribute thoſe blandiſhments to me which I do
not deſerve. Hindering me from ſpeaking out what I intended (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Pallmira</hi>) you prevented me from comforting you for the ſame
loſs, by making you hope very much ſatisfaction from the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of three illuſtrious Romanes, who have rare qualifications of
ingenuity. Speak of your ſelf, if you pleaſe, Madam, (anſwered
<hi>Laelius</hi>) and you will ſpeak with juſtice. And you will give leſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to <hi>Nadalia</hi> (added <hi>Cato</hi>) who loves not to hear the Romans
commended, of whom ſhe hath conceived ſo ſtrange an opinion,
that ſhe takes them all for <hi>Catoes.</hi> Alas! <hi>Cato</hi> (interrupted this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Lady) I do not that favour to all the Romans; and if I have
ſometimes had an unkind opinion of them, you ought to forget what
I ever ſaid out of that prejudice, ſince from the time I knew the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
I have infinitely eſteemed them. And moreover, added ſhe
ſmiling, I may ſay I am now perfectly reconciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> and am
extreamly glad of being ſo: for in truth my imagination was tyr'd
out with contending every day againſt that powerful City. But it
would be known (ſaid <hi>Palmira,</hi> after having laugh'd at this ſpeech
of <hi>Nadalia</hi>) how you could do otherwiſe then eſteem a people who
in the judgement of all others is indued with virtue, wit and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                  <p>To tell you the truth, anſwered <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and according to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
permitted me every where to ſpeak of things according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
I have of them; I conceived indeed the Romanes had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60667:73"/>
virtue really, but that their virtue was nothing at all lovely: on the
contrary: I believed it was ſo rigid and ſevere, that it never beheld
joy and divertiſements without diſcontent and inquietude. If I
believed the Romans valiant (proceeded ſhe) I thought they were
ſo by wit rather then greatneſs of courage; that they adventured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
dangers, becauſe they were conſtrained to it; and if they loſt their
lives rather then commit an ignoble act or a cowardize, it was onely
becauſe they lookt upon infamy as ſomething more terrible then
death.</p>
                  <p>And in a word, added ſhe ſmiling, I imagin'd the glory the Romans
fought for, not to be a beautiful Virgin, lovely and reſplendant, but a
Woman of a good age, ſevere and Majeſtical. As for wit, I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
none of the Romanes deſtitute, and that their wit was cultivated
and polliſht, but not well contriv'd; that it was a dry wit, (if I may
ſo ſpeak) and averſe from all jollity and gallantry. And in fine, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe ſmiling, I imagin'd the Romans ſo enamour'd on their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that in their converſations they never utter'd other pleaſantneſſes
but political Maxims.</p>
                  <p>But, fair <hi>Nadalia,</hi> ſaid <hi>Regulus</hi> to her, the firſt Roman whom you
knew, was not, I conceive of that ſevere humour. That was your ſelf,
<hi>Regulus</hi> (anſwered ſhe) who convinc'd me of my prejudice at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum.</hi>
Not but that before I ever ſee you (continued ſhe ſmiling)
I violently dreaded your converſation, and that more then <hi>I</hi> ſhould
have fear'd that of <hi>Cato</hi> or <hi>Fabritius. I</hi> beſeech you earneſtly (ſaid
<hi>Regulus</hi> agreeably) tell me what it was that ſo terribly affrighted
you. 'Twas becauſe (anſwered ſhe) <hi>I</hi> believ'd you a greater lover of
<hi>Rome,</hi> then all the other Romans, and conſequently more ſevere and
political. You pronounce very confidently in favour of <hi>Regulus</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Palmira</hi>) without declaring your reaſon. 'Tis eaſie to render it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Nadalia</hi>) for if it be reaſonable (added ſhe ſmiling) to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the love of a man by the hatred he bears his Rivals; may not <hi>I</hi>
conclude that <hi>Regulus</hi> loves <hi>Rome</hi> more then all the Romans beſides,
ſince he hates <hi>Carthage</hi> more then then they all do, which <hi>I</hi> have heard
a hundred times term'd the Rival of <hi>Rome?</hi> But <hi>Nadalia,</hi> take
care what you ſay, (interpos'd <hi>Cato,</hi> ſmiling a little) for according to
what you aſſerted firſt, it will follow that <hi>Carthage</hi> ſhould be the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of <hi>Regulus,</hi> and not of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have ſuffered me to proceed a long time without reproving
me, anſwered <hi>Nadalia</hi> with her accuſtomed pleaſantneſs, but take heed
your ſelf (continued ſhe with the ſame air) and know, that what
would not be exact ſpeaking in the mouth of <hi>Cato,</hi> is very tolerable
in that of <hi>Nadalia;</hi> and after all, it ſuffices that <hi>Regulus</hi> hates <hi>Carthage</hi>
more then you do, to give me ground to infer that he loves <hi>Rome</hi> more
then you do, as much <hi>Cato</hi> as you are. <hi>Nadalia</hi> pronounced theſe
laſt words ſo agreeably, having utter'd them with a little pleaſing
commotion, that all the company ſmiled thereat. After which
<hi>Laelius</hi> beginning to ſpeak, <hi>I</hi> perceive <hi>Nadalia</hi> (ſaid he to her) you
have need of my friendſhip, becauſe you agree but ill with <hi>Cato,</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60667:73"/>
not exceeding well with <hi>Regulus.</hi> For which reaſons I offer it to you,
without expecting till you deſire it of me, and I will uſe all means
to make it acceptable unto you. For I will renounce in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
all ſort of affairs. And ſince the hatred of <hi>Regulus</hi> (added he
ſmiling) has not made a good impreſsion in your mind, to give you
better for my humour, I ſhall never ſpeak to you but of love. In
truth, anſwered ſhe ſmiling, you will perhaps do me a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
then you believe, provided this laſt but two or three dayes; for
during that time a quite contrary converſation becomes vehemently
faſtidious to me: and I dare affirm, the illuſtrious <hi>Aemilia</hi> hath made
me deſpair. For when I went about to ſpeak to her concerning <hi>Scipio,</hi>
ſhe in treated me to forbear, but it was with ſuch a touching ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as would have conſtrain'd the moſt rebellious heart in the world
to obey her: ſo that I was depriv'd of the ſatisfaction I ſhould have
had of performing a good office in ſome meaſure to a perſon, who
being ſo young a Conqueror, is nevertheleſs extreamly virtuous, and
infinitely amiable. But <hi>Laelius</hi> (continued ſhe ſmiling) ſince you
have begun to make me obliging propoſals in publick, it is fit you
ſpeak of Love in General, though it were onely to do diſpleaſure to
the perſons with whom you give me notice, I am not upon good
terms. Forbearing to ſpeak in particular (anſwer'd he, I ſhall do all
that you pleaſe, and maintain againſt all your Enemies, that there is
nothing more powerful, nothing more noble and advantageous then
love. And I ſhall prove (interpoſed <hi>Regulus</hi> pleaſantly) that what
you ſay of Love, may be with more juſtice attributed to hatred. But
to make the converſation more handſome (anſwered <hi>Nadalia</hi>) it is
requiſite that you ſpeak ſeriouſly, as alſo that <hi>Cato</hi> declare himſelf, and
take his turn; and when you have all three given your opinions, the
judgement of the difference ſhall be referred to the Princeſs. <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the conditions, ſaid <hi>Laelius;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> do the ſame, added <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
my ſubmiſsion then to the propoſal ſhall follow, agreed <hi>Cato.</hi>
But it muſt be known (ſaid <hi>Nadalia</hi> to him) whether you will defend
Love or Hatred? <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeak againſt both (anſwered he) But
<hi>Nadalia</hi> (ſaid the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo) I</hi> will not decide this debate, or
at leaſt, not without your judgment. It is neceſſary that you do it,
Madam, anſwered ſhe, for not to make the Elogium of your wit, <hi>I</hi>
can only ſay for my ſelf, that <hi>I</hi> am ſuſpected in this matter. Well
then, <hi>Nadalia,</hi> replyed the Princeſs, to avoid a new diſpute which
would ariſe betwixt you and me: <hi>I</hi> will do what you deſire, though
on condition that after <hi>I</hi> ſhall have declared my judgement, you tell
your own without diſsimulation or complyance. <hi>I</hi> ſhall obey your
pleaſure, (anſwered ſhe.)</p>
                  <p>To begin therefore to ſpeak of Love, ſaid <hi>Laelius,</hi> I ſhall aſſert, that we
have nothing more powerful, nothing more advantageous or noble,
then the excellent paſsion I ſpeak of. We ſee Love is a God, and a
God ſo powerful, that he hath ſubdu'd all the reſt to his Empire, and
who, that he might triumph generally over all, hath overcome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſometimes ſigh'd after the fair <hi>Pſyche.</hi> And if it be true,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60667:74"/>
proceeded he, that Diviſion of what nature ſoever, is a thing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deſtructive; is it not juſt to affirm that we have nothing more
advantageous then Love, which is a paſsion that preſerves all things
while it unites them? And indeed, was it not Love that eſtabliſh't ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
ſociety amongſt the firſt men? Was it not love that afterwards
incited them to elegancy of life, and teaches us every day to live as
much for others as for our ſelves? But theſe are not all the effects of
love; for if virtue makes it ſelf to be belov'd, it muſt be love that
inſpires it, ſince love ſeeks alwayes to extend it ſelf in the heart of
the beloved perſon. Moreover we ſee every day this excellent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
gives courage to the Pufillanimous, moderates the fierceneſs of
Conquerors, opens the Purſe of the Covetous, and daily inſpires us
with ſuch excellent ſentiments, that we may in a manner ſay, that
Nature by giving us Being onely, makes us living Creatures; but
'tis love which afterwards renders us reaſonable. In truth (ſaid <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi>
when he perceived <hi>Laelius</hi> had no more to ſay) I am in a ſtrange
perplexity, being oblig'd to anſwer a perſon of a tranſcendent wit.
It lies upon me to ſpeak in commendation of hatred before the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
perſons who ought extreamly to abhor it, ſince they look upon the
contrary paſſion every day as an effect of their beauty; and in brief,
<hi>I</hi> muſt be the Patron and Protector of a thing whoſe onely name
ſeems preſently odious.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it cannot be evident, continued he agreeably, <hi>I</hi> ſhall
maintain that Hatred is more powerful, more advantageous, and
more noble then Love. And in effect, Is it not true, that there is more
evil then good in the world? that Grief acts more vigorouſly then Joy?
and that Poyſons deprive us of a life, which remedies are unable to
reſtore?</p>
                  <p>If this be true, as is not to be doubted; Is it not alſo true, that the
paſsion which with-drawes from all theſe things <hi>I</hi> mention'd, ought
to be more powerful and advantageous then that which leads us to
good, which is uſually found more weak then evil, as <hi>I</hi> ſaid before?
<hi>I</hi> might hereunto add a hundred other particulars to the advantage of
Hatred; but <hi>I</hi> ſhall content my ſelf with anſwering what <hi>Laelius</hi> hath
ſpoken in the commendation of Love. <hi>I</hi> obſerve then, that he ſaid
Love is a God, and a God that hath ſubdued all the other Deities to
his Empire. Nevertheleſs alſo <hi>I</hi> obſerve it may be anſwered, that
that very God may as well bear the name of the God of Hatred. And
indeed, does he not ſhoot as many Arrows headed with lead, which
produce hatred in the breaſts they touch, as he does of thoſe which
are pointed with Gold, which inflames the hearts which they wound;
and conſequently cauſing as much hatred as love, he might aſſume
the name of the former of theſe Paſsions, if perhaps the people had
not been at firſt dazled with the effects of the richer mettal, or at leaſt
if they had not conceiv'd ſome greater pleaſure in naming them, then
in naming Hatred, which was produc'd by a metal not eſteem'd of.
For in truth, one of theſe Paſsions does not ſatisfie more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and <hi>I</hi> believe a perſon that hates, pleaſes himſelf as much in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60667:74"/>
his averſion, as a perſon that Love finds ſatisfaction in reflecting on
his affection. Therefore let <hi>Laelius</hi> change his opinion, and let him no
longer ſay, That 'tis Love rather then Hatred which eſtabliſh'd civil
ſociety by uniting our fore-fathers together; that love hath induc'd
us to politeneſs of manners, and taught us liberality, and the way to act
for the intereſt of others. For, as for my part, <hi>I</hi> believe Hatred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
theſe excellent effects, and think it not difficult to be prov'd. For
be pleas'd, Ladies, to imagine the world without ſociety and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
manners; you will ſoon apprehend how men continuing in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts
without union and order, would kill one another like Tygers
and Leopards; but you will alſo ſee that coming by degrees to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a hatred againſt ſuch diſorder, they will unite to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they will build Cities to ſecure themſelves from the attempts
of ſtrangers, and conſtitute puniſhments againſt thoſe that ſhall cauſe
diſturbance amongſt them. Thus you ſee, Hatred will eſtabliſh civil
Society. And let it not be objected to me, that this proceeds rather
from the love we bear our ſelves, which cauſes to unite for our own
converſation, ſince on the contrary 'twas that ſelf-love which cauſed
all the former diſorder: for the ſtrong would never go about to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the weak, if he were not deſirous to raviſh from him what he
ſees him poſſeſs; ſo that it may be ſaid, 'tis that ſelf-love which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
diviſion and hatred that has afterwards eſtabliſht civil ſociety.
But this is not all the advantage which we receive from Hatred. For
after having eſtabliſh'd ſociety, it hath alſo taught us the means to
preſerve it: for (that as in the primitive confuſion) men hurt and kill'd
one another; it behov'd them in ſociety to act one for another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they have made a kind of act of doing good offices, and obliging
generouſly.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>I</hi> affirm, that Nature has made us more rational by
giving us Hatred, then by giving us Love, ſince we have more evil to
encounter with (as I ſaid) then good to purſue; and it is neceſſary
firſt to overcome the evil that we may afterwards attain the good;
as no queſtion, it behoveth firſt to conquer our Enemies, before we
can enjoy the ſweetneſſes of the victory. Thus you have (added <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>)
what I had to plead in defence of a paſſion, which has not ſo
many Patrons as it ought, &amp; whoſe very name oftentimes affrightens
perſons who knows not the nature of it. In truth (ſaid <hi>Laelius) I</hi> am
highly pleas'd it fell to me to ſpeak firſt, for having heard <hi>Regulus,</hi>
how much better ſoever my cauſe be, I ſhould be ſtrangely perplext,
if <hi>I</hi> were in the place of <hi>Cato.</hi> You would not be ſo, anſwered <hi>Cato,</hi>
if you were really in my place; ſince you would not reſent the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
which the paſſions excite, or at leaſt you would not be obliged
to ſpeak in their commendation, and extol the ſource of all miſchiefs,
and the cauſe of all irregularities. For in brief, 'tis reaſon which
ought to guide a man, and 'tis the violence of paſſions which clouds
his reaſon, and cauſes a man not to deport himſelf as a man. <hi>Cato</hi>
held his peace after theſe words: but becauſe 'twas known he was
naturally inclin'd to ſilence, it was the cuſtome to ask queſtions, or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60667:75"/>
propoſe Objections to him to draw him to ſpeak. Wherefore <hi>Lelius</hi>
taking this courſe: How, <hi>Cato?</hi> (ſaid he to him) do you content
your ſelf with ſpeaking thoſe few words againſt the paſſions? Have
not I ſaid enough (anſwered he) when I told you 'twas they which
hindered a man from acting like a man, and term'd them the ſource
of all irregularities?</p>
                  <p>But we may ſay alſo (replyed <hi>Lelius</hi>) that they are the ſource of
very many virtues: For we ſee daily, Fear renders us prudent, by
making us fore-ſee the Evils which threatens us, and boldneſs makes
Conquerors. I know well (anſwered <hi>Cato</hi>) that the Paſsions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
conduce to the purpoſes you ſpeak of: but it falls out ſo ſeldom,
that they lead us to Virtue, and ſo often, that they carry us to Vice,
that in truth I ſhould be loth to make uſe of their aſsiſtance. As in
caſe I were to ſight a battel (added he) <hi>I</hi> ſhould not be very glad
to ſerve my ſelf of Souldiers whom <hi>I</hi> ſaw inclinable to revolt againſt
me, and readier to tear me in pieces, then to make me carry the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But yet it muſt be confeſs'd (ſaid <hi>Regulus</hi>) that the virtues which
ſerve to govern the Paſſions, would be no longer in the world, if
you ſhould baniſh thence the motions which they ought to regulate.
<hi>I</hi> acknowledge it, anſwered <hi>Cato,</hi> but you muſt alſo grant me, that in
this caſe we ſhould ſuffer no damage. For ſince the Virtues you ſpeak
of, ſerve onely to govern the Paſsions, they would become uuprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the world after there were no longer any Paſsion in it: ſo
that we ſhould in a manner be ſatisfied for the loſſe of them on this
condition, as we ſhould be aſſuredly raviſh'd with joy for having no
phyſical remedies in the world, provided there were alſo no diſeaſes.
what you ſay, is unqueſtionably ingenious (ſaid <hi>Regulus</hi>) but I find
an impoſsibility in the thing; for I do not believe it poſsible to root
up the Paſſions out the heart of man.</p>
                  <p>If we cannot wholly pull them up by the roots (anſwered <hi>Cato</hi>)
we may at leaſt pull up all that germinates from thence, provided it
be done ſpeedily, and they be not permitted to grow vigorous and
gather too great ſtrength. <hi>Cato</hi> ſpoke no further; and <hi>Lelius</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>
knowing his humour, did not attempt to oblige him to ſpeak
more, ſo that it now came to the Princeſs <hi>Palmira</hi> (notwithſtanding
all her refuſals) to give her judgment concerning theſe contrary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
which ſhe had heard deliver'd. She endeavour'd indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe would pronounce to draw forth the opinion of <hi>Nadalia;</hi> but
this amiable Virgin oppos'd it ſo reſolutely, though withal very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
that <hi>Palmira</hi> was conſtrained to pronounce without it, which
yet was not tell ſhe had firſt engag'd <hi>Nadalia</hi> to declare her own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
afterwards, without diſſimulation or complyance. This little
conteſtation being ended, ſilence was made, during which, the fair
Princeſſe of <hi>Hippo</hi> lookt upon the three Romans, who expected to be
judged by her, and then told them that <hi>Lelius</hi> had ſpoken extream
gallantly, that <hi>Regulus</hi> had contriv'd his reaſons in a very ingenious
manner, but that there was more wiſdom and ſafety in following the
ſentiments of <hi>Cato. Palmira</hi> had no ſooner ended theſe few words,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60667:75"/>
but <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi> were ſatisfied with them, and return'd her
thanks.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſeem'd extraordinary and unexpected in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
was, that <hi>Cato,</hi> who was the moſt oblig'd to <hi>Palmira,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in his wonted coldneſs, without making any remorciment at
all to the fair Princeſs. Upon which, <hi>Laelius,</hi> who was of an open and
gallant addreſs, could not ſuffer <hi>Cato</hi> to uſe this ſeverity; but being
they were familiar and intimate, 'tis ſtrange to me (ſaid he to him)
that you have not thank'd the Princeſſe <hi>Palmira</hi> for preferring your
ſentiments before ours. And I find it more ſtrange (anſwerd <hi>Cato,</hi>
without being mov'd) that you give the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> thanks for
ſpeaking what ſhe thinks. We give her thanks (replyed <hi>Laelius</hi>)
becauſe ſhe thinks and ſpeaks things to our advantage. The Princeſs
<hi>Palmira</hi> (anſwered <hi>Cato</hi>) being a juſt perſon, thinks and ſpeaks ſo
onely, becauſe ſhe believes you deſerve ſhe ſhould; ſo that her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
not giving you any merit, and onely declaring, to ſpeak the
truth, that you are deſerving, you are more oblig'd (if I may ſo
ſpeak) to your own merit, ſince 'tis that which produces thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
ſentiments in <hi>Palmira</hi> of you. We know well, ſaid <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>
to <hi>Cato,</hi> that you do not want reaſons to maintain your ſevere
humour. But, believe me, <hi>Cato,</hi> 'tis alwayes a ſevere humour, and
conſequently not ſo lovely as the pleaſantneſs of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to ſpeak after the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo.</hi> Fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> (added <hi>Laelius,</hi>
turning towards this lovely Virgin) tell us with freedom and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as you promiſed, whether your judgment be conformable to
that of the Princeſſe <hi>Palmira.</hi> To ſpeak in the manner required of me
(anſwered ſhe with an air perfectly pleaſing, and addreſſing to the
company in general) I ſhall tell you, that <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi> have
ſpoken very rationally, and that according to what I have heard,
their ſentiments are not ſo contrary as they ſeem. As for thoſe of
<hi>Cato,</hi> it is impoſſible that I ſhould approve them. For indeed, one,
but the leaſt cauſe of our contrary opinions, is the diverſity of our
humours; but beſides, added ſhe ſmiling, if onely inſenſibility were
required to wiſdom, I believe a Rock would be a great Philoſpher,
and a Tree wiſer then <hi>Cato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At theſe words of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> the company expreſſed a ſmile of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
and ſome of them telling <hi>Cato,</hi> they wondered a perſon
ſo ingenious ſhould not approve theſe opinions; I had rather, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, it ſhould be wondered why witty perſons appove not my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
then why they do. As <hi>Cato</hi> was ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Scipio</hi>
and <hi>Magasba</hi> entered into the Hall, and changed the converſation;
where after they had ſpoken of divers matters, and <hi>Palmira</hi> was told
by one of her Attendants, that they might go up to <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
without diſturbing her; all this illuſtrious company went up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſaving <hi>Maga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ba,</hi> who by good fortune was drawn otherwhere to
take care for ſomething which he conceiv'd wanting to that exact and
troubleſome civility of which he made profeſſion. But <hi>Aemilia</hi> being
recovered of her weakneſs, and beholding <hi>Magasba's</hi> Garden from
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60667:76"/>
her Chamber window, ſhe declared her deſire to go and walk there,
upon which all this noble company readily accompanied this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lady thither. <hi>Cato</hi> gave the hand to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> which <hi>Scipio</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
not to do out of reſpect, but lead <hi>Palmira,</hi> as <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>
did <hi>Nadalia,</hi> to whom they told a thouſand divertiſing things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
very contrary. For <hi>Laelius</hi> alwayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpoke to her as a friend,
and <hi>Regulus</hi> as an enemy, to render the converſation more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
founding that enmity upon the opinion which <hi>Nadalia</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had of him before ſhe knew him. <hi>Aemilia</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt an excellent Diſcourſe, but after a prudent and ſerious
manner; and the illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> entertained the amiable <hi>Palmira</hi>
onely with the violent paſſion he had for the adorable Lady which he
ſaw walk before him. The Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> was really affected with
the expreſſions of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and therefore being willing to do a ſervice
to that illuſtrious Lover, ſhe inſenſibly drew <hi>Aemilia</hi> into an Alley
which ended in a fair Grotto, on both ſides of which were two little
Arbors of Jaſmine. <hi>Nadalia, Laelius,</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi> amus'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in beholding the Grotto; and when <hi>Aemilia, Palmira, Scipio,</hi>
and <hi>Cato,</hi> were entered into one of thoſe Arbors, <hi>Laelius</hi> began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
very loud againſt <hi>Nadalia,</hi> upon the firſt thing ſhe ſpoke, and
then went into the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bor where <hi>Aemilia</hi> was, to cauſe <hi>Cato</hi> to come
forth. In truth (ſaid he, as hs was entering) I think we are to day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to nothing but diſpute; and therefore, Ladies, it is neceſſary
that you give us <hi>Cato</hi> to judge of our differences, ſince it cannot be
objected that he is a paſſionate Judge; and moreover, added he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably,
our company hath more need of wiſdom then yours. The
fair <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who nothing doubted the little treaſon intended againſt
her, and beheld her ſelf with the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo,</hi> did not oppoſe
<hi>Laelius</hi>'s deſire; but anſwered pleaſingly, that if ſhe had known of
their being already ſo high in conteſt, ſhe would have contributed
all her indeavours to the compoſing of their differences. And I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Madam, (added ſhe pleaſingly, turning towards <hi>Palmira</hi>) that
you have not put an end to their debates which you caus'd to ariſe
riſe amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>I know not very well (anſwered ſhe) whether I have wanted power,
or a will to do it. For power, replyed <hi>Aemilia,</hi> I will not do that injury
to the perſons amongſt whom the diſpute is we ſpeak of, to believe they
will not ſubmit to your ſentiments; nor on the other ſide, will I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
you of not having bin willing to bring matters to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modement.
Alas, Madam (replyed <hi>Palmira</hi>) I was not much ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
of doing what you ſpeak of; for, beſides that I was willing to
hear handſome Diſcouſes, I had an accommodement to make which
was of greater importance. <hi>Palmira</hi> in ſpeaking theſe words, lookt
upon <hi>Aemilia</hi> in ſuch a manner, that this Roman underſtood what
ſhe intended to intimate; ſo that ſhe would not anſwer to a Diſcourſe,
the continuance of which ſhe did not deſire.</p>
                  <p>But the paſſionate <hi>Scipio</hi> not being able to moderate his tranſports
at the ſight of ſo many charms, caſt himſelf at <hi>Aemilia's</hi> feet, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60667:76"/>
told that Admirable perſon without her being able to interrupt him,
all that a violent and reſpectfull paſsion could inſpire him with to
move her. No, no, Madam (ſaid he to her) you muſt not perſiſt in
this cruel inflexibleneſs which cauſes all my torment; but you ought
at leaſt to liſten to a Princeſs who would intercede in my favour with
you. I beſeech you, <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered this fair perſon) moderate
your paſsions, or rather augment that which you have, for glory, to
the end you may weaken that which ſerves onely to trouble your
quiet, and accuſe not of your unhappineſs a perſon who is her ſelf in
danger of becoming the moſt unhappy in the world. Therefore (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe, riſing up) you ought onely to think of overcoming the
fierce enemy of the Romans: And in the mean time <hi>Scipio,</hi> (added
ſhe, offering to go forth) believe I ſhall not perhaps have more zeal
to pray the Gods in behalf of my Country, and my Brother, then I
ſhall have to make vowes for your preſervation and your glory. She
was going out as ſhe ended theſe words; but <hi>Scipio</hi> retain'd her, and
then beholding her with eyes which ſpoke ſufficiently both his love
and his diſcontent. How? Madam (ſaid he to her) have you the
cruelty to forſake the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo,</hi> without hearing what ſhe
hath to ſay to you. In the name of the Gods, <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered ſhe, with
a ſuppliant action and infinitely affecting) do not oppoſe what I am
deſirous of. And you, Madam (added ſhe, turning towards <hi>Palmira</hi>)
be pleaſed to have the goodneſs to pardon me the incivility which I
am enforced to commit; and believe, I beſeech you, that you would
not accuſe me of injuſtice, if you knew the reaſons for which I act in
this manner. You muſt then, if you pleaſe, Madam (anſwered <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi>)
do me the favour to let me know them, and to permit <hi>Laelius</hi> to
recount me the Hiſtory of his Illuſtrious friend (which he dares not
do without your conſentment) to the end I may afterwards act equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
both for you and <hi>Scipio.</hi> I conſent to it (replyed ſhe going forth)
and I am glad you will by that means learn that I have done for <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
whatever gratitude obliged me to, or virtue permitted me.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, all the Company joyn'd together again, and
<hi>Palmira</hi> failed not to acquaint <hi>Laelius</hi> with the conſent ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of <hi>Aemilia;</hi> ſo that (added ſhe) I ſhall not ſuffer you in quiet
till you have ſatisfied my curioſity. I ſhall ſatisfie it when you pleaſe
(anſwered he to her) and ſhall be glad to let you know two Illuſtrious
perſons who are not known to you now but imperfectly.</p>
                  <p>As ſhe ended theſe words, the Prince of <hi>Capſa</hi> came among this
fair company, and continued with them till he judged it time for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Their repaſt was compleatly magnificent; and after a ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<hi>Aemilia</hi> was accompanied to her Chamber, and <hi>Nadalia</hi> to
hers by <hi>Palmira,</hi> into which the Princeſs entered, and cauſed <hi>Laelius</hi> to
enter too. Who knowing the intentions of theſe two fait perſons, and
<hi>Aemilia's</hi> pleaſure that <hi>Nadalia</hi> ſhould hear the particularities of her
life, ſeated himſelf down by them. And though this famous Roman
was term'd among others by the names of the wiſe and knowing, yet
he underſtood ſo well how to accommode his knovvledg and vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60667:77"/>
that he did not appear leſs gallant and debonair among the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
then he vvas othervvhere a Warrier, politick and virtuous.
He began his relation in theſe vvords, addreſsing it to <hi>Palmira</hi> onely,
as <hi>Nadalia</hi> had entreated him to do.</p>

                  <head>The Hiſtory of SCIPIO and AEMILIA.</head>
                  <p>EXpect not, Madam, to hear in the beginning of my Diſcourſe,
that kind of Proem which they generally uſe vvho are to recount
a Hiſtory. They are vvont to promiſe great matters to gain the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of thoſe that hear them; they pick out high words to ſhew
their excellent wit, and never fail to excuſe themſelves that their
eloquence is ſhort of the ſubject they are to treat of. For my part,
Madam, I account it not material for me to make uſe of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
for beſides that, I believe that the names of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
promiſe at firſt all that can be imagin'd great, I conceive it would
be needleſs for me to take pains to win the attention of a Princeſs,
who without doubt would not have commanded me to ſpeak, if ſhe
intended not to liſten to what I have to ſay. As for high language,
Madam, I preſume you will readily diſpenſe with me; for beſides
that, it ſhews ſome violence and enforcement in him that uſes it, yet it
too much takes up the hearers, who oftentimes heedleſly let important
matters paſs by, and even ſome which being neceſſary to the body
of the Hiſtory, it is impoſſible afterwards to diſ-intricate adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But, Madam, I ſhall yet leſs ſerve my ſelf of the excuſes which
I now condemn'd: for to tell you things as I apprehend them, if I
were eloquent, I ſhould be ſo far from being ſorry that my eloquence
were ſhort of the ſubject that I ſpeak of, that I would repreſs it in
caſe it offer'd to lift up it ſelf, and keep it under, as I may ſo ſpeak,
to the end there might be nothing in my diſcourſe that might divert
part of an attention which <hi>I</hi> would have wholly beſtow'd on the
things I ſhould ſpeak, and not on the words I made uſe of to expreſs
them. For what can be heard more ſatisfactory to the mind, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to fill it with excellent Idea's, then the relation I am going to
make, whether you conſider that greatneſs of birth in the perſons I
am to ſpeak of, or admire the rare qualities of their bodies and minds,
or be affected with the ſentiments of an heroick ſoul; or laſtly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to hear ſurpriſing events related, which ſeem deſtinated onely
to cauſe revolutions in the lives of extraordinary perſons? But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
leſt you ſhould apprehend me guilty of the fault I decry, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
me to enter upon the matter, and to let you know that <hi>Scipio</hi>
is of the Illuſtrious race of the <hi>Cornelii,</hi> which has always bin ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in great men, that 'tis not without cauſe the ſir-name of <hi>Scipio</hi> has
bin given them, which ſignifies in our language a Prop, or ſtay, ſince
aſſuredly the <hi>Cornelii</hi> hath ever ſupported our Republick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it couragiouſly againſt all the enemies that have attaqued it.
Nevertheleſs I may ſay, ſince all the world believes and publiſhes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60667:77"/>
it, that the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> has yet a higher deſcent, and is Son of
the great Gods. For you have heard, I imagine, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was ſeen
under the form of a great Dragon in the Chamber of the Mother
of this Illuſtrious Roman, as 'tis reported he was ſometimes ſeen in
that of <hi>Olympias</hi> the mother of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And that which may in
ſome meaſure perſwade us, that <hi>Scipio</hi> is the ſon of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or at
leaſt as worthy to be ſo as the famous King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> is; that
<hi>Scipio</hi> is extreamly pious, endued with all virtues, and blemiſhed
with no defect; that being not born upon the Throne, he is riſen by
his virtue to the ſupream authority which he poſſeſſes, that he has
already done things in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> which will aſtoniſh poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and that if he happens to defeat <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a deciſive bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
he will have done more then ever <hi>Alexander</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a difference between theſe two great men, which is, that
the King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> would peremptorily have had the whole
world treated him as the Son of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and on the contrary the
whole world would have treated <hi>Scipio</hi> in that manner, if himſelf
had not oppoſed it.</p>
                  <p>It is true, this famous Roman has taken no extream care to root
this belief abſolutely out of the minds of people, but it has only
bin out of reſpect to the glory of <hi>Rome;</hi> for he believ'd the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
would fight with a higher confidence, if they conceiv'd they
fought under a Son of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and would take themſelves to be
invincible when they beheld a Demy-God in the head of them.
But, Madam, intending only to ſpeak of <hi>Scipio</hi> as of a great man,
and the Son of <hi>Publius. Scipio,</hi> who loſt his life gloriouſly in <hi>Spain</hi>
at the winning of a great field, I ſhall omit to tell you of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
that were ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> on the day of his birth, which cauſed
us to preſage good fortune to our Common-wealth, and of thoſe
that were alſo obſerv'd at <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had a contrary effect. For
'tis reported that the day on which <hi>Scipio</hi> was born, according to the
ſupputation that has bin made of it, the Tongue of Land on which
<hi>Carthage</hi> is built was perceiv'd to tremble, and that Eagles were ſeen
entring into the houſes of the <hi>Suffetii,</hi> who as you know, have the
ſame authority in <hi>Carthage</hi> that the Conſuls have in <hi>Rome.</hi> But for
that all theſe Prodigies, which are nothing but extraordinary ſigns
of things not common, would not much divert you; I ſhall prefer
to tell you things more eſſential to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be more agreeable and pleaſing to you.</p>
                  <p>After having ſpoken of the houſe of the <hi>Cornelii,</hi> it may ſeem
convenient before further proceeding in my relation, to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that of the <hi>Aemilii,</hi> being as well to recount to you the life
of the Illuſtrious <hi>Aemilia,</hi> as that of the Grand <hi>Scipio.</hi> The firſt
therefore that bore the name of <hi>Aemilius,</hi> was according to an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſufficiently authentick, a Son of the famous <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> named
<hi>Marcus,</hi> to whom the name of <hi>Aemilius</hi> was given by reaſon of his
eloquence. This <hi>Marcus</hi> after the death of his Illuſtrious Father,
who, as all the world knows, came out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> went to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60667:78"/>
inhabitate at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he eſtabliſht the <hi>Aemilis.</hi> But, Madam,
there is yet ſomething more of Grandeur in the Original of this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Houſe: for according to ſeveral inquiſitive Antiquaries,
the <hi>Aemilii</hi> is deſcended from that famous <hi>Aemilia,</hi> daughter of
<hi>Aenaeas</hi> and <hi>Lavinia,</hi> who was of ſuch admirable beauty, that <hi>Mars</hi>
himſelf became amorous of her. And the <hi>Hero</hi> that was the iſſue of
that affection, was not <hi>Romulus,</hi> as ſome would have it, but the firſt
of the <hi>Aemilii,</hi> who having no father upon earth, bore the name of
his Illuſtrious Mother, and cauſed theſe words to be engraven on
the Gate of his Palace in our language, which ſignifie, <hi>We are from</hi>
Mars.</p>
                  <p>Behold therefore, Madam, what are the Houſes of the <hi>Cornelii</hi>
and the <hi>Aemilii,</hi> which have given us the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the
admirable <hi>Aemilia.</hi> As for the education of the fair perſon I named
laſt, I ſhall not inſiſt upon the particularities of it, but content my
ſelf to tell you, that <hi>Publius,</hi> who was undoubtedly an excellent
perſon, omitted not to breed up <hi>Scipio</hi> nobly. For himſelf train'd
him up in all his exerciſes at home; and then caus'd him to be taught
the Sciences, and alſo ſent him to <hi>Greece</hi> to perfect and poliſh his
mind.</p>
                  <p>It was my happineſs that my Father ſent me hither too at the
ſame time; ſo that it was at <hi>Athens</hi> where I began to contract that
friendſhip with <hi>Scipio</hi> which is ſo taken notice of in the world, and
will unqueſtionably be the ſole advantage that will make me known
to poſterity. But if the Romans admired the wit of <hi>Scipio,</hi> I may
ſay the Greeks were aſtoniſh'd at it: all the excellent perſons that
were at that time at <hi>Athens,</hi> reſorted to <hi>Scipio's</hi> lodgings, either to
make converſation with him, or to take his ſentiments for the works
which were then writ in <hi>Greece.</hi> And to ſhew you that <hi>Scipio's</hi> mind
is none of thoſe narrow ones, who cannot addict themſelves but to
one ſcience, or to one kind of writing: I have onely one thing
to tell you that all the world knows already. You may pleaſe
then to know, Madam, that <hi>Ermius,</hi> who was at that time at <hi>Athens,</hi>
and who began there to write Latine Verſes in imitation of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and to bring our Poetry into the world which our Fathers
never before attempted; began alſo to ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
and to ſhew him his Works before he durſt publiſh them to the
world. But if <hi>Scipio</hi> were admirably accurate in judging the Works
of <hi>Ermius,</hi> which have a ſtyle majeſtical and rough, he did not judg
with leſs exquiſiteneſs of the ageeable Comedies which <hi>Terence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to compoſe at that time, and us'd to bring to him himſelf, and
which had a certain air ſo eaſie, natural, and gallant, that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
love them with an extream paſſion. But this was not all
the attraction of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s wit, to draw perſons of different humours
and contrary Nations to him, as I told you; for he allured even the
Greeks themſelves, who liv'd not at <hi>Athens. Polybius</hi> quitted <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi>
being charm'd by the reputation of this Illuſtrious Roman,
to come and be near him, and hath ſince begun (as no queſtion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60667:78"/>
you have heard) to write of the Warr which we have at <hi>Carthage.</hi>
But, Madam, I ſhould not have ſpoken thus largely of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s wit,
but onely becauſe he ſhews it at full view but to few perſons, and
ſhews to very few of his friends whatſoever he writes in Verſe or
Proſe. I will not be ſo prolix in commending his courage, ſince in
the recital of his life, you will ſee a thouſand evidences of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
valour; and I ſhall alſo forbear to tell you of two or three
ſingle fights he had at <hi>Athens,</hi> in defending the intereſts of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and his friends. Not but that there is ſomething extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and ſurpriſing in that which I paſs over in ſilence; for though
<hi>Scipio</hi> had not reacht his ſixteenth year, yet he got the better in
three combates which he fought with ſo much advantage and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that all the Swordmen began to make their reſort and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with him, as the wits had done already. But he might have
drawn more pleaſant advantages from thoſe which he gain'd in his
fightings if he had pleaſed: for his reputation joyn'd with his noble
aſpect, caus'd all the handſome perſons whom we ſaw both at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
and the other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> where we came to have a high
eſteem for him, and ſo great a complacency, that I have wonder'd
a hundred and a hundred times, how <hi>Scipio</hi> could live in <hi>Greece</hi>
without being intangled, and that he had no more but a generous
and reſpectful civility for ſo many amiable perſons. For nothing
is more true then that he never reſented thoſe agreeable agitations
which they call Love all that time, during which he liv'd after a
moſt perfectly pleaſing manner. But it was requiſite for him in a
ſhort ſpace after to forſake that calm manner of living; for news
came into <hi>Greece,</hi> that <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> having bin ſlain, his brother in law
<hi>Hannibal</hi> was put in the head of the Army of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi>
that he had already over-run a part of Spain; that he ever ſince
won all the places that he attempted; and that after ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
he prepared to beſiege the ſtrong City of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with the people of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We alſo heard at the time, that <hi>Regulus</hi> was gone to put himſelf
into <hi>Saguntum,</hi> and that the Romans had ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
to complain of the proceedings of <hi>Hannibal</hi> there, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the League made by his Father <hi>Amilcar,</hi> and renewed by
<hi>Aſdrubal</hi> his Brother in law, led his Army againſt the confederates
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> no ſooner underſtood what I have rehears'd to you, but he
felt himſelf inflam'd with a deſire of glory, and an ardor wholly
generous. So that the ſame day having taken order for all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations
for his journey, he departed the next morning to go
into <hi>Italy.</hi> My ſelf being a Roman of no bad inclinations, and a
friend to <hi>Scipio,</hi> departed with him, and we went to the Iſle of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthus</hi>
to ſhip our ſelves, becauſe we were inform'd there was a
Veſſel of <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> there in readineſs to hoiſe ſayl and return for
<hi>Sicily.</hi> But, alas! fair <hi>Nadalia,</hi> we were no ſooner arrived at <hi>Zacyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
(whoſe Inhabitants, without doubt you know, went in former
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60667:79"/>
times into <hi>Spain</hi> to found <hi>Saguntum</hi>) but we beheld all the world in
ſorrow, and learnt that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had entered that miſerable City
by aſſault.</p>
                  <p>They went yet further, and as people are wont not to intermix
in lamentable news any thing that may mitigate them, they told us
nothing of the paſſages of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Thomira,</hi> but contrarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
us; all were deſtroy'd by fire and ſword, and that they had
not ſpared the Prince <hi>Edeſcon,</hi> nor <hi>Lucius,</hi> nor <hi>Regulus.</hi> At this
news <hi>Scipio</hi> loſt all moderation, expreſſing a thouſand regrets for
this miſerable City, and in his agitations threatned <hi>Carthage,</hi> and
blamed <hi>Rome</hi> for not having ſuccour'd her Allies. But as ſoon as we
were imbarqu'd, the wind became ſo favourable to us, that we
ſoon arriv'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where chance caus'd us to meet with a man
who expected an opportunity to go into <hi>Greece,</hi> to bring us Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from <hi>Publius,</hi> and my Father, who commanded us to go to
<hi>Piſa.</hi> Wherefore we continued on our voyage, and the wind alſo
ſtill favouring us, we arriv'd in a ſhort time at <hi>Piſa,</hi> where <hi>Publius</hi>
gathered together all the ſhips he could, both upon the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi>
Sea, and that of <hi>Liguria,</hi> to paſs afterwards to <hi>Marſilia,</hi> and give
<hi>Hannibal</hi> battel amongſt the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would be difficult to repreſent to you the careſſes that <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
made to <hi>Scipio,</hi> though he endeavour'd to reſtrain part of his
tenderneſs, and to expreſs to you the joy which he reſented when
he beheld his dear ſon exceeding the relations of fame in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of his perſon. I ſhall content my ſelf with telling you, that
after <hi>Publius</hi> had received his Son in this manner, he gave him ſome
reproofs. <hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid he to him) if you have ſhew'd your ſelf ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
by coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> when you knew it convenient to ſerve
<hi>Rome,</hi> you are to be commended; but you give me no cauſe to be
pleas'd with you in coming without my order. For you ought to
know, I have the ſentiments of a true Roman, and a heart firm
enough to be able to ſacrifice you to your Country; and that if you
are generous enough to deſire to deſerve it, before you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
your ſeventeenth year, I am ſo to have you ſerve it, and to
command you to do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Publius</hi> pronounced theſe words with ſuch Majeſty, that <hi>Scipio</hi>
bluſht out of reſpect, and afterwards beginning to ſpeak; My
Lord (anſwered he, with a profound ſubmiſſion) having an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
belief that you would ſend order for me to come away; I did
ſo without expecting it, and was willing to arrive the ſooner with
you, to deliver you from the care of ſending into <hi>Greece. Scipio</hi>
had ſcarce ended theſe words, but the young <hi>Fabius,</hi> the young
<hi>Flaminius, Cato, Servilius, Lentulus,</hi> and ſeven or eight other young
Romanes of quality, came to do reverence to <hi>Publius,</hi> and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to him the ſatisfaction which they had in beginning to ſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him. <hi>Publius</hi> receiv'd them with all the civility that they could
deſire; after which having commanded <hi>Scipio</hi> to ſalute them, we
all ſaluted one another with very much joy and affection. All
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60667:79"/>
theſe young Romans were ſo raviſht with beholding the goodly
aſpect of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and obſerving a certain gracefulneſs in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and words, that they began forthwith to eſteem him infinitely,
and accompanied the careſſes they made him with a certain reſpect,
which their age, which was ſomething more advanc'd then that of
<hi>Scipio,</hi> might have in a manner diſpens'd with. But, Madam, not to
detain you with relating the cares <hi>Publius</hi> took to form an Army;
I ſhall onely tell you, that this Illuſtrious Roman having ſuddenly
and ſtrangely gathered one together, we departed from <hi>Piſa,</hi> and
arrived happily at <hi>Marſilia.</hi> There we ſoon underſtood from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>
who was come thither, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had beaten the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
which attempted to diſpute the paſſage of the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> with him, and
that he was preparing to paſs over the Alpes with an Army of an
hundred thouſand foot, and twenty thouſand horſe. Upon which
<hi>Publius</hi> ſent <hi>Regulus</hi> with three hundred horſe both to obſerve the
march of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and to diſcover in what places the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Army might moſt advantageouſly encampe. But for that
<hi>Scipio</hi> had learnt that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was wont to ſent forth parties, either
to pillage or to diſcover the paſſages; he came into my Chamber
the ſame morning that <hi>Regulus</hi> departed, and embracing me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
with a gladſome kind of fierceneſs upon his countenance;
Come, my dear <hi>Laelius,</hi> (ſaid he to me) let us go to horſe, and not
ſlip the firſt occaſion of drawing our ſwords, without putting our
ſelves into a condition of drawing them.</p>
                  <p>I had no ſooner conſented to what he propounded, and we had
no ſoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er taken our Horſes, but we ſpeeded after <hi>Regulus</hi> with
ſuch happy diligence, that our arrival was ſerviceable to him; for
when we overtook him, we found him engag'd with five hundred
Horſe of <hi>Hannibal's</hi> Army, who notwithſtanding his valour, had
totally de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eated him, if <hi>Scipio</hi> had not came opportunely to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p>But this Illuſtrious Roman whom I endeavoured to ſecond, was
no ſooner came up to <hi>Regulus</hi> in the head of his men, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſlew a valiant <hi>Numidian,</hi> who commanded the party of the
Enemies; and being afterwards ingag'd in the midſt of thoſe <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
he carried death and terrour where ever his dreadful ſword was
ſeen. At length we diſpatcht or put to flight the Enemy, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi>
teſtifi'd that he ow'd all the advantage to him which he had
gain'd; and all the Romans beheld this young <hi>Hero</hi> with a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more then men uſe to reſent in beholding perſons like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Publius,</hi> and all the Romans of quality, received us at <hi>Marſilia</hi>
with much joy, and very many demonſtrations of eſteem; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the teſtimonies of both they gave us, it was eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
what an extraordinary admiration they had of the young
<hi>Scipio.</hi> The Illuſtrious <hi>Publius</hi> was he alone that endeavour'd to
conſtrain himſelf, and not to ſhew fully how much he eſteem'd his
dear <hi>Scipio;</hi> but his eyes oftentimes betray'd that ſevere prudence,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60667:80"/>
in which there was obſerv'd now and then ſuch joy, and ſo many
tokens of tenderneſs, that we well perceiv'd that he who teſtified
by his words that he reſented onely a moderate ſatisfaction, really
reſented an extraordinary gladneſs. But how highly will he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
this eſteem and admiration? <hi>Publius</hi> no ſooner underſtood
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> marcht directly towards the <hi>Alpes</hi> to paſs over them,
and bring the War into <hi>Italy,</hi> but he ſet ſail, and aſſoon as he was
landed, beſtowed all diligence to give check to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
He re-inforced his Army with the remains of that of <hi>Manlius,</hi> who
had been beaten by the <hi>Gauls;</hi> and having alſo received ſome new
Troops from <hi>Rome,</hi> in which was the young <hi>Aemilius,</hi> brother of
<hi>Aemilia,</hi> he onely took care to provide for a battel. Accordingly
he paſſed the <hi>Po,</hi> and the <hi>Teſino</hi> in the head of his Army: and being
he marched towards <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> alſo was coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, it was not long before they met and encountred. At
firſt the good order and fierce appearance of our enemies, ſtruck
ſome terror into our Forces; But <hi>Publius</hi> confirmed them, and
made them go on with confidence enough againſt an Enemy more
potent in number, and made proud by ſeveral victories, ſacks of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the preſence of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Our Illuſtrious Generall found
his courage encreas'd the nearer he approacht ſuch an enemy; and
paſsing from rank to rank, embracing ſome, and encouraging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
after all neceſſary preparation; My friends (ſaid he) we are
to fight to day not onely for our lives and liberties, but alſo in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Wives, our Children, our Temples, and in a word, in
defence of the walls of <hi>Rome:</hi> for, you ſee, our Enemies are now in
<hi>Italy,</hi> the Pyrenean Mountains and the Alps are no longer between
us, and they have no more <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> to fight with. But to
put you in mind, (added he, addreſſing to thoſe whom he believ'd
to be timerous) that you are Romans, and that you are going to
charge the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> is ſufficient to make you ſee that you are
running to Victory. For have we not alwayes beaten the enemies
which we go to attaque? Have we not impoſed tributes upon them?
And have we not enforced them to ſeek our alliance? What have we
therfore to fear? Is it for that they have paſſed the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Hills and
the Alps. Alas! my friends, this is it which aſſuredly promiſes us vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
ſince we are going to charge forces, whom wearineſs and the
Ice of the Alps have half overcome already, and we are without
queſtion going to finiſh the conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Publius</hi> was ſpeaking in this manner, his generous Son
upon ſight of the Enemies, began to appear more admirable then
he ever had yet done; his heart (if I may ſo ſpeak) ſeem'd to quit
its ordinary place, and make it ſelf ſeen in his eyes, in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
in his action, and in his words; his aſpect became more firm
and fierce, and his aire ſuddenly high and imperious. Let us on
(ſaid he to fifteen or twenty Volunteers who were to fight together)
let us go ſhew <hi>Hannibal</hi> the difference there is between the Romans
and the Nations which he has overcome; and let us onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that Romans, and ſuch Romans as we, ought to die in the arms
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60667:80"/>
of glory, or take from thence the Crowns which are never attain'd
but by generous attempts.</p>
                  <p>He had ſcarce ended theſe words, but he fell in amongſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
with an unparallel'd impetuoſity; ſo that <hi>Maharbal,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the wing which we charg'd, was much put to it to bear up
againſt this furious ſhock. But being a man of unqueſtionable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
he quickly rallied his men which we had at firſt diſordered.
And ſoon after meeting with <hi>Scipio,</hi> they ſingled one another out
and fought, till they were parted by the throng that fell in upon
them. <hi>Scipio</hi> was then deſirous to find <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and ſo opening his
paſſage on every ſide with his ſword, he encountred with <hi>Magar,</hi>
whom he wounded and caſt to the ground; killing afterwards and
over throwing all that ſtood in his way. At length he came to a place
where he thought he might find the fierce Enemy he ſought for:
But, alas! it was in that place that we beheld <hi>Publius</hi> forſaken by
his own men, and encompaſſed with above two hundred of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horſe, and onely endeavouring to dye gloriouſly. We beheld
him all cover'd over with blood and duſt; he defended himſelf with
his ſhield, and kept off his enemies with his ſword, and being ſtill
ſeconded by ſeven or eight men, diſputed his life generouſly. But
this reſiſtance would have been nnprofitable, had not we come up
immediately to him; and yet we were not there timely enough to
hinder him from receiving a wound with a Javelin in the right arm.
This enraged <hi>Scipio,</hi> who ſuffering himſelf to be tranſported by the
violence of his reſentment, and cleaving the crowd with more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence:
Ha! Caitives (cryed he) Ha Barbarians! and without
ſaying more, he ran upon him that had wounded <hi>Publius,</hi> paſs'd his
ſword through his body, diſ-engag'd his Father, ſav'd his life, as all
the world knows, and perform'd thoſe gallant actions which have
been ſo much celebrated ſince, though he had not yet attain'd to the
age of ſeventeen years.</p>
                  <p>But when he caus'd <hi>Publius</hi> to be carried into his Tent, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
whoſe courage was upheld by the preſence of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s,
were contented onely to bear up againſt the enemies, and made ſo
weak reſiſtance, that they fought no longer but in their retreat.
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who was but ſlightly wounded, betook himſelf again to his
charge; but he could not get himſelf follow'd; wherupon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards me, and ſome other voluntiers that were with us: Ah!
<hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he to me) is it poſſible that we have not overcome?
Let us go, <hi>Laelius,</hi> let us renew the fight, and at leaſt be the laſt to
retreat from it.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid no more, but beholding <hi>Fabius, Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all three ſlightly wounded, who were retyring themſelves, he
ſhew'd them a body of Horſe ſtill fighting; wherefore all of them
ſpeeding up to ſee vvho they were, we beheld about forty or fifty
Horſe vvith <hi>Aemilius, Regulus,</hi> and <hi>Servilius,</hi> vvho defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
couragiouſly againſt above three hundred of the enemies.
Our ſuccour preſently rendred our friends the ſtronger; ſo that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60667:81"/>
                     <hi>Aemilius, Regulus,</hi> and <hi>Servilius</hi> being diſengaged, we all drew off
in good order with the reſt of the Army. But becauſe the Enemies
had loſt a great number of men, and ſo were not in a condition to
attempt any thing upon us; moſt part of the Volunteers left the
Camp to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and likewiſe a few days after <hi>Scipio</hi> and my
ſelf went thither, with <hi>Publius</hi> who was carried in his Litter, leaving
the Conduct of his Forces to his Lieutenant Generals, till <hi>Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
came to demand them in his place. The day we arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi>
I found my father at <hi>Publius</hi>'s houſe with an infinite number of
Romans who were met to await for <hi>Publius,</hi> and to ſee <hi>Scipio,</hi>
whoſe reputation had fill'd the mouthes of the City. <hi>Aemilius, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> were there with their Illuſtrious Fathers. We
alſo found there <hi>Flaminius, Cato, Regulus, Minutius,</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi>
who was but of obſcure extraction, but by the favour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and a pride ſufficiently fortunate was grown up to ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
In brief, all the Romans of quality excepting <hi>Sulpitius,</hi>
were this day at <hi>Publius</hi>'s houſe, as well they which had lately ſerv'd
under him, as they which had ſerv'd in <hi>Sicily</hi> under <hi>Sempronius.
Pyneas</hi> King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> a young and goodly perſon, <hi>Perſeus</hi> Prince
of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and ſome others of like quality who were then at
<hi>Rome,</hi> repaired thither alſo, ſo that the converſation was perfectly
handſome: for if on the one ſide the Romans of elder years ſpoke
of the affairs of the Common-wealth, the younger ſort who made
a company apart, entertain'd themſelves onely with the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of love and gallantry, which were occaſion'd by the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Rome.</hi> At which time one of <hi>Servius</hi>'s friends made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
to <hi>Publius</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> in the name of his friend, who was
conſtrained to defer his viſiting them; and as he was going about
to tell the reaſon where we were, <hi>Pyneas</hi> began to ſpeak, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
to <hi>Scipio;</hi> I find (ſaid he to him) ſomething very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in the reputation which you have gain'd, ſince the faireſt
perſons of <hi>Rome</hi> have not onely a great deſire to ſee you, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
eſteem for you already, and are deeply oblig'd to you. For
not to mention the fair <hi>Fnlvia,</hi> whom <hi>Servilius,</hi> whoſe life you
ſav'd, is to marry to morrow; you have oblig'd the Illuſtrious
<hi>Aemilia,</hi> and the amiable <hi>Attilia,</hi> by reſcuing their dear brethen,
<hi>Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Regulus.</hi> And the charming <hi>Popyria</hi> (added <hi>Flamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>)
has perhaps not a leſs obligation to you for the ſafety of <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We continued this converſation for ſome time, by which <hi>Scipio</hi>
and I came to know the eminenteſt beauties in Rome, by the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made of them: after which, being it was already very late, all
the company retyr'd. The next morning when we intended to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
our friends, it was told us we ſhould find none of them at home,
for that they were all at <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe, or thoſe adjoyning to his
to ſee <hi>Fulvia</hi> paſs by, who was to be lead home to him. Wherefore
having never ſeen the like ceremony; we went to ſee it at a houſe
whoſe windows opened directly upon the Gate of that of <hi>Servilius.</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:60667:81"/>
But becauſe, Madam, 'tis poſſible you are ignorant in what manner
they lead Brides home at Rome; I ſhall deſcribe to you in few words
how we ſaw <hi>Fulvia</hi> brought to <hi>Servilius</hi> at Rome.</p>
                  <p>There were ſix men attyr'd in a ſilken habit of Carnation, and
blew, becauſe theſe were the colours of <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>Fulvia.</hi> Theſe
ſix men carried this fair Virgin, who had on her head a Garland of
Vervain and flowers, which ſhe ought to have gathered her ſelf. The
Chair in which ſhe was carried, was adorn'd vvith a thouſand knots
of carnation and blew, vvhich ty'd together little vvreaths of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
On the corners of the Chair hung large bunches of Myrrhe
and Vervain, ſtuck vvith all ſorts of flovvers; there vvas alſo ſeen
a great Portal at the entry of <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe, adorn'd vvith an
Arch and Pillars of flovvers, vvhich vvas extreamly handſome.
But, Madam, perhaps you vvonder that they carry the Bride to her
Husbands houſe at Rome, and no vvhere elſe. It is eaſie to ſatisfie
the curioſity you may have to knovv vvhy this cuſtome has bin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht
at Rome.</p>
                  <p>Yet I ſhall not give you the account moſt of the vvorld do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it; vvhich is, that 'tis not ſeemly for Virgins to enter of
themſelves into the houſe of their Husbands. For, Madam, I ſhall
not do the injury to the Ladies of other Nations, as to ſay, that the
modeſty. I ſpeak of is peculiar to thoſe of Rome, and does not
produce the ſame effect in the hearts of the <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
But, Madam, to tell you the verity of the thing, this cuſtome vvas
eſtabliſht at Rome, only to renevv in all marriages the memory of
the firſt that vvere made there, as you knovv vvithout doubt, by
the carrying avvay of the Sabine vvomen. But to return to the reſt
of the Ceremonies that vvere obſerved, vvhen <hi>Fulvia</hi> vvent home
to her happy Lover, you muſt knovv that <hi>Servilius</hi> being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by all his kindred, and excellent muſick ſounding before
him, received his lovely Bride, and divided her hair vvith the point
of a Dart.</p>
                  <p>This Ceremony is done, to ſhevv that the cares of Marriage
ought to be divided; and vvhereas they make uſe of the point of a
Dart, 'tis onely in remembrance of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and to teſtifie that
the Romans when they wanted women, knew how to get them by
the dint of Arms. After <hi>Servilius</hi> had divided the hair of <hi>Fulvia,</hi>
as I ſaid, he preſented her the keyes of his houſe, he wiſhed that
ſhe were as virtuous as <hi>Tanaquil,</hi> and afterwards took her by the
hand to conduct her into a great Hall where the Ceremonies were
to be compleated.</p>
                  <p>All theſe paſſages I have related to you pleas'd me ſo highly, that
I fix'd my eyes unmoveably upon them, and gave them my whole
attention, ſo that I took no notice that there was a fair and Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Company in the windows oppoſite to ours.</p>
                  <p>For the divine <hi>Aemilia</hi> was there, with the charming
<hi>Papyria,</hi> the faire <hi>Attilio,</hi> and ſeverall other Ladies of other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60667:82"/>
of the men that were ſeen together with theſe fair perſons,
was <hi>Aemilius,</hi> the King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and
<hi>Varro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is moreover remarkable, that though my eyes were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
imploy'd too much to behold the fair company I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
yet <hi>Scipio</hi>'s were contrarily ſo fix'd in beholding them, that
he ſaw nothing at all of the Ceremonies that were done before us.
Indeed it muſt be confeſs'd, I was dazled my ſelf when I beheld
<hi>Aemilia;</hi> for you may well judge, Madam, that the luſtre of her
beauty hindered all the Ladies that were with her, from diverting
any part of that admiration which we gave intirely to this divine
perſon. <hi>Aemilia,</hi> therefore, being ſo tranſcendent as you have ſeen
her, and beyond the power of my Rhetorick to deſcribe, retain'd
the eyes of <hi>Scipio</hi> in ſuch manner, that this Illuſtrious Lover (for
ſo I may already term him) did not underſtand the Ceremony was
ended, but by ſeeing that fair perſon withdraw from the window,
and a ſervant take away a Cuſhion of Cloath of Gold, upon which
ſhe had lean'd: All the ſpectators did the ſame both on <hi>Aemilia's</hi>
ſide and ours, ſo that we neceſſarily were engag'd by being ſeen, to
ſalute her, and the noble perſonages with her, who return'd our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
at the ſame time. Yet I believe, <hi>Scipio</hi> would not have begun
the ſalutation, (his mind was ſo imploy'd) but when <hi>Aemilia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him, ſhe ſaluted him; and afterwards <hi>Pineas, Perſeus,</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi>
with the Ladies, did the like. <hi>Scipio</hi> was indeed very ready to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
himſelf and re-ſalute them; but he did it with an action ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
and agreeable, that all the Ladies turned towards the men that
wee with them, to tell them (as we underſtood afterwards) that
they knew <hi>Scipio</hi> both by his graceful aſpect, and that gallant aire
which they obſerved in him when he ſaluted them; and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alſo, that if all the qualities of this young Roman anſwer'd to
thoſe they already remark'd, he had with juſtice obtained an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
eſteem.</p>
                  <p>While theſe Ladies were ſpeaking thus, they departed from their
Windows, and went into a Hall, where we loſt the ſight of them;
upon which, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſtayed ſome time at the window, if peradventure
he might have another ſight of them; but he ſaw them otherwiſe
then he expected, for within a few moments after, he perceived at
the Gate of the houſe <hi>Aemilia's</hi> Mother, who was coming out of it
to go to that of <hi>Servilius,</hi> with <hi>Varro</hi> who led her; and preſently
after when he had ſeen her divine daughter appear, he would ſtay
no longer, but went haſtily out of the Chamber wherein we were,
without calling me. Aſſoon as I perceived his action, I ran after
him, and asking him whither he was going, to <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe
(anſwered he.) You are very exact (ſaid I to him ſmiling) to make
your viſits ſo ſpeedily. And you little obliging (replyed he) not to
make yours, till after all people elſe. I would not defer it ſo long
(ſaid I) nor yet am I deſirous there ſhould be ſo great a crowding
thither. Were it not time at this inſtant (anſwered he) to make a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60667:82"/>
complement to <hi>Servilius,</hi> undoubtedly there would not be that
crowding thither, which you fear ſo much. But (ſaid I again to
him) hear at leaſt what I have to ſay. But cannot you ſpeak (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
he) as we are going. Pardon me (anſwered I) and I
wiſh to the Gods, that what you will ſee at <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe, may as
little hinder you from ſpeaking aright, as I am troubled to ſpeak
in going. But (continued I) 'tis poſſible you will not have all your
mind about you there; for according to what I have obſerv'd, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
things which you never ſaw, affect you very ſenſibly when
you firſt ſee them. I mean (added I ſmiling) the brave Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
which we beheld now. And I very vvell underſtand your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
(anſwered he, endeavouring alſo to ſmile) but to ſhew you that
I am capable of doing a great violence upon my ſelf: I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
alſo the liberty of my mind, and chaſe out of it in a manner
the fair Idea, where with the gallant Ceremony you mean, has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
filled my imagination</p>
                  <p>You ſhall do very well (replyed I) if you intend to preſerve the
eſteem which the perſons we are going to ſee have already concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of you. Well, <hi>Laelius,</hi> (ſaid he, as he was entering into the
houſe of <hi>Servilius</hi>) obſerve what power I have over my ſelf. And
in ending theſe words, he indeed reſum'd that freedom of Action
and ſpirit, which he was unpoſſeſs'd of a few moments before; and
I may with truth affirm, that notwithſtanding the great multitude in
the Hall of <hi>Servilius; Scipio</hi> at his entrance drew the eyes of every
one upon himſelf, and perhaps the eſteem and admiration. He went
immediately to make his Complement to <hi>Servilius,</hi> and to <hi>Fulvia,</hi>
and the principal of her kindred, and having acquitted himſelf
with great gallantry, went to that place of the Hall where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were; but he was amazed to behold <hi>Aemilia</hi> yet more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
beautiful then ſhe ſeem'd to him before. For you muſt
know, Madam, in theſe ſort of Feaſts, they uſe to ſhut up all the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of day-light, into the place where the Aſſembly is, and then
light up five Torches in honour of the five principal Deities which
are invoked in Marriages, and an infinite number of Lamps in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the leſſer Deities, ſo that this kind of light being ordinarily
favourable to beauty, and moreover <hi>Aemilia</hi> having a certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
ſweetneſs which is not diſcernable at diſtance; and all this
joyn'd with the goodlineſs of her ſtature, and the gentle air of her
carriage, almoſt made <hi>Scipio</hi> loſe the reſolution which he had taken;
beſides that he fancied this fair perſon, who ſeeing him approach
riſe preſently up, as all the reſt alſo did, had ſaluted him after a
more civil and more obliging manner. But he renewed his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
both becauſe I was preſent, and he had engag'd to me to
keep his mind free, or rather becauſe <hi>Aemilia</hi> was preſent, before
whom he would not appear perplext, eſpecially in this firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>So that after ſome agreeable diſcourſes concerning the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Marriage, which was a ſubject that at that time offered it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60667:83"/>
ſelf, <hi>Emilia</hi> told <hi>Scipio,</hi> that he was arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> at a very good
time to ſee this Feſtival, and then demanded of him whether he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to not very handſome. I proteſt to you, madam (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) I never ſaw any thing ſo handſome, as what I have ſeen in this
Feſtival. But for that there are different ſorts of handſomneſs, and
different humours, (ſaid <hi>Papyria</hi> to him) you muſt tell us with
vvhat you vvere beſt pleas'd, vvhether with the comlineſs of the
perſons, or the muſick, or the gallantry of attire, to the end vve
may know vvhether you have had the ſame guſt vvith <hi>Emilia,</hi> or
<hi>Attilia,</hi> or my ſelf. <hi>Scipio</hi> being a perfectly honourable perſonage
(ſaid <hi>Emilia</hi>) vvill not be loath to confeſs that he judg'd <hi>Fulvia</hi> the
handſomeſt thing vvhich he beheld. Pardon me, Madam, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered
he) if preſume to contradict you, and aſſure you, that
<hi>Fulvia</hi> vvas not the handſomeſt thing vvhich I beheld. <hi>Scipio</hi> has
reaſon (ſaid <hi>Attilia</hi>) not to be much affected vvith the beauty of a
Lady, (becauſe he ſees fair ones every day) as vvith the pompe of a
Feſtival vvhich he never ſavv before. But that is not it, Madam,
(anſvvered he) vvhich moſt affected me. It muſt needs be then
(ſaid <hi>Papyria</hi>) that I have gained the cauſe, ſince there remains no
other part to take but that of the Muſick. Verily, Madam, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he) you have as little gain'd the cauſe; for that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me moſt, was neither the Muſick, nor the Ornaments, nor <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
but ſomething infinitely above them all. It is eaſie then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
it (ſaid <hi>Aemilia</hi>) for ſince it was neither of thoſe three things,
and there was nothing ſurpriſingly handſome beſides, it muſt be a
certain pleaſingneſs that ariſes from them altogether, which charms
more then any one of them is able to do ſeverally. But, Madam,
(anſwered he) as I was not very intent to behold them ſeverally, it
is difficult I ſhould have bin able to guſt that united pleaſingneſs
you ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> being very ingenious (ſaid <hi>Aemilia</hi>) it is not to be wonder'd,
if he does not declare himſelf; for in ſo doing, he would diſoblige
two Ladies, and oblige but one. But, <hi>Aemilia,</hi> (anſwered he) be
pleas'd not to make me ſo ingenious; and believe, I would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
confeſt the thing, if it had been mention'd what really
moſt pleaſed me. For my part, (ſaid <hi>Aemilia</hi>) I am in deſpair to
conjecture it. I believe you would be much troubled to do it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he) for I am confident, Madam (added he ſubtilly) you
could not ſee what I beheld moſt handſome. I was the onely perſon
that well underſtood the ſenſe of theſe laſt words of <hi>Scipio:</hi> for <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
began to ſpeak at this time, and <hi>Perſens</hi> and my ſelf being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
mixed in the converſation, it became in a manner general,
and yet very agreeable and pleaſant. In the mean while, <hi>Varro</hi> was
ſpeaking to <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s Mother with very much heat, ſo that we were
a long time at <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe; though theſe kind of viſits uſe to
be generally of no great length, by reaſon of the throng which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
happens in ſuch occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But at length, after <hi>Claudia</hi> had conferr'd ſome time with <hi>Varro,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60667:83"/>
ſhe aroſe to go forth, being followed by all our fair company; but
as I happened to be ſufficiently near her, I obſerved <hi>Varro</hi> retain'd
her by the Robe as ſhe was riſing, and heard him ſay theſe words
to her with paſſion: Alas! I beſeech you, Madam, anſwer me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
before you go.</p>
                  <p>The matter being very important (anſwered ſhe, bowing down
to him) you muſt give me leave to conſult about it with the perſons
concern'd: after which ſhe aroſe and went forth, as I told you. The
amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> would certainly have gone forth with her incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
daughter, if I had not with-held him and conſtain'd him to
content himſelf with making a profound to <hi>Claudia,</hi> and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that went with her, and only to follow the divine <hi>Aemilia</hi> with
his eyes. <hi>Scipio</hi> could not continue there a moment after this fair
perſon was gone, but was abſolutely bent to go away too, and told
me with ſome ſeeming trouble our viſite had continued long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and we might well go forth now, ſince all the world had
done ſo already. Yet, I ſee (anſwered I) the company is ſtill good;
nevertheleſs I will do what ever you pleaſe, and I will go (added I
ſmiling) whither you will command me, ſince the moſt lovely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the world is no longer here. I will not tell you a thing which
all the world knows (replyed he, as we were going forth). I
ſhall then go learn (ſaid I, ſmiling again) which no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
knows yet, which is unqueſtionably that you love <hi>Aemilia</hi>
more then all the perſons that ever you have ſeen before. Alas!
<hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) I beſeech you do not ſmile when you ſpeak
of ſuch matters. I ſhall do what you pleaſe (replyed I) provided
you do not require me to ſigh; for I ſhould be much troubled to
obey you.</p>
                  <p>And is there any cauſe of ſadneſs in what I have ſeen (anſwered
I, taking my way towards the <hi>Tybor,</hi> on whoſe banks we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to walk) and ought not I to be raviſht with joy, that <hi>Scipio,</hi>
who without flattery, is the goodlieſt perſon of all our Romans, is
become amorous of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who unqueſtionably tranſcends all
the beauties of <hi>Rome?</hi> What then do you find your ſelf, <hi>Scipio,</hi>
that can give you diſcontent! Is there not an equality between you
in point of greatneſs, of birth and riches? and if <hi>Aemilia</hi> has beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wit and virtue; does not all the world ſpeak of your rare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment?
and in fine, is there any reaſonable perſon in
<hi>Rome,</hi> that would not make vows to ſee <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemilia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
together, and the powerful Houſes of <hi>Cornelii,</hi> and the
<hi>Aemilii</hi> allied?</p>
                  <p>Alas, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he ſighing) you conſider not what you
ſay, or elſe little underſtand the divine <hi>Aemilia.</hi> How can you
think, <hi>Laelius</hi> (continued he with the ſame air) that a reaſonable
man ought to pretend to <hi>Emilia?</hi> Alas! <hi>Laelius,</hi> all is below this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
perſon; and you would certainly be of my opinion, if you had
well conſidered what ſhe is, if you had taken notice of her dazling
beauty, if you had obſerved her wit which is both gallant and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60667:84"/>
and laſtly, if you had remark'd a certain charm in her above
all <hi>I</hi> have mentioned, which I obſerv'd my ſelf, but am unable to
expreſs. Yes, <hi>Laelius,</hi> if you had admir'd all theſe things as I did,
you would acknowledg that <hi>Aemilia,</hi> the adorable <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ought to
look upon the pretenſions of the moſt worthy perſon in the world
as an inſufferable inſolence. You are tranſported too far (ſaid I to
him) for how Illuſtrious and fair ſoever <hi>Aemilia</hi> be, ſhe will one day
render ſome man happy; and you never yet ſaw any perſon ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutely
elevated above all others, but there has bin found a match for
her in the world. And you have alſo never ſeen (in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>errupted he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately)
any perſon comparable to <hi>Aemilia;</hi> ſo that you cannot
here infer, as they do ordinarily in the like caſes, where you are
ſpeaking of a divine perſon who is ſo farre above all that is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
beſides in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> pronounced theſe words inſpired to him by his paſsion,
with ſuch violence, that I was ſtrangely amazed his paſſion ſhould
be ſo ſtrong in its beginning; wherefore deſiring to moderate his
tranſports, I indeavoured to give him hope, conceiving no other
paſſion ſo proper as that to calm the violence of love. But as I was
repreſenting to him, that I ſaw no reaſon he had to frame occaſions
of trouble and inquietude to himſelf, and that I could not diſcern
what obſtacles could intervene to his happineſſe, and was by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
arguments indeavouring to compoſe his mind in quiet; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
ſome young perſons of quality approching towards us, which
were, <hi>Fabius, Flaminius, Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Regulus.</hi> Being united, the
converſation amongſt us was at firſt very agreeable, but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more a few moments after; for having met <hi>Cato,</hi> who
was walking alone upon the banck of <hi>Tyber,</hi> we employ'd our ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
againſt him upon a hundred occaſions at once to puzzle him;
and he having a very ſtiffe and impetuous wit, the converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
exreamly divertiſing.</p>
                  <p>But for that our diſcourſe at that time is of no neceſſity to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of my ſtory, I conceive it not material to detain you with the
ſeveral ſubjects of our converſation. But, to proceed, I muſt tell
you, that all being parted at convenient time, <hi>Scipio</hi> and I went to
the Palace of <hi>Publius,</hi> his Father, where I was conſtrained to Sup.
Which we had ſcarce done, but a ſlave of <hi>Publius</hi>'s came to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
me in the ear, deſiring me to take the pains to deſcend down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the low Hall where <hi>Minutius</hi> attended to ſpeak with me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an affair of importance. Being I lived in an abſolute liberty in
<hi>Publius</hi>'s houſe, I deſcended forthwith without being obliged to any
Ceremony; and there I found <hi>Minutius,</hi> who approaching towards
me, deſired my pardon for his coming to incommodate me at ſuch
an hour.</p>
                  <p>But ſince 'tis for a friend (proceeded he) that I am come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
a favour, I conceive I may do it with the more confidence,
and eſpecially from <hi>Laelius,</hi> who ſo well underſtands all the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of friendſhip. But not to loſe time (added he;) I muſt tell you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60667:84"/>
in few words that <hi>Varro</hi> is infinitely amorous of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and that
I newly received this Ticket from him which you may pleaſe to
read. At which words he preſented me one, in which I was much
ſurpriz'd to read theſe words.</p>

                     <p>If I was ſurpriz'd at the beginning of <hi>Minutius</hi>'s diſcourſe, I
was extreamly aſtoniſh'd when I had read this Ticket; ſo that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi>
taking this time to tell me what he had deſigned to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to me, he entreated me to embrace the party of <hi>Varro,</hi> and
to engage <hi>Scipio</hi> in it too. For though I have not hitherto done
<hi>Scipio</hi> or you any ſervice (continued he) and there be no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacie
between us; yet I hope you will not refuſe what I requeſt
of you, ſince no exception can be taken againſt a Caball, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of which is onely to bring about a marriage. I have ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for all ſorts of Cabals in general (anſwered I) that you
may pleaſe to excuſe me if I ingage not in yours: beſides, that the
end you deſign, is ſo different from the means you would uſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, that I think your project will be unſucceſsful. Moreover,
all that ſhall contribute towards bringing to paſs this affair by the
way you would take, will not onely highly diſoblige the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the <hi>Aemilii,</hi> but they will alſo contribute to the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>Varro;</hi> for indeed he would be in eternal puniſhment to
have alwayes a fair perſon in his eyes, whom himſelf had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unhappy, and gain'd by force (as I may ſo ſpeak) in ſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to affect her heart by his ſubmiſſions, reſpects and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
But ſince 'tis your deſire I ſhould mention it to <hi>Scipio,</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
I) I promiſe you to acquaint my friend this night with what I
underſtand from you, and to let you know in the morning our laſt
reſolution. In the mean time, <hi>Minutius,</hi> be confident I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
your ſecret to any whatſoever but <hi>Scipio.</hi> Becauſe it is unmeet
(anſwered he) to go about to force the ſentiments of others, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take it ill that you diſapprove ours; and provided, you religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
obſerve the promiſe you have made me, beyond which you
are not obliged, I have no right to pretend to more. Nevertheleſſe
(added he craftily) one of theſe two things muſt be effected; either
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60667:85"/>
that you gain <hi>Scipio,</hi> and be both of you of our Cabal; or that I
prevail upon the mind of <hi>Varro,</hi> ſo as to quit his enterpriſe. The
laſt of the two (anſwered I) is aſſuredly more eaſie and equitable
then that which you deſire of me; but however, I keep my ſelf
to my promiſe, which is to ſpeak of your affair to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and to none
elſe. I had no ſooner ended theſe words, but <hi>Miuntius,</hi> who appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
intended to go to other Houſes, took his leave of me, and
immediately after his departure, I went to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and lead him to
his Chamber; where aſſoon as we were entered, I began to tell him
of this new adventure, but without the leaſt ſign of wondering at it,
to the end he might not apprehend it as a matter of any great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But it did not fall out accordingly; for I had no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him the diſcourſe I had had with <hi>Minutius,</hi> and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Varro's</hi> Letter; but he teſtifi'd an extream trouble and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
at it.</p>
                     <p>Alas! <hi>Laelius</hi> (cryed he) how much were you deceiv'd, when
you conceiv'd there were no obſtacles to my happineſs. And I am
unhappy (added he) ſince in the ſame day that I am become amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
the deareſt of my friends muſt come and tell me I have a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and that a formidable Rival too, ſince he deſigns to engage
a part of <hi>Rome</hi> to act for his intereſts. If your paſſion permitted you
to reaſon aright (anſwered <hi>I</hi>) you would not apprehend the matter
as you do, nor look upon <hi>Varro</hi> as a formidable Rival, who takes ſo
unpromiſing a courſe to advantage his pretenſions. What know
you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted he) but ſome ſtrange fate may make <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
conquer by a way not ordinary, a perſon who is ſo little ſo? Juſt
Gods! (cryed I) what prepoſterous thoughts are theſe of yours!
Why do not you inſtead of reaſoning ſo perverſly, reflect rather
upon <hi>Varro</hi>'s Letter, which will unqueſtionably compoſe your
mind?</p>
                     <p>And in truth (continued I) do not you ſee <hi>Claudia</hi> would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
your Rival nothing, and that <hi>Varro</hi> has no hopes from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
inclinations of <hi>Aemilia?</hi> But you do not ſay (anſwered
he) that <hi>Claudia</hi> has not refus'd my Rival any thing, &amp; in ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
as theſe, who ſo refuſes nothing, ſeems to promiſe all. If you
were not ſtrangely prejudic'd (replyed I) you would ſay that in
theſe occaſions, who ſo promiſes nothing, ſeems to refuſe all. And
it was never ſeen that a man was roughly rejected, and his alliance
but weakly refuſed. But on the contrary, there is alwayes ſome
temperament us'd in the matter; as ſometimes they tell you, the
perſon you deſire is too young: othertimes, they ſpeak of an other
match from which ſhe is not yet wholly diſ-engag'd; and in brief,
they find out a hundred pretexts which are not diſobliging to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
you what you deſire. But you cannot ſay (anſwered he) that
<hi>Claudia</hi> has uſed any ſuch like pretext. No more can you (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
I) that ſhe has not, or that ſhe has bin favourable to a man
who ſees himſelf conſtrain'd to have recourſe to the laſt remedies;
and after all, you ſee your Rival declares expreſly, he can hope no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60667:85"/>
from the favour of his Miſtreſs; what reaſon therefore have
you to afflict your ſelf? This indeed makes not much to my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(anſwered he) but yet I apprehend not ſo much ſweetneſs
therein as you do; for ſince <hi>Varro,</hi> who is infinitely ingenious, and
has made a thouſand converſations with <hi>Aemilia,</hi> judges nothing
to be expected from her favour, what can <hi>Scipio</hi> hope? How? (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
I) would you that <hi>Varro</hi> ſhould have made any impreſſion
upon the heart of <hi>Aemilia?</hi> or would you have me make your
Panegyrick, and ſay that <hi>Scipio</hi> may obtain that which <hi>Varro</hi> has
fail'd of?</p>
                     <p>Ah! cruel friend, (cryed he) why do you uſe ſuch perplexing
expreſſions? Becauſe (anſwered I) you imploy your wit onely to
frame torments to your ſelf, and complain that 'twas your friend
who advertis'd you that you had a Rival, inſtead of rendring thanks
to the Gods for the diſcovery made to you of a contrivance againſt
your Miſtreſs. Quiet your mind therefore, I beſeech you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of buſying your ſelf about fancies to increaſe your trouble, let
us conſider what anſwer we muſt give <hi>Minutius.</hi> Theſe will be no
difficulty in giving him an anſwer (ſaid <hi>Scipio.</hi>) For we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do but to break his deſign, which equally ſtrikes both at
virtue and <hi>Aemimila.</hi> But that which I find a little perplexing is,
that I am unreſolved whether I ought to advertiſe <hi>Emilia</hi> of it, or
whether, without engaging for in the affair, I ought to endeavour
to perſwade <hi>Varro</hi> to deſiſt from his enterpriſe; or in caſe he reſolve
to proſecute it, to oppoſe him with my friends, and either to be-break
it, or or dye generouſly.</p>
                     <p>But I believe, (added he) this laſt courſe will be that I muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
for I conceive we ought not to divulge a thing told us in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
before having endeavour'd to redreſs'd it, and moreover, I
believe it were better to ſerve <hi>Emilia</hi> without bringing her parents
into danger, whether we ſerve her by hidde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> means, or by uſing
open force. I am of your opinion (anſwered I) although I know if
we ſhould chance to periſh in our enterpriſe, we ſhould be blam'd
for not having rendred our party ſtronger, by diſcovering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the perſons concern'd. But for that the perſons who would
blame us in ſuch manner, are certainly onely ſuch people as never
judge of things but by the events; we ought as little to ſtand upon
the gaining of their eſteem, as the fore-ſeeing what may happen.
For after all, great prudence ought not in my jugdment to be the
grand virtue of young perſons. Wherefore without further debate,
let us expect to take the beſt expedients we can to morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we come to confer with <hi>Minutius,</hi> and learn his utmoſt
reſolutions. In the mean time (added he) it is requiſite for us to
betake our ſelves to our lodgings; and I would have you conſider
when you are at your reſt, whether, if you have a Rival, you ought
to fear the power of his birth and his virtue; and ending theſe
words, I went forth out of his Chamber without expecting his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and retyr'd into my ovvn, vvhere I paſs'd the night vvith
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60667:86"/>
more quiet then <hi>Scipio.</hi> The next morning aſſoon as it was day, he
came into my Chamber, and being ſeated upon my Bed-ſide, would
not at firſt ſpeak concerning <hi>Aemilia,</hi> but began to ſet upon me for
my ſloathfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>I apprehended the matter ſo pleaſantly, that indeed it inſpired me
with cheerfulneſs; ſo that looking towards him, you believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt (ſaid I) 'tis very late, becauſe perhaps 'tis a long time you
wak'd. But do not deceive your ſelf, and think not 'tis the Sun
which cauſes you to riſe ſo early, that makes it day to us. Alas! I
beſeech you (anſwered he) let us diſcourſe ſeriouſly. I do ſo (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
I, affecting to ſeem ſerious) and for confirmation of what I
ſay, I will prove that in good Morality, you are injurious in waking
me, and that a friend ought not like a Miſtreſs, diſturbe the reſt of a
perſon that loves him.</p>
                     <p>You are ſo little ſerious this morning, <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he) that I
know not well what to ſay to to you. And you ſo much (anſwered
I) that I know not well what courſe to take to make you lay aſide
your ſerious humour. Provided (replyed he) you do not require
me to diſcard that which you think makes me ſerious; I find my ſelf
incli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nable to ſatisfie you, and to regulate my ſentiments as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
But, <hi>Laelius,</hi> require nothing further; and not imagine as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ordinarily do, that you ought to oppoſe a paſſion that is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the breaſt of a friend, and that to encourage it, would be like
giving weapons to one that is frantick. For, in brief, <hi>Laelius,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you, that <hi>Aemilia,</hi> the adorable <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ſhall alwayes raign
abſolutely in my heart, and that I will wear during my life, the
bonds of hers which I find upon me; for they ſeem to me ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo charming and precious, that I eſteem them above all the
Crowns in the world. Ah! dear friend (added he) I little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
and you are ſtill ignorant, wherein conſiſts a true and
lively pleaſure; ſince you have not yet reſented thoſe motions of
tenderneſs which a fair perſon excites in our hearts when ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues
them to her dominion; ſince you have not reſented that lively
joy, nor thoſe ſweet fears which acompanie the love and reſpect
of a paſſionte heart; and in brief, ſince you know not that that
which is called inquietude, melancholly and muſing in a Lover, has
a thouſand charmes above thoſe which men at libertie ſtile ſolid
pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>This ſubject, Madam, ſeem'd ſo pleaſing and copious to <hi>Scipio,</hi>
that he would further have purſu'd his diſcourſe, had not one com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to give us notice that <hi>Minutius</hi> deſired to ſee us. As ſoon as he was
come into our Chamber, and the civilities were paſs'd on all ſides;
he at firſt beheld us as if he intended to read our reſolutions in our
countenances; and preſently after; what may I expect you will do,
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he) in this affair? We will do all (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Scipio,</hi> that virtue requires us to do; that is, neither <hi>Laelius</hi> nor
<hi>Scipio</hi> will engage in a partie againſt one of the moſt illuſtrious
Houſes of <hi>Rome;</hi> and you muſt either perſwade <hi>Varro</hi> to make uſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60667:86"/>
of his for the benefit of the Common-wealth, or unlooſe your ſelf
from his intereſts, to joyn with perſons of none but honourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tententions.
For, <hi>Minutius</hi> (continued he) you were a Roman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you were <hi>Varro's</hi> friend, and ſo you are oblig'd to prefer the
intereſts of <hi>Rome</hi> before thoſe of your friend, and even to oppoſe
any wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſoever that goes about to diſturb the publique Peace and
commit violences in the City. What you ſay, is ſo rational (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Minutius</hi>) that it would be injuſtice not to follow your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and therefore I engage my word to you, that <hi>Varro</hi> ſhall
ſerve himſelf of other means to attain the happineſs he aſpires too.
Theſe laſt words caus'd <hi>Scipio</hi> to bluſh, which yet was not obſerv'd
by <hi>Minutius;</hi> for at the ſame time he was bethinking handſomely
to change the matter of the converſation, and to ſpeak no more of
a buſineſs which was not very advantageous to his friend. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
he fell to ſpeak of many perſons of quality whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
he deſcrib'd to us; he alſo inform'd us of the intereſts of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
which he had obſerv'd in ſeverall parts of the City, and all
this with ſo much wit and freedom of mind, that we believ'd he
was no longer in ſuſpence and unſatisfi'd. After which <hi>Minutius</hi> left
us to go to <hi>Publius,</hi> and I prepar'd my ſelf to go to my father,
though <hi>Scipio</hi> very urgently oppos'd it, and would not permit me
till I had promiſed to attend for him there, to go and paſs the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
with <hi>Aemilia,</hi> to whoſe houſe accordingly we went, where
the converſation was indeed very agreeable.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſpoke leſſer then he was accuſtom'd; for he fix'd
his eyes ſo conſtanly in beholding <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and his countenance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
ſo many tokens of an inward joy which he reſented, that
though I had not known the ſecret of his heart, yet I ſhould have
poſſibly ſuſpected ſomething extraordinary by his aſpect. Beſides,
he appear'd ſo ſatisfi'd, that I have ſince wonder'd it was not then
obſerv'd he was amorous; for I believe, nothing but the preſence
of the perſon beloved could cauſe ſo lively a joy. Not but that his
attention and his joy was often intterrupted by a hundred things
ſpoken to his advantage, and of which he was deſirous to break off
the continuance, which was a diſpleaſure that befell him at ſeverall
times; for though <hi>Aemilia</hi> and the perſons that were with her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the world perfectly, and were not ignorant, that 'tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubleſome in a companie, when great praiſes are given to a
perſon that is preſent; yet they thought themſelves powerfully
conſtain'd to extol <hi>Scipio,</hi> both for that his brave actions were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
celebrated every where, and becauſe they had bin very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to moſt part of the perſons of qualitie in <hi>Rome.</hi> Indeed
<hi>Scipio</hi> was not ſo much perplex'd, as he would have bin, if <hi>Aemilia,
Fabius, Cato</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> had bin that day with <hi>Aemilia,</hi> they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bin witneſſes of his glorie, and importunately oblig'd to him.
But for that they were gone into the Country, to a Houſe of <hi>Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius's.
Scipio</hi> was without doubt delivered from a part of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60667:87"/>
and that which hindered him from reſenting greater diſguſt,
at what he heard was the civility of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and ſome gentle and
obliging words which that fair perſon expreſs'd concerning him,
in mentioning his preſerving and reſcuing <hi>Aemilius:</hi> So true is it,
that the joy which the perſon belov'd excites, is pure and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>At our departure from thence, I was alſo conſtain'd to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<hi>Scipio</hi> this night to the houſe of his father <hi>Publius,</hi> that I
might here the reflexions upon the fore-paſt afternoon: But our
converſation was interrupted by the arrival of his young brother,
whom <hi>Publius</hi> had ſent for from <hi>Greece;</hi> ſo that we could not
have time then to ſpeak of <hi>Aemilia.</hi> But, Madam, admire I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, the capriciouſneſs of fortune. The young <hi>Scipio</hi> ſeeming
a lovely and ſprightly youth, I began to ſet upon him, and told
him the Ladies and the Carthaginians would have no great cauſe to
be glad of his arrival. For if I be not deceived, (continued I)
you have an aſpect that promiſes you will be undoubtedly both in
Love and and War. As for War (anſwered he) I ſhall betake my
ſelf to that aſſoon as I can; for I conceive at firſt, there is no more
required then to obey: But for Love, I ſhall defend my ſelf from
it a long time; for beſides that, 'tis a troubleſome thing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in, I think I am yet to ſeek how to manage it. The matter
is not ſo hard as you believe (replyed I) ſmiling) for love has a
Torch to give light to thoſe that acknowledge his Empire. That
Torch (anſwered he) gives light to few perſons; for I have ſeen
this day in the houſe of <hi>Papyrius</hi> by which I paſs'd, two friends of
yours, who have great endowments of wit and capacity, and yet
have need of the light you ſpeak of; they were <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> of
which the firſt is in love, and the other is his Confident, But it
was reported <hi>Fabius</hi> was ſo wiſe a Lover, that he never appeared
paſſionate, and yet he was charg'd this morning for having ſuffer'd
the ſecret of his heart to be known at <hi>Papyrius</hi>'s houſe, without ever
having given the leaſt intimation of it to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who is the perſon
he loves</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Cato,</hi> he was ſufficiently play'd upon with rallery, for
being the confident of a paſſion which he condemns, and intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the carrying on of an affair of which he underſtands not the
perplexities and the pleaſure; and that kind of addreſs which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learnt by experience. And indeed he declar'd that he had no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
for things of this nature; but he believ'd he might promote
the ſucceſs by mediating with <hi>Lucius,</hi> to accord the marriage of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
and <hi>Aemilia.</hi> For marriage (added he) being an affair, and
that very important, I conceive I ſhould have done no diſ-ſervice
by intermedling in it. Thus, <hi>Laelius</hi> (proceeded he) you ſee in what
manner this Torch gives light, or rather how love oftner lends lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
his fillet to bind them, then the light you ſpeak of to direct
them.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the young <hi>Scipio</hi> was ſpeaking thus, his Iluſtrious Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60667:87"/>
turn'd away his head, that he might not diſcover the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his countenance. But at length, deſirous to underſtand the
matter more fully: How? brother (ſaid he) is <hi>Fabius</hi> amorous of
<hi>Aemilia?</hi> Yes, brother (anſwered he) and if you have any intereſt
in the caſe, you may direct your courſe accordingly. As <hi>Scipio</hi> was
going to reply, <hi>Publius</hi> enter'd the Chamber, ſo that the diſcourſe
was wholly broken off; &amp; <hi>Publius</hi> began to expreſs himſelf in much
tenderneſs to his young Son, who did the ſame with teſtimony of
reſpect and reverence to his father. A little time after, my father
came to ſee the brother of my illuſtrious friend, and taking me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
home with him, <hi>Scipio</hi> was depriv'd of the hope he had to tell
me his ſentiments upon what his brother had related of <hi>Fabius</hi>'s love.</p>
                     <p>The next day indeed he came to me after dinner, when the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of an Alliance made between our Republick and <hi>Pineas,</hi>
King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> was to be ſeen in the Capitol that day; yet we muſt
omit that to go ſee <hi>Aemilia.</hi> But going at night to <hi>Publius</hi>'s houſe,
whither <hi>Scipio</hi> made me to accompany him, we learnt but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particularities; for <hi>Publius</hi> told us with a ſatisfi'd and ſmiling
countenance, that <hi>Illyria</hi> was become tributary to <hi>Rome.</hi> And I wiſh
(continued he) you had ſeen the Ceremony of the Alliance we
have made with <hi>Pineas.</hi> It is to be wondered (ſaid I to him) that a
Prince of ſuch accompliſhments and courage ſhould do what you
have told us. <hi>Lucius</hi> has ſo great a power over his mind (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) that he could have made him do other things then this. How?
My Lord (ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi>) has <hi>Pyneas</hi> made this Alliance ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to <hi>Rome</hi> onely by the influence of <hi>Lucius?</hi> There is nothing
more certain (anſwered he) and I ſhall amaze you more when I
have recounted you what paſſed in the Capitol not above an hour a
go. Know then (continued he) that after the ceremonies were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Pyneas</hi> deſired <hi>Lucius</hi> and me to ſtay till all the crowd
was gone; where being without Witneſſes, <hi>Pyneas</hi> walked
ſome time with us without ſpeaking, and at length ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to conſider that admirable ſtature of <hi>Romulus,</hi> which ſtands
at the end of the great Hall of the Capitol, he read the Inſcription
upon the Pedeſtal, upon which he bluſhed and ſigh'd, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
us, with an air ſufficiently ſad; My Lords, (ſaid he to us)
do not believe I have done what you have ſeen out of weakneſs or
timerouſneſs; 'tis a more noble inducement that makes me to act ſo,
and have not made this tranſaction but onely becauſe—he ſtopt
after theſe few words; and then reſuming his diſcourſe. Ah, My
Lords (purſued he) I know not well what I ſay, but my hand more
bold then my tongue, ſhall better expreſs to you the ſentiments of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi>
&amp; let you know for what reaſon he makes himſelf tributary to
the Romans. And you ſhall ſee with this illuſtrious witneſs (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, addreſſing to <hi>Lucius,</hi> and pointing to me) whether the manner
in which I have acted, be unworthy either of <hi>Lucius</hi> or <hi>Pyneas.</hi> End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe words, he drew a Paſtil out of his ſleeve, and returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the ſtature of <hi>Romulus,</hi> writ ſomething under that which he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60667:88"/>
had read; after which again addreſſing to <hi>Lucius,</hi> Read, My Lord
(ſaid he to him) read, and you you will ſee that <hi>Pyneas</hi> is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of elevation then of lowneſſe.</p>
                     <p>After theſe words, he intimated to us, that he could no longer
be there with us; ſo that after he was gone forth, we approacht
the Statue, and read with ſurpize what the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
You know there are under that admirable ſtatue four Verſes,
which ſeveral Nations judge too haughty; yet their loftineſs is in
ſome meaſure pardonable, being grounded upon certain predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have been made to the advantage of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make you comprehend how ingenious the manner was where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Pyneas</hi> expreſs'd his ſentiments, in which are altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
the handſomneſs of his wit, the greatneſs of his courage,
and the violence of his love, I muſt put you in mind that the four
Verſes I ſpeak of, and which ſeem to be ſpoken by <hi>Romulus,</hi> are
conceiv'd in theſe termes:
<q>
                           <l>My City ſhall rule over Land and Sea,</l>
                           <l>And fill all parts with awe;</l>
                           <l>And all the Cities of the world one day</l>
                           <l>Shall hence receive their law.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> to ſhew that he had onely done that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to his love which we had lately ſeen tranſacted, and that ſo
haughty an Inſcription had not daunted him, writ theſe four Verſes
under thoſe that I now repeat.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Although it ſhould rule over Land or Sea,</l>
                        <l>And fill all parts with awe,</l>
                        <l>Saw I not there the faireſt eyes i' th'world,</l>
                        <l>I'de not receive her law.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>You may well judge that <hi>Pyneas</hi> underſtands here only the fair
<hi>Aemilia,</hi> for he daily reſorts to her, as <hi>Lucius</hi> told me ſince; and in
brief, 'tis out of reſpect to <hi>Lucius,</hi> that he has made this Alliance ſo
highly to the advantage of the Commonwealth; ſo that <hi>Lucius</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi'd
to me that he had a great obligation to the King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> and
that he found ſome inclination in himſelf to give him his daughter,
provided he would bring a powerful ſuccour into <hi>Italy.</hi> How? My
Lord (anſwer'd I) is it poſſible <hi>Lucius</hi> can reſolve to marry ſo fair
a perſon out of <hi>Rome?</hi> It appears, <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted he) that you
are ſtill a young Roman; that is, that you have courage indeed, but
not yet a compleat ſoul, ſince you are capable of wondering a man
ſhould marry a fair and dear daughter into a forrain Country, and
ſacrifice her to the intereſt of his Country.</p>
                     <p>As he ended theſe words, and it was already late, we all retyr'd,
and <hi>Scipio</hi> was deliver'd from the trouble of hearing the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of ſo cruel a diſcourſe. And after having ſup, he made
a reverence to <hi>Publius,</hi> and aſcended up to his Chamber, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have ſome buſineſs to do there. You may judge, Madam, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60667:88"/>
I did not deſert him, and that he did not fail immediately to tell me
all his ſentiments. Alas! <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he to me) I knew I ſhould
meet with more obſtacles then you imagin'd. But (added he with
very great ſadneſs) I could never have believ'd it poſſible, things
ſhould conſpire ſo ſtrangely to render me the unhappieſt man of the
world. Was ever any thing heard or ſeen more cruel in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a paſſion? 'Tis but three dayes (proceeded he) ſince I ſaw
the adorable <hi>Aemilia,</hi> three dayes ſince I began to adore her: but
in theſe three days, the deareſt of my friends has informed me that
<hi>Varro</hi> is my Rival, <hi>Varro,</hi> who is the favourite of the people, and
who by ſome fortunate raſhneſs may cauſe an obſtacle to my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
Yeſterday I was with <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and I beheld that divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
more fair and charming, then ſhe had before appeared to me; my
paſſion received new vigour, and I faſtned my chains my ſelf; but
upon my leaving that admirable perſon, it fell out that my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advertis'd me <hi>Fabius</hi> was my Rival<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Fabius,</hi> whoſe birth and
merit place him above <hi>Varro.</hi> But this is not all; my father,
who has an infinite tenderneſs for me, being yet nearer then a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and dearer then a friend, tells me to day I have a Rival more
to be fear'd then <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Fabius;</hi> as if fate had ordered the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are deareſt to me, ſhould bring me the adventures which
are moſt troubleſome and tormenting. For in truth, <hi>Laelius,</hi> I ſee
<hi>Pyneas</hi> is a goodly perſonage, I know he is indued with wit, and
I have heard ſay, he has very much courage too, and a ſoul full of
high and noble ſentiments; But yet I ſee above all that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that he makes all things ſubmit to his paſſion, and gives a
fair proof of it, ſuch as can be given onely by Kings, and thoſe very
amorous. But, <hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid I to him) do you know that the King
of <hi>Illyria</hi> loves <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and that 'tis ſhe poſſitively that he meams
in his Verſes? Can you doubt it? <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted he) and could
<hi>Pyneus</hi> better expreſs himſelf then by mentioning the faireſt eyes in
the world? beſides, could he have given for any perſon but <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
ſo important a proof of his love? Would he have addreſſed to
<hi>Lucius</hi> in doing all the paſſages we have heard my father relate?
No, no, <hi>Laelius,</hi> it muſt not be doubted, and I ſee clearly enough,
my hard fate raiſes me up new Rivals every day, and new obſtacles.
Not that theſe Rivals and obſtacles can make me renounce the love
I have; but on the contrary, I feel it augments in my heart, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
I ſhal do things which perhaps my Rivals will not. In the mean
time, to neglect nothing, it is requiſite we retire, and either of us

deſign; to the end to morrow morning, according to your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or my own, I may reſolve what courſe to take to ſurmount

               <head>BOOK II.</head>
               <p>UPon the point of day-break, <hi>Scipïo</hi> entered into my
Chamber, and having wak'd me, Well, <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid
he to me) I have Rivals, but I reſolve theſe Rivals
ſhall ſerve to augment my glory; I will comport my
ſelf with an air that perhaps ſhall ſurpaſs theirs, and
leaving them to their ordinary methods of Courtſhip, I will do
things which aſſuredly ſhall not be unworthy the eſteem of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<hi>Aemilia.</hi> You will do well (anſwered I) in doing the
rare things you ſpeak of, but perhaps you will not do ill in ſerving
your ſelf of thoſe ordinary methods of acting with a Miſtreſs, which
you leave to your Rivals. How? <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted he) ſhould I
ſerve the adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> as they ordinarily ſerve Ladies? Ah!
<hi>Laelius</hi>—Ah! <hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted I) you have not all your ſoul
about you this morning; for ſhould <hi>Aemilia</hi> be more adorable then
ſhe is, were it fit to be leſs diligent, or leſs complacential? Would
you court her with fewer blandiſhments? would you offer her
leſs incenſe? In a word, would you take leſs care to pleaſe her?
You know, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) I would not fail in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
whatſoever: But yet I am deſirous to render <hi>Aemilia</hi> ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
ſervice, before I take all thoſe little cares you ſpeak of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am
not of your opinion (ſaid I to him;) and if I were a Lover, I ſhould
chooſe rather to begin with thoſe little diligences, then your grand
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60667:90"/>
ſervices. For thoſe aſſiduous converſations, thoſe blandiſhments
and complacencies; and in brief, all thoſe little diligences inſinuate
much more, and enter inſenſibly into the memorie, and likewiſe the
heart of the perſon belov'd. And in caſe ſhe ſhould become ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
as to ſtand upon her guard, yet ſhe will ſoon deſpond to make a
continual reſiſtance. Beſides, we hourly find occaſions to render
theſe ſmall offices I ſpeak of, whereas the opportunities of glorious
actions be rarely offer'd, there is not the like advantage of inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into the affections.</p>
               <p>And moreover, the luſtre of them ſerves as an excitement to a
Ladie to put her ſelf in a poſture to reſiſt an invaſion; yea, I paſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and think a Lady has ground to ſuſpect that a man who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
a grand action, acts more for his own glory then for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the perſon lov'd. So that, <hi>Scipio,</hi> if you will believe me, you
ſhall take all occaſions whatſoever to render ſervice to <hi>Aemilia,</hi>
without affecting onely to do great and glorious things; the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of which may be heavy and incommodious to a fair perſon,
upon whoſe heart you have yet made no impreſſion, and who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may have ſome kind of diſcontent to ſee her ſelf on a ſuddain
little over-oblig'd. You have reaſon, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) and if
I reaſon'd at firſt in ſuch manner, it was onely a certain ardor I am
ſenſible of which tranſports me; and for that I conſider'd my Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
as ſo many obſtacles to my heavineſs, I propos'd to my ſelf at
firſt onely generous attempts to ſurpaſs theirs, and fill'd my mind
with glorious enterpriſes. But, <hi>Laelius</hi> (added he) I ſhall follow
your ſentiment, and alwaies act with <hi>Aemilia</hi> according to the beſt
advantages to win upon her mind, not daring yet to pretend (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, embracing me) to have effected her illuſtrious heart.
And indeed, Madam, <hi>Scipio</hi> afterwards acted in ſuch a manner, that
he ſurpaſſed his Rivals in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>He was more magnificent then the King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> in Attire, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
and Horſes, and all parts of gallantry at <hi>Rome;</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
before <hi>Aemilia</hi> more prudent then <hi>Fabius,</hi> and even with
this difference, that it ſeem'd the wiſdom of <hi>Scipio</hi> was an effect of
the reſpect he had for that fair perſon, whereas that of <hi>Fabius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
rather an effect of his temper. But beſides all his gallantry
and wiſdom, he was more fierce then <hi>Varro,</hi> when it behoov'd him to
be ſo; and with this difference alſo, that the fierceneſs of <hi>Varro</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſomething inſolent, but that of the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but what was lovely and heroical. So that theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments
together, joyn'd with the goodlineſs of his perſon, and
the handſomneſs of his wit, made <hi>Scipio</hi> eſteem'd above all other
honourable perſons at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Aemilia</hi> her ſelf inclin'd to treat
him in a more civil and obliging manner then all the reſt that uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convers'd with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> enjoy'd theſe contentments with an extream pleaſure,
though ſometimes he reſented ſtrange inquietudes; for the ſame
beauty which fill'd him with joy, a few moments after gave him
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60667:90"/>
an extream ſadneſs, becauſe he lookt upon it as a thing ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the pretenſions of men, that he not onely da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his paſsion to her, but ſcarce dar'd to think he ought to love
her with hope of being endur'd, when ſhe came to diſcover the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his ſoul. So that this mixture of joy and inquietude which
he reſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ted every moment, began to alter his health, in which
all the world ſo much concern'd themſelves, that ſome came to me
every day to inquire the cauſe of it. Even <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who about this
time was pleas'd to honour me with ſome place in her friendſhip,
very obligingly demanded of me concerning it, grounding her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
intereſt upon the general, and upon the obligation ſhe had
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> as the ſiſter of <hi>Aemilius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however, Madam, this admirable perſon had ſo great a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſeem'd to me oft-times more ſatisfi'd and fair in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of <hi>Scipio,</hi> yet neither preſum'd he to mention his paſſion to her
nor I, as much friend as I was to him, to open my mouth to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it to her; ſuch a profound reſpect did ſhe, though young and fair,
ſtrike upon all that approacht her. And this reſpect encloſing in
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s heart all the flames that <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s beauty had excited there,
this Illuſtrious love became much more paſſionate, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eis'd with a kind of languiſhing, that made me apprehend
much fear and trouble. Yet he had ſome conſolation in this indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs;
for <hi>Aemilia</hi> happen'd on a ſuddain to treat <hi>Varro</hi> with ſuch
contempt, that <hi>Scipio</hi> had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing one of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rivals
ill treated, and he of them who had apparently diſcovered to <hi>Aemilia</hi>
the inclinations of his ſoul, it not being poſſibly one of <hi>Varro</hi>'s hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
that is, fierce, turbulent, and impatient, ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
violent paſsion in his breaſt out of reſpect, and as little to
be thought <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who never acts but very judiciouſly, ſhould
begin to treat <hi>Varro</hi> unfavourably, without leaving new cauſe to do
ſo. It is true, ſhe had one afterwards very notorious and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as you ſhall inſtantly hear. For intelligence coming to <hi>Rome,</hi>
that <hi>Sempronius</hi> would ſoon be in a poſture to march with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
againſt <hi>Hannibal, Pyneas,</hi> who had long before ſent to make le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
in <hi>Illyria,</hi> departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> with <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> to
ſee in what condition the forces were that were rais'd, which they
underſtood were upon the Frontiers. Upon which thoſe of the King
of <hi>Illyria</hi>'s Rivals that knew his deſign, were extramly perplext at
it. And the next day after their going, <hi>Scipio, Servilius, Varro, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi>
and my ſelf, were at <hi>Aemilia's</hi> houſe, with <hi>Fulvia</hi> and <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
alſo, where we began to ſpeak concerning Marriages and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
the preſence of <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and the departure of
<hi>Pyneas,</hi> furniſhing us the occaſion. Yet I conceive (ſaid I, after ſome
other diſcourſe) <hi>Servilius</hi> ought to ſpeak with pleaſure of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as theſe.</p>
               <p>I am of your opinion (anſwered <hi>Varro</hi>) ſince having married a
perſon whom he loves, the ſubject we are ſpeaking of, ought to be
matter of joy to him. You ought alſo add (replyed I) that he is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60667:91"/>
beloved by her, for his amiable bride does not diſown it. <hi>Fulvia</hi>
bluſht a little at theſe words, and as ſhe was going to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>Varro</hi> prevented her, and ſaid, he did not add that expreſſion
of mine, becauſe he judg'd it needleſs. For in my judgment (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he) a man is happy when he marries a fair perſon whom he
loves, though he be not belov'd by her again. Can you think,
<hi>Varro,</hi> (cry'd <hi>Scipio</hi>) a man can receive contentment in marrying a
perſon by whom he is not belov'd? Change your mind, I beſeech
you, and be not peremptory in maintaining an opinion which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be admitted.</p>
               <p>I know not whether it will be received by a great part of the
world (anſwered he) but I know well, that ſuch as are capable of
a certain delicacy of pleaſure which I apprehend, will not onely be
of my opinion, but will find more ſatisfaction in not being lov'd
by a fair perſon whom they marry, then if they were affected by
her with the higheſt ardor. This concerns you, Ladies, more then
us (ſaid <hi>Servilius</hi>) therefore I beſeech you anſwer for your ſelves.
I conceive then, ſaid <hi>Emilia,</hi> with a ſcornful accent) that <hi>Varro</hi>
ſpeaks very well; for in expreſſing his ſentiments thus, he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
ingages the world not to bring him in danger of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
to be beloved. Provided I may be ſo by you, Madam,
(anſwered <hi>Varro,</hi> much perplexed for having ſpoken in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and thinking to repair his fault by ſome kind of blandiſhment)
I ſhould not deſire to be affected by any other whatſoever. No, <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
(replyed ſhe with the ſame contempt) the delicacy of pleaſure you
ſpeak of, muſt be ſecured, and you need not fear I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varro,</hi> as fierce and ſprightly as he is, was extreamly dejected
with theſe laſt words of <hi>Emilia;</hi> ſo that endeavouring to compoſe
his countenance the beſt he could, and beholding that charming per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with a forced ſmile, as if to intimate to her, that what he had
ſaid was onely in jeſt. But, Madam (ſaid he) you miſtake the matter;
for you may underſtand my ſentiments are wholly pure and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
if I pretend to marry a fair perſon whom I love, and by
whom I dare not hope to be belov'd again. That term, dare, was
wrong placed (anſwered ſhe with the ſame air) but, <hi>Varro,</hi> ſince
I am not in the humour to examine whether your ſentiments are
pure and unconcerned, you will do me a great pleaſure to ſpeak no
more of theſe matters. But, Madam, (ſaid I to <hi>Emilia</hi>) 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
to impoſe ſilence to <hi>Varro;</hi> for ſince his opinion ought not to be
followed, it is requiſite that he change it forth-with; or after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſaid his utmoſt to confirm it, be convinced of his error by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
reaſons.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Varro</hi> ſhould not change his opinion (ſaid <hi>Attilia</hi>) there would
be no danger of drawing much of the world to be of his judgement.
The ſentiments of the multitude are not alwayes the beſt (anſwered
<hi>Minutius</hi>) and the greateſt part of man-kind is not perpetually the
wiſeſt. Should what you ſay be true (replyed <hi>Fulvia</hi>) yet there
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60667:91"/>
would at leaſt be in the kind of ſentiments, the ſatisfaction of not
erring but in good company. Beſides (added I) an error ceaſes to
be ſuch when it is generally receiv'd. And what will become of
our priority, if the ſentiment oppoſite to that of <hi>Varro</hi> be perfectly
good and generally receiv'd? We may examine the goodneſs of
it (anſwered <hi>Minutius</hi>) but as for being generally receiv'd, I ſhall
not agree to that; for in the Chamber where we are, the opinion of
<hi>Varro</hi> ought to find many defenders, ſince the Ladies who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ought either to approve it, or confeſs that they take pleaſure
in being belov'd.</p>
               <p>For my part, (ſaid <hi>Attilia</hi>) I ſhould take none inbeing hated.
But, Madam (proceeded ſhe, addreſſing to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
ſpoke her unwillingneſs to declare her ſelf) you ſhall tell
us your ſentiment alſo, if you pleaſe. To tell it you ingeniouſly,
ſince you deſire it (anſwered ſhe) I ſhall acknowledge that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the friendſhip, or the indifference of perſons that are worthy
of both, ought to be deſir'd; as they ſay, 'tis a pleaſure to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by a perſon that is commendable himſelf. But, Madam (ſaid
<hi>Varro</hi>) if an amiable perſon ſhould not love you, would you be leſs
ſatisfi'd, when you conſider'd that you did what you ought, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a lovely perſon, and eſpecially that does not love you, ſince
you would act without intereſt? There would be more genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
in that which you ſay (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) but I do not conceive
there would be more ſatisfaction. That generoſity (replyed <hi>Varro</hi>)
would cauſe the pleaſure I ſpeak of: but ſince you require I ſhould
ſpeak of a pleaſure that is more eſſential to the thing, I have onely
to tell you, that if you come to marry a perſon that loves you paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately,
you act as well for her as for your ſelf; ſo that this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
being divided, is weakened on your ſide; whereas if you
act onely for your own intereſts, you have the pleaſure of ſeeing
that all you do is done for your ſelf, and that you triumph over the
paſſions of a fair perſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when you act in this manner, you reſemble Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
who gloriouſly win a place that reſiſts; whereas they who get
themſelves to be affected by their little diligences, attendances and
complacencies, are like thoſe Captains that take Cities onely by
intelligence, or ſome other ſecret means. Moreover (added <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>)
in the deportment of a perſon that loves, you obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo obliging, that ſeems to diſparage modeſty, whereby you
are not ſo lively affected with it; beſides, that ſuch a perſon requires
at ſeveral times you ſhould perform certain duties to her, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſervices which ſhe overcomes according to the capriciouſneſs
of her paſſion; and ſo taking them as tributes which you owe
her, it is impoſſible you ſhould render them without regret, becauſe
you do with conſtraint. But upon the countenance of a perſon that
loves you not, you alwayes ſee ſuch a coldneſs and reſervedneſs
which increaſes modeſty, and raviſhes you with a joy beyond my
ability to expreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:60667:92"/>
I ſhall go further (replyed <hi>Varro</hi>) and ſay, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more noble in this ſentiment of mine. For either the perſon
we love, has wit, or ſhe has not; if not, you may eaſily judg there
is no great advantage in being lov'd by her; if ſhe has, and does not
love us, we have the glory of doing what we ought in loving (as
I ſaid before) and ſurmounting the greateſt obſtacles in the courſe
of our paſſion, which unqueſtionably are the inſenſibility, and the
ingratitude of the perſon beloved. And to ſhew you (proceeded
<hi>Varro</hi>) that what I ſay is beyond all doubt; let us examine friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which neareſt approaches love, and the name of which having
nothing in it but ſweetneſs, will not affright the Ladies, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it oftentimes under the name of the paſſion I mentioned, which
they conceive ſomething too untameable and tumultuous. Let us
ſpeak, I ſay, of friendſhip; and ſuppoſe, Madam (continued he, with
a hidden deſign, addreſſing to <hi>Aemilia</hi>) that <hi>Attilia</hi> lov'd you paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionatly,
and you did not love her; it would without doubt come
to paſs, that <hi>Attilia</hi> would take a thouſand and a thouſand cares to
pleaſe you, whilſt you paid her with ingratitude, and return her
cruel and ſevere words in acknowledgment of her blandiſhments;
ſo that it would alſo happen, that all the world would commend
the generous procedure of <hi>Attilia,</hi> and blame yours. For friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
which is an union not being poſſible to be built but upon two
foundations, and that which is between two perſons extreamly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht,
not poſsible to be other then commendable and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
You will be blamed, Madam, for not ſupporting it on your part,
and your indifference will augment the luſtre of <hi>Attilia</hi>'s ſincere and
generous affection. You will I hope permit me to leave you (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he ſmiling) to make the application of what I have ſaid, and at
leaſt in converſation to make you paſs from friendſhip to love; for
if you judge a friend to be ſo much the more generous in that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is not countenanc'd; why will you not judge the ſame of a
lover, whoſe paſsion being more ardent, merits more acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Confeſs therefore, I beſeech you, that my opinion is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
as you believed it, which is, that there is much ſweetneſs and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
in marrying a fair perſon whom we love without being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
for if I love, I act, and act with choiſe, yea with liberty too;
ſince at the beginning of my paſsion, I have power to determine
to love or not to love; whereas, if I am lov'd, I am without acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I onely lend a dead preſence (as I may ſo ſpeak) and in ſum, only
receive the tokens of an affection which I cannot deſtroy. I believe
(ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi>) 'tis poſsible to find either effectual or apparent reaſons
for all the things in the world; but this does not hinder but there
may be found others contrary, of more or leſs prevalence, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the juſtice or injuſtice of the ſubject they concern. Wherefore
you muſt not wonder, <hi>Varro,</hi> if you are told you are miſtaken in
your reaſonings.</p>
               <p>For did not you ſay, the ſatisfaction of a man that acted for his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60667:92"/>
own intereſts, was much greater then when he acts alſo for thoſe of
the perſon loved? It follows therefore, that you muſt confeſs you
love your ſelf onely; for it would be a ſtrange contradiction to
pretend that you love a fair perſon at the ſame time that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
acting for her.</p>
               <p>You alſo ſaid afterwards, as I remember, that your ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being ſhared by the perſon you lov'd, would be much weakned
on your ſide. Alas! <hi>Varro,</hi> you underſtand little of the nature of
love, ſince you are ignorant that this paſſion is ſo far from dividing,
that it unites all things, and inſtead of ſharing ſatisfaction, makes
you enjoy that of the perſon loved too, and ſo gives you a double
one. Then would be the time, <hi>Varro</hi> (ſaid <hi>Servilius</hi>) that you
might abandon your ſelf to the raviſhment of joy that was ſpoken
of, when you ſhould ſee your own paſsions excite the like in a fair
perſon, when you beheld your joy glitter in her eyes; and her fair
mouth ſigh for your griefs. This, <hi>Varro</hi> (proceeded he) is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
of pleaſure you ought to wiſh to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent; for we may ſay, that
he that is not capable of it, is uncapable of the higheſt ſatisfaction.
Theſe words of <hi>Servilius</hi> cauſed <hi>Scipio</hi> to bluſh; upon which I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
began to ſpeak, and that with ſome heat, to the end no
notice might be taken of the alteration in the countenance of this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious-Lover:
and addreſsing to <hi>Varro:</hi> If you ſurpris'd me
(ſaid I to him) when you termed that a divided ſatisfaction of two
perſons, whom you confeſs to be united, becauſe they love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
I was not leſs amaz'd when you compar'd the heart of a
fair Lady to a City beſieg'd; for I can fancy nothing more diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant.</p>
               <p>If we ſee (continued I) that the force of battering Rams, and
other warlike Engines, make breaches by which the Victor enters
the place beſieg'd; we ſee, on the contrary, a generous heart is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gain'd upon but by complacencie, ſubmiſsions, reſpects, and a
thouſand little acts which cannot be taught, but are daily inſpired
by love. We ſee, I ſay, a generous heart, that noble and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
place which is able to breath an air of libertie amidſt chains, is
ſo far from giving enterance to any whatſoever by violence, that it
never receives a conqueror but by the gate which it ſelf freely opens.
Nevertheleſs, though I ſhould have approv'd your compariſon,
yet you would be obliged to confeſs, that a man that raigns by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
cannot raign long, that he muſt ſtand in fear of all the world,
ſince all the world does ſo of him, that he is ready every day to ſee
his very Guards turn their Arms againſt him, and his ſubjects wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of being ſuch, ſhake off his tyrannicall yoke; and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it will eaſily be judged better to enter and raign by gentleneſs
in a place, and to be the lawfull poſſeſſor, then a ſevere uſurper
of it.</p>
               <p>As for the ſentiment of <hi>Minutius</hi> (ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi>) it will not perhaps
be better entertain'd, becauſe himſelf follow'd that of <hi>Varro.</hi> You
aſſerted (continued he, addreſsing to <hi>Minutius</hi>) that we ſee in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60667:93"/>
countenance of a fair perſon that loves us, ſuch a kind of obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that diſparages modeſty. But do not you know, that love is
alwaies accompanied with reſpect, fear and languor: I mean thoſe
reſpects which do not torture the mind, and thoſe ſweet fears that
delight the perſons who cauſe them, and thoſe languors which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh
the countenance, and give it an air infinitely affecting: And
not of thoſe—which you ſpoke of, which can have nothing lovely
in them, becauſe 'tis averſion which produces them. As for the
ſervices and duties you mention'd, which you imagine a perſon
that loves us exacts imperiouſly, your ſelf deſtroy what you eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;
for in ſaying ſuch a perſon loves us, do not you alſo imply,
that ſhe deſires nothing but what pleaſes us? and when you ſuppoſe
we love ſuch a perſon, do not you alſo grant that we do nothing for
her with conſtraint? In the diſtinction which <hi>Varro</hi> made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(continued <hi>Scipio</hi>) it may be ſaid he has not ſtood to his firſt
ſentiments; for I conceive, at the beginning of his diſcourſe he
deſigns to act onely for himſelf, and in the place I ſpeak of, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
that he ought to be generous, and that he ought not to
act but for the intereſt of the perſon loved.</p>
               <p>But to omit this kind of diſcuſſion, is it not to be thought an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
to love, and not be lov'd again, whetherſoever the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
lov'd be ingenious or otherwiſe? For if we love a perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wit and worth, we may without much arguing conclude, that
our engagement alone renders us unhappy. But we are much more
to be pittied, when a Lady of a ſprightly and judicious wit, is averſe
from loving us; for all the world wil have ground to conclude us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving
to receive that which a Lady that judges prudently of
matters, refuſes to grant us: Beſides (added I) for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the miſery, ſuch a Lady ſhould refuſe that which ſhe were
in ſome meaſure oblig'd to grant, namely to love him that loves
her. For indeed (continued I) for the Intereſt of my friend, 'tis a
peculiar grandeur of love, that all the Treaſures and Empires of
the World cannot ſatisfie it, but it muſt ſuffice it ſelf, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
heart communicate its flame.</p>
               <p>As I was pronouncing theſe words, I lookt upon <hi>Aemilia,</hi> though
without unſeemlineſs, and that fair perſon began to ſpeak after a
ſmile infinitely charming, addreſſing to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> at the venture of
ſaying nothing conſiderable (ſaid ſhe) it is requiſite for me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to what has bin ſaid concerning me, and to declare that the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is impoſſible that was made of my not eſteeming and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you. But though you had not that goodneſs for me (anſwered
<hi>Attilia</hi>) and ſhould happen not to love me, the reaſoning of <hi>Varro,</hi>
would not, I conceive, be the ſtronger, for in truth, I ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
my ſelf infinitely unhappy. But ſo far would your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be (repli'd <hi>Aemilia</hi>) from being noble and generous, as they ſay
it would be, that you would be accus'd of ſtupidity, if you could
perſiſt in loving a perſon, who in not loving you would aſſuredly
be highly unjuſt. For my part (ſaid <hi>Fulvia</hi> agreeably, bluſhing a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60667:93"/>
little) ſince it is lawful for me to confeſs there is ſweetneſs in loving,
it will be alſo lawful for me to ſay, that there is infinite in being
lov'd, and I wiſh I had ſufficient eloquence to prove it. You have,
Madam, (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) to prove things much more difficult,
and <hi>Varro</hi> has not ſerved himſelf of reaſons ſtrong enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
ſo excellent a capacity as yours. For <hi>Varro</hi> affirm'd (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) that 'tis more noble to love then to be lov'd; becauſe when
when we love, we act, and that with choiſe and liberty, having in
our power to determine to love, or not the firſt moment we engage
our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But to be lov'd, ſaid he, is, to ſpeak properly, to do nothing, but
lend a dead pretence, and receive teſtimonies of a paſsion that is not
to be deſtroy'd, which is not difficult to be refuted. For if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that loves, acts; and the perſon lov'd, does not; the forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the latter is much more noble then the action of the other,
ſince the inducement to act proceeds from, as well as the end of the
action terminates, in the perſon lov'd: As it is the grandeur of a
King to cauſe a thouſand perſons to act without taking the pains
to act himſelf, and doing that for his ſubjects which they are oblig'd
to do for him. But I have wondred more at that which <hi>Varro</hi> dar'd
to affirm, that 'tis in our power to determine our ſelves to love, or
not; and that to be lov'd, is to do nothing but receive the tokens of an
affection which we cannot extinguiſh: I will not inſiſt in finding out
a contradiction in theſe words, though it would be no difficult
ſearch. But if a man can love, or not love, a Lady that deſires not
to be loved by him, might eaſily give him powerful inducements
to reſolve not to love her; ſo that, contrary to the ſentiments of
<hi>Varro,</hi> it will be in her power to extinguiſh the paſsion that ſuch
perſons has for her.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Varro</hi> is excuſable for having ſpoken in this manner; for
he knows not very well what love is, ſince according to his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a man is able to determine to love, or not to love; and ſince
he is ignorant that our hearts are on a ſuddain engaged, before our
reaſon deliberates the matter, and we take the chains upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing whether we ought to wear or break them. But in my
judgement, <hi>Varro</hi> is yet more unjuſt, when he ſays with a kind of
contempt, that to be lov'd, is to do nothing, but onely receive the
teſtimonies of an affection that cannot be extinguiſhed. For indeed,
what can be more glorious then that deſirable impatience, of not
being able to hinder our ſelves from being beloved? What can we
ſay more magnificent of our Gods, then that it is impoſſible to know
them without loving and adoring them?</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, Ladies, how much <hi>Varro</hi> hath miſtaken the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and whether he has done well in going about to maintain an
opinion, which he ought never to have thought worthy to defend.
After theſe words, <hi>Aemilia, Fulvia, Attilia, Servilius,</hi> and my
ſelf, ſpoke ſomthing to intimate, that the diſcourſe of <hi>Varro</hi> had
made no impreſſion upon our minds, or at leaſt none that was very
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60667:94"/>
advantageous to him. And it now growing late, it fell out by chance
that <hi>Scipio, Varro, Minutius,</hi> and I went forth together; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
one another with looks that ſpoke no great kindneſs, as you
may well judge, Madam, we ſilently and unadvertingly went along
till we came upon the bank of <hi>Tyber,</hi> where we walk'd ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
all in ſilence; till at length <hi>Varro,</hi> whoſe nature is ſufficiently
violent, regretting what had paſs'd at <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s houſe, lookt ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
upon <hi>Scipio,</hi> after having bluſh'd two or three times. You
have had more aſſiſtants (ſaid he to him) then I at <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s; but
I do not deſpair, having an other party which perhaps will render
me happy in the manner I wiſh. For, I believe not (continued he)
a Lady of extraordinary merit, and whom I ſhould honour infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as I do <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ought to think her ſelf injur'd, if I take all
manner of courſes to marry her. But on the contrary, as there is
nothing better evidences the greatneſs of a paſſion, then the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
means which are us'd to ſatisfie it; I conceive, a Lady,
how averſe ſoever ſhe ſeem, would be glad to have great projects
and contrivances employ'd to conquer her; and indeed they bring
more glory to him, that ſerves himſelf of them, and to the perſon
for whom they are undertaken, then thoſe kind of little diligences,
ſlight complacencies and ſecret inſinuations, which being ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without luſtre, are alſo ordinarily without glory. You deceive
your ſelf, <hi>Varro</hi> (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) if you believe a Lady that were
of <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s humour, could approve ſuch violent proceeding, which
you term extraordinary courſes.</p>
               <p>On the contrary (purſued he) you muſt know that Virtue and
ſeemlineſs have conſtituted certain waies, beyond which all paſſes
for rudeneſs and irregularitie; and therefore a virtuous perſon
would be ſo far from being wrought upon by thoſe great projects
and contrivances you ſpeak of; or to ſpeak more clearly, thoſe boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
attempts and violences, that ſhe would perfectly hate a man,
who in order to marry, ſhould take your great courſes, employ your
grand projects, and make choiſe of your extraordinarie means. You
ill apprehend my ſentiments, <hi>Scipio</hi> (replied <hi>Varro</hi>) when you ſpeak
of boiſterous attempts; for what power ſoever I have in <hi>Rome,</hi> I
will never make uſe of it to do violence to <hi>Aemilia.</hi> You would
have done verie well, <hi>Varro,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi> diſdainfully) to have ſaid
before that fair perſon what you ſay now, though it had bin onely
to have ſetled her mind. For the houſe of the <hi>Aemilii</hi> have great
reaſon to fear the power of <hi>Varro</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> But, <hi>Varro,</hi> (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
he with a fierce air) you would do yet better not to ſpeak ſo
high of the party you have in <hi>Rome,</hi> but believe your ſelf not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of uſing it againſt a houſe ſo illuſtrious as that of the <hi>Aemilii.</hi>
For when all is done, <hi>Varro, Aemilius</hi> will ſpoil your plots at his
return; and if in his abſence you offer to execute any deſign not
conſiſtent with virtue, I will do the ſame that he would do if he
were at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It belongs not to you (anſwered <hi>Varro,</hi> bluſhing) to examine of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60667:94"/>
nature the deſigns I am framing, are; and I conceive you have not
yet bin long enough at <hi>Rome,</hi> either to make plots there, or to be
able to break them. And 'tis ſo little a while (replied <hi>Scipio</hi> with a
ſcornful air) that your name has been known there, that my name
alone would break the partie that you have form'd; and if this
means be too weak, I ſhall find others that will do it both more
powerful and more infallible.</p>
               <p>Thoſe other means you intimate (anſwered <hi>Varro</hi> fiercely) will
as little daunt me, as the pronouncing of a name, which ſeems to
me to have nothing myſterious enough in it to do great exploits.</p>
               <p>Theſe words of <hi>Varro</hi> made <hi>Scipio</hi> loſe the patience which he had
till then preſerv'd, ſo that ſuddenly wreſting a ſword which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
by a ſlave; Let us trie, <hi>Varro</hi> (cryed he) whether I can well
make uſe of thoſe means I intimated. Ending theſe words he drew
the ſword, and as <hi>Varro, Minutius,</hi> and my ſelf had ſeiz'd others
which were carried by our ſlaves, we had all four began a combate
which in all probability would ſoon have been fatal, if by chance
<hi>Flaminius, Lentulus,</hi> and ſeveral other Romans had not at the
ſame moment arriv'd in that place by a ſtreet which open'd juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, ſo that they were immediately upon us, and parted us. But for
that <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> fear'd leſt the ground of their quarrel ſhould
be known, they preſently were provided with pretexts, and alledg'd
their difference was occaſion'd by a diſcourſe concerning the affairs
of the Armie. And accordingly ſaid <hi>Varro</hi> (who was more capable
then <hi>Scipio,</hi> to ſpeak a thing confidently that was not true) I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
that <hi>Sempronius</hi> did very well to prepare himſelf for a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and that he would do better if he engag'd aſſoon as poſſible.
<hi>Scipio</hi> immediately contradicted me for the intereſt of his Father,
and endeavoured to perſwade us that <hi>Sempronius</hi> was unjuſt, if he
gave battel before <hi>Publius</hi> was perfectly cured, that he might be in
a condition to bear part of the pains and glory with <hi>Sempronius.</hi>
So that having anſwered <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> replied to me, we were
eaſily exaſperated; and <hi>Laelius</hi> being of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s opinion, as <hi>Minuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
was of mine, they became involved in our quarrel, inſtead of
being inclinable to reconcile it.</p>
               <p>This pretext of <hi>Varro</hi> ſeeming to carry ſome colour of truth,
becauſe the general diſcourſe of <hi>Rome</hi> was much after this rate, <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
who was ſomething more aged then <hi>Lentulus,</hi> deſired to
take up the buſineſs upon the place, imagining we had no other
grounds of quarrelling; ſo that entreating us to ſpeak no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the intereſts of <hi>Publius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius,</hi> he caus'd us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
him we would not, thinking by that means to avoid all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
conſequences, and ſo we retir'd ſeverally. In the mean
time <hi>Varro</hi> conſidering with what ardor <hi>Scipio</hi> had ſided with the
intereſts of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> did not doubt but that he was enamour'd of
her; and therefore perceiving he had to do with a Rival ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and moreover with a Rival that was conſcious to his ſecret,
he determin'd to beſtir himſelf to execute his deſign before <hi>Scipio</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60667:95"/>
ſhould diſcover his love, or <hi>Pyneas</hi> return with <hi>Lucius</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his. My Illuſtrious friend, on his part, reſolved to neglect
nothing; he engaged ſeven or eight of his friends to be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to ſerve him in an important affair, in caſe he ſhould have
need of them, and choſe out ten or a dozen of his Domeſticks,
whom he believed to be men of courage, not daring to make a
ſtronger party, leaſt the buſineſs ſhould be diſcovered. For being
not certainly aſſured that <hi>Varro</hi> durſt attempt in the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
to carry by force a Lady of great qualitie, he fear'd that if his great
preparation to oppoſe a pretended Raviſher, ſhould be known, it
would be believ'd about the City, either that he was ſufficiently
amorous of her to have loſt his reaſon, or was ſeiz'd with a pannick
terrour: Beſides, conceiving that if <hi>Varro</hi> intended any ſuch thing,
it would be onely by night, he thought he ſhould be ſtrong enough
to reſiſt him with eighten or twenty men in whom he might confide.
But for that it was impoſſible for him exactly to know the day in
which <hi>Varro</hi> would enterpriſe what he had projected, he was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alſo to make himſelf ſure of a noble relation of his named <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
who lodg'd near <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Palace, to the end if the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould happen to be in that quarter, and the noiſe of it heard at
<hi>Appius</hi>'s houſe, he might take from thence what ſuccour ſhould be
neceſſary. Thither therefore he went to acquaint him with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
but finding him not at home, and unwilling to ſtay he left
a Note conceiv'd in theſe terms, with order to be delivered to his
own hands.</p>

                     <hi>Scipio</hi> having written and ſhew'd me this Note, went from thence,
and afterwards as ſoon as night began to appear, ſent one of his
ſlaves, and commanded him to paſs to and fro time after time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Aemilia</hi>'s Gate, till an hour which he ſet him to retire, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſend others thither ſucceſſively, and continue this vigilance
all the night to obſerve if any appear'd there in a readineſs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing. But when it was told <hi>Scipio,</hi> that there was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſeen there beſides ſome Domeſticks of <hi>Lucius,</hi> he ſlept quietly
till the break of day; when he aroſe to go to <hi>Appius</hi>'s houſe, where
he underſtood his Note had been delivered to him, and that he was
gone an hour before into the Country. <hi>Scipio</hi> was ſomething trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60667:95"/>
that he could not ſpeak with him; but when at his going out
of the houſe he beheld the ſtately Palace where the adorable <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
liv'd; this fight not onely diſpell'd his trouble, but inſpir'd him
with a very ſenſible joy. But the aſpect of the perſon lov'd, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
one incomparably greater and livelier, <hi>Scipio</hi> awaited impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
the hour in which he might ſee the fair perſon he ador'd, and
accordingly went to her houſe to paſs the afternoon with her; but
he was ſurpris'd when the Porter of <hi>Lucius</hi> told him <hi>Aemilia</hi> was gone
forth with <hi>Claudia,</hi> and that by all conjecture they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home till night.</p>
                  <p>The amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> heard not theſe words without regret, and
being not able to remain longer without ſeeing <hi>Aemilia,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
reſolv'd to go ſeek her in all places whither he judged ſhe
might be gone. But this tranſport being over within a few moments,
he conceiv'd it not conſiſtent with decency for him either to go or
ſend to ſeek <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and therefore he bethought himſelf to ſend
to inquire for me in all theſe houſes, commanding the ſlaves which
he ſent into divers quarters to have tydings the ſooner of what he
deſir'd, that they ſhould pretend I was with <hi>Claudia.</hi> This was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
enough contriv'd; for it was very uſual for <hi>Scipio</hi> to cauſe
me to be ſought out, and not ſtrange it ſhould be ſaid I was with
<hi>Claudia,</hi> at whoſe houſe I was almoſt every day, as I have already told
you; ſo that by ſaying confidently I was with her, it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
demanded whether ſhe were in the places at which I was
ſought for. Nevertheleſs, all this diligence prov'd unſucceſsful;
and which was more perplexing, <hi>Scipio</hi> underſtood that not onely
<hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Aemilia</hi> were not gone abroad at all that day, but alſo
that <hi>Minutius</hi> had paſs'd the afternoon with them at their houſe:
for a ſlave whom he caus'd to watch about the Gate till they ſhould
return home, to the end he might come preſently and give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, told him that he did not ſee them enter into the houſe,
but beheld <hi>Minutius</hi> come forth from thence towards night. We
mus'd a long time concerning this adventure; but all we could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
thereupon, ſerv'd onely to perplex <hi>Scipio,</hi> who came at length
to believe that <hi>Varro</hi> had devis'd ſome means to win the mind of
<hi>Claudia,</hi> and that <hi>Minutius</hi> perhaps went thither to treat of an affair
on which this paſſionate Lover could not think without being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd.
Yet he did not ceaſe his former courſe of ſending ſlaves from
time to time towards <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Palace; but he onely learnt that at
ſeveral times, many came forth to look them in the faces and obſerve
them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Scipio</hi> made no great reflexion upon this laſt circumſtance, both
becauſe he believ'd it was the cuſtom to take notice of ſuch perſons
who in the night time paſs and repaſs ſeveral times before the ſame
houſe: but when he conſidered that <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Porter had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
ſpoken by <hi>Claudia</hi>'s order, and that in all appearance, it was
onely for <hi>Varro</hi>'s intereſt, he reſented a greater paſſion then I am
able to give a name to, much leſs to deſcribe. He paſſed the night
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60667:96"/>
without ſleeping, and the languiſhment which had ſeiz'd on him
ſometime before through exceſs of love, being now accompanied
with ſo deep a diſcontent and ſo many inquietudes, caus'd him the
next morning to ſeem as if he had bin a long time ſick. Aſſoon as
he thought it fit time to ſee the Ladies, he reſolved to go to <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>'s
houſe, which I abſolutely oppos'd, and repreſented to him ſo
undeniably, that he was too paſſionate to be able to make this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
without giving evident ſuſpitions of the violence of his paſſion,
that at length he ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded, and permitted
me to go alone and viſit that admirable Lady which he adored. I
found at <hi>Claudia</hi>'s houſe five or ſix fair perſons, whom I have not
hitherto mentioned to you, Madam, becauſe I conceived it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in the relation I am making, to inform you of all the fair
Ladies in <hi>Rome: Fabius, Cato, Regulus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> were there
alſo, whoſe preſence with the reſt made this day extreamly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<hi>Aemilia</hi> appeared to me even more charming, although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
the ſweetneſſe wherewith ſhe was accuſtomed to receive all
the world that came to her; I obſerved methought, a little melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
which from time to time ſhe could not well diſſemble. I had
an extraordinary deſire to go fit near this adorable perſon; but I
ſtaid a good time to do it with convenience, which I could not do
till a happy change fell out for my intention. For three or four La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of great qualitie, and ſomething advanced in years, entered
into <hi>Claudia</hi>'s Chamber, who led them apart to her own Couch,
and ſo left us to make a converſation which was afterwards ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more gallant and divertiſing. I did not omit then to take my
opportunity to ſpeak to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> aſſoon as I could, without being
over-heard by any perſon; wherefore turning my ſelf towards her,
Well, Madam (ſaid I to her) ſince <hi>Scipio</hi> and I were yeſterday
unhappy, may we know to day to cauſe of our unhappineſs? In
truth, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered ſhe) you would be a very ſtrange perſon
if you ſhould require me to anſwer your queſtion? Yet 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
you do it, (replyed I) for I am not in the humour (added I
ſmiling) to believe it lawful for you to do us miſchief, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at leaſt obliged to inform us why you do it. You are ſo little pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to day (<hi>Laelius</hi> replyed ſhe agreeably) that I know not very well
whether or no I ought to diſcourſe with you; Its very eaſie for you
to be ſo, Madam (anſwered I) who know not what an unhappineſs
it is to ſeek every where for the Illuſtrious <hi>Aemilia,</hi> without being
able to find her. You have reaſon (replyed ſhe ſmiling) to bemoan
your ſelf, if that be the unhappineſs you mean; for I look upon it
as very great and inſupportable. Ah! Madam (interrupted I) ſpeak
ſeriouſly, I beſeech you, and be pleaſed to tell me whether <hi>Scipio</hi>
and <hi>Laelius</hi> were concerned in the order that was yeſterday given to
your Porter, to ſay you were gone abroad. To ſpeak to you after
the manner you deſire (anſwered ſhe ſeriouſly) I believe <hi>Claudia</hi>
commanded the Porter that he ſhould give the ſame anſwer indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
to all that came to ſee her. Your Porter then is not very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60667:96"/>
(replied I) for I know all the world was not ſo unhappy
as we were. <hi>Minutius</hi> (anſwered ſhe) whom without queſtion you
intimate, was here before that order was given, and this did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its being afterwards given to all the world. 'Tis not, <hi>Laelius</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe bluſhing) but that I have underſtood <hi>Claudia</hi> has ſome great
cauſe to complain of your friend. How? Madam (interrupted I)
can <hi>Claudia</hi> believe ſhe has cauſe of complaint againſt <hi>Scipio?</hi> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Madam (proceeded I) you can no ſooner have told me upon
what ſhe grounds her complaint, but I ſhall let you ſee ſhe can have
no juſt foundation for it. 'Tis ſomething which I cannot tell you
(anſwered ſhe) for <hi>Claudia</hi> has not informed me of it; and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to you that I know nothing of it, you ſee I admit a converſation
with you, who perhaps would not paſs for very innocent, if I
knew your friends crime. 'Tis true (replied I) I am criminal, if he
be culpable. But it is more true, that I am perfectly innocent. As I
had ſpoke theſe words, <hi>Aemilia</hi> was drawn aſide to anſwer to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was propoſed to her; after which we engaged our ſelves
in a promiſcuous converſation. In the mean time I was deſirous to
ſtay till all the company was gone to juſtifie <hi>Scipio</hi> with <hi>Claudia;</hi>
but it was ſo late before they all retired, that I had not much time
to ſpeak with <hi>Claudia,</hi> though I had too much to hear a thing that
ſeemed to me terribly ſurpriſing. For, Madam, you muſt know,
<hi>Claudia</hi> after ſome other diſcourſe, told me with an air extreamly
ſevere, that ſhe wondered, a perſon for whom <hi>Lucius</hi> and her ſelf
had an infinite eſteem and kindneſs, one of ſo noble and glorious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment,
could be capable of contriving a deſign very
ſtrange and unjuſt. For, in brief, <hi>Laelius</hi> (proceeded ſhe) I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<hi>Scipio</hi> has too much intereſs'd himſelf in our domeſtick affairs;
I am told he has engaged ſome of his friends to make great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
aiming at the interruption of a marriage of <hi>Aemilia;</hi> but I
conceived he would have done better not to have medled with any
of theſe matters. Believe me, <hi>Laelius,</hi> Reaſon is not alwaies the
Miſtreſs of perſons of your and your friends age, and perhaps, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe, ſhaking her head a little) you have given us in a teſtimony
that however diſcreet and virtuous you are eſteem'd, you are yet
ſhort of that perfect wiſdom, which is elevated above all paſſions,
and have not abſolutely renounc'd all temerities of youth. I beſeech
you, Madam, (anſwered I, when I was recovered from the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
into which her firſt words had caſt me) let us examine the
matter, and you will ſee.—There's no great neceſſity of that
(interrupted ſhe) and I conceive it ought to be ſufficient to you,
that I underſtand it exactly enough already. You know it exactly!
(cryed I) No, no, Madam, 'tis impoſſible; you have without
queſtion bin ill informed, ſince you know not that <hi>Scipio</hi> has rather
oblig'd then offended you. You deceive your ſelf, <hi>Laelius</hi> (replied
ſhe) for though <hi>Scipio</hi> ſhould have believed he acted for my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in this affair, I conceive I were not concern'd to thank him for
doing ſo; ſince it does not belong to <hi>Scipio</hi> to make or break a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60667:97"/>
of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> nor to examine whether the Matches propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her be advantage or not. But as to ſatisfying you how I have
bin informed, I deſire to be excuſed; to morrow you ſhall ſee
whether I deport my ſelf with as much diſcretion and moderation
as is requiſite in a perſon of my age and ſex. Beſides, to tell you
ſome of my ſentiments, I take no pleaſure in ſpeaking of a thing
which I ſhall endeavour to forget, as well for that I ſtill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my ſelf obliged to <hi>Scipio</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> as well
for that I am ſtill ſenſible of much eſteem and kindneſſe towards
him. But <hi>Laelius</hi> (added ſhe, as ſhe was going from me) content
your ſelf with what I have ſaid, and be pleaſed to require no more
from me.</p>
                  <p>Leaving me theſe words, I was conſtrained to go away from her
houſe, which I did, ſo ſurpriſed and ſad with what I heard, that <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
who expected me with an extream impatience, cryed, aſſoon as
he ſaw me. Ah! <hi>Laelius,</hi> your aſpect ſpeaks ſome great unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but in the name of the Gods (added he) declare the matter
without concealment, to the end I may appeaſe <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s mind, if
ſhe be incenſed againſt me for any cauſe I am ignorant of, or that
I may dye if that adorable perſon forbid me evermore to ſeek her.
<hi>Aemilia</hi> is not at all incenſed againſt you (anſwered I) but I know
not whether it would not be better ſhe were ſo, and I had not that
to tell you which I am going to relate. Speak it out then, <hi>Laelius,</hi>
(interrupted he) ſpeak it confidently; and ſince the adorable
<hi>Aemilia</hi> is not incenſed againſt me, you ſhall ſee I will ſuffer with
ſufficient moderation whatever you have to tell me. I wiſh it prove
ſo (anſwered I) but I have not much hopes of it. For, to tell you
the matter really as it is, that having a true knowledge of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
you may ſeek the neceſſary remedy; I have onely to recount
to you the diſcourſe I lately had with the Mother of the Illuſtrious
<hi>Aemilia.</hi> And accordingly after this, I recounted to <hi>Scipio</hi> in full
I had heard from <hi>Claudia;</hi> whereupon this paſſionate lover ſuddenly
interrupting me. Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (cryed he ſorrowfully) <hi>Varro</hi> is then
agreed with <hi>Claudia:</hi> you had indeed reaſon to ſay, that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Aemilia</hi> were incenſed againſt me, provided <hi>Claudia</hi> were not in
the manner ſhe is. For my innocence would have ſoon appeaſed
that fair perſon, whereas the too great ſeverity of <hi>Claudia</hi> would
liſten to what you had to ſay in my juſtification. Oh Gods! who
could have believed the beſt intentions ſhould have been followed
with the worſt ſucceſs. Alas! (continued he with the ſame air)
who could have believed that <hi>Scipio,</hi> wholly poſſeſs'd with zeal and
reſpect, ſhould come to ſee himſelf the moſt unhappy perſon in the
world, becauſe he had the beſt intentions? and that a violent and
unjuſt man ſhould come to the point of ſeeing his crimes Crown'd,
and receiving a recompence for them ſo glorious, that the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of men would not dare to claim after the moſt important
ſervices and heroical actions? But on what do I amuſe my ſelf (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, after a reflexion of ſome moments, upon what he had
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60667:97"/>
ſaid) I content my ſelf with making complaints, whilſt perhaps
<hi>Varro</hi> is within a ſmall ſtep of being happy? O Gods! this thought
pierces my ſoul, this thought kills me. How? let us rather go
turn that fate upon my rival, and afterwards do things worthy of
<hi>Scipio,</hi> of my love, and of <hi>Aemilia.</hi> He was going forth at theſe
words, but it being already very late, I retained him, and ſo well
repreſented to him, that his caſe was not yet arrived to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
which requires the laſt remedies, that I forc'd him to await till
we had underſtood the matter more perfectly. I will expect then,
ſince you will have it ſo (anſwered he roughly) Yes, cruel friend,
I will expect; but know at leaſt, that what you cauſe me to do is
ſomething more inſupportable then the extreameſt miſery, Yes,
<hi>Laelius</hi> (continued he) the incertainty and ſuſpence in which you
detain me, has ſomething more cruel in it then abſolute deſpair;
for if you would leave me to act like a man that hopes for nothing,
I ſhould keep no meaſure, I ſhould obſerve no punctilio's of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
I ſhould deſtroy my unworthy rival; and abandoning my
ſelf afterwards to my deſtiny, either ſoon enjoy <hi>Aemilia,</hi> or ſoon
have recourſe to death. I beſeech you, <hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid I to him) ſuffer
not your ſelf to be tranſported in this manner, conſider whether
you have reaſon to ſay what you do, and to take up ſuch violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.
I am not in a condition (anſwered he) to examine all
theſe matters; I onely conſider that I adore <hi>Aemilia,</hi> that I loſe
that divine perſon, and that by the moſt horrid injuſtice that can be
imagined. But you know not (replyed I) whether <hi>Aemilia</hi> be loſt
to you; you cannot ſo much as know who could have diſcovered
your deſigns, and who has committed the injuſtice that troubles
you, and occaſions your complaints. Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) the
matter is not to be doubted of, none but <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> could
have known my deſign; 'tis beyond queſtion, they believ'd that
to oppoſe their deteſtable reſolution, I would imploy the aſſiſtance
of my friends; and not to ſeek further, it appears they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
gracious with <hi>Claudia,</hi> to have told her part of it; ſo that,
<hi>Laelius,</hi> my miſ-fortune will have it ſo, that <hi>Claudia</hi> is become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
againſt me, for going about to oppoſe a marriage which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
ſhe approves, ſince ſhe ſo ill interprets the attempt to break
it. And without intimating to her in what manner the marriage was
intended to be effected; 'tis certain ſhe has onely bin informed of as
much as was neceſſary to incenſe her againſt a perſon that would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it. But I ſhall ſoon make her underſtand by what fraud ſhe is
induced to commit an extream injuſtice, in abſolutely ruining a
perſon who never had other deſigns then ſuch as the greateſt
ſeverity would account virtuous, and gratifying one who contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a horrid inſolence againſt her houſe. Yes, <hi>Laelius,</hi> I will open
<hi>Claudia</hi>'s eyes, and afterwards let <hi>Varro</hi> ſee, that though I make
not uſe of wiles, yet I know how to diſcover them when they are
us'd againſt me, and ſhall hinder the employers of them from uſing
them with impunity. I ſhould never end, Madam, if I ſhould go
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60667:98"/>
about to relate to you all the expreſſions of this Illuſtrious Lover.
I could not wholly gain his mind; he was ſtrangely inquieted, and
found no intervals of being ſo: but when he judg'd it convenient
time to go to <hi>Aemilia;</hi> Let us go, <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he to me, let us go
juſtifie our ſelves, and make it manifeſt, that if our innocence be
perſecuted, at leaſt it deſerves not to be unhappy. But, <hi>Scipio</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
I, obſerving his countenance extreamly alter'd) I conceive
you are not in a condition to go and reaſon with <hi>Claudia.</hi> How?
<hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted he) can you be ſo unjuſt, as to hinder me from
going to <hi>Claudia?</hi> No, no, <hi>Laelius,</hi> I muſt go; for I conceive an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
perſon gives no great teſtimonies of his innocence, when he
avoids the preſence of the perſon that accuſes him. But, <hi>Scipio</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
I) if you cannot contain your ſelf from going to <hi>Claudia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
I beſeech you, that you ought not in the condition you are
in, to expoſe your ſelf to the danger of being ſeen by <hi>Aemilia;</hi> for
the air of your countenance is apparently changed, and the effects
of love, jealouſie, grief and choller, are eaſily legible in it. It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) I muſt ſee <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and I conceive
it not neceſſary to ſhew her a calm and ſerene mind, provided I
make her ſee an innocent heart. But, believe me, <hi>Scipio,</hi> (replyed
I) methinks 'tis a pleaſure to appear before a fair perſon whom we
love, with a gallant and amiable air, and I conceive it not very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous,
to ſhew her a countenance wherein appears nothing but
inquietude and fierceneſs, but the firſt wholly ſullen and ſad, and
the latter gloomie and clouded. But, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) I am
capable of all things when I am to ſee <hi>Aemilia;</hi> I will inforce my ſelf,
I will compoſe my aſpect; and if you diſcern inquietude and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in it, you ſhall at leaſt perceive nothing of ſadneſs and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>At length, Madam, whatever I could urge more to this paſſionate
lover, he was reſolved to go to <hi>Claudia's</hi> houſe, and ſee the fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he ador'd, evidencing to me that no attraction is more powerful
then that of a perſon whom we love. But when we arrived there,
we found all we had unprofitable; for inſtead of finding either
<hi>Claudia</hi> or <hi>Aemilia,</hi> it was told us they were gone into the Country
in the morning; but whether, or when to return, we could not be
informed. <hi>Scipio</hi> received this anſwer like a ſtroke of Thunder;
and beginning to think <hi>Aemilia</hi> was no longer in <hi>Rome,</hi> that great
City ſuddenly ſeem'd to him turn'd into a vaſt deſart, and he be
came infinitely more perplext and afflicted then he had bin ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
He then was minded to go and walk upon the Rampants, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
(as I apprehend) there was ſome ſatisfaction in beholding
the campagne, and ſome pleaſingneſs in breathing the air of the
Country, whilſt <hi>Aemilia</hi> did ſo too. But this contentment laſted
but a little ſpace, for he no ſooner conſidered that perhaps himſelf
was the cauſe, however innocent of <hi>Aemilia's</hi> departure, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
exteamly afflicted: upon which addreſſing to me, in relation
to his thoughts: Ah, <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he to me, ſighing) this laſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60667:98"/>
would have had ſomething more inſupportable in it then
the other, if I had contributed to it, although I have done nothing
but what I ought to do. For, let <hi>Scipio</hi> ſuffer the injuſtice which is
done him, let him ſigh and be miſerable; this is capable of making
me complain, and even of making me loſe part of my reaſon; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
my grief is in ſome manner comforted, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
'tis for the adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> I ſuffer theſe miſeries. But my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is incomparably greater, when I behold that divine perſon her
ſelf ſuffer, when I ſee her enforc'd to leave this faireſt City of the
world to go into ſolitude, and conſider, that perhaps <hi>Scipio</hi> is the
cauſe of it. Did <hi>Aemilia</hi> ſuffer what you mention, as an unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(anſwered I) you would have cauſe to afflict your ſelf; But
perhaps you are injurious to your ſelf, and at the ſame time you
ſigh, <hi>Aemilia</hi> is amongſt divertiſements, enjoyes the delights of the
Country, breathes the air with ſweetneſs, hears the birds with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
admires the enamel of the Meadows, and perhaps alſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
her ſelf in obſerving the innocence and ſimplicity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that make their uſual abode there; ſo that inſtead of lamenting
her ſelf, ſhe is perhaps raviſht with having left <hi>Rome</hi> for a time.
Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (cryed he) to what end do you tell me all theſe fancies?
How? (interrupted I) can you blame me for telling you the perſon
you love is not unhappy? You ill conſtrue my zeal; you ought at
leaſt to conſider that what I ſpoke was onely to ſatisfie, ſince I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to you that <hi>Emilia</hi> was already taſting the pleaſure which
ſhe is not yet in a condition capable of what would you have me
do. <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he, ſighing) I am unjuſt in blaming you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<hi>Aemilia</hi> were not perfectly happy at this hour: but, <hi>Laelius,</hi>
I am amorous, and therefore you ought not to wonder at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travangance
of my ſentiments; but you may know, that though
I am not lov'd by <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and dare not hope to be ſo, yet 'tis ſome
pleaſure to me to think ſhe is afflicted by leaving a City in which I
am; and I ſhould certainly reſent great torment in imagining ſhe
were now injoying all the pleaſures you have mentioned. In ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered I) your ſentiments are admirable well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
ſince in the beginning of our diſcourſe, the affliction alone of
<hi>Emilia</hi> cauſed yours, and now you tell me you ſhould not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
if <hi>Emilia</hi> were not afflicted, and that your ſelf would be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afflicted if ſhe injoy'd contentments.</p>
                  <p>Have I not already told you, <hi>Laelius</hi> (replyed he) that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous?
Why therefore do you, (who are not) require reaſons,
where in the jugdement of men that are free, there is nothing to be
found but fancies. Nevertheleſs (added he) you would eaſily ſee
that I have reaſon to apprehend things ſo differently, if you would
conſider the diverſity of grounds I have to do ſo; and you would
alſo better perceive that you ought not to wonder, if in the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition I am in, I afflict my ſelf with all things. I had rather
ſee (anſwered I) your mind a little more at quiet, and that to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
afflicting your ſelf in thinking on <hi>Emilia;</hi> you would paſs the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60667:99"/>
reſt of the day with a fair perſon to whom I ſhall lead you. Ah!
<hi>Laelius</hi> (replied he) my afflictions too much preferable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
which you propoſe to me.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, I beſeech you (anſwered I) that even for the intereſt
of your love, you ought to go to ſome meetings, leaſt your abſence
from thence during that of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> give cauſe of ſuſpition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
the paſſion you are poſſeſſed with. I ſhould give more cauſe
(replyed he) if I reſorted thither; ſince I ſhould begin to do it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s departure; that is, when I can no longer ſee that
fair perſon at her own houſe. But (ſaid I to him) the City being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
great, I would lead you into a quarter, where it is not known
that you have bin a conſtant frequenter of <hi>Aemilia.</hi> Then 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
for me to go thither to hide my paſſion (anſwered
he.) Wherefore, <hi>Laelius,</hi> you ought not to urge me upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
you alledge, but rather be ſo complacential to take the aire
here with me a while, and talk a moment longer concerning the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable
<hi>Aemilia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, Madam, I was conſtrain'd to walk ſtill with <hi>Scipio,</hi> and
entertain my ſelf with him about the charmes of <hi>Aemilia.</hi> But at
length it growing late, and time for us to retire, we beheld two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
handſome Horſes paſſing into the City at the Gate <hi>Capena,</hi> which
were lead by a ſervant. <hi>Scipio</hi> had no ſooner caſt his eyes upon the
firſt which was a dapple Gray, and had a very rich and remarkable
Saddle on his back; but he knew to whom it belonged; ſo that
looking upon me and changing colour; That's <hi>Minutius</hi>'s Horſe
(ſaid he) himſelf cannot be far of; ſurely he accompanied <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia;</hi>
and that which yet more troubles me, is, that <hi>Minutius</hi> would
not ride in on horſe-back, which circumſtance undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
ſome miſtery.</p>
                  <p>As he was ſpeaking theſe words, we perceiv'd <hi>Minutius</hi> indeed,
who was with one of his relations, named <hi>Metellus,</hi> and was in
truth very much troubled to meet us when he ſo little expected it.
Which <hi>Scipio</hi> obſerving, you muſt acknowledge, <hi>Minutius,</hi> that
you are much ſurpris'd in meeing us, where in probability we were
not to be look't for. Yet I am not at all (anſwered he, affecting not
to ſeem ſo) and certainly I know few things that are able to ſurpriſe
me. I know ſome (replyed <hi>Scipio</hi>) that will not ſurpriſe you, and
particularly the departure of <hi>Aemilia;</hi> for I conceive no man is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
with a thing he is not ignorant of, but on the contrary knows
even to the leaſt circumſtances. True (anſwered <hi>Minutius,</hi> very
much more perplexed then before, believing <hi>Scipio</hi> better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then indeed he was) <hi>Emilia</hi>'s departure has not ſurpriz'd me,
becauſe I knew of it, and moreover accompanied that fair perſon.
You declare this laſt circumſtance very ingenuouſly (replied <hi>Scipio</hi>)
for one that intended to conceal it by entering a foot into the City,
and who having accompanied ſo fair a perſon, ought rather to have
entered as triumphant. But after all, <hi>Minutius</hi> (added he) you
are too much <hi>Varro</hi>'s friend to be <hi>Emilia</hi>'s lover; wherefore love,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60667:99"/>
that affects myſteries, having no ſhare in what we ſee you do, you
muſt needs be too ſomething too much <hi>Varro</hi>'s friend, as I ſaid,
and perhaps you come from doing things for him which you would
not willingly give way to be inquir'd into. You may inquire what
you pleaſe (anſwered <hi>Minutius</hi> roughly) provided I ſerve my
friend, I ſhall little trouble my ſelf with what you judge of it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<hi>Minutius</hi> (replied <hi>Scipio</hi>) it would be well for you I had not
at all examined the matter, for you would not then (added he fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
have bin brought to make the experiment that <hi>Scipio</hi> is as little
capable of ſuffering, as doing an injuſtice. Your ſelf ſhall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(anſwered <hi>Minutius</hi>) that if I know how to render a ſervice
to my friends, I better know how to maintain what I do for them.
Let us by that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

am with my friend, and <hi>Metellus</hi> with you, and there is yet day
enough left to do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> had no ſooner ſpoke theſe few words, but <hi>Minutius, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi>
and my ſelf, ſeem'd raviſht with joy; ſo that all four going
ſome diſtance from the City, and having found a place that was
ſecret enough, and very fit for our purpoſe, we preſently drew our
ſwords and began to cloſe: I ſhall not particularlize this Combate,
but; but I cannot omit to tell you, that I never beheld any man
more ſprightly, fierce and amiable then <hi>Scipio</hi> ſeem'd to me, when
he approach'd <hi>Minutius</hi> with his ſword in his hand. I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what he did afterwards, becauſe <hi>Metellus</hi> and I were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engag'd. But ſome moments after, having bin more fortunate
then <hi>Metellus,</hi> whom I wounded in two places, and paſſing upon
him ſeiz'd the gards of his Sword, without receiving more then
one ſlight hurt from him; <hi>Scipio</hi> came up to us to ſeparate us. I lookt
upon him to ſee in what condition he was, and beholding the blood
flow from his Arms; You are wounded (ſaid I to him) yes, <hi>Laelius</hi>
(anſwered he) with a cheerful, yet ſomething fierce aſpect; but
withal, loſing time (added he) let us go ſuccour <hi>Minutius</hi> who has
bin more unfortunate then I. We immediately therefore went to
<hi>Minutius</hi> whom we found lying on the ground, and dangerouſly
wounded by a thruſt through the body, and two others not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Metellut,</hi> who well knew the valour of his kinſman, was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſurpriſed to ſee him wounded in this manner; ſo that beholding
him attentively, he conſider'd his overcome with admiration.</p>
                  <p>Thus this victory was not without glory to <hi>Scipio,</hi> for <hi>Minutius</hi>
is one of the moſt valiant men in the world; and had he then had
that prudence he afterwards learnt under the great <hi>Fabius,</hi> after that
occaſion of his fighting. <hi>Hannibal</hi> contrary to the advice of that
Dictator, he would have bin a very gallant man; but he was then
of an humour too violent, and becauſe he and <hi>Varro</hi> were by their
intrigues, and a certain fortunate fierceneſs rais'd to the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
charges; they believ'd they ſhould have the ſame ſucceſs in all
ſorts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60667:100"/>
neither in their little affairs, nor in their grand attempts, as
without queſtion you have heard, Madam; for all the world knows,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> would have totally defeated <hi>Minutius</hi>'s Army, if the great
<hi>Fabius</hi> had not come timely to his relief; as likewiſe all poſterity
will reproach the memory of the raſh <hi>Varro,</hi> with the dreadful loſs
we ſuſtain'd at <hi>Canna,</hi> and the deplorable death of the Illuſtrious
<hi>Paulus Aemilius.</hi> But, Madam, not to leave <hi>Minutius</hi> without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
I muſt tell you, that though we were all three wounded, yet
we rais'd him up, and according to our beſt skill and conveniencies,
endeavour'd to ſtanch his blood. Which when we had done, and
what for our ſelves we could in ſuch occaſions, I went to call our
ſlaves, whom we had commanded to wait out of the field where we
fought, and cauſing <hi>Minutius</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> to be lead by them, and
<hi>Metellus</hi> and my ſelf ſlowly following them, we all four entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a houſe near the Gate, the Maſter of which we knew was a very
honeſt perſon. Immediately Chyrurgions were ſent for, all things
that were neceſſary provided, and our combate made known to our
relations, who came ſecretly to viſit us, and having reaſon'd about
it, counſell'd us abſolutely to leave the City as ſoon as we could.
Wherefore about break of day, <hi>Minutius</hi> was carried to one of his
relation's houſes in the Country, whither <hi>Metellus</hi> accompanied
him, and <hi>Scipio</hi> and I went to <hi>Oſtia.</hi> Aſſoon as we were arrived there,
my onely care was to provide for our cure, for <hi>Scipio</hi>'s thoughts
were wholly upon <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and he gave himſelf again to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciated
by his inquietudes, which his late encounter had ſuſpended
onely for ſome moments. But our wounds being neither very great
nor dangerous, we kept the chamber but a few days, and ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to walk in the Garden belonging to the houſe where we were
lodg'd, not daring as yet to appear in <hi>Oſtia,</hi> till we had firſt learnt
how our affair ſtood at <hi>Rome.</hi> If the rumour of our quarrel did not
ſpread abroad there much at firſt, that of our retreat was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
diſpers'd in <hi>Oſtia;</hi> ſo that this alſo cauſed ſome prejudice to
the affairs of <hi>Scipio,</hi> as you ſhall now underſtand. Receiving news
from <hi>Rome</hi> time after time, and that ordinarily by night, one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongſt the reſt, we beheld a ſlave of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s enter our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who brought us a pacquet, &amp; by the trouble of his countenance,
teſtified he had ſome extraordinary matter to relate. He was no
ſooner entered, but addreſſing to <hi>Scipio,</hi> My Lord, (ſaid he) I have
ſomething to tell you which I preſume will becauſe of no ſmall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
to you. Speak it then (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) and do not amuſe your
ſelf to tell me ſuperfluous matters. As I drew near towards <hi>Oſtia</hi>
(ſaid he) and it was yet not late enough to enter into the Town, I
purpos'd to hide my ſelf behind one of thoſe great hedg-rows that
border upon the Road that leads from <hi>Rome;</hi> vvhere having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
night, vvhen I was going to re-enter into the vvay and finiſh
my journey, I heard the noiſe of Horſes vvhich vvere coming to
<hi>Oſtia,</hi> and wondered vvhen I beheld five or ſix Horſemen alight

Nothing being betvveen them and me but ſome buſhes, I was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to obſerve their actions, and hear all they ſaid. Novv, I
beheld amongſt them, a man very richly cloth'd, but to ſpeak more
conciſely, I beheld <hi>Varro</hi> there, vvho advanced himſelf two or three
ſteps tovvards a man that came from <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and addreſſed to him in
great haſt: Well, <hi>Titus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Varro</hi> to him firſt) what ſayes <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia?</hi>
What ſayes <hi>Aemilia?</hi> All that you can wiſh they ſhould (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the man, whom I preſently knew, having ſeen him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times at <hi>Lucius</hi>'s houſe) and I aſſure you, my Lord, (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he) that <hi>Minutius</hi> could not have acted more handſomely for
your intereſts. For when you went into the Country, and took <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
along with you; <hi>Minutius,</hi> who is not amorous of <hi>Aemilia,</hi>
and conſequently ſeem'd wholly unſuſpected in what he ſaid, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Letter you know of; he nam'd alſo two or three of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for my part, I added that his ſlaves paſſed to and fro
before the houſe every night to obſerve us; and in ſhort, <hi>Minutius</hi>
ſo well mannag'd the matter, and I endeavour'd ſo well to ſecond
him, that we ſucceeded admirably, and <hi>Claudia,</hi> who had not much
thought of you, who were not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> believ'd, and does ſtill
that <hi>Scipio</hi> could not endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Pyneas</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> and had reſolv'd to ſteal her away for one of
his Kinſmen. But, My Lord, you will without queſtion be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
as well as I was, when you hear <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> are by all
conjecture at <hi>Oſtia,</hi> at leaſt <hi>Claudia</hi> ſuſpects ſo from a deſcription
made to her of two goodly young perſons that keep themſelves
conceal'd in a houſe there. Upon which <hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> who is
inform'd of all by her Mother ſince our departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> are
extreamly exaſperated againſt them, and aſſuredly confirmed in a
ſentiment which will no queſtion prove to your advantage. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
My Lord, the reſidence of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> there ſeems to
me very ſuſpicious, And I cannot comprehend, wherefore—I
know upon what pretences they are there (interrupted <hi>Varro</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly)
I come from <hi>Rome,</hi> as you know, where I have learnt the
paſſages of a fray of theirs; but I wiſh to the Gods that what I hear
from you, prove not true in relation to <hi>Scipio</hi>'s and <hi>Laelius</hi>'s being at
<hi>Ostia.</hi> However (continued he, after a little reflecting upon what
he had ſad) advantage ought to be drawn from all things, and even
the retirement of <hi>Scipio</hi> to <hi>Oſtia,</hi> muſt be rendred ſerviceable to my
deſign. Go therefore, <hi>Titus,</hi> begin anew to ſerve me, account that
for nothing which I have already given you, and be aſſured your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhall be proportionable to the greatneſs of your deſert. Go
ſhew <hi>Claudia</hi> and her divine daughter a terrifi'd countenance, aſſure
them that <hi>Scipio</hi> lies hid in <hi>Oſtia;</hi> ſay, 'tis to execute his deſign, and
that a great multitude is to come to him from <hi>Rome</hi> this night; in a
word, <hi>Titus,</hi> omit nothing that may ſerve me, and expect all things
from my gratitude. In the mean time I will go give ſome other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and then offer my perſon to <hi>Claudia,</hi> vvith five or ſix of my
friends vvith me, in reference to the News vvhich I will pretend
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60667:101"/>
to have receiv'd concerning <hi>Scipio</hi>'s deſign. If ſhe favourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
what I offer her, I ſhall be gloriouſly recompenc'd for it, with
the poſſeſſion of the charming <hi>Aemilia:</hi> for as ſoon as ever I have
drawn a conſent that will make me happie, I will challenge <hi>Scipio,</hi>
to which honour indeed will ſeem to oblige me, but 'tis my love
which will really conſtrain me more powerfully, to the end I may
either rid my ſelf of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who certainly will ſoon diſcover my
Artifice and ruine me utterly, or periſh my ſelf to avoid ſeeing it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.
But if, on the contrary, I be badly receiv'd, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
be paid with ſigns of averſion and contempt, I ſhall have a
fair pretext to betake my ſelf to violence. I will ſpeak it aloud,
that I am reſolved to ſerve <hi>Aemilia,</hi> even againſt her own will; and
ſince ſhe is wiling to be taken away violently, I will become the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher,
and ſooner die then forſake ſo amiable a perſon to any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:
and in this caſe eſpecially, <hi>Titus,</hi> your aſſiſtance will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to me. As <hi>Titus</hi> ſeem'd going to anſwer, a Horſe-man, whom
<hi>Varro</hi> miſtook for one of his own partie, but was one that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to this Citie, paſſed by; upon which <hi>Varro</hi> fearing he might
be perceived by others, diſmiſſed <hi>Titus</hi> back again, and going aſide

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ndants, gave me libertie to
bring you vvith all ſpeed the intelligence I have related. <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
ſlave had ſcarce done ſpeaking, but his Illuſtrious Maſter, who had
bin a thouſand and a thouſand times upon the point to interrupt
him, was beginning to expreſs his ſentiments upon what he had
heard; which he was not able to do at firſt, they were ſo tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
It muſt be confeſs'd he reſented a ſenſible joy in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Aemilia</hi> was in <hi>Ostia,</hi> and having diſcover'd in what manner he
was betray'd; (for, Madam, he learnt nothing from the mouth of
<hi>Minutius,</hi> who vvas obſtinate not to make the leſt diſcovery)
but with all coming at the ſame time to think on the perfidiouſneſs
of <hi>Minutius</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> and on the adorable perſon vvho vvas to be
carried away by that treachery, his choler became extreamly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and this laſt paſſion having ſomething more impetuoſity then
the other, ſeem'd alone to poſſeſs him. Ah, Traytor! (cryed he)
ah perfidious! is it thus that thou betrayeſt me? Is this the courſe
thou takeſt to attain the poſſeſſion of the faireſt perſon in the world?
No, no. Traytor, thou ſhalt never have the ſucceſs thou promiſeſt
thy ſelf, and the Gods who have lately by mine arme puniſhed thy
complice, do not now diſcover thy crime to leave it with impunitie.
But, let us not loſe time (added he in an impetuous manner) let us
go; or rather fly, to puniſh the Traytor, ſince the concernment is to
ſerve <hi>Aemilia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ending theſe words, he took his ſword, and without remembring
that he was not abſolutely cured of his wound, cauſed one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him to <hi>Claudia</hi>'s houſe, at the Gate of which we found ſeven
or eight men with arms: Who, indeed, were <hi>Varro</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and, as we vvere informed afterwards, ſtood there expecting
<hi>Titus</hi>'s anſwer, vvho vvas gone to advertiſe <hi>Claudia</hi> of their arrival,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60667:101"/>
and of the cauſe that brought them; This infamous wretch having
already ſpoken againſt <hi>Scipio</hi> all that the blackeſt perfidiouſneſs
could inſpire him with, my illuſtrious friend did not ſtay to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
when he beheld thoſe people at the Gate, but drew his ſword
and couragiouſly ſet upon them. Are you here, traytor <hi>Varro</hi> (cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he with a fierce and menacing tone) are you run upon the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of your crime? Yes, I am here (anſwered <hi>Varro</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently)
to your unhappineſs, who come to puniſh your ſelf for the
attempt you were preparing to commit. Theſe words ſo augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s choler, that he caſt himſelf upon his enemy with ſuch
violence, that he wounded him the firſt paſs he made at him. <hi>Varro,</hi>
who was ſo far from being puſillanimous, that he has bin alvvaies
accus'd of raſhneſs, was not diſmaid at this on-ſet; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
being of a violent temper, grew inrag'd, and omitting the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
care of guarding himſelf, ſought to diſpatch <hi>Scipio</hi> with
one violent thruſt; So that <hi>Scipio</hi> was alſo wounded. But his heart
being perfectly the heart of a Hero, and that of <hi>Varro</hi> the heart of
a Lyon; <hi>Scipio</hi> wounded him deeply in three or four places, and
vvas onely ſlightly hurt himſelf in tvvo: for though he fought vvith
more love, more impetuoſity and choler, yet he fought too with
more judgment; ſo true it is that the valour of <hi>Scipio</hi> cannot be
proportionably deſcrib'd, having ſomething in it too great, and too
extraordinary to ſuffer it ſelf to be comprehended. In the mean
time, Madam, our enemies being well arm'd, and ſtronger in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
we had perhaps at length bin worſted, although <hi>Varro</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
with-drawn from the combate, becauſe our Hoſt, who had
guided us thither was wounded, and ſo was <hi>Scipio</hi>'s ſlave, and I had
receiv'd one wound in the body, and another in the arm. We had
bin worſted, I ſay, if an inhabitant of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> who came to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the fray, had not called a great multitude together to
his aſſiſtance to ſeparate us. But, Madam, I ſtill tremble when I
think that at this time the perfidious <hi>Titus</hi> came forth from
<hi>Claudia</hi>'s houſe, and ſeeing <hi>Varro</hi> all cover'd with blood, who made
no longer reſiſtance; and withal, perceiving by the light of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that were brought, <hi>Scipio</hi>'s ſword glittering in his hand, which
carryed death or dread on all ſides; this villain, either to revenge
<hi>Varro,</hi> or not to be diſcover'd, reſolv'd to kill this great perſon;
and accordingly went behind him to run him through the bodie, if
the Inhabitants of <hi>Oſtia</hi> I mention'd, had not bin near enough the
Traytor to ſtop him. But he could not ſo well with-hold his arm,
but that notwithſtanding that obſtacle, the inraged wretch run him
with a deep wound into the back.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Inhabitants of <hi>Oſtia</hi> had wholly ſeparated us, and
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s ſlave, who beheld that action of <hi>Titus,</hi> had requited the
traytor with a great wound too, our Hoſt, who was not dangerouſly
wounded, took care of us, and cauſed us to be carryed to his houſe,
where he ſent to ſeek the Chyrurgions who attended on us before,
<hi>Scipio</hi> and I were deſirous to be in the ſame chamber where this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60667:102"/>
Roman, in the firſt place demanded news concerning our
Hoſt, and ſeem'd very well ſatisfi'd when he underſtood he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
only a ſlight wound in the left arm. Then the Chyrurgions
ſearched our hurts, and told us they were not mortal, though we
judg'd by their countenances that they were very dangerous. After
which having given them the firſt dreſſing, they caus'd our Hoſt to
enter into the chamber, who preſently approacht towards <hi>Scipio</hi>
very reſpectively, and thank'd him for his goodneſs in remembring
him. 'Tis I am to thank you (anſwered the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi>) for
your aſſiſtance; but ſince it has pleas'd the Gods (added he) that
you have not bin conſiderably wounded; I muſt deſire you to do
me an other ſervice, in which there is neither danger nor difficulty,
and which nevertheleſs is of no ſmall importance to me. Go
therefore (continued he, obſerving the man expected only his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands)
go to <hi>Claudia</hi>'s houſe, tell her ſhe is abuſed, and that <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
is culpable, and I innocent. Moreover, tell her, that—But, no,
(recollected he ſuddenly) I ſhould loſe too much time in recounting
to you <hi>Varro</hi>'s treachery; go, tell her onely what I have ſaid to you,
and aſſure her that I am ready to juſtifie both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Scipio</hi> had given this Commiſſion, he commanded the
ſlave I told you of, ſhould come to him, having reſolved to ſend
him at the ſame inſtant to <hi>Claudia</hi>'s houſe, there to convince <hi>Titus,</hi>
and wholly diſcover the perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Varro.</hi> After which, this
Illuſtrious lover addreſſing to me; Well, <hi>Laelius,</hi> I am ſatisfi'd
(ſaid hetome with an air that ſpoke him really to be ſo, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great wounds he had received.) I am ſatisfied (ſaid he)
ſince the adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> is now ready to underſtand the difference
there is between the procedure of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the perfidiouſneſs of
the Traytor that would deſtroy me and carry her away. So that
<hi>Laelius,</hi> whether I die or be cured, I ſhall receive either fate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exceſs of ſorrow or ſatisfaction. For when I conſider I am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the point to ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear in <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s mind ſuch as I am, I reſent a joy
ſo ſenſible, that it effaces all other thoughts of whatever importance.
<hi>Scipio</hi> pronouncing theſe words ſomething loud, by reaſon of his
paſſionate expreſſions, the Chyurgions who were retir'd a while
to leave us to our reſt, heard his voice; wherefore they returned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
and entreated him with many reaſons and importunities to
forbear ſpeaking, which <hi>Scipio</hi> promiſed them, becauſe he had then
no cauſe to neglect his life, or rather becauſe he thought to find
more ſweetneſs in thinking on <hi>Aemilia,</hi> eſpecially at the ſame time
he conceived ſhe was receiving the information of his innocence.
As he was muſing upon this with extream ſatisfaction, our Hoſt
entered into our Chamber with a countenance which ſhewed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
he had not ſucceeded well in the Commiſſion enjoyn'd him.
<hi>Scipio</hi> was at firſt ſo ſurpris'd at it, that he ſeemed ſtruck dumb with
amazement; but he was very ſenſibly afflicted when he was told
<hi>Claudia</hi> would receive no meſſage nor hear any thing from him, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60667:102"/>
that ſhe was gone to offer <hi>Varro</hi> both her houſe and all kind of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
How? (cryed he) is it poſsible that <hi>Claudia</hi> would hear
nothing that <hi>Scipio</hi> ſent to tell her, and that ſhe is gone to offer both
her houſe and all ſort of aſsiſtance to <hi>Varro,</hi> who betrayes hers to
<hi>Varro,</hi> who at the ſame time that he receives her civilities, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to carry away her adorable daughter? But, <hi>Varro,</hi> thy falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
ſhall ſoon be diſcovered (continued he) as if <hi>Varro</hi> had bin
preſent) and things ſhall ſoon be told <hi>Claudia</hi> in thy preſence, which
ſhall prove thy attempt and <hi>Titus</hi>'s infidelity. Yes, <hi>Varro</hi> (added
he) thy crime ſhall ſoon be known, thy accuſer ſhall be a witneſſe
that both ſaw and heard thee, and who ſhall ſo exactly lay open
the circumſtances of thy perfidiouſneſs, that thou ſhall not dare to
diſown it, though thou ſeeſt thy ſelf accus'd by a ſlave, and a ſlave
of thine enemy, and thy rival.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Scipio</hi> ended theſe words, he that he had ſent to call the ſlave
he was ſpeaking of, entered our Chamber, and told him he could
not find that ſlave, nor ſo much as hear any tydings of him. <hi>Scipio</hi>
had no ſooner heard theſe words, but lifting up his eyes to heaven,
compleat my deſtruction, cruel deſtiny (cryed he) and ſeek not
out ſuch terrible and extraordinary means to increaſe the greatneſs
of my miſery.</p>
                  <p>He had no time to proceed further, for the Chyrurgions haſtned to
repreſent to him the danger into which this agitation would caſt
him. I have no more rules to obſerve (interrupted he impatiently)
your aſſiſtance is no longer neceſſary to me, and the wounds you
endeavour to cure, afford the leaſt part of the pains that I reſent. But
<hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid I to him, not to ſuffer him to abandon himſelf to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair)
the injuſtice of <hi>Claudia</hi> will not injure for ever, and we ſhall
without doubt find means to make her—Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he, ſpeak not, I beſeech you) as you do; accuſe not <hi>Claudia,</hi> I
conjure you: if you ſee your friend die, yet at leaſt add not to all
his torments, that of hearing you term the Mother of the adorable
<hi>Aemilia</hi> unjuſt. I am not capable of your virtue (replied I roughly)
if I eſteem it heroical, I alſo eſteem it inhumane; and I conceive
there is nothing more lawful for a miſerable perſon then complaint.
Well, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he ſadly) let us pitty our ſelves; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you let us impute all we ſuffer to my unhappineſs, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
a perſon to whom we owe an infinite reſpect. I ſhall have as
much reſpect as you pleaſe (replied I) yet at leaſt ſuffer me to tell
you, that after the eſteem you have acquired, and the gallant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you have atchiev'd; <hi>Claudia</hi> has too lightly given credit to
what was ſuggeſted to her to your prejudice. Alas! <hi>Laelius</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he ſighing) it muſt be believed, that the eſteem you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ill grounded, if yet it be true that I have gain'd any; and that
what I have done hitherto is little conſiderable, ſince a perſon who
cannot be deceived in her judgement, has not bin ſufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
in favour of me, to be able to reſiſt the firſt aſſaults of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie.
I might have a thouſand things to alledge (replied I) for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60667:103"/>
you, and againſt <hi>Claudia,</hi> but I will not continue a diſcourſe which
I ſee is prejudicial to your health. Let us ſpeak, I beſeech you, <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
(ſaid he) let us ſpeak of my unhappineſs, without accuſing
<hi>Claudia</hi> of it, and without taking heed to a health which deſerves
no longer to be cared for. I anſwered nothing to whatever he
ſpoke afterwards. But he was tranſported to call me cruel friend,
and to preſs me with the moſt affecting language he could uſe; in
which nevertheleſs I reſiſted him, and refus'd to the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
friend that ever was, the ſole thing I ought not to have granted
him. Yet my ſilence cauſed not his agitations to ceaſe abſolutely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he ſtill complained againſt that ſtrange medley of infelicities that
befell him; he ſet his thoughts a thouſand and a thouſand times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the glorious beauty of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> to render himſelf more unhappy,
in thinking afterwards on the injuſtice which had injur'd him in the
mind of that divine perſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Madam, this illuſtrious Lover would neither liſten to the
Chyrurgions entreaties nor mine, and was tormented the reſt of the
night with ſuch violent troubles, that the next morning the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
began to affirm there would be no hope of his recovery, if
the violence of his inquietudes dured ſome hours longer. But while
he was in this deplorable condition, and no body was permitted to
enter into our Chamber, one came to whiſper me in the ear, that
<hi>Claudia</hi> deſired to ſee him, if it might be without diſturbance. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
deſires to ſee <hi>Scipio?</hi> (anſwered I) Alas! tell me whither or no
you know her ſo well, as not be deceived, before you ſpeak further.
'Tis ſhe (anſwered the meſſenger) and I know her ſo well, that I
can aſſure you of it, and tell you moreover that an Inhabitant of
<hi>Ostia</hi> leads her, and that ſhe is follow'd by <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and two or
three of her attendants. Go then (ſaid I to him) and cauſe her to
come hither; and in the mean time addreſſing to <hi>Scipio,</hi> whom I
would prepare for the joy he was to receive, leſt being ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd,
he might undergo ſome more vehement agitation by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
in his heart, ſurpriſing between a joy that would offer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into it, and a deep ſorrow that would diſpute its admiſſion. But,
Madam, all I could do was unprofitable: For, beſides that, I had
not time, to ſpeak much, <hi>Scipio</hi> was ſo little diſpos'd to believe
he was upon the point to receive the viſit I ſpeak of, that <hi>Claudia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
before he believed it really. It would be difficult indeed, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to expreſs to you the condition this Illuſtrious ſick perſon
then was in: for he had no ſooner caſt his eyes on the fair perſon
that followed <hi>Claudia,</hi> but he ſeem'd like a man that were on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
brought into the rayes of the Sun, after a long continuance in
the obſcurity of a Dungeon. He began to behold <hi>Aemilia</hi> with ſo
much intentneſs, that he forgot, as I knew afterwards, both the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Varro,</hi> and your honour which he received from <hi>Claudia.</hi> He
did not ſo much as remember the wounds he had upon him, and the
condition they had brought him to; in ſhort, he lookt onely upon
<hi>Aemilia,</hi> he thought of nothing but <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and remembred not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60667:103"/>
any thing but this adorable Lady, with which object his mind and
heart were wholly taken up. Yet this did not hinder him from being
extreamly weak and faint, as you may eaſily judge; ſo that when
<hi>Claudia</hi> came near him, and bowed down her head to make him a
complement, he would have enforced himſelf to return her the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
which ſick perſons that receive viſits are uſually able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
but his ſtrength failed him, and all he could do was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<hi>Claudia,</hi> with a certain attention that ſufficiently ſhewed he
thought he ſaw that in a dream which he really beheld. I beſeech
you, <hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) conſult your generoſity before you
hear what I have to ſay to you; and believe, I conjure you, that
if I have done an injuſtice, I have done it innocently, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by force. For in truth (contniued ſhe) <hi>Minutius,</hi> who ſeemed
to me neither your enemy, nor <hi>Varro</hi>'s intimate friend, told me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, that your reſorting to our houſe was onely to find out
ſome means how you might bring to paſs a marriage of <hi>Aemilia</hi>
with the Son of <hi>Manilius</hi> who is your Kinſman. He afterwards came
to tell me of certain Verſes which the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> had written,
which teſtified ſufficiently that he pretended to our Alliance, as
which <hi>Lucius</hi> himſelf confirmed to me not long after. This deceipt
came to my knowledge, as I remember, two or three days after the
departure of <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Pyneas;</hi> and as I was wondering before
him, that ſome perſons belonging to had bin ſeen paſſing too and
fro a hundred times before our Gate the night before, he took his
time to tell me that the pretenſions of <hi>Pyneas</hi> having interrupted
your purpoſe, you deſigned to take ſome ſhorter courſe, although
violent, to bring your intention to paſs. Accordingly, Madam,
(continued he) I know that <hi>Scipio</hi> has engaged five or ſix of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
or friends, which I ſhall name to you, to aſſiſt him in what
he deſigns.</p>
                  <p>I know alſo that he has indeavour'd to gain one of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks,
named <hi>Titus;</hi> and for an evident proof of what I tell you,
behold, Madam (ſaid he to me) a Note that is fallen into my
hands, which <hi>Scipio</hi> writ to <hi>Appius,</hi> who dwelling near your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
might apparently more conveniently ſerve him then all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
relations. After theſe words he preſented me a Note indeed,
which I knew preſently to have bin written by you, having ſeen
your Letters many times ſhewed me by <hi>Publius</hi> while you were in
<hi>Greece;</hi> at which being greatly amazed, I read it over often enough
to be able to remember the very words of it; which were theſe,</p>
                  <p>I came to you to your houſe to ſpeak with you, concerning a very inpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
affair, but finding you not there, and perhaps my occaſion requiring
your aſſiſtance this night, I have left this Note for you, to entreat you to
be in a readineſs to iſsue forth well accompani'd, in caſe you hear any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
neer <hi>Lucius's</hi> Palace, and to come to my aid if I meet with reſiſtance
there, which yet in all appearance I ſhall not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60667:104"/>
Now <hi>Scipio,</hi> Does not your Note ſpeak very preciſely? Does it not
fully enough confirm what <hi>Minutius</hi> had before told me? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
this aſſur'd me at the ſame time, that you caus'd it to be told
him that you would give him an exceſſive recompence, provided
he would ſerve you in a very important affair you had to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to him: And thus I became at length fully perſwaded of
the truth of their ſuggeſtions; for beſides what I have told you,
I was alſo aſſured by ſome, that the night following, ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
belonging to you, were ſeen coming to obſerve what was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at our houſe; this, <hi>Scipio,</hi> cauſed me to reſolve to forſake
<hi>Rome</hi> for ſome time, without ſo much as declaring to any whether I
went, becauſe notwithſtanding your pretended crime, I could
neither hate you, nor forget the obligations I had to you; but I
was glad to deprive you of the means of executing the deſign I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
you intended, and alſo to avoid, leaſt our houſes ſhould fall
into an open feud: I communicated my purpoſe to <hi>Minutius,</hi> to
whom I took my ſelf to be very much obliged; he preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it, and having offered me all ſervices in his power, he told
me afterwards, that believing himſelf obliged to make the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to me he had done, he was ingaged to imbrace my intereſts in
this affair, whether ſoever it came to break forth, or—Alas!
<hi>Minutius</hi> (interrupted I) how do you treat me? Can you believe
I would embroil you with your friends, and ſo ill acknowledge
the favour you have but now done me ſo generouſly? But Madam
(ſaid he) what will you ſay to <hi>Scipio</hi> when he comes to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon the change which he will obſerve in your comportment
towards him? I will ſay nothing (anſwered I) But Madam (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
he) who ſo ſayes nothing in theſe conjunctures, ſayes all
things in effect; ſo that it will be better for you to tell him one of
the reaſons you have, not to treat him as formerly, then to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to him: And ſince you will not have the matter pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
(added he) do not mention that which would moſt ſenſibly
incenſe him, do not treat him as the Raviſher of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell him, you do not take it well, that he intermeddles in the
breaking of a marriage that is propounded for her, without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
what marriage you mean. Upon theſe reaſons I was induced
to ſpeak in that manner to your Friend <hi>Scipio,</hi> as without queſtion
you have underſtood, and I after that left <hi>Rome</hi> for the cauſes I
have told you: But for that you already know all that is paſſed
ſince, as a Slave of yours lately aſſured me, it remains only to tell
you that <hi>Fabius</hi> is here (continued ſhe, pointing at the Inhabitant of
<hi>Oſtia</hi> who had lead her) to whom we have great obligations, and
whoſe prudence alone has diſcovered all theſe matters I have related
to you, as himſelf can teſtifie. The Gods, My Lord (ſaid <hi>Flavius</hi>)
and not my prudence, have cleared up the luſtre of your virtue,
and diſsipated the cloud wherewith black calumny endavoured to
envelop it. But to let you know in few words, in what manner they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60667:104"/>
have ſerved themſelves of me, to lay open ſo deteſtable a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
I am to tell you that I was the perſon who coming from
Rome laſt night, beheld the conference of <hi>Varro,</hi> upon the way
which the circumſtance of time preſently rendred ſuſpitious to me.
So that being arrived at home, as I was conſidering on what I had
ſeen, I heard a noiſe about the Gate of this Ladies houſe, which is
but a few ſteps from mine, which cauſed me to run to ſee what the
matter was, and afterwards call my Neighbours to my aid, to part
the fray. At which time I perceived a man whom I called to mind I
had ſeen in the conference upon the way to <hi>Oſtia,</hi> going behind
you to kill you; I oppoſed his purpoſe immediately, and ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his arm; but my zeal proving leſs powerful then his rage, I could
not wholly ſtop the blow which yet did not paſs unpuniſhed: for
at the ſame time, a man whom we ſince underſtood belongs to you,
rewarded him with a great wound through the body. Whereby
judging by his ſtroke, that the villain I had ſeiz'd was one of <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s
partie, ſince he that wounded him was in all probability of yours
(for, My Lord, I had learned your name, and that of <hi>Varro</hi> confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
pronounced in the tumult.) I alſo cauſed this man to be ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
whom I believed belonged to you. And ſo cauſing them both
to be put in a place of ſurety, I hoped to draw from their mouthes
ſome diſcovery of your quarrel, that I might afterwards acquaint
this Lady with it, or ſend to Rome to advertiſe ſome perſon of
eminent quality, who might come and acommode it. My deſign
has very well ſucceeded; for having brought your ſlave to give
me information, he repeated to me all the relation which he the laſt
night made to you.</p>
                  <p>After which examining, <hi>Titus,</hi> concerning the ſame, he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
preſſed by ſo many particular circumſtances which I laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, that being paſſed hope of injoying reward of his treaſon,
by reaſon he has but few days longer to live, he ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
the truth to me, and excited as great admiration in me of your
deteſtation of the crime of <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Minutius.</hi> You may judge,
My Lord, I loſt no time; but haſtened forthwith to the houſe of
this Lady, and declared to her the matter as I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it; upon which ſhe deſired to come hither to you, aſſoon
as the aſtoniſhment raiſed by my diſcourſe permitted her. Great
Gods! (cryed <hi>Scipio</hi> then) I render you thanks; after which caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his eyes upon <hi>Claudia</hi> with as much joy and reſpect as he was
able to expreſs in this condition; I crave your pardon, Madam,
(ſaid he to her) for having contributed, though innocently, to the
cauſing of your inquietude. But, Madam (added he) ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
after) wherefore have you taken the trouble to come your
ſelf? could you not have ſent ſome one of your attendants to
come—Alas! <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered ſhe) how do you treat me? I came
with an extream tenderneſs to deſire your pardon my ſelf, for the
injuſtice I have done you, to requeſt you to forget it, and to
cauſe you and your friend to be brought to my lodgings,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60667:105"/>
to the end I may have the greater care of you. Believe not that
<hi>Varro</hi> has bin there (added ſhe) for he would not accept of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
I made him to acquit my ſelf of the obligation I conceiv'd I had
to him; but aſſoon as he learnt that you were not dead, he cauſed
himſelf to be carried out of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> tormented, no queſtion with the
remorſe of his deteſtable intentions. But, <hi>Scipio,</hi> there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between you and <hi>Varro,</hi> for, beſides divers great obligations
which I really have to you, there has always bin a very friendly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
between our families, and I have ever entertained a great
dearneſs and eſteem for you; and therefore I have reſolved to cauſe
you to be carryed to my houſe; or if that cannot be done without
danger, to come my ſelf hither every day, to ſee that you be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the greateſt care and diligence poſſible. Ah! Madam (ſaid
<hi>Scipio</hi>)—do not not enforce your ſelf to reply (interrupted ſhe)
for your condition diſables you from reſiſting me, and from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too. In the mean while I leave you to compoſe your mind to
quiet, which, no doubt, has bin agitated with a thouſand different
thoughts during the relation we have made you; and I go to your
friend to juſtifie my ſelf with him, and impart to him what I have
already told you. In ſpeaking which words, ſhe came to me, with
<hi>Fabius</hi> alſo, becauſe ſhe perceived <hi>Scipio</hi> was offering to make her
a remerciment, which might have injur'd his health: and as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Aemilia</hi> onely making a reverence to <hi>Scipio</hi> as ſhe paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and ſo following her Mother. How? Madam (ſaid I as
vehemently as my weakneſs would permit, and addreſſing to <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>)
will you ſuffer a perſon whoſe intereſts <hi>Scipio</hi> has engaged
in, to paſs before him without ſpeaking ſo much as one word to
him? <hi>Aemilia</hi> is not accuſtom'd to ſpeak much where I am in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
(anſwered <hi>Claudia</hi>) and I conceive ſhe accounts it unmeet to
begin to violate that decorum to the prejudice of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s health.
Provided <hi>Scipio</hi> ſpeak not (replied I) you have nothing to fear; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
I apprehend there is ſome kind of power in the aſpect of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fair perſon to diſſipate the ſadneſs of a ſick perſon. Speak to <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
then (ſaid <hi>Claudia,</hi> turning towards <hi>Aemilia</hi>) though I refer not
to the reaſon which <hi>Laelius</hi> alledges of your beauty; but ſuffer him
not to anſwer you. Accordingly, Madam, <hi>Aemilia</hi> went and ſat
down near <hi>Scipio</hi>'s bed, and whilſt <hi>Claudia, Fabius,</hi> and I were in
diſcourſe apart; this Illuſtrious Lover (as he after told me) took
this opportunity to mention his paſsion to the adorable perſon who
gave it birth. For <hi>Aemilia</hi> having at firſt beheld <hi>Scipio</hi> with a little
bluſhing, ſhe began to ſpeak to him with ſo great a ſweetneſs, that
the moſt inſenſible perſons in the world would have bin affected
with it. I did not conceive my ſelf (ſaid ſhe to him) oblig'd to
make you a complement; for having done you no injuſtice, ſaving
in my ſubmiſsion to the ſentiments of <hi>Claudia,</hi> I believed my ſelf
obliged to nothing more then to yield with greater pleaſure to the
ſentiments contrary to thoſe whereof you might accuſe us as of a
great crime. Ah! Madam, (interrupted our paſsionate infirm) how
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60667:105"/>
good and how generous you are, in being pleas'd I ſhould die the
moſt contented of men, by informing me then that the onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the world; for whom—<hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted ſhe likewiſe)
I am forbidden to ſuffer you to ſpeak, leſt it be prejudicial to your
health. If you prohibite me to ſpeak (anſwered he) onely for the
preſerving of my life, I ſhall loſe it through joy, Madam, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that without loſing reſpect, I may tell you that I die yours.
<hi>Scipio</hi> (replied ſhe) Why will you give me more cauſes then one
not to hear you? is it, that you would be unjuſt towards me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you believe I have done you an injuſtice? Alas! Madam (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he) why will you not hear the moſt reſpectful of all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who never dar'd to mention his paſsion to you, but when he
is dying? And why do you term a man unjuſt, who adores the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſon that beſt deſerves the adorations of all the earth? Well,
<hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I return to <hi>Claudia,</hi> ſince you will have it ſo. Go,
Madam (anſwered he) while this unfortunate perſon betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to dye, ſince you will have it ſo: yet he will not die (added he
with a weak and dying voice, though he inforc'd himſelf to ſpeak)
but after having declared before the faireſt perſon that ever lived,
that he dies leſs by reaſon of the wounds he has receiv'd, then of
love—He could not finiſh what he intended to ſay; love was the
laſt word he pronounced, which I believe he could not have reacht
to, if there had not been infinite ſweetneſs in pronouncing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the perſon beloved.</p>
                  <p>In brief, Madam, my illuſtrious friend fell into a ſwound by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpoken after a too paſſionate manner; for the pittiful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into which he was reduc'd by a great loſs of blood, follow'd
with a thouſand violent agitations; and the denyal of <hi>Aemilia</hi> to
hear him; though it was after a manner extreamly civil, did not a
little contribute thereunto. That fair perſon was ſo affected with
this accident, that ſhe immediately made a great ſhreek, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as much ſorrow as amazement. After which turning towards
us, as <hi>Claudia</hi> was haſtning to ſee what the matter was; Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(ſaid ſhe to her) <hi>Scipio</hi> is dead. <hi>Scipio</hi> dead! cryed <hi>Claudia</hi> and
I together) O Gods (continued I, caſting up mine eyes to heaven
with the greateſt ſorrow that ever I reſented) can you ſuffer <hi>Scipio</hi>
to periſh in ſo unjuſt a quarrel? Will you ſuffer ſo admirable a life
to be extinguiſhed in its beginning? and can you think it enough
to ſhew to the earth but tranſiently a Haro, whom it ſeem'd you had
deſtinated for the moſt memorable exploits, by the grand qualities
you ſo liberally favoured him with? I continued thus to bewail the
infelicity of my friend, and beſeech the Gods for his preſervation,
not being then able to aſſiſt him ſaving by vows and prayers. And
indeed the Gods in a ſhort ſpace reſtored him to us, whether it were
that they would not, a work which they had ſo excuſably framed,
ſhould be of ſo little continuance; or would not withdraw ſo great
a prop from the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they protect with a goodneſs,
of which all the world has ſeen indubitable teſtimonies during the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60667:106"/>
war which <hi>Hannibal</hi> brought into <hi>Italy.</hi> So the Chyrurgions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
this Illuſtrious perſon, though with extream difficulty, who
opened his eyes at laſt after ſeverall cordials, and began to give us
ſome hope. But when he became capable of well diſcerning
the objects that were about his bed, he aſſumed new vigour, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the lovely eyes of <hi>Aemilia</hi> were wet, and that apparently
ſome tears had dropt from them. And indeed <hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Aemilia</hi>
could not without weeping behold ſuch a perſon as <hi>Scipio</hi> in ſo great
a danger, and even dying for their quarrel, to whom they had ſo
great obligations, and as yet given him no tokens of the gratitude
they pretended to teſtifie to him. Wherefore they went not forth
of our Chamber till they had ſeen <hi>Scipio</hi> in as good a condition as
he was in at their coming to him; though <hi>Claudia</hi> inſiſted no more
to have us carried to her houſe, becauſe the Chyrurgions judg'd it
unfitting.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as they were gone, Madam, <hi>Scipio</hi> related to me the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
he had with <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and then told me he believ'd the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
appli'd to him would be unprofitable, ſince it did not pleaſe
<hi>Aemilia</hi> he fhould live. I cannot, <hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted I) ſuffer this
your injuſtice, and without doubt you would not ſpeak in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if you had ſeen the grief of that fair perſon. I oberved well
(anſwered he) that by all appearance ſhe had ſhed ſome tears. But,
<hi>Laelius,</hi> this does not fully ſatisfie me, becauſe moſt certainly ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
ſhe beſtowed them on my death. Should what you ſay be
true (replied I) have you any reaſon to conclude ſhe would not
have you live, ſince your ſeeming death cauſed her to weep? Ah!
<hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered he) do not deceive your ſelf, but believe there is
a great difference between theſe two reſpects, for it is uſual enough
to be effected with the death of any whatſoever. But it does not
often happen that any perſons intereſs themſelves to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the contented life of others who are indifferent to them. So
that, <hi>Laelius</hi> (added he, though he ſaw I could not approve his
ſpeaking) <hi>Aemilia</hi> forbidding me to ſpeak to her of my paſsion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
me alſo to live; for to tell you in a word what I think, ſince I
know you deſire I ſhould not ſpeak much, it is an undoubted truth
that 'tis impoſſible I ſhould live without loving <hi>Aemilia,</hi> or that I
ſhould live without ſpeaking to her of it; and if ſhe has not the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſuffer me to do ſo, then take your meaſures accordingly (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he) either to preſerve my life, or to prepare your ſelf to ſee me
ſeparated from you by a death, which will without doubt be cruel
to me for more then one cauſe. The Gods will preſerve us from
that unhappineſs (replyed I) and I believe moreover <hi>Aemilia</hi> will
never conſent to the loſs of an Illuſtrious Roman, whoſe crime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
onely in declaring to her, that one of the moſt worthy perſons
of the world dyes for love of her, but for a love ſo reſpectful, that
he preſumes not to diſcover it but tremblingly, and when he is upon
the point to dye of the wounds which he has lately received for her,
having embraced her intereſts in the moſt generous manner that can
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60667:106"/>
be imagin'd. No, no, <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſhe is too reaſonable to carry her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
ſo far as you apprehend; and I paſs higher, and believe ſhe is not
diſpleaſed that you love her; but for that ſhe make profeſſion of a
ſcrupulous virtue, ſhe judges it not becoming to liſten to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of love without endeavouring to impoſe you ſilence out
of decency. But according to the knowledge I have of her, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſhe would have ſtrangely ill-heated any other beſides you. For
Ladies of great quality and eminent virtue, are very difficult in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
ſuch diſcourſe as we are ſpeaking of, for that they will
not their hearts ſhould be attaqued by any, being determin'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of them only according to the pleaſure of the perſons to whom
nature has made them ſubject. Nevertheleſs I deſpair not of ſucceſs
for you with <hi>Aemilia;</hi> and if you will promiſe me to yield to all
things for the promoting of your cure, I promiſe you I will act not
unproſperouſly with the perſon you love. Ah! <hi>Laelius,</hi> if you
would—I have done <hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted I) and I cannot ſuffer
you to ſpeak longer. Theſe laſt words cauſed my dear friend to be
ſilent, who was more apprehenſive of diſpleaſing me then injuring
his own health, and afterwards ſuffer'd any courſe to be taken for
his cure.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, Madam, an occaſion of ſerving my friend
with <hi>Aemilia</hi> preſented it ſelf. For <hi>Claudia</hi> her ſelf viſited us, and
daily came to ſee in what condition we were, though ſhe had ſent
twice or thrice before for the ſame cauſe. So that as ſhe was pleas'd
from time to time to give ſuch orders concerning us as were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
her adorable daughter often remain'd near my bed, not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
to approach that of <hi>Scipio</hi> alone. Whereby it was eaſie for
me to take my time to ſpeak to that fair perſon, and to let her know
that ſhe had really the power of life and death over my Illuſtrious
friend. You ſpeak not ſeriouſly, <hi>Laelius</hi> (anſwered ſhe bluſhing, and
I think you doubt not, but your friend would ſoon be in perfect
health, if my cares could effect any thing; for in your chooſing
me for your friend (continued ſhe) you ought ſo to know, I am any of
ſufficient goodneſs, as to believe that theſe kind of reproaches cannot
be caſt upon me but with injuſtice. What I have ſpoken, Madam,
(replied I) was in the greateſt ſeriouſneſs poſsible, and the accident
you beheld here, not long ſince leaves no room for the doubt of it.
But, Madam (proceeded I) the ſequel of it will be much more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
&amp; unleſs you give <hi>Scipio</hi> ſome teſtimonies of that goodnes
you ſay you make profeſsion of, you wil ſee him die infallibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few dayes, and you will alſo aſſuredly ſee grief will cauſe me to
follow him. So that, Madam, you muſt either prepare your ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that miſery, or admit the declaration of the moſt reſpectful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that ever was reſented. <hi>Aemilia</hi> perceiving I ſpoke with an air that
ſufficiently intimated the correſpondence of my words &amp; thoughts,
and remembring likewiſe the extream danger wherein ſhe had ſeen
<hi>Scipio,</hi> appeared a little mollifi'd; but ſhe did not wholly yield, and
would not promiſe me to permit <hi>Scipio</hi> to ſpeak of his paſsion to
her. For, I wonder, <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid ſhe) you ſhould be ſo inſtant with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60667:107"/>
me as you are, ſince a friend is much more obliged to cure his friend
of a weakneſs he obſerved in him, then a Virgin is to hearken
to things which ſeemlineſs forbids her to ſuffer. Neither does
ſeemlineſs prohibit you to ſuffer the paſſion of my friend (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I) nor is that paſſion a weakneſs, ſince you, Madam, are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that have excited it, and given it birth in a heart perfectly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious.
But, Madam (continued I) not to loſe time, anſwer me,
but in the name of the Gods anſwer favourably; Will you ſuffer
<hi>Scipio</hi> to love you, or will you ſuffer him to die? Alas! <hi>Laelius</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
ſhe) why do you pleaſe your ſelf in afflicting me? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do you porpound things to me which I ought not to hear,
much leſs conſider which to chooſe? But, <hi>Laelius</hi> (continued ſhe)
perceiving her anſwer, deeply affected me, to ſhew you that I am
good, I will my ſelf go offer my friendſhip to <hi>Scipio,</hi> I will withal
deſire his, and intreat him to chaſe away all other ſentiments that
he pretends to have for me. And accordingly after theſe words,
this fair perſon without expecting any anſwer, went to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and
having a while beheld him with bluſhing and ſilence, becauſe ſhe
immediately obſerved a thouſand tokens of his paſſion in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
I come (ſaid ſhe to him) to deſire a favour of you, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio;</hi>
but in the name of the Gods do not refuſe it to me. Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(anſwered the paſſionate <hi>Scipio</hi>) why do you not forthwith
command the perſon, that of all the world owes you the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
and perfect obedience? Nevertheleſs, I will not tell you (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
ſhe) what I deſire to obtain of you, unleſs you firſt promiſe to
grant it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words gave <hi>Scipio</hi> ſome ſuſpitions, ſo that he muſed upon
them a little; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter which ſuddenly reſolving, ſpeak it, Madam,
(ſaid ſhe) and if you command me not to ceaſe loving you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt you ſhall be obeyed. Well, <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered ſhe) if I
deſire you ſhould love me, would you do that which—Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(interrupted he impatiently) why do you make a queſtion
ſo cruel to me of ſuch matters? Command, Madam, command
(added he tranſported with his love) and if the buſineſs be about
ſerving you, I will do things, as infirm as I am, that ſhall aſtoniſh all
the earth. I require none of thoſe great things of you, (anſwered
ſhe) I come onely to requeſt you to act with moderation, and to
cauſe you to change the tumultuous ſentiments you have for me,
into thoſe of friendſhip. In a word, <hi>Scipio,</hi> I come my ſelf to deſire
your friendſhip, and to offer you mine. I will none of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
(interrupted he roughly) no, Madam, I will none of your
friendſhip; I had rather die the unhappieſt of all men, and die your
lover, then live with a general eſteem, then live with all the honour
and glory that can be wiſhed, and live no more but your friend.
Yes, Madam, I ſhall love you during my life with the ſame ardency
I do; I ſhould even increaſe the violence of my paſſion if it were
poſsibly to be augmented; and I conſider all that love you not in
the ſame meaſure, as ſtupid people, without pleaſure, without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60667:107"/>
and without life. Yes, Madam (added he again) I eſteem
them ſuch as I have ſaid; and if friendſhip could ſubſiſt between
two rivalls, I ſhould have already wiſhed a thouſand and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, that <hi>Laelius</hi> loved you as I do; for me thinks he ſpends
a languiſhing and ſhamefull life, becauſe he lives without love for
you. Theſe paſſionate words extreamly confuſed the faire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that heard them (as ſhe told me afterwards) for ſhe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the Illuſtrious Lover who uttered them, was the perſon of
the world that beſt merited her eſteem. For, beſides youth, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of perſon, greatneſs of courage, charmes of wit and generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind which ſhe obſerved in <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſhe conſidered alſo that
this <hi>Heroe</hi> had not been reduced to the extremity wherein ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him, but only by having ſhewed her; and that if he was upon
the point to expire, it was only through the violence of his love to
her, which he had not declared but in the moſt reſpectfull manner
that can be imagined. But this ſevere Lady retaining ſtill ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of ſcruple in her heart, which prohibited entry to a certain
tenderneſs, which ſhe felt was ſeiſing on it, ſhe anſwered her Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Lover, that ſhe could no longer ſuffer ſuch diſcourſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Madam, (replied he ſadly) adde alſo that 'tis their pleaſure
that I ſhould not live. In ſincerity, <hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his griefe would make an end of that little ſtrength was
left him, after the agitations I told you of) you have no reaſon to
afflict your ſelfe as you do, and I conceive you would be injuſt, if
you would oblige me to ſuffer the paſſion you ſay you have, after
having taken the liberty to refuſe a friendſhip, I offered you my
ſelfe, which perhaps no other would have refuſed. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
Madam (anſwered he with a lower and weaker voice) to
oblige you to any thing whatſoever, not ſo much as to have any
regret for my death, which you are about to be the cauſe of. Yes,
Madam, I betake my ſelfe to die, ſince you will have it ſo; and did
I not fear to looſe the reſpect I owe you, by making you ſee fatall
objects, I would at this moment, leave of what is applied to my
wounds in order to preſerving my life. <hi>Scipio</hi> ened theſe laſt words
with ſo familiar accent, and in ſo languiſhing a manner, that <hi>Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
perceived he was again falling into a ſound. Upon which riſing
up ſuddenly and being throughly mollified, Live (ſaid ſhe to him)
live <hi>Scipio,</hi> I beſeech you, I conjure you. But Madam, (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he with a weak and trembling voice) you know well what you
muſt ſuffer, in order to preſerve my life. Well, <hi>Scipio</hi> (replied
ſhe, letting fall a few teares from her lovely eies) I will ſuffer it,
to avoid conſenting to your death; my conſtancy yields at length
to your importunateneſs; I eſteem you ſufficiently, and have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to you great enough to conform me to reſolve to ſuffer this
kind of perſecution from you, when I cannot avoid it. But, Oh
admirable change! <hi>Aemylia</hi> had no ſooner done ſpeaking, but <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
reſumed new ſtrength; ſuch power have the words of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
loved to penetrate even to the heart, and fortifie it againſt the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60667:108"/>
attaques of excruciating paſsions. <hi>Scipio,</hi> I ſay, aſſumed new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and amorouſly beholding the fair perſon that began to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to him; I will live, Madam, ſince tis your pleaſure (ſaid
he with a ſtronger voice) and moreover I will live happie, ſince tis
your pleaſure I ſhould live.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Scipio</hi> ended theſe words, <hi>Claudia</hi> entered into our Chamber,
accompanied with <hi>Publius</hi> and my father, whom ſhe had ſent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to advertiſe of all that had paſſed, they were alſo followed
by ſeven or eight of our relation, who came to teſtifie their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
ſentiments of our unhappineſs. But for that they ſpoke but
little, and that too after a manner ſufficiently ſad. I ſhall not repeat
their diſcourſe to you. But I ſhall content my ſelf with intimating to
you, that our ordinary Chyrurgions, with thoſe our friends brought
from <hi>Rome,</hi> having entreated the company to with-draw, they all
did ſo, and left us to our repoſe; of which then <hi>Scipio</hi> began firſt to
be capable. But, Madam, I am deſirous to leave him to take it, as
alſo to give you libertie to go to yours; for I believe it is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
late, and that extraordinary watchings are neither agreeable nor
advantageous to fair perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laelius</hi> here broke off his diſcourſe, and the fair Auditory beheld
one another as if they expected whether or no they ſhould deſire
him to continue it. But for that they judged, that beſides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
lateneſs of the night, it might be incommodious to <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
to ſpeak yet longer, the referred they ſequel of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to the next morning: After which they gave <hi>Laelius</hi> very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
thanks, and to ſhew him ſome proofs of their attention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
a little on the moſt remarkable paſſages of the Hiſtory he
had related to them. Which done, the fair Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> gave
the good-night to <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and having embraced and kiſſed that
amiable Virgin, retired to her own Chamber, being accompanied
thither by <hi>Lelius.</hi> The next morning <hi>Palmira</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> were
more early then their ordinary cuſtome; and <hi>Nadalia</hi> being ready
ſooner then <hi>Palmira,</hi> went to the Chamber of that fair Prinnceſs,
whither they afterwards ſent to call <hi>Lelius,</hi> aſſoon as they were in a
condition to be ſeen by him. This Illuſtrious Roman repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
immediately, and knowing with what impatience <hi>Palmira</hi> and
<hi>Nadalia</hi> expected the continuation of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Hiſtory, without loſing
time he ſeated himſelf near theſe two fair perſons, and reſumed his
diſcourſe in theſe terms, addreſſing it again to <hi>Palmira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The relation of our ſickneſs being not that which you deſire, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if you pleaſe I ſhall paſs over in ſilence all the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of it, and proceed to tell you, that when we were out
of our danger, <hi>Claudia, Aemilia,</hi> and all our relations departed from
<hi>Oſtia,</hi> where they notwithſtanding left us, either for that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the air of that City better then that of <hi>Rome,</hi> or believed
the numerous viſits we ſhould be forced to receive imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
at <hi>Rome,</hi> would be incommodious to us. But before their
departure, <hi>Scipio</hi> had a time of ſpeaking of his paſsion once more
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60667:108"/>
to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and I had the happineſs to confirm in to two or three
converſations the friendſhip that fair perſon was pleaſed to honour
me with. By which means I heard ſome daies after her departure
from <hi>Oſtia,</hi> that ſhe gave many advantageous teſtimonies of me at
<hi>Rome,</hi> commending both my wit and my nature upon all occaſions,
and daily inquiring tidings concerning me; which cauſed me to
think my ſelf obliged to teſtifie my acknowledgments of her civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in a Letter, to which ſhe had the goodneſſe to anſwer. How?
<hi>Lelius</hi> (interrupted <hi>Nadalia</hi>) will you receive Letters in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
without letting us partake of the gallantries in them, being
apparently not written in the ſerious ſtile of thoſe Letters of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which you recited to us before? You have reaſon, <hi>Nadalia,</hi>
(anſwered <hi>Lelius</hi>) there is without queſtion ſome peaſingneſs in
them; and ſince you deſire to hear them, perhaps I may be able to
ſatisfie you. That which I writ to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> was, as I remember, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in theſe terms.</p>

                  <q>I wiſh your Illuſtrious friend a ſpeedy cure. But, <hi>Laelius,</hi> I wiſh

                  <p>I had not no ſooner broken open the ſeal, but <hi>Scipio</hi> look'd with
extream impatience whether there were an anſwer in my Letter for
him; but he was ſenſibly afflicted when he beheld there was none.
Indeed he believed at firſt <hi>Aemylia</hi> would ſpeak of him in that of
mine, but he ſoon perceiv'd ſhe did not: upon which his grief would
have been inſupportable, if the ſight of the Characters trac'd by
the faire hand of <hi>Aemylia</hi> had not given him ſome contentment, and
he had not receivd'd a little more by the Poſtſcript ſhe had written
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60667:109"/>
for him. I perceived he was really raviſhed with joy, when he
obſerved the delicacy of wit which appeared in <hi>Aemylias</hi> Letter. But
Madam, as a lover ſometimes fancies pleaſures to himſelf from all
things, ſo it often fals out, that he makes every thing poyſon, and
frames torments to himſelfe, where he might really find ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thus Madam, was it with my Illuſtrious Friend; for on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
he became extreamly ſad, and the wit which was replendent in
<hi>Aemylia's</hi> Letter, and that dearneſs which might be obſerved in her
Poſtſcript became to him matter of diſcontent, which I preſently
took notice of by the alteration of his countenance. For he beheld
me with an aire, wholly different from that wherewith he had read
<hi>Aemylia's</hi> Letter; after which he expreſſed to me certain ſentiments
which came into his mind at that time, with which I was extreamly
ſurprized. Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (ſaid he to me) this Letter of <hi>Aemylia</hi> and
her Poſtſcript deeply afflict me. Yet they ought to produce a
contrary effect in you, (anſwered I) and I conceive a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the hand of a faire perſon, and that in a very pleaſant ſtraine,
ought to inſpire joy into the heart of a lover that reads it; beſides
the Poſtſcript you ſpeak of, ſeems to me to contain ſomething of
ſweetnſs and obligingneſs, which ought rather to ſatisfy then afflict
you. Ah! <hi>Laelius,</hi> you are not a lover (replied he) ſince you ſpeak
in this manner; for I know nothing could be more ſerene for me,
then this writing of <hi>Aemylia:</hi> for it is impoſſible that that ungentle
perſon could write to you without thinking of me, eſpecially in this
conjuncture; For in that ſhe indulges her wit, notwithſtanding that
thought, it is eaſy to judge ſhe is inſenſible for <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of that unhappy lover excites no trouble in her heart,
which might hinder her from writing with ſuch exactneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs:
But, <hi>Laelius</hi> (added he, taking the Letter from me, and
reading again the Poſtſcript written in it) this it is that ſpeaks much
cruelty to me, that <hi>Aemylia</hi> wiſhes I were inſenſible for her, and
ſeems in a manner to make ſlight of reigning in my heart; for the
latter words of her Poſtſcript leave me all poſſible grounds to
imagine ſo? But, <hi>Laelius,</hi> ſaies this inſenſible perſon to you, <hi>I wiſh
with all my heart that his cure be perfect.</hi> What can you imagine,
<hi>Laelius,</hi> more cruell for me then theſe words: But <hi>Aemylia</hi> (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
he, as if that faire perſon had been preſent) I will never be
cured in the manner you wiſh, and I will adore you all my life,
though you have the rigor to wiſh me a kind of recovery which I
dread much beyond the moſt terrible death. I will not accuſe you
<hi>Scipio</hi> at this time (ſaid I to him) for having too much wit, as you
did but now <hi>Aemylia;</hi> but whereas you told me I did not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
things, becauſe I am not a Lover, I ſhall tell you that your
ſelf do leſs, becauſe you are. For do not you know (continued I,)
that 'tis a part of decency and modeſty, for a Virgin to make wiſhes
of this nature, which you complain of; and moreover that they
are many times very glad to make unprofitable wiſhes? Therefore,
<hi>Scipio</hi> you are unjuſt to afflict your ſelf as you do, and more ſo in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60667:110"/>
deſiring <hi>Aemylia</hi> ſhould write to me without debonarity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
of wit; for ſince you are not prohibited to turne matters
to their advantage, is it not more reaſonable you ſhould imagine
<hi>Aemylia</hi> is willing to write galantly, when ſhe knowes you are to
read what ſhe writes, and preſumes not to do thoſe things uninge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly,
which muſt come to your ſight. Thoſe thoughts, <hi>Laelius</hi>
(interrupted he) are too flattering, and if I were capable of them,
I ſhould not only be ignorant of <hi>Aemilia's</hi> humour, but believe my
ſelf unworthy of her eſteem. Wherefore I am of a contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
to yours, and I imagine <hi>Aemylia's</hi> wit diſplayes it ſelfe,
without he intending it, and that ſhe is ſo farre from affecting the
winning, and retaining hearts, that ſhe takes all imaginable care to
acquit them, when ſhe is forc't to ſee they have been engaged by
her charmes. And indeed, <hi>Laelius,</hi> her deportment towards me,
and the Poſtſcript ſhe ha's writ to you are ſufficient proofes of my
opinion; beſides, that her great modeſty ought to convince us, that
apparently that admirable Lady cannot favour that kind of
conduct, where ſecreſie and addreſs make all the pleaſure
of a Lover, and that ſhe would not be leſs offended at thoſe
more publick gallantries which love every day, incites to
make for a faire perſon. So that, <hi>Laelius, Aemylia</hi> being of
this humour, did not without doubt think of preſerving my
heart and eſteem when ſhe writ to you; and this is it which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
troubles me, that ſhe ha's written ſo gallantly, and had no
deſigne to do ſo. In brief, Madam, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſpake much more to this
purpoſe, complaining of <hi>Aemylia,</hi> and preſently after infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
her: but that which ſeemed to me moſt ſurpriſing was, that he
accuſed her of inſenſibility, while I ſided with her and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her procedure; and certainly defended her when I ventured to
terme her infenſible. So true it is, that Love is never without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travigance,
even in the moſt illuſtrious and intelligent hearts. But
to proceed, Madam, I am by this time come to tell you, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to quit the chamber, and within two or three daies after, we
were in a condition of attempting to take horſe to go to <hi>Rome.</hi> For
the newes we received thence, obliged us to haſten our departure
from <hi>Oſtia,</hi> being informed by a ſlave who brought us a packet
that <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Aemylius</hi> were arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Claudia</hi> was
gone from thence, and had left her charming daughter there, who
in all appearance would be married to the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> within a
few daies. He added that there was a rumour ſpread abroad in
<hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Lucius</hi> was ingaged to it, and that <hi>Pyneas</hi> was ſhortly to
arrive there for that purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e; beſides that <hi>Publius</hi> and my Father
writ to us, not only that we might come to <hi>Rome,</hi> but that they
ſhould be extreamly glad to ſee us there, aſſoon as we could give
them that ſatisfaction without prejudicing our healths not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
confirmed. Wherefore we did not deliberate what we had
to do, but immediatly took horſe, being extreamly ſatisfied
that the orders we received were exactly conſentaneous to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
we had to go, and obſtruct the happineſs of the King of <hi>Illyria.</hi>

on the unwelcome intelaligence brought us without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
at it, and teſtifying his deſpaire to me. At length, <hi>Laelius</hi>
(ſaid he to me, as we were ſpeeding along) ſee the laſt ſtroke of
misfortune; we may now ſay, I am upon the point to experience,
that which is the moſt cruell and fatall in love. But I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
it (added he ſuddainly with a tranſport, and redoubling
his diligence, as if himſelf had been at that inſtant about breaking
the marriage which he feared) No, no, I will not experience it
(added he again) and I believe it is not a matter of too great faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to marry the adorable <hi>Aemylia,</hi> before the unfortunate <hi>Scipio</hi>
be ſent out of the world. Theſe words made me obſerve that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have more torments to fear, then pleaſures to hope for; and
excited alſo an averſion in me from engagements, which bring us
every moment into a condition of miſtruſting all things. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
I deſired to repreſs my Friend's fear; and therefore having
beheld him ſomething attentively, and obſerved that he was deeply
afflicted, I indeavoured to repreſent to him that his trouble was
weakly grounded, and that I extreamly wondered he ſhould ſo
ſoon give credit to an information brought him by a ſlave. 'Tis
becauſe a ſlave brought it (anſwered he ſighing that my miſery is
indubitable: for it is not very uſuall for a marriage to be openly
ſpoken of, before the treaty of it be concluded; and leſs, for a ſlave
to know ſuch matters as theſe before they be publiſhed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
before they be concluded. But <hi>Scipio</hi> (replied I) you
know people uſually ſpeak of perſons of quality, according to their
fancies, and ſo 'tis not to be wondered if marriages be ſpoken of,
which are ſo farre from being concluded, that they were never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
Wherefore (added I) your apprehenſion is not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable
upon reaſonable grounds, ſince a flying rumor renders the
matter at moſt but dubious. Ah! <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted he) there
are foundations for it ſolid enough to my unhappineſs! ſince I
ground it only upon the inclinations of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and the departure
of <hi>Claudia.</hi> For I know <hi>Lucius</hi> well enough to judge eaſily that
he would ſacrifice all his family, for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and conſequence that he has promiſed his adorable daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Pyneas,</hi> to gratify him for what he has already done, and
likewiſe the better to retain him by that alliance, to the intereſts of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And you will not doubt of the truth of this (added he)
if you conſider that <hi>Claudia</hi> is gone from <hi>Rome</hi> in this conjuncture;
for wherefore ſhould ſhe leave <hi>Lucius</hi> upon his return, were it not
that ſhe ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s reaſons to do ſo, and had not the goodneſs to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
to be preſent at the concluſion of an affaire which muſt
perfectly deſtroy me. Since it was not difficult for <hi>Claudia</hi> to
know, that Generoſity alone did not incite me to act in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
I have had againſt <hi>Minulius</hi> and <hi>Varro;</hi> there's no queſtion but
ſhe has underſtood the paſſion I have for her adorable daughter,
and aſſuredly compaſſionates me, perhaps not without ſome eſteem
and tenderneſs, as ſhe told me her ſelf: upon which ſhe is unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60667:111"/>
to be preſent at a treaty, which ſhe knows will be fatall to me,
that ſhe may be able hereafter to excuſe her ſelf of it, if I ſhould
make my complaints to her, by alledging all was done during her
abſence, and that ſhe knew not of the buſineſs till it was paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<hi>Scipio</hi> added other reaſons to theſe: Madam, but how ſtrong
ſoever his conjectures were, I never ceas'd to lighten and qualifie
them during our journey. I ſhall omit filling you with what joy
<hi>Publius</hi> receiv'd us, when we arriv'd at his houſe, and how he was
ſurpriſed to ſee us ſooner then he expected. But I ſhall only inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
to you, in what manner we our ſelves were ſurpriſed. Having
received careſſes of <hi>Publius,</hi> with the affectionate teſtimonies of
young <hi>Scipio,</hi> and reſted a while, during which we had a handſome
entertainment ſet before us; <hi>Publius</hi> heheld us with an open and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
aſpect, and told us we muſt go to <hi>Lucius's</hi> houſe concerning
an important affaire, and ſuch as would without doubt be very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
unto us. After which we will go to yours, <hi>Laelius,</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he looking towards me) He pronounced theſe words with ſuch
ſatisfaction, that He did not take notice that they cauſed <hi>Scipio</hi> to
bluſh; ſo that inſteed of requiring the cauſe of the alteration of his
countenance, he turned about to go forth, and took his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Lucius's</hi> Palace. <hi>Scipio,</hi> as great and as much here as he
was, was nevertheleſs perfectly ſubmiſs and obedient to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Publius,</hi> and went after him, without opening his mouth to
complain, and afterwards beholding me, with ſighes went to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius's</hi>
houſe like victimes, who go of themſelves to the Temples
where they are to be ſacrificed. I will perceive (ſaid he to me ſome
moments after) this important affaire is the marriage of <hi>Pyneas,</hi>
and <hi>Aemylia.</hi> I ſee, <hi>Laelius,</hi> that's the affaire, which a cruell ſtate-inclination
makes perſons of the humour of my father and <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
terme agreeable; but, <hi>Laelius</hi> (added he, ſighing again) I will
not ſpeak of <hi>Publius,</hi> nor the father of the divine <hi>Aemylia:</hi> for as I
ought not to mention them but with reſpect, ſo I feare the troubles
which I reſent will hinder me from an exact obſervance of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He was ſilent after theſe words, and continued to follow his
father; yet with ſuch dejectedneſs, that when we were arriv'd at the
gate of <hi>Lucius's</hi> Palace, <hi>Publius</hi> ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ily perceived it. Upon which,
beholding him with an aire, in which appeared a mixture of fear
and contentment, In the name of the Gods, <hi>Scipio</hi> (ſaid he to him)
diſpell thoſe tokens of ſadneſs that appear in you countenance, and
give not <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Aemylia</hi> occaſion to find fault with you; for to
tell you the buſineſs more clearly, 'tis in reference to that fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
if we come hither, and to make an alliance which ought to fill
us with joy. I knew before, my Lord (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi> ſighing)
that your coming to <hi>Lucius's</hi> houſe, was in order to the treating of
that marriage. But I beſeech their pardon, if I cannot find the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in it, you would unqueſtionably have me reſent. How?
<hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted <hi>Publius</hi>) are not you ſo highly ſatisfied with
this marriage as I wiſh you were? It cannot be; you have not ſo
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60667:111"/>
ſoon altered the mind, and I conceive you will find ſatisfaction
wherein I do, and where without doubt it ought to be found. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
theſe words he began to aſcend, partly for that he believed
(as he told us after) <hi>Scipio</hi> would change his ſentiment out of that
intire ſubmiſſion which he bare towards his relations, and partly that
the preſence of a faire perſon, would ſoon diſſipate the diſcontent
he had perceived. But his conjectures failed him; for the perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Scipio</hi> augmented proportionably as he aſcended, becauſe he
was going to ſee an adorable perſon, whom he was in an apparent
fear of looſing. So that beholding me with eyes manifeſting both
his grief and his diſpaire, Aſſuredly <hi>Pyneas</hi> is arriv'd (ſaid he) ſince
the friends of <hi>Lucius</hi> aſſemble hither to his houſe. But, <hi>Laelius</hi>
(added he in a very violent manner) neither <hi>Lucius,</hi> nor <hi>Publius,</hi>
nor the whole world ſhall ever cauſe him to poſſeſs the adorable
<hi>Aemylia.</hi> Some moments after he had ſpoken theſe few words,
we entered into a Hall where <hi>Lucius</hi> was walking, who no ſooner
beheld us but he came towards us, and having ſaluted <hi>Publius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the familiarity that was between them, he imbraced <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
with an extream tenderneſs. After which he commanded <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylia</hi>
to be called; but of a ſuddain taking notice of the deep ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that appeared upon <hi>Scipio's</hi> countenance, he was much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and troubled at it, and believing it in probability an effect of
his ſickneſs, he ſaid to him with the ſame ſweetneſs, How? <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
will you give me more then one cauſe to complain of you? and
that after having put me in danger of looſing the alliance, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
from me the ſentiments you have for <hi>Aemylia,</hi> I ſee you
have endangered the loſs of that little health that is left you, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing
your ſelf to travell, before you were in a condition for it,
without hazard of your life. Ah! my Lord (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>)
fince you know the ſentiments I have for the adorable daughter,
can you believe it poſſible for me to preſerve my life, while I looſe
the hope of obtaining the Illuſtrious alliance you ſpeak of. That
hope of yours would have been loſt (replied <hi>Lucius</hi>) if <hi>Pyneas</hi> had
declared his mind; but while I believe he expected to be at Rome,
to declare his pretenſions more openly unto me, it is happily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
for our houſe that <hi>Claudia</hi> tells me ſince my return, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
you had ſome affection for <hi>Aemylia,</hi> which was confirmed
to me by a Letter writ by you not long ſince, which by chance fell
into my hands. Vpon which being extreamly joyfull, I went to
<hi>Publius's</hi> houſe, and without ſticking at the punctilio's which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of Virgin's endeavour to obſerve, I preſently told him of the
paſſion you had, and then offered him <hi>Aemylia: Publius</hi> really te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
a joy as great as mine; ſo that after ſome diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the happineſs of allying our two houſes together, I returned
home and commanded <hi>Aemylia</hi> to treat you as the perſon deſigned
to be her husband, that is, as one whom ſhe ought to love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and on whom ſhe ought to depend. Thus you ſee, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
there wants nothing but your conſent to the concluſion of a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60667:112"/>
buſineſs, which as I apprehend, you ardently deſire the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.
Whileſt <hi>Lucius</hi> was ſpeaking thus, <hi>Scipio</hi> beheld him
with an aſtoniſhment tranſcending my expreſſion. Then he lookt
upon his father in the ſame manner; after which his eyes ſeemed to
ask me, whether I beheld the ſame that he did; in a word, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>Scipio</hi> for ſome moments appeared like a man, who thinks he
ſees what he paſſionately deſires, and nevertheleſs believes not that
he ſees it really. But he was not long before he was convinced of
the reality of his happineſs. For reflecting upon the manner of
<hi>Lucius's</hi> ſpeaking, and perceiving alſo that <hi>Publius</hi> approved of it
by his ſilence, he moreover obſerved an aire of joy in my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that ſeemed to confirme the matter: ſo that ſeeing himſelf
on a ſuddain raiſed from extream unhappineſs to ſupream felicity,
Is it poſſible, my Lord, (ſaid he to <hi>Lucius</hi>) that your goodneſs
advances me to the greateſt glory that can be aſpired unto? Is it
poſſible (continued he, caſting himſelf at his feet) that I am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the point to marry the divine <hi>Aemylia,</hi> and to poſſeſs the faireſt,
and moſt adorable perſon that ever lived? As he pronounced theſe
words, and ſome other abrupt expreſſions, which his raviſhment
ſuggeſted to him, and as <hi>Lucius</hi> was offering to lift him up, the
faire <hi>Aemylia</hi> entred into the Hall where we were, and with her a
glorious ſplendor, and a thouſand charmes and graces. Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſuch was the entrance of that admirable perſon, who no ſooner
ſaw the moſt amiable, and illuſtrious of her Lovers at her fathers
feet, and moreover an amiable and illuſtrious Lover, who ſhe
knew was upon the point of being happy, but ſhe preſently bluſht,
and made us judge that in ſuch occaſions a like effect of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
is the moſt agreeable thing in the world. But when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
neer us by <hi>Lucius</hi>'s command, <hi>Scipio</hi> appeared ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that we eaſily perceived the preſence of this fair Virgin cauſed
too exceſſive joy in him, and that he received new wounds from
the ſight of ſo numerous charmes, which by being pleaſing did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
not ceaſe to be troubleſome. For there was ſo great a
dilatation of his ſpirits, that his heart being the moſt ſick part about
him, becoming the weakeſt by that expanſion, this Illuſtrious Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had almoſt fallen down at <hi>Aemylia's</hi> feet; and indeed he began
to tremble, and an exceſs of joy appeared painted on his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and his eyes were halfe cloſed. Which I obſerving, and
knowing what a ſuddain joy might effect, preſently ſtept to him,
and <hi>Lucius</hi> taking notice of it commanded <hi>Aemylia</hi> to retire; upon
which, Madam, <hi>Scipio</hi> being ſtill capable to diſcern objects, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the admirable perſon he loved was gone, which inſtantly
made him reſent a kind of regret, that ſerv'd to moderate his joy,
and contributed not a like to his ſpeedy recovery from his fainting.
And when he came to be ſomething compoſed, he returned thanks
to <hi>Lucius</hi> in termes that expreſſed much better his contentment,
then his gratitude, whileſt the admirable <hi>Aemylia</hi> retired into her
chamber, after having ſeen that joy did no leſs teſtifie <hi>Scipio's</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60667:112"/>
then grief had done ſome days before, and both paſſions
get even proofs of it as certain as dangerous.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo another thing that helped to allay the exceſſive
joy of our Illuſtrious Lover, which was, that <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Publius</hi>
told him, that for the good of Rome, they had reſolved not onely
to defer his marriage, but to keep the matter ſecret. For I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
(ſaid <hi>Lucius</hi>) if you ſhould marry <hi>Aemilia</hi> to day, we ſhould
loſe the forces of <hi>Pynaeas</hi> to morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you ought not to be
troubled at the deferring of a thing you are certain of, which is
done onely to retain a conſiderable aſſiſtance to the State. <hi>Scipio</hi>
was ſupriſed at theſe words; but love, joy and hope, ſuddenly
tranſporting him, he was upon the point (as he told me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
to declare to <hi>Lucius,</hi> that himſelf would perform actions
that ſhould repair the loſs of the <hi>Illyrians.</hi> Nevertheleſs, for that
virtue always guided that Illuſtrious Roman, and regulated as well
his words as action, he ſuppreſſed his ſentiments, and onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<hi>Lucius</hi> to permit that the marriage might be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
privately.</p>
                  <p>Do you think me capable, <hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted the father of
<hi>Emilia</hi>) to tranſact in the manner you ſpeak of, an action of luſtre
and rejoycing; and in which privacy always ſeems to hide ſome
conſiderable defect? No, no, <hi>Scipio,</hi> do not except it; I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
act in that manner; and I would not give <hi>Pyneas</hi> ſo juſt an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to complain of me, when the buſineſſe ſhould come to be
diſcovered. For the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> might ſay I had abuſed him
by ſuch a ſecret carriage of it; but he cannot accuſe me of any
thing whatſoever, when after he has ſerv'd us, I cauſe him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by the people of Rome, and afterwards prepare his mind
to ſuffer your marriage with moderation, by telling him, (as 'tis
time) that <hi>Claudia</hi> propounded it to me before himſelf declar'd to
me openly that he pretended to my alliance.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Scipio,</hi> by this courſe I act as I ought; and is it not
enough for you that I promiſe you <hi>Aemilia,</hi> ſince a word paſſed by
a perſon of my humour, is ſacred and inviolable. You ſee alſo that
I intend to take my time to temper the mind of a Lover before
whom I prefer his Rival, and that I act for the advantage of the
Common-wealth, by not depriving it of a powerful aid; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
though <hi>Pyneas</hi> has rendred <hi>Illyria</hi> tributary to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he is
not obliged to ſupply us with forces, and we have no right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
any thing of him beyond the Tribute which is impoſed upon his
Kingdom. But, My Lord (replyed <hi>Scipio</hi>) can you conſider the
violence of my paſſion without—But, <hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted <hi>Lucius</hi>)
can you conſider what I have ſaid without yielding to it? and would
you direct perſons who have very much reaſon for what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
becauſe you have very much love for what you aſpire to?
Theſe words pronounc'd with an aſpect Majeſtical, though not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and that by the perſon who alone had right to diſpoſe of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:60667:113"/>
made <hi>Scipio</hi> reflect ſeriouſly on the matter; ſo that revolving
in his mind for a few minutes, the happy change of his affairs, and
afterwards conſidering the generous and obliging manner of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s
proceeding, he preſum'd no longer to anſwer him, but onely
made him a profound reverence, as if to ſignifie that he ſubmitted
to his Orders. In the mean time before we went away from <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s
houſe, <hi>Publius</hi> went alone to <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s Chamber, where, (as
we knew afterwards (he gave her a thouſand teſtimonies of eſteem
and dearneſs, which that prudent Ladie received with all the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and ſubmiſſion, which ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to render to a
perſon of high quality, grave years, and extraordinary wit. After
whoſe return to us in the Hall, we departed, and went to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, who was extreamly glad to ſee us, eſpecially perceiving
we ſeem'd very joyful; but that which ſurpris'd us was, that when
he had embraced us, and expreſſed his tenderneſs to us, <hi>Publius</hi> told
him that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me from <hi>Lucius</hi>'s houſe, and that without loſing
time we were going to that of <hi>Regulus.</hi> Theſe words augmented
my fathers joy, who having once again embraced <hi>Scipio,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<hi>Publius</hi> to go accordingly to <hi>Regulus</hi>'s houſe, and <hi>Scipio</hi> and I
followed them. But as <hi>Publius</hi> and my father were ſpeaking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I was entertaining my ſelf with my Illuſtrious friend, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerning <hi>Emilia</hi>'s beauty, or in conjecturing the occaſion of
our going to <hi>Regulus</hi>'s houſe, my father turned about towards me,
and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d me he would not have me ſo ſurpriſed as <hi>Scipio</hi> had bin;
and therefore you muſt now, <hi>Laelius</hi> (added he) that you are going
to ſee <hi>Attilia,</hi> and moreover to engage your ſelf to her, and in all
appearance within a few days you ſhall marry that amiable perſon.
Verily, Madam, you will be ſurpriſed at the effect of theſe words;
for I had no ſooner heard them, but <hi>Attilia</hi> inſtantly preſented her
ſelf to my mind with her amiable, ſprightly, and gallant aſpect;
and I remember I thought upon the charmes of that fair Virgin with
a certain motion of dearneſs, ſuch as I had never reſented before.
But aſſoon as I came to <hi>Regulus</hi>'s houſe, and had caſt my eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his amiable ſiſter, that dearneſs made it ſelf more ſenſible in my
heart, and contrary to the practiſe of thoſe who ceaſe to love when
they marry their Miſtreſſes, I aſſure you I began to love <hi>Attilia</hi>
paſſionately from the time it was told me I ſhould marry her. And
indeed that fair perſon had charmes ſufficiently powerful to affect
the moſt inſenſible hearts. But it not being her Hiſtory that I am
relating, you will pleaſe to excuſe me, Madam, from repeating the
particularities of the converſation we made; it ſuffices that you
know it was extreamly handſome and agreeable that <hi>Attilia</hi> ſpoke,
but little in it, but very judiciouſly, and with much modeſty, and
that after we had ſet a day for the meeting of our friends, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
extreamly ſatisfied with the civility of <hi>Regulus,</hi> and all the
fair qualities of his amiable ſiſter. My Father detained <hi>Scipio</hi> that
right at his houſe, notwithſtanding <hi>Publius</hi>'s reluctance to part with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60667:113"/>
him; and after having taken care of our wounds by the reſiſtance
of the Chirurgions we brought with us from <hi>Oſtia,</hi> he left us in
the Chamber of <hi>Scipio,</hi> where that Illuſtrious Lover and I had the
ſweeteſt converſation that ever we had made, ſpeaking of nothing
but the pleaſing adventures that had befallen us, and frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon the circumſtances which ſeemed to augment our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie.</p>

               <p>THe report of our arrival being ſoon diſperſed about the
City, the next morning we received very many viſits from
our relations and friends at my fathers houſe, of which
the moſt acceptable was indeed that of <hi>Regulus</hi> and <hi>Emili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who came thither together. The converſation we had with them
was perfectly delightful, and the expreſſions of our mutual eſteem
ſo agreeable, and our diſcourſe ſo complacential and obliging, that
we received not without diſpleaſure other viſits that interrupted ſo
ſweet an entertainment. For our relations having reſolved to keep
ſecret the treaties that were between them, it behov'd us not only to
charge our diſcourſe before the company that came to us, but alſo
to uſe the ſame deportments amongſt our ſelves (vvhich likewiſe
vve have ever ſince obſerved) that vvere vvont to do before the
mentioning of our aliances. But, Madam, <hi>Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi>
had no ſooner left us, but amongſt other perſons that viſited us this
morning, vve vvere ſurpris'd to ſee ſome of the relations of <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Varro</hi> come to us, and to be aſcertain'd of vvhat vve had
underſtood only uncertainly, that the report had bin no more then

to him, but that <hi>Minutius</hi> had undoubtedly corrupted the ſlave
to whom the delivery of it had bin recommended; for <hi>Appius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
us he did not find him at home when he return'd out of the
Country, whither <hi>Varro</hi> had engaged him to go in reference to an
affair which he told him was of great importance. But, Madam, if
the ſight of our Parents and our friends gave us contentment, we
received one more conſiderable in the afternoon at <hi>Lucius</hi>'s houſe.
For after <hi>Scipio</hi> had bin at his fathers, whom he deſired to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he drew me to go with him to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> telling me that ſince his
love preceded mine, it was more juſt to go to <hi>Lucius</hi>'s houſe before
going to ſee <hi>Attilia.</hi> But, <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered I with very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
I am oblig'd to go to that of <hi>Regulus,</hi> and you may, if you
pleaſe go alone to <hi>Aemilia.</hi> True, <hi>Laelius</hi> (replyed he) but if you
come not with me, there will want ſomething to the pleaſure which
I am to receive there. But, verily, <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered I with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of diſcontent) you are unjuſt to prefer your pleaſure above
my duty. If we could not both go together as well to the houſe of
<hi>Lucius,</hi> as that of <hi>Regulus</hi> (replyed he) I would be ready to do
whatever you pleaſed. But, <hi>Laelius</hi> (added he ſmiling) do not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your ſelf, I will not cauſe you to fail in that exactneſs for which
you reproached me, the firſt went to <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe to ſee <hi>Emilia</hi>
there.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce ended theſe words, but we beheld a ſlave belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Regulus</hi> paſs by, of whom I demanded if his Maſter were
at home; but when he anſwered me he was gone abroad, and I was
going to aks him the ſame queſtion concerning <hi>Attilia;</hi> I was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſeiz'd with a kind of fear which cauſed me to change counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and I felt a certain diſturbance in my ſelf, that with-held
me from ſpeaking, which <hi>Scipio</hi> did not fail to take notice of, and
ſmile at. After which having askt the ſlave what I was unable to do,
we were told the amiable ſiſter of <hi>Regulus</hi> was with the Illuſtrious
<hi>Emilia;</hi> wherefore without loſing time in a further conteſt, vve
went immediately where we were to ſee the two fair perſons whom
vve lov'd. I ſhall not tell you, Madam, that if I ſeem'd timerous in
ſpeaking of <hi>Attilia,</hi> I vvas much more ſo vvhen at <hi>Lucius</hi>'s houſe,
I vvas approaching near to that fair perſon; I ſhall alſo forbear to
mention to you vvhat ſatisfaction I reſented vvhile I vvas enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that lovely Virgin, vvho treated me vvith all the ſvveetneſs
that ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to expreſs to a Lover, whom ſhe
was ſhortly to marry, and that without repugnance; for that I am
onely to ſpeak concerning the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
which he adores. You may pleaſe therefore to know, Madam,
that as we entered into <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Chamber, after notice given her,
and her permiſſion obtained, vve found only <hi>Attilia</hi> vvith her, and
tvvo or three other Virgins vvho vvere employed about vvorks in
Silk, at the end of the Chamber oppoſite to the Bed, vvhich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60667:115"/>
cauſed us to imagine, that they had no intention of ſeeing
much company that day, and conceiving at the ſame time that we
were priviledg'd, and that we ſhould alone have all the liberty we
could wiſh to entertain them; which thought gave us extream ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Aſſoon as we had made our reverence with a profound
reſpect to thoſe two admirable perſons, they ſaluted us very civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though without offering to look upon us; and we had ſcarce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
to meet their eyes, to obſerve in them what we were to
hope or fear, but we beheld a pure vermilion aſcend into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
in which, to our happineſs, neither anger nor averſion ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have any influences. Yet this made us not more confident;
but we advanced towards them with a very profound ſubmiſſion,
and deſired their pardon for that we were come to ſee them in a time
which perhaps they had reſolved to paſs in private. 'Tis true (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Aemilia</hi> with infinite modeſty and ſweetneſs) we had no
purpoſe to ſee much company to day; but for that I have all the
ſubmiſſion to the pleaſure of <hi>Lucius</hi> that I ought, and <hi>Attilia</hi> but
now told me ſhe had the like for that of her Brother, whom ſhe
is willing to comply with; we have not preſumed to refuſe your
viſit after the commands laid upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aemilia</hi> in pronouncing theſe laſt words, felt that lovely redneſs
to increaſe, which blended it ſelf ſo agreeably with the purity of
the complexion, that it was perfectly diſcernable upon her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and <hi>Scipio</hi> could not hear them without reſenting an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
trouble; ſo that beholding that fair perſon with eyes
that ſhewed both a violent love, and a very ſenſible diſpleaſure: Ah!
Madam (ſaid he to her ſighing) you are extreamly cruel, in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me preſently into a condition of not doubting of my miſery,
and intimating to me in the beginning of our converſation, that I am
obliging for the honour I receive, rather to the command of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
then to your own goodneſs. But that is not all, Madam, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he with the ſame air) for I find ſomething ſo rigorous in your
ſaying, <hi>You dar'd not refuſe my viſit,</hi> that I can imagine nothing in
the world more cruel. In ſincerity (replyed that prudent Lady)
I confeſs to you, I would not have received it in the manner I do, if
I did not know in what degree <hi>Lucius</hi> requires me to reſpect you.
Ah! Madam, (anſwered he ſighing) if it be true that you are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
in ſpeaking as you do, it is too true that I am miſerable. But,
Madam (proceeded he ſome moments after, he had beheld her with
a very paſſionate air) ſweeten the matter at leaſt, and in ſtead of
telling me you would not have dared to refuſe my viſit after the
command of <hi>Lucius,</hi> I conjure you to ſay, you would not have
dared to receive it without that command. Verily, <hi>Scipio</hi> (replyed
ſhe with a modeſt ſmile) you make me wonder at the difference you
put between thoſe two expreſſions. But without puzling my ſelf
in being ſo ſevere as you are to examine them, I ſhall not much ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to conſent to what you deſire, and to permit you to take what I
ſaid according as ſeems moſt agreeable to you. I know, Madam
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60667:116"/>
(reply'd this paſſionate Lover) you will not find the ſame difference
in it that I do; for 'tis of a nature not preſently to be diſcerned,
and there is nothing but love that can find it out. So that, Madam,
I do not wonder you confound thoſe two expreſſions; for however
lively your wit be, it is impoſſible it ſhould apprehend ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
'tis your heart that muſt do it: But, alas! it is requiſite
that that Illuſtrious heart be firſt affected, and give me to obſerve
upon your countenance that you well underſtand all the force of the
terms you uſe, and employ them not but upon choiſe. Then would
it be, Madam (proceeded he with a mixture of ſeveral paſſions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in his eyes) that I ſhould be as happy as I am now unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
for ſince I know all the tenderneſs of love, and that all
that proceeds from you, Madam, makes an impreſsion in my heart,
I never fail to reſent to the full whatſoever it behoves me to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> continued this diſcourſe ſtill with a paſsionate air, whilſt I
was ſpeaking to the fair <hi>Attilia;</hi> but the Illuſtrious <hi>Aemilia</hi> always
anſwered him with ſo much prudence and modeſty, that at the
ſame time he eſteemed her much more, and alſo complained of her
for it; ſo that, Madam, I cannot determine whither the amorous
<hi>Scipio</hi> reſented this day at <hi>Lucius</hi>'s houſe more grief or joy, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went from it more ſatisfied or diſcontented; for <hi>Aemilia</hi>
treated him with very much complacency in every thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
not his paſsion, and which was moſt of all obliging to him,
ſhe acknowledged with great freedom and ſweetneſs, that ſhe would
obey the command of <hi>Lucius</hi> with leſs repugnance then ſhe ſhould
have had for any other. But on the other ſide, that which afflicted
this Illuſtrious lover, was that ſhe continually acted and ſpoke with
ſuch reſervation, that he could never obſerve that ſhe reſented any
thing for him beyond eſteem, or that he had gained upon her heart.
The next day, indeed, he was much more happy, as you ſhall now
underſtand; for, <hi>Pyneas,</hi> who arrived that morning, went to paſs
the afternoon with <hi>Attilia,</hi> becauſe he was informed <hi>Aemilia</hi> was
gone to her houſe with her brother. <hi>Fabius,</hi> whoſe love was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
was there alſo with <hi>Cato:</hi> and there was likewiſe two very
lovely perſons that lived not far from that place, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
thither by <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whoſe preſence occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
the converſation to be more general, and conſequently more
agreeable to all thoſe that had no particular intereſt. So that, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>Scipio</hi> had no great reaſon to be ſatisfied with this kind of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and tumultuous entertainment, where uſually there are ſome
whoſe humour leads them to the affairs of State, or an Army, whilſt
others deſire onely to ſpeak of Balls, Comedies and Faſhions, where
the diſcourſe is of a hundred different ſubjects; and laſtly, where
every one produces what his intereſt or genius ſeverally incites him
to. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Scipio</hi> had very great reaſon to think himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
for <hi>Aemilia</hi> received the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> and <hi>Fabius,</hi> with all the
coldneſſe ſhe could ſhew without ſeeming uncivil; and whilſt ſhe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60667:116"/>
treated them with a kind of ſeverity, of which perſons that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
in ſuch matters eaſily take notice, ſhe approved with great
complacency whatever was ſpoken by <hi>Scipio,</hi> and comported her
ſelf with a more obliging air towards him then towards the reſt,
which cauſed all the company who were ignorant of the ſecret tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
to believe <hi>Scipio Aemilia</hi>'s friend, as it was known I was,
and none ever ſuſpected him to be her Lover. For it was always
believed, Madam, as without queſtion you have reported, that <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
was not capable of being amorous of any thing but glory; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that no perſon could have imagin'd, knowing <hi>Emilia</hi>'s hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and having never heard of the command <hi>Lucius</hi> had laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, that that ſevere Virgin would have treated <hi>Scipio</hi> ſo obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as ſhe did, if ſhe had known he was inflamed with love for her.
But, Madam, this Illuſtrious Lover had ſoon after a more ſenſible
ſatisfaction; for a Lady of high quality, named <hi>Martia,</hi> Aunt to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilia</hi>
(who dwelt at <hi>Regulus</hi>'s houſe, becauſe having no children of
her own, ſhe deſired to take care of her nieces education after her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death) entered into the Chamber where we were, and after
the performance of civilities uſual in ſuch occaſions, told us the day
was ſufficiently fair to invite us down into the Garden; whither ſhe
accordingly cauſed us to deſcend both to take the air there, and for
the pleaſure of the walk. But for that <hi>Pyneas</hi> was a ſtranger, and
had newly come from his journey, <hi>Martia</hi> treated him with more
exact civility, which occaſioned him at our going forth of <hi>Attilia</hi>'s
Chamber, to give the hand to her Aunt, whereby <hi>Scipio</hi> had the
opportunity to lead <hi>Emilia:</hi> For, indeed, though <hi>Fabius</hi> was a very
comly perſon, and infinitely ingenious, yet he was of a temper neer
to that of <hi>Cato;</hi> he appeared ſo cold, ſo ſage, and ſo ſlow in his
carriage, that he was no very dangerous perſon to obſtruct the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of a Rival; nor was he very like thoſe dextrous Lovers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
by a way they have learnt in the world, are always ingraciating with
their Miſtreſſes, by rendering them a hundred little Offices, leading
them, and whiſpering in their ear, and all this without being lyable
to be taxed in vvhat they do, of intruſion or oſtentation; beſides
that in brief, the coldneſs <hi>Emilia</hi> ſhevved him this day, vvas not I
conceive very effectual to diſpel that of his temper. By this means,
<hi>Scipio,</hi> as I told you, had the happineſs to give the hand to <hi>Emilia;</hi>
and being thoſe tvvo Illuſtrious perſons are chiefly concerned in my
relation, you muſt knovv, Madam, that vvhen vve vvere in <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s
Garden, vvhich is extream ſpacious, and the vvalks exceeding
handſome, <hi>Scipio</hi> beheld the fair perſon he led vvith infinite love
and reſpect. After vvhich, alas! I beſeech you, Madam (ſaid he
to her ſuddenly) be pleaſed to tell me vvhether I am more in favour
with you then <hi>Varro, Pyneas,</hi> and <hi>Fabius;</hi> or, to explain my ſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Tell me, I conjure you, whether I ſhould have bin treated this
day as the two latter were, if <hi>Lucius</hi> had not bin favourable to
me. Being he has bin ſo (anſwered ſhe) I am obliged to have ſuch
ſentiments for you as I ought not to have any other. But, Madam
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60667:117"/>
(replied he) is it to that obligation you ſpeak of, that I owe my
happineſs, and will you not be pleaſed to let me know, whether it
would have been lawfull for me, to hope you would have done
that out of goodneſs, which you have done out of obedience? Since
that which you cal happineſs is aſcertained to you (anſwered ſhe) why
do you ſeek to bring it in doubt by ſpeaking as you do? Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(interrupted he) I have no longer any happineſs, if to ſpeak
as I do, be to bring it to doubt; For indeed, I apprehend that in
ſuch occaſions as this we are ſpeaking of, it is impoſſible for a man
to be effectually happy, if he owes his felicity only to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a Father. Speak therefore, Madam, ſpeak (continued
he ſighing) but not to kill me with grief: ſay, I beſeech you, that
<hi>Scipio</hi> owes not all to <hi>Lucius,</hi> but that the adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> would
have prefer'd him above all his Rivals, if ſhe had had the liberty of
choice. Sincerely (anſwer'd ſhe with very much goodneſs) I will
acknowledge to you, that I ſhould not account my ſelf juſt, if I
could admit <hi>Varro</hi> into my mind in concurrence with the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and you would have cauſe to believe me very little
gratefull, if after all you have done. I were capable to preferre ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Fabius,</hi> or the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> before <hi>Scipio,</hi> to whom I have
without doubt ſuch obligations, as I have not to thoſe you call your
Rivals.</p>
               <p>The Illuſtrious <hi>Aemylia</hi> pronounced theſe words with ſo much
ſweetneſs, and ſuch an amiable freedome, that <hi>Scipio</hi> could not but
be highly pleaſed with them, which yet he was not abſolutely;
for after a few moments he reflected that <hi>Aemylia</hi> ſeemed rather to
act out of generoſity then inclination, and that ſhe would have had
the ſame ſentiments for any of her Rivals, if he had done the ſame
ſervices for her that himſelf had performed. So that not knowing
well whether he ought to make remerciments for them, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
he ſpoke after a manner ſo incoherent, his ſighes ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
his diſcourſe, and there appeared in his eyes ſo much love,
fear, and reſpect together, that if <hi>Aemilia</hi> were not abſolutely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with it, it was only for that ſhe accuſtomed her ſelf to hear
with inſenſibility, all the moſt paſſionate expreſſions of her Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Lover. But this prudent Lady having very much ſeverity
in her ſoul, ſhe ſpoke nothing that could perſwade <hi>Scipio</hi> he had
touched her heart: 'Tis true indeed, the fair eyes of that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perſon, were little more favourable then her mouth, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tell <hi>Scipio</hi> in a language, which appeared ſtill timerous (as I
may ſo ſpeak) that an Illuſtrious Lover, who has all the advantages
of nature, and fortune joyned with excellent acquired accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might hope to become happy. Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> parted at this
time from her upon good termes, and afterwards had ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
with that Illuſtrious perſon, during which ſhe diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him all the eſteem ſhe had for him; ſhe told him with very
much freedome part of her ſentiments, and intimated to him upon
divers occaſions, part of the dearneſs ſhe already reſented for him.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60667:117"/>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> alſo underſtood that <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Aemilius</hi> alwaies infinitely
eſteemed him, and that <hi>Claudia</hi> had ever ſo great a dearneſs for
him, that ſhe was oftentimes upon the point to tell his mother a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before ſhe died that ſhe deſigned <hi>Aemilia</hi> for the uniting of their
families. He likewiſe learnt that <hi>Claudia,</hi> before her departure
from <hi>Rome</hi> had commanded her adorable daughter, to have ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of eſteem and acknowledgment for <hi>Scipio;</hi> and that ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
left <hi>Rome</hi> for no other reaſon, but only that ſhe might not
be obliged to diſcover to <hi>Lucius</hi> all that ſhe knew of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Varro:</hi> And in brief, this paſſionate Lover had ſo many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to belief himſelf happy in thoſe delightfull entertainments, that
I may conclude he was ſo in reality. But Madam, whileſt love and
joy are the paſſions that rule in the illuſtrious heart of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and
this famous <hi>Roman</hi> is enjoying all the purity of delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they afford, Intelligence is brought from the Camp of <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi>
that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had advanced towards <hi>Trebia,</hi> that the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians</hi>
had already made excurſions as far as the banks of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that they forraged, plundered, and waſted all the Country,
and made deſolation in all places, whence the <hi>Romane</hi> Army might
draw ſubſiſtence. The Carrier that brought theſe tidings certified
alſo, that <hi>Sempronius</hi> was upon the point to draw his army out of
their entrenchments, and to march directly againſt the Enemies,
without expecting till <hi>Publius,</hi> his Colleque, were in a condition
to joyne with him and fight them. Upon which all the Officers and
Valunteers that were then in <hi>Rome,</hi> took order the ſame day for
their affaires that they might depart the next, which many accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
did; for the moſt part of them expecting ſuddenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome ſuch tidings, had all things in readineſs that could not
be provided in an inſtant, to the end they might have nothing to do,
that might afterwards occaſion their delay at <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſhall not tell
you that <hi>Publius</hi> as unfit as he was ſtill for an expedition, would
notwithſtanding depart, and reſolved alſo to carry the young <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
with him. I ſhall alſo omit to tell you what regret I had to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<hi>Attilia,</hi> or what I ſaid to that fair perſon, when I was upon
the point to take my leave of her, and how obligingly ſhe anſwered
me. Nor do I think it neceſſary to let you know that <hi>Flavius</hi> at
this time was intertained into the attendance of my Illuſtrious friend,
who had ſent to him at <hi>Oſtia</hi> a reward of ineſtimable value. Only I
ſhall tell you, Madam, that it was requiſite for <hi>Scipio</hi> to depart too,
notwithſtanding the indiſpoſedneſs he was in by reaſon of his
wounds, and the extream reluctancy he had to leave <hi>Aemilia.</hi> But
what did he not ſay, or what did he not do before his going? he
went to the houſe of <hi>Lucius,</hi> he ſaw <hi>Aemylia,</hi> and being in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the admirable perſon, and conſidering that he was now at
the inſtant to leave her, he beheld her a long time without being
able to open his mouth to expreſs his regret. After which, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſhe was a little mollified, Alas! Madam (ſaid he to her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully)
muſt I be ſeparated from you! muſt I part from the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60667:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
place where you are! muſt I go where you are not! Ah! no, no,
Madam, I will never do it: glory has no longer any charmes to
move me, if I muſt go ſo far from you to ſeek it, and its luſter
ſeems to me too obſcure and too fatall, if it muſt withdraw me from
that of your eyes. As he was proceeding, his ſighes interrupted
him; and though he had a thouſand paſſionate and tender thoughts
to expreſs, yet he was not able to ſpeak, either becauſe he had too
many things to ſay at once, or for that his ſoul was ſuddenly too
much ingroſſed by Grief and Love. 'Tis true, theſe very paſſions
ſpoke themſeves by hindering him from ſpeaking, and expreſt his
ſentiments in ſo affecting a ſtrain, that at length the fair eyes of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi>
laid open all the tenderneſs, which that fair and diſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
had cautiouſly concealed to that houre, ſo that theſe two Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
perſons beheld one another for ſome time without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
after which <hi>Aemilia</hi> with a melancholy that had ſomething in
it infinitely ſweet and amiable, told him there was an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for his departure; for you are obliged to it (continued ſhe)
both becauſe you are a <hi>Roman,</hi> and eſpecially becauſe you are <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio.</hi>
Go therefore (added ſhe) go whither glory calls you; and
if it be true that you have a reluctancy to part from one, begin to
overcome your ſelf, that you may be able afterwards more eaſily
to overcome our enemies, and make us hope that he that can gain a
victory over <hi>Scipio,</hi> may well pretend to gain one over <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
Ah! Madam (anſwered he) how difficult is it to gain the victory
you ſpeak of, and how contrary is this to thoſe of Conquerors,
ſince the heart it ſelf, is unwilling to enter the combat, in order to
gaining it? It behoves you then (replied ſhe) to ſerve your ſelf
of contrary meanes, and I conceive flight will ſoon bring you to
the attainment of the victory we ſpeak of; fly therefore, I conjure
you, <hi>Scipio:</hi> fly the preſence of a perſon who ha's been the cauſe
that you have been capable of weakneſs: And to ſhew you (added
we with an extream goodneſs) that 'tis only for your glory, and
not through averſion that I entreat you to depart, I promiſe you
that I will pray the Gods for your preſervation, that I ſhall be glad
that you preſerve for me the ſentiments which you already have,
and that I ſhall have ſuch for you (added ſhe caſting down her eyes
and bluſhing a little) as ſhall be full of a reall eſteem and kindneſs,
which the command of <hi>Lucius</hi> and your own merit ſufficiently au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe.
Ending theſe words ſhe offered to go into her cloſet;
but <hi>Scipio</hi> ſtayed her by her robe, and caſting himſelf at her feet,
becauſe there was only one waiting woman in the chamber, from
whom <hi>Aemilia</hi> concealed nothing, How? Madam (ſaid he with
extream grief) have you the cruelty to leave me, after having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
me by a too rigorous prudence to depart from you? will
you ſo cruelly deprive me of the ſatisfaction which I receive; and
in brief, Madam, will you have me fly from a perſon for whom I
live; from a perſon, without whom I cannot continue one moment,
and who alone in the world is able to render me happy? Ah? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60667:118"/>
this is not poſſible. Yet it muſt be ſo, <hi>Scipio</hi> (interrupted
ſhe) and abſolute neceſſity requires it. <hi>Aemilia</hi> pronounced theſe
words with ſo much majeſty, and ſuch an imperious aire, that the
amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> durſt not anſwer; yet he retained her ſtill, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beheld her a while, after a manner extreamly reſpectfull and
paſſionate; Well Madam, (ſaid he ſighing) I will go ſince you
command me; but I beſeech you (added he with the ſame aire)
grant me that which I am going to requeſt of you, ſince in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
wherein matters are, I may deſire it without injury to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
I owe you. After that which is paſt (anſwered ſhe with her
firſt ſweetneſs) I may without doubt do many things for you; Be
pleaſed then, Madam (ſaid he) to ſuffer an excellent Painter of
<hi>Sicyonia,</hi> who is arrived in this City two or three daies ſince, to
draw your pourtrait, to the end I may carry it to the places where I
muſt not ſee you, and comfort my ſelf with the ſight of it, for the
miſeries I am there to ſuffer. In truth, <hi>Scipio</hi> (anſwered ſhe) I am
extreamly ſorry, that I am obliged to refuſe you what you deſire.
How? Madam (interrupted he) will you refuſe me the favour
which I requeſt? <hi>Scipio,</hi> I muſt do ſo (anſwered ſhe) and <hi>Lucius</hi>
is the ſole perſon in the world that can induce me to admit what you
ſpeak of. Well, Madam (replied he) ſince <hi>Lucius</hi> can effect it,
I do not deſpaire of obtaining what I deſire; and I conceive (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he) that after all that he has done for me, he has not the ſame
ſevere cautiouſneſs that you have. There is no time left to intercede
with <hi>Lucius</hi> to that purpoſe (interrupted ſhe) and you would abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
diſoblige me, if you ſhould do it. For I put no difference
between giving my picture, and teaching the meanes to obtain it,
nor have I leſs ſcruple for the firſt then the latter. But, Madam,
(ſaid he infinitely dejected) what ſhall I then carry with me, to
ſweeten the cruelties of my abſence? The love of glory (anſwered
ſhe) and not of certain things which may in ſome manner render
you capable of weakneſs, as I have obſerved at this preſent. The
things you ſpeak of, Madam (replied he) are of value beyond all
the laurels that glory can Crown me with: ſo that, Madam, if you—As
he was proceeding to ſpeak, <hi>Aemilius, Regulus</hi> and I entered
into the chamber; and being we perceived <hi>Scipio</hi> was dejected and
ſad, <hi>Aemilius</hi> told his ſiſter, ſhe was obliged by very many reſpects
to a dearneſs for <hi>Scipio,</hi> and eſpecially in this conjuncture. But
brother (anſwered ſhe with very much ſweetneſs) what would
you have me do, when he deſires things of me which I cannot grant
him. Chooſe, Madam, (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) chooſe what you pleaſe
to give me. I ſhould be much troubled (replied ſhe) if it were
requiſite for me to do what you ſay; for what ever I gave, if I ſhould
conſider <hi>Aemilia</hi> were the perſon that gave it, I ſhould think ſhe
gave too much; and on the other ſide, if I conſidered (added ſhe
with great goodneſs) that <hi>Scipio</hi> were the perſon that received it,
perhaps I ſhould imagine ſhe gave too little: She had ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
theſe words, which manifeſted an extream delicate mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60667:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as well as much dearneſs for <hi>Scipio,</hi> but <hi>Aemilius</hi> anſwered her,
that the choice propoſed to her, was not very difficult to be made;
for ſiſter, (added he) you need only give <hi>Scipio</hi> the Scarfe which
you promiſed me; Being I promiſed it to you (replied ſhe) it is
now yours, and it conſequently belongs to you to give it. I am
not forward to believe (anſwered <hi>Aemilius</hi> ſmiling) that <hi>Scipio</hi>
deſires to receive it from my hands; therefore ſiſter, if you pleaſe,
let it be from yours; and to give you conveniency to preſent it to
him, in a manner that may more endeare it, (added he with the
ſame aire) I ſhall withdraw with <hi>Laelius, Regulus.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he went out after theſe words, though he perceived <hi>Emilia</hi> was
unwilling he ſhould, and ſeemed extreamly perplexed. <hi>Scipio</hi>
ſtill preſſing that fair perſon, with extream reſpect, and a thouſand
tokens of a violent paſſion, at laſt obtained the Scarfe <hi>Emilius</hi> ſpoke
of, which was carnation ambrodered with ſilver, wherein were ſeen
the Characters of the admirable Virgin that gave it; but ſhe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it to him with an aſpect, that manifeſted a conteſt of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and kindneſs in her heart. After which ſhe commanded <hi>Scipio</hi>
to depart, and bad him adiew, having firſt tendered her hand to
him, which he kiſſed very reſpectfully; and as ſhe retired, ſhe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
face away to hide it from <hi>Scipio,</hi> the teares which undoubtedly
fell from her fair eyes, and ſo entring into her Cloſet preſently
made faſt the dore. <hi>Scipio</hi> croſt his armes and ſighed, in beholding
this department of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and the grief he reſented would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have hindred him from going forth of the chamber, of that fair
perſon; if he had not endeavoured to moderate it by caſting his
eyes upon the Scarfe which he had receiv'd, and recall'd into his
mind the obliging expreſſions, and ſhewes of tenderneſs, he had
obſerv'd in that adorable perſon, at her ſeparating from him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
theſe very thoughts afflicted him oftentimes; for he could not
conceive it poſſible for him, without dying with ſorrow to depart
from a divine perſon, who had very much goodneſs for him, and
began to give him ſome tokens of a kindneſs, which certainly was
able to charme the hearts of the moſt inſenſible. Nevertheleſs
when he came alſo to conſider, that it behov'd him to be wholly
cover'd with glory, that he might merit the eſteem of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and
likewiſe remembr'd what he had done before he was a Lover, and
ſo proceeding to think of the great exploits he was obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
in order to rendring himſelf in ſome manner worthy of the
moſt fair and illuſtrious perſon of the world, his courage was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to as high a pitch as his love. Upon which he left the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Emilia</hi> with a generous reſolution, and it may be ſaid that
the conſideration of this fair perſon now drive him thence, as it had
before attracted and retain'd him there. Yet before his going he
made many civilities to <hi>Silia,</hi> which was ſhe of <hi>Emilia's</hi> attendants,
that was moſt favour'd with her friendſhip, and privacy of her fair
miſtreſs. After which as he was going away and paſſed into the
hall, he beheld <hi>Lucius</hi> to enter, whom had been call'd by ſome of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60667:119"/>
his ſervants, becauſe he had given them order, notice ſhould be
brought him when <hi>Scipio</hi> came to his houſe. My Illuſtrious friend
preſently made a reverence to the Father of <hi>Emilia,</hi> and afterwards
made him a complement, in which he expreſſed both his grandure
and generoſity, together with that profound reſpect which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
all his words and actions. Upon which <hi>Lucius</hi> embrac't him
and anſwer'd him with a thouſand teſtimonies of eſteem and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and then commanded him, as a father, to take care and to
preſerve himſelf in all occaſions, where the ſervice of <hi>Rome</hi> was not
concern'd. But, Madam, not to detain you with any more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of <hi>Scipio's</hi> actions before his departure, you may pleaſe
to know that the next morning we went out of <hi>Rome,</hi> very early in
a very brave company; For <hi>Publius</hi> was ſo generally eſteemed that
the greateſt part of the Officers that were yet at <hi>Rome,</hi> would goe
along with him, as likewiſe all the volunteers did. <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>
were alſo of our troop with <hi>Servilius, Flamminius, Marcellus, Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi>
and many others of that rank; but amongſt all that number
of gallant perſons, there was a moſt intimate friendſhip contracted
between, <hi>Scipio, Emilius, Regulus</hi> and me, which ſociety was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
delectable, that we injoy'd a thouſand contentments du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our journey. Not but that <hi>Scipio</hi> was extreamly inclined to
penſiveneſs and melancholy, if we had not ſoon obſerv'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to divert it, whereby he moderated his anxiety; and
became by degrees capable of entertaining a certain aire of joy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with us. For being infinitely amorous, he had nevertheleſs
an unqueſtionable aſſurance of poſſeſſing the fair perſon which he
lov'd. And that which rendred our pleaſure greater, was, that
<hi>Aemylius</hi> had as great hope of poſſeſſing <hi>Papyria,</hi> whom he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſionately
enamor'd of, as I had to marry <hi>Attilia.</hi> So that we
were all happy Lovers excepting <hi>Regulus,</hi> who inſtead of being a
Lover, had his heart poſſeſſed with hatred, yet he enjoy'd no leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
ſince he was going to fight againſt a Nation whom he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in perfection. But, Madam, when we arrived at the Army, we
found our ſelves in danger of loſing our former contentment, and
even ready to fight one againſt another upon occaſion of a conteſt
that happened at a Council of War, which was held aſſoon as <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
was arrived. For, you muſt know, Madam, <hi>Sempronius,</hi> who
was a perſon of high courage, but wanted ſomething of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
requiſite to a great Captain, was abſoutely deſirous to
give battail, fearing leſt the new Conſuls that were ſhortly to be
created, ſhould come and prevent him of that glory; beſides, that
he was puft up with the good ſucceſs that a party of two thouſand
Roman Horſe, had had another of three thouſand <hi>Numidians,</hi> who
were beaten and diſpoil'd of a prodigious booty that they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
to the Camp of <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Publius</hi> on the other ſide, who was one of thoſe Great men that
are ſatisfied in themſelves, both of their own courage, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their intentions, and who beſides that advantage, enjoy a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60667:120"/>
ſolid glory acquir'd by a thouſand brave actions, would conſider
nothing in this occaſion but the advantage of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
he could not conſent to the reſolution of his Collegue, and
maintain'd it was abſolutely important to decline fighting for a
time. Then we muſt decline it for ever (interrupted <hi>Sempronius</hi>
roughly) for ſince the two Conſuls are joyned together, I think it
ought not be declared till a third be created by a Law and ſent to
our aſſiſtance. Say therefore (added he with the ſame air)
that you will wait till you are perfectly cured, vvhich yet I account
not very material; for we ought never to conſider our particular
intereſt, vvhen the Glory of <hi>Rome</hi> is in queſtion. For the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(anſvvered <hi>Publius</hi>) you ought not to conſider yours, as I ſee
you only do; But, <hi>Sempronius</hi> (proceeded he fiercely) vve ſhall ſee
in the fight, vvhether the inconvenience I ſtill am under by reaſon
of my vvounds, vvill retard me from performing the actions of a
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and whether afterwards you and I may not have a diſcourſe
concerning the law of a third Conſul you tell me of. In the mean
time (added he) endeavouring to moderate himſelf) in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the end of the battel, I would at preſent, as Conſul of <hi>Rome,</hi>
draw you from your error, and convince you that it is by no means
expedient to fight <hi>Hannibal.</hi> For we have intelligence (continued
he) that <hi>Mago Bardo</hi> is come from <hi>Sicily</hi> to joyn with him, and that a
conſiderable number of <hi>Gauls</hi> are added to his Army; ſo that we
ought to expect till that numerous Army diſperſe it ſelf, which in
all appearance will ſhortly come to paſs. For, <hi>Italy</hi> being ſtill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
intirely ours, <hi>Hannibal</hi> will be neceſſitated continually, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to getting Ammunitions of War and Proviſion, to ſend out
parties which our Allies will encounter with; beſides that the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
who make a great part of our enemies forces, will certainly in a
ſhort time retire into their own Country; for there is a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of impatience peculiar to that Nation, as well as a daring and
generous ardor whereby they will become weary of bearing Arms
and not uſing them; and it being very eaſie for them to retreat, in
all probability they will not be ſlow to do it.</p>
               <p>If theſe words of <hi>Publius</hi> did not abſolutely convince his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
yet they perſwaded the greateſt part of the Convention,
and even hindered <hi>Sempronius</hi> himſelf, who conſidered the weight
of them, for returning a ſharp anſwer, which would without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
have deſperately embroiled us. But the unhappineſs was, that
though <hi>Publius</hi> had more partakers, as well as greater reaſon then
his Collegue, yet there were fewer that declared for his opinion;
becauſe in that of <hi>Sempronius</hi> there was a certain ſplendor of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
which is more powerfully attractive then ſolid wiſdom,
that is not alwayes judg'd aright of in Armies, and which we ſcarce
ever dare follow. Wherefore all that <hi>Publius</hi> could do, was not to
iſſue forth of his Intrenchments during the time he commanded:
but aſſoon as it came to <hi>Sempronius</hi> to give orders, he could not
longer continue in his Camp; beſides that there was an occaſion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60667:120"/>
offered, which ſtrangely ſeconded his intention. For <hi>Maharbal</hi> and
<hi>Mago</hi> came in the head of four thouſand Horſe, to the Gate of the
line of our Trenches. Upon which <hi>Sempronius</hi> preſently ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
four thouſand Romans to horſe, the command of which he gave
to <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Regulus.</hi> In which preferring of <hi>Scipio</hi> before all other
Romans, he did juſtice to his birth and valour, and proceeded ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
by making it appear, that if he had conteſted againſt <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
it was out of no inducement of hatred or envie; nor was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon that he preferred <hi>Regulus</hi> before many others, for beſides
that he was a perſon of infinite courage, he had already more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in Arms, then the greateſt part of his equals in age and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and moreover he was uſed to ſue for theſe kind of emploments
with as much earneſtly as the moſt ambitious Roman could do for
the office of Conſul or Dictator. <hi>Aemylius, Marcellus, Flaminius,</hi>
and I rang'd our ſelves with our friends, and reſolved to fight under
them, as likewiſe all the volunteers ſoon after did, and amongſt the
reſt the young <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we marched out of our Trenches with ſuch alacrity and
promiſing fierceneſs, that our party drew the eyes and hearts of
our Generals, and excited admiration in all the Army. Though
<hi>Scipio</hi> were yet indiſpoſed by reaſon of his wounds, yet I
may ſay he felt then no inconvenience from them; for beſides that
motion and activeneſs uſually ſuſpends thoſe ſorts of pain, the Idea
of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and the preſence of glory (as I may ſo ſpeak) had a
greater effect then his agitation. I ſhall forbear to deſcribe to you,
Madam, the prodigious valour we admired this day in <hi>Aemilius,</hi>
and omit alſo to tell you in what manner <hi>Regulus</hi> ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and what my good fortune enabled me to perform; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſpeak only in relation to <hi>Scipio,</hi> I muſt inform you, Madam,
that that Illuſtrious Roman no ſooner perceived that the four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe under the conduct of <hi>Maharbal</hi> and <hi>Mago,</hi> made a ſtand
to expect us, but he fell in upon them with an unparallel'd impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity:
he would uſe onely his ſword, becauſe other weapons could
not ſo well have bin manag'd by his ardour; but he imployed that
ſo couragiouſly, that he performed miraculous action with it; he
dangerouſly wounded <hi>Maharbal,</hi> killed three or four Officers, and
at length made our enemies give gronud after a reſiſtance of an honr
and half. He drove them back as far as the main body of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was ready drawn up in battalia, without their Trenches,
to come to their relief: and when we obſerved <hi>Sempronius</hi> had
done the ſame for us, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had done for <hi>Maharbal,</hi> we
charged the right wing of our enemies which was commanded by
<hi>Braveus,</hi> King of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> becauſe it conſiſted of Auxiliary
forces, and as it hapned, <hi>Pyneus</hi> commanded our left wing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
backt his Rival, though he was ignorant of it. But that
paſſionate King knowing that <hi>Aemilius</hi> was fighting in the ſame
place, preſently came to the head of his ſquadron, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
joyned with us. At which time he performed a thouſand brave
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60667:121"/>
actions; ſo that it would not have bin difficult for us to have bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thoſe we were engaged with by this re-enforcement, if on a
ſuddain we had not bin called off to run to the ſuccour of <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and <hi>Publius.</hi> But there hapned two or three ſtrange accidents
in a moment, which ſoon loſt us the advantage we had gained at
firſt; for <hi>Mago Barſa,</hi> with ſix thouſand horſe, iſſued forth of an
ambuſh where <hi>Hannibal</hi> had placed them, in mooriſh places covered
with Willows and Poplars, and charge our rear which <hi>Publius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
ſo unexpectedly, that that Illuſtrious Roman was ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
by his own forces; upon which he endeavoured to fall
into the battel where <hi>Sempronius</hi> was; but whilſt theſe two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls
were fighting vvith extraordinary valour, it began of a ſudden
to ſnovv, and a ſtrong Wind aroſe vvhich blevv the ſnovv in the
face and eyes of our Souldiers, ſo that all theſe diſadvantages, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vvith the prodigious valour of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> fruſtrated the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
attempts of <hi>Sempronius</hi> and <hi>Publius,</hi> and cauſed our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to retire with a loſs ſufficiently conſiderable. 'Tis true, this
Victory coſt our Enemies dear; for if <hi>Hannibal</hi> loſt abundance of
men in his main battail, his left wing was not much more happy,
where <hi>Fabius, Servilius, Cato,</hi> and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> fought vigorouſly;
and vve had vvithout doubt utterly defeated the right, had not vve
alſo had our particular misfortune. For after <hi>Scipio</hi> had performed
the gallanteſt actions that could be done by man, ſaved the life of
<hi>Pyneus,</hi> vvounded <hi>Ducarion,</hi> vvho vvas an Inſubrian of quality,
and commanded the forces of his ovvn Nation in <hi>Hannibals</hi> Army,
and after he had alſo taken the King of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> priſoner, he
reſolved to go vvhere <hi>Hannibal</hi> vvas ſaid to be fighting, preſuming
that vvas the place vvhere the Romans moſt needed ſuccour. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to vvhich commanding <hi>Flavius</hi> to carry <hi>Braveus</hi> to our Camp,
and to take a thouſand horſe to guard him thither, he endeavoured
to charge the Enemies body; but he vvas of a ſuddain ſurpris'd to
ſee tvventy Elephants in the front, like ſo many forts or hideous
Bulwarks. We endeavoured to make our Javelotiers on horſeback
advance againſt them, becauſe we had no infantry to goad thoſe
beaſts, and drive them by that means againſt our Enemies; for it
was not very eaſie for us to kill them: but this was impoſſible to
be done, for their terrible bulks ſo affrighted our horſe, that they
could not be made approach them. Wherefore we were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to draw off: and being forced to fight to open our ſelves a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
we could not reach where we intended, till our Army was
retreating in ſufficient diſorder. 'Tis impoſſible for me to repreſent
to you the grief we reſented for this inproſperous enterpriſe; and
indeed, being almoſt all wounded, for a good time we thought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of lamenting our unhappineſs, without conſidering to get our
wounds dreſſed.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary I ſhould tell you the particulars of our loſs, or
that <hi>Cato</hi> and the King of <hi>Illyria</hi> were taken priſoners by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and afterwards exchanged for the King of the <hi>Allobroges</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60667:121"/>
(whom <hi>Flavius</hi> had conducted to the Camp with very much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
and valour) and <hi>Ducarion,</hi> whom <hi>Aemylius</hi> had likewiſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be conducted thither; 'tis ſufficient, Madam, you have bin
informed in what manner we gave battail at <hi>Trebia,</hi> and how the
Romans were unfortunately overcome, notwithſtanding the great
actions of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemylius,</hi> and all our Illuſtrious Gallants
that follow'd them, and intimated them in that famous occaſion.
<hi>Publius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> performed wonders there, and this latter
quitted the reſentment he had kept againſt his Collegue, after the
loſs of the battel; for he had kept it indeed (notwithſtanding his
civility to <hi>Scipio</hi>) by reaſon of the words which <hi>Publius</hi> anſwered
him in the Council of War; and he alſo cauſed <hi>Publius</hi> to quit the
ſentiment which he ſtill retained; for he went to viſit him at his
Tent, deſired his pardon for not having followed his opinion, and
proteſted to him with more reſpect then his dignity and fierceneſs
ſeemed to permit, that it was to go againſt Rome, to go againſt the
opinion of ſuch a Roman as <hi>Publius.</hi> The Illuſtrious Father of
<hi>Scipio</hi> received the complement of <hi>Sempronius,</hi> with very many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of acknowledgement and eſteem, and having returned
his civilitie, they went both together to encourage their Souldiers
who were ſtill terrified, and to put all things in a readineſs, that they
might ſtoutly repel the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in caſe they ſhould attempt
to fall upon our Works. But for that the loſſes they ſuffered were
not inferiour to ours, they had no thought to purſue us. After this
there paſſed nothing memorable, till the Creation of the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,
who were the Fathers of <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Servilius.</hi> But,
Madam, not to inſiſt punctually in relating things you are unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
not ignorant of, ſince all the world knows them, and not to
detain you with deſcribing the loſſes we ſuffered in <hi>Italy;</hi> I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to tell you, that after the battel of <hi>Trebia, Publius</hi> prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to go to his Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> where his brother <hi>Cnaeus</hi>
was arrived long ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi>'s ſorrow was redoubled, when he conſidered that he was
going to be further removed from the <hi>Aemilia;</hi> and becauſe he
ſaw it was impoſſible for him to go to Rome, he writ to that fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and encharged <hi>Fabius</hi> with his Letter, uſing all the motives
he thought capable to cauſe him to make the greateſt diligence and
ſpeedieſt return, becauſe he knew he would bring him an anſwer
from <hi>Aemilia,</hi> that divine Lady having had the goodneſſe to paſſe
him a promiſe to that purpoſe. And accordingly <hi>Scipio</hi> had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
he hoped for; He found in <hi>Aemylia's</hi> Letter very many
evidences of her eſteem, and could diſcern in it a certain tenderneſs
which that diſcreet Virgin had as it were obſcured in terms that
ſeemed to be only modeſt and obliging. By which means, of all
the inquietudes wherewith the violent paſſion that poſſeſſed him, is
uſually accompanied, he reſented at that time only that which was
cauſed by abſence.</p>
               <p>In the name of the Gods, <hi>Laelius</hi> (interrupted <hi>Nadalia</hi>) repeat us
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60667:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe two Letters; for I confeſſe, I paſſionately deſire to hear a kind
one of the Illuſtrious <hi>Emilia.</hi> Sincerely, fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> (anſwered
he) I am ſorry I cannot ſatisfie you at this time; but I proteſt to
you, that I did not read <hi>Emilia</hi>'s anſwer often enough to be able to
remember it, becauſe it hapned that I did not ſee that of <hi>Scipio.</hi> But
be not disſatisfied, Madam, I beſeech you; for in the Narration I
am to make, hapned ſo many different events, that there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

obſerving <hi>Nadalia</hi> has no more to interrupt him with, he purſued
his diſcourſe in this manner.</p>
               <p>I am telling you, Madam, that <hi>Scipio</hi> upon his departure from
<hi>Italy,</hi> reſented onely the inquietude that abſence gives paſſionate
Lovers; and I can moreover aſſure you, that he was not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to hear that <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> were ſo highly ingraciated
with the people, that they might reaſonably pretend to the moſt
conſiderable offices. For we underſtood that as wounded as they
were, they deſired, or at leaſt made ſemblance to deſire that they
might be carryed to <hi>Sempronius's</hi> Camp before he fought the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Trebia,</hi> that the people withſtood their purpoſe, admired
their generoſity, and according to the genius of other Nations,
augmented a certain blind and indiſcreet ardor they were before
poſſeſt with; for perſons who had lately dazled their e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that ſurpriſed them. We alſo underſtood that after the loſs
of that battail, they had given great ſums of money towards the
levying of forces, and in brief, had omitted nothing that might
promote their advancement to ſome ſplendid dignity, ſo to cover
the obſcurity of their deſcent. And you ſhall hear, Madam, in the
ſequel of my diſcourſe, that they attained that, but too ſoon for
the misfortune of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereunto their ambition aſpir'd. I ſhall
omit to tell you with what preparations <hi>Publius</hi> departed from <hi>Italy,</hi>
as well as the particular circumſtances of his voyage, there being
none remarkable enough in it to deſerve your attention. When we
were arriv'd in <hi>Spain</hi> (for you may judge, Madam, I may ſpeak in
that manner, and was with my Illuſtrious friend) we underſtood
<hi>Himilcon</hi> was ſet forth from <hi>Carthage</hi> with a good number of ſhips,
and was coming to re-enforce the Naval Army of our Enemies, of
which he was Commander; upon <hi>Publius</hi> reſolving to oppoſe <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcon,</hi>
left the other Army to his brother <hi>Cnaeus</hi> to withſtand <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,
Barſa,</hi> and appointed <hi>Scipio</hi> and me his Lieutenants Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>Caeneus</hi> had already his Son, ſurnamed <hi>Naſica,</hi> and a Roman
Knight named <hi>Martius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have without doubt heard by fame, with what ſucceſs the
<hi>Scipio</hi> fought in <hi>Spain,</hi> and you cannot but know that under thoſe
Illuſtrious Romans, our Eagles flew there both by Sea and Land,
the Carthaginian Forces being not able to ſtop them. You alſo
know, that <hi>Hamilcon</hi> and <hi>Aſrubal</hi> were beaten, that <hi>Publius</hi> and
<hi>Cnaeus</hi> conquered a part of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they founded the City of
<hi>Taragona</hi> there, and laſtly made alliances very advantageous to the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60667:122"/>
Romans. But for that perhaps you have not known the particular
actions of <hi>Scipio,</hi> I ſhould be obliged to make you a relation of
them, if I did not think it more requiſite to aſſure you in few words,
that he was the perſon that contributed moſt to the acquiſition of
the Victories which the Romans gain'd, that he perform'd actions
that fill'd me with aſtoniſhment, and that he was ſeveral times in
the Army of <hi>Cnaeus</hi> to ſerve in it, and conſequently render
it victorious, when he had put that of his Father in a poſture not to
fear the enterpriſes of the Enemies. And indeed it was extreamly
neceſſary, that this young <hi>Heroe</hi> ſhould do all thoſe great actions to
repair in ſome manner the loſſes we ſuffered in other places; for our
Armies had ſucceſſes very contrary in <hi>Italy.</hi> When the fame of
our Victories was ſpread abroad in <hi>Rome, Rome</hi> was no more then a
deſolated City, it was in a ſtrange general conſternation; the death
of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> was publiquely known with the loſs of his Army;
and, in a word, tydings was meerly brought thither of the events of
the battel at the Lake of <hi>Thraſymene,</hi> which I ſhall not relate to you,
being certain they are known throughout the whole world. I ſhall
alſo ſilently paſs over, that at that time they were conſtrained to
create a Dictator, and that <hi>Fabius</hi> was the perſon choſen to that
charge, namely the Father of him that was amorous of <hi>Aemylia,</hi>
who with the ſurname of Moſt-Great, gain'd alſo that of the ſhield
of the people of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe memorble paſſages are unknown to none, no more then
that <hi>Minutius</hi> was made General of the Horſe of the Dictators
Army, that he was afterwards equaliz'd to him in Authority, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and relieved by the Illuſtrious <hi>Fabius;</hi> and at
length depoſed himſelf from the Magiſtrates, and would fight no
longer but under the orders of the Dictator. Its alſo well known
that <hi>Fabius</hi> was called the Delayer, becauſe inſtead of fighting
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> he ſtill declin'd the encounter, but it was with a deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
deſign to our enemies, whom he held beſieged by poſſeſſing
himſelf alwayes of the high places that commanded the plain. So
that the Carthaginians being no longer able to ſend forth parties to
forrage for proviſions which they frequently wanted, their wilely
General was conſtrained to make uſe of the Oxen of his Army,
for opening a paſſage for his Army in the manner you have heard
reported, and poſterity will without queſtion admire. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if we were ſurpriſed in hearing of the advancement of <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
we were much more ſtrangely at that of <hi>Varro,</hi> who ſometime
after that I am ſpeaking of, was to our unhappineſs created Conſul
with the Illuſtrious Father of <hi>Aemylia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> ſuddenly admired the capriciouſneſs of our Nation, but
being willing afterwards to excuſe their proceeding, he told me
with a ſincere and heroical generoſity, that perhaps <hi>Varro</hi> had ſince
our departure acquir'd the moderation and other virtues he wanted
at our being there, that at leaſt he paſſionately wiſhed it was ſo, and
that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> might not have cauſe to repent the choice
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60667:123"/>
they had made. But, alas! we, and all the earth, too ſoon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that <hi>Varro</hi> was not at all amended, that he was alwayes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and void of conduct, and that the headineſs of his humour in
a ſhort time rendred the plains of <hi>Cannae</hi> famous by the dreadfull
over-throw he occaſioned the Roman there. We no ſooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that in <hi>Italy</hi> the two Conſular Armies were to unite to
make one notorious encounter for the driving the Carthaginians
from thence; but <hi>Scipio</hi> determined to go thither. For ſeeing the
affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> were in a matter quiet, he could not continue there,
and eſpecially when he ſaw that by paſſing into <hi>Italy,</hi> he might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome ſervice to <hi>Lucius</hi> or <hi>Aemylius,</hi> or at leaſt might partake
in the dangers they were going to adventure in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Publius</hi> had a ſtrange repugnance to ſuffer us to depart; but he
conſented to it, being preſſed by the intreaties of his Illuſtrious Son.
Wherefore we departed as ſoon as poſſibly we could, and omitted
no diligence till we rendered our ſelves at <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Camp. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that in our firſt enterview, the Illuſtrious father of <hi>Aemylia</hi>
embraced <hi>Scipio</hi> a long time in his arms, and then having careſſed
me almoſt in the ſame manner, he told us, the inconſiderate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of <hi>Varro</hi> was more formidable to him then the valour of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
and that in all probability that Roman would do more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to Rome then all the Forces of Carthage. But as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
his diſcourſe, and informing us of the ſtate of affairs, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius,</hi>
who had bin Conſul the year before, <hi>Aemylius, Regulus</hi>
and <hi>Cato,</hi> entered into the room, and brake off the converſation by
the civilities and careſſes they made to us and <hi>Lucius,</hi> gave way for
us to receive. We were afterwards aſtoniſh'd to hear, that the next
morning the battel was to be given, and that <hi>Varro</hi> wiſhed for fight
with as much impatience as the Great <hi>Fabius</hi> had avoided it with
wiſdom. But, in brief, it could not be avoided, but all the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Plebeian Conſul (ſo they ſtyl'd <hi>Varro</hi>) were abſolutely
for what their Chief deſired, apparently incited to it by the falſe
glory of their inſolent Captain, and the falſe-apprehended limidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Illuſtrious <hi>Lucius.</hi> What need I tell you, Madam, ſince
all the world knows it is but too true, that the bad genius of Rome,
and the temerity of <hi>Varro</hi> cauſed us to give that fatal battel, and
ſuffer thoſe dreadful loſſes, which without doubt poſterity will not
hear of but with aſtoniſhment? Yes, Madam, we gave that bloody
battel; and as if the good fate of <hi>Carthage</hi> had not bin well enough
ſeconded by the adventurous blindneſs of <hi>Varro,</hi> the ſubtilties of
<hi>Hannibal</hi> muſt needs bear a part in that diſaſterous victory. For he
drew up his forces in ſuch a manner, that ours were expoſed to the
diſadvantages of the wind and ſun, by which they were ſo cruelly
inconvenienc'd, that we not only could not overcome our enemies,
nor ſo much as fight, but remain'd expos'd to their blows without
knowing which way to ward them off. Not, but that for all theſe
inconveniences, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſurpaſſed himſelf, in performances exceeding
all belief, and that <hi>Aemylius</hi> did wonders, and that all the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60667:123"/>
Romans I have mentioned to you, ſignaliz'd themſelves glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;
but in fine, all their endeavours were not capable to reſiſt
an Army of an hundred thouſand diſciplin'd Veterans, conducted
by a great Captain, and who beſides all theſe advantages, had all
that ſcituation of places for ſuch bloody encounters could afford.
So that, Madam, in this fatal field, beſides ſo many thouſand of
Souldiers that periſhed, we loſt an infinite number of Knights and
Senators, we loſt <hi>Servilius</hi> who had bin Collegue with <hi>Flaminius;</hi>
but, alas! that which afflicted us moſt ſenſibly, was the loſs of the
Illuſtrious and infortunate <hi>Lucius,</hi> who was unfortunately ſlain in
the rout. Ah! Madam, how can I recount to you the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this deplorable death? The Illuſtrious <hi>Lucius</hi> beholding all
was loſt on our ſide, reſolved not to out-live this day; but yet to
dye gloriouſly, he ſought out <hi>Hannibal</hi> to fight him, he thrnſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
where-ever he ſaw the greateſt danger, and in a word, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his courage made him perform actions little different from
thoſe of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemilius.</hi> But, alas! how fatal was that exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
valour to him! For as this great perſon was upon the point to
charge <hi>Hannibal,</hi> his Horſe was ſlain under him, and not loſing his
judgement, he diſentangled himſelf from the ſtirrups, and fought
on foot very vigorouſly, till at length he received three or four
wounds at the ſame time, which enforced him to retire out of the
fight. We preſently received information of his misfortunne, and
<hi>Scipio, Aemilius, Sempronius, Regulus,</hi> and my ſelf redoubled our
endeavours to get to him and relieve him. But as we were upon the
point to do it, we were prevented by an extream ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
accident. For <hi>Lucius</hi> being wounded in the manner I have
told you, was ſat down with his face turn'd towards the enemies,
holding his ſword in his hand, which he ſtill lift up as often as his
faintneſs would permit him: When <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who fought near that
place, ſeeing him in ſo deplorable a condition, alighted, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
his Horſe to him; Here, my Lord (ſaid he to him) make
uſe of my horſe to preſerve a life ſo neceſſary to our Republique.
I thank you <hi>Lentulus</hi> (anſwered he faintly, and yet in a manner
that ſhewed his gratitude) do you preſerve your ſelf from <hi>Rome?</hi> I
beſeech you, ſave your ſelf, and leave an infortunate perſon to dye,
who will not ſurvive the deſolation of his Country. They who
beheld <hi>Lentulus</hi>'s action alighted alſo, to go ſuccour their Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
General, and likewiſe the Horſemen that were at ſome diſtance
doing the ſame, upon a miſtake that they were commanded to fight
on foot (which was a caſe not without example) this ſtrange and
lamentable accident hapned juſt as we are approaching to <hi>Lucius,</hi>
ſo that we ſuddenly beheld above a thouſand Horſes looſe, which
made a horrible diſorder, and were an obſtacle impoſſible for us
to break through. Yet we endeavoured to open our ſelves a paſſage;
but as we are uſing all our diligence to that purpoſe, a body of our
enemies Cavalry falling upon thoſe of our Horſemen that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
eaſily cut them in pieces, and afterwards driving back both
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60667:124"/>
the Horſemen and the Horſes, and all that was in their paſſage, we
were unhappily carried along with the crowd; and had the grief to
ſee that apparantly, the body of <hi>Lucius</hi> had bin trampled by the
feet of the Horſes. It is impoſſible, Madam, fully to repreſent to
you the greatneſs of the reſentment of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemylius</hi> or what
they perform'd when diſpair came to be added to their ordinary va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
I ſhall onely tell you that they had undoubtedly periſht, if that
which was moſt likely to contribute to their ruine had not ſaved
them. For being left but about ten or twelve thouſand men of all
our brave and numerous Army, we were ſoon ſurrounded by that
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had ſtill above fourſcore thouſand. Upon which
<hi>Sempronius</hi> and <hi>Appius</hi> deſirous to preſerve the remainder of our
fortunate Troops, cryed out to <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemylius,</hi> that they
ſhould not fight where they did, but put themſelves in the head of
<hi>Romanes</hi> that were left, and ſave them by opening a paſſage through
the enemies, and ſo recovering a way for their retreat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemylius,</hi> either for that they were ſtill capable of that
Roman conſtancy that induces to prefer the intereſt of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
before all others, or that their grief reſembling their diſpoſition,
was more effective to carry them to great actions, then unprofitable
complaints, by adding the deſire of revenge to that of Glory;
However it were, they put themſelves in the head of the ten or
tvvelve thouſand men I mentioned, and notvvithſtanding the
vvounds they had already received, made themſelves a paſſage vvith
their ſvvords, and carried their party to <hi>Cannuſium,</hi> as the vvorld
has heard and highly commended <hi>Sempronius</hi> for being
the Author of that attempt. But, Madam, at <hi>Cannuſium,</hi> theſe
two Illuſtrious Romans manifeſted all the tenderneſs of their ſouls,
and abandoned themſelves wholly to grief, when the body of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
was brought to them, which they had preſently ſent to <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
to demand. I ſay, when the body of <hi>Lucius</hi> was brought to
them, without denoting to you the circumſtances of a time which
was wholly a time of affliction, I ſhall alſo omit to deſcribe to you
the conſternation that was ſeen at Rome; <hi>Cannuſium,</hi> and all the
Cities of our allies, chuſing rather to paſs that over in ſilence which
I ſhould fall infinitely ſhort in repreſenting, herein imitating a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Painter, who drew a vail over thoſe countenances whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
ſadneſs he believ'd beyond the power of his Penſil to expreſs.
I preſume you have known, Madam, that the ten thouſand men
whom we led to <hi>Cannuſium,</hi> with the common conſent both of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Souldiers, choſe the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> to command them,
and <hi>Appius</hi> with him, becauſe he was <hi>Scipoi</hi>'s kinſman, and had bin,
together with <hi>Sempronius,</hi> author of the enterpriſe that ſaved them,
as I have told you; and laſtly, becauſe they would either preſerve
an order which reſembled that of their uſual command, namely,
the having of two Conſuls which were two Generals, or to favour
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who they ſaw was conſiderably wounded. But for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſoever it was, they choſe <hi>Appius</hi> with his Illuſtrious Kinſman,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60667:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
although there were then at <hi>Cannuſium,</hi> an infinite number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
conſiderable both for their deſcents and employments; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<hi>Varro, Fabius, Flaminius,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who took their
way towards <hi>Rome,</hi> all the remainder of brave and Illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
was retired to <hi>Cannuſium</hi> with us. For <hi>Aemilias, Sempronius,
Fabius, Regulus, Cato, Leutulus,</hi> and too many others were there,
but wounded as well as we. 'Tis true, the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
mind to think of his cure, for his ſoul was wholly taken up with
his own grief, and the apprehenſion of that which he foreſaw the
adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> would reſent when the doleful news of the death
of her illuſtrious fore-father, ſhould be reported to her. Yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
affliction did not abſolutely hinder him from taking care of
the troops which were put under his conduct in ſo obliging a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And indeed, when we were determining to cauſe the body of
<hi>Lucius</hi> to be carried to Rome, notice was brought us that divers
young Romans of chief quality reſolved to abandon <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſeek
a Sanctuary in ſome remote Country; we were informed <hi>Metellus</hi>
was the author of that Cabal, and it was at his quarte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that the
complotters were aſſembled. Upon which, <hi>Scipio,</hi> as all the world
as all the world has heard, went to <hi>Metellus</hi>'s his lodgings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tranſported by his grief, the greatneſs of his courage, and zeal
for his Country, drew his ſword as he entered alone into a Hall
where there were about forty men aſſembled, and looking upon
them one after another, with a fierce and ſcornful aſpect, mixt with
terror and ſorrow, I come hither (cryed he to them) to know who
thoſe unworthy perſons are that intend to abandon Rome, and go
ſeek and infamous ſafety in another Country; I come to make them
renounce ſo horrible a deſign; or to puniſh them my ſelf at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
and if you are all of this deteſtable complot (added he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
them with greater fierceneſs, and lifting up his arm) and
will not alter your reſolution, know I have drawn this ſword one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt you, which I will never ſheath till I have waſht it in your
blood, till I have ſlain you all, and till I have reveng'd my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Yes (added he again) I will kill you all, if you have taken up
ſo infamous a reſolution as you are accus'd of; for if you are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſuch cowardiſes, you vvill not without doubt be capable to
reſiſt ont <hi>Scipio</hi> all together.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce pronounced theſe words, but all the aſſembly vvas
not onely aſtoniſhed, but ſo terrified at them, that there was none
of them that anſwer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the name of the reſt. Our young Hero
vva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> nevertheleſs not ſatisfied by having frightned ſuch a multitude;
but perceiving that ſpeaking to all, no particular perſon thought
himſelf obliged to anſwer; he advanced fiercely tovvards <hi>Metellus,</hi>
vvho vvas ſaid to be the author of ſo black a deſiggn; he ſeized with
one hand on his Coat of armour, and lifting up his ſword vvith the
other; 'Tis to you, <hi>Metellus</hi> (cryed he vvith a menacing accent)
that I addreſs, as he that has engaged all this company in ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an enterpriſe; but you muſt either periſh at this moment (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60667:125"/>
he) or ſwear before the immortal Gods, that you will ceaſe
to live before you vvill ceaſe to ſerve <hi>Rome. Metellus</hi> vvas much
more terrified by this laſt action and words of <hi>Scipio,</hi> then he had
bin by his firſt menaces; ſo that ſeeing himſelf ſo ſtreightly urged,
he accordingly ſvvore at length, and after him all his companions
ſvvore alſo in the manner that <hi>Scipio</hi> required.</p>
               <p>After this action vvhich made ſo great a report in the vvorld,
our Illuſtrious Roman vvent to <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s quarters, vvhere he vvas
viſited by the principal Officers of his Troops, vvho had bin there
before to make there complements to <hi>Aemilius</hi> upon the death of
<hi>Lucius. Scipio</hi> received them vvith all the civility that the publick
and his particular affliction could permit him; and having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
recommended to them the conſtancy of true Romans to
their death, he deſired <hi>Appius,</hi> vvho alſo came to <hi>Emilius</hi> ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
after, to take care alone of the Troops vvhich they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
telling him there vvas a neceſſity upon himſelf to go to
<hi>Rome,</hi> in relation to an affair of higheſt importance. So vve depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the next morning from <hi>Cannuſium,</hi> and cauſed the body of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to be carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> vvhich vve accompanied with all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
of quality, whoſe wounds were not conſiderable enough to
oblige them to keep the bed. But, Madam, if I have not bin able
to deſcribe to you the affliction of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Emilius;</hi> how is it
poſſible for me to repreſent that which <hi>Claudia</hi> and her adorable
daughter reſented upon our arrival? 'Tis beyond all the power
of words to do; and you may pleaſe onely to let me tell you, that
the conſtancy of <hi>Claudia</hi> abandoned her in this occaſion, that this
deſolate Lady was not capable of remembring that at leaſt the death
of her Illuſtrious <hi>Lucius</hi> was glorious, that as truly Romans as ſhe
was, ſhe forgot for ſome time the loſſes of the Common wealth,
only to think of that of her own houſe, and in a word, that ſhe ſo
abſolutely reſign'd her ſelf up to her ſorrow, that ſhe cauſed all
thoſe to weep who endeavoured to ſtop the flood of her tears. Not,
that ſhe preſently fell to violent weeping; for her grief was of ſuch
a nature, that it could not ſo expreſs it ſelf; for ſhe was ſeen to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<hi>Emilius,</hi> and cloſe him faſt in her arms during more then a
quarter of an hour, without being able either to ſpeak or lament.
Nor did ſhe let her dear Son go, before ſhe was ſeveral times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed
that he was wounded; and as ſhe beheld him retiring, that
he might not ſhew her the exceſs of his affliction, Ah! my ſon (ſaid
ſhe to him lamentingly) you have now no longer a father! This, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
was all <hi>Claudia</hi> was able to ſpeak to <hi>Aemilius</hi> in that firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who intended to make a reverence to her, could not
do it at firſt, ſo vigorouſly was he ſeiz'd with ſorrow himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he perceiv'd the adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> was infinitely afflicted; who
being met in the paſſage by her Illuſtrious brother, they embraced
one another, and expreſſed ſo many tokens of a real dearneſs, and
an extream affliction that all the ſpectators were yet more deeply
affected with it. How then, Madam, could <hi>Scipio</hi> be Maſter of his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60667:125"/>
grief, ſince there was no perſon in the company, but ſhewed as
much ſadneſs, as if every one of them had loſt ſome very near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the perſon of <hi>Lucius.</hi> It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that <hi>Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
alone might have drawn tears from perſons that had the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to tenderneſs; for could any without being deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
have beheld a young and fair perſon, whoſe extream grief ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
upon her countenance only by a faint languor, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it infinitely moving, and yet withal made it evident, that ſhe
was far more ſenſibly ſorrowful, then thoſe that expreſs themſelves
in Acclamations and tranſport. Beſides, <hi>Aemilia</hi>'s beauty being of
a fair complexion, the brightneſs of it was undoubtedly heighned
by the mourning attire that is uſually worn in the like occaſions. So
that it was impoſſible, as I have ſaid, to behold a perſon ſo fair and
ſo afflicted without, preſently reſenting all the motions of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that compaſſion and grief are capable to excite. But, Madam,
it will be no exaggeration to ſay, that the affliction of my Illuſtrious
friend was beyond all that others ſuffer in ſuch loſſes; for he was
not able to ſpeak to <hi>Claudia,</hi> when he made his reverence to her,
though that Illuſtrious Lady embraced his head a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which he bowed down out of reſpect, and told him that ſhe
loſt much more in the death of <hi>Lucius</hi> then he believ'd, becauſe he
he had bin lov'd by him above what he imagin'd. But, Madam,
when this afflicted Lover was to approach to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> he found it
was impoſſible for him; ſo that after having made a thouſand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
which proved unprofitable, he was conſtrained to go away
without making a reverence to that afflicted beauty; ſo true it is,
that he could not be maſter of his grief, having caſt his eyes upon
the divine countenance he was infinitely enamour'd of. When we
departed from <hi>Claudia</hi>'s houſe, we went to that of my father, who
loſing not much time in teſtifying to us the ſenſible joy he reſented
to ſee us return from a battel, where it was believ'd all were periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cauſed us preſently to be led to a bed, and having taken order
for our wounds, and ſome convenient repaſt for us, went forth of
our Chamber to leave us to take repoſe. But, Madam, how little
was <hi>Scipio</hi> capable of keeping any! For his mind was wholly filled
with <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and his affliction. He ſigh'd every other moment, and
his ſleep was interrupted frequently by the image of that fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
he believed every thing be beheld lookt gaſhly, and reſented
ſo lively a ſorrow after the ſight of that of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> that he imagin'd
all things had changed their aſpect, or at leaſt ought to have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it by the affliction of that divine perſon. Whereby, Madam,
this grief of <hi>Scipio</hi> deſtroyed that little health his travels and
wounds had left him, and caſt him into a long and languiſhing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
during which we had either hope or fear according to the
different relations that perſons which viſited him brought him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Aemilia,</hi> though without knowing the high intereſt he had
therein. But at length we knew by the amendment of his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that there was ſome mitigation in the ſorrow of <hi>Claudia</hi> and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60667:126"/>
                  <hi>Aemilia;</hi> and as if Love had been as well Maſter of his body, as it
was certainly of his heart, his health returned aſſoon as <hi>Aemilius</hi>
was in a condition to go and ſee him; inaſmuch as he gave him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
of his happineſs, by confirming to him in the name of
<hi>Claudia,</hi> the promiſe that <hi>Lucius</hi> had made him. <hi>Claudia</hi> viſited
him ſome dayes after her ſelf; for beſides that, we were lodged at
my fathers houſe, the Ladies not onely made no difficulties at this
time to viſit thoſe that were returned wounded from the Army;
but they wholly addicted themſelves for a good time to that pious
imployment; ſo that according to what was told us by thoſe that
ſaw it, it was the moſt ſad ſpectacle in the world to meet frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
companies of Ladies, and thoſe of the moſt Illuſtrious, coming
forth of one houſe drying their tears, and entering into another,
where they were ſure to find a new occaſion to weep: for you may
judge, Madam, ſuch viſits were not made without the recounting
of ſome of the particulars of that fatal battel we had lately loſt;
But if <hi>Claudia</hi>'s viſit corroborated a health that <hi>Aemilius</hi> had in a
manner reviv'd, I may ſay the adorable <hi>Aemilia</hi> abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it by an obliging anſwer ſhe returned to a Letter writ to her
by <hi>Scipio,</hi> aſſoon as he was able to do it. The amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> had
written with all the paſſion that he could expreſs in keeping never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
a certain decorum, which the condition affairs were then in,
obliged him to obſerve more exactly then a contrary conjuncture
could: for if a time of rejoycing ſeems in a manner to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to love, and conſequently to give us a certain liberty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the ſentiments that noble paſſion inſpires us with, a time of
mourning is deſtinated onely for tears; and it ſeems to be irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and unſutable to ſpeak of other then ſad ſubjects, and ſuch as
ſerve not to feed the miſerable paſſion that is then predominant,
and that with the conſentment of the ſufferers. But <hi>Rome</hi> was not
in this conſternation ſo long a time, as it was apparent ſhe would
have been; for intelligence was brought, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was gone
to <hi>Capua</hi> in ſtead of proſecuting his Victory, and that in <hi>Spain</hi> the
two <hi>Scipios, Publius</hi> and <hi>Cnaeus</hi> had almoſt utterly defeated the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
with the confederates they had in that Country. My
Illuſtrious friend received this laſt news with extream ſatisfaction,
and moderated the regret he had for not partaking in that Victory,
when he underſtood his brother and his kinſman <hi>Naſica</hi> had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſignaliz'd themſelves as well as the brave <hi>Martius,</hi> for whom he
had already many ſentiments of eſteem and friendſhip. But as it
ſeems, that Illuſtrious perſons are never unhappy by halves, this
news that <hi>Scipio</hi> received, ſerved onely to ſuſpend his affliction for
a time, to the end his mind might be more ſenſible of the grief, which
he was afterwards to be cruelly aſſaulted with. For within a ſhort
ſpace after the tydings of the death of <hi>Publius,</hi> and that of <hi>Cnaeus</hi>
were brought him; and he alſo led their Armies, whereby defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after gaining of the laſt battel they fought, if <hi>Martius</hi> had not
preſerved them by an admirable conduct. Verily, the conſtancy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60667:126"/>
of <hi>Scipio</hi> was found too weak to ſupport this laſt ſtroke of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and this Illuſtrious Roman, whoſe ſoul was as tender in theſe
kind of accidents, as unmovable in other occaſions, could not think
of the loſs new befallen him, without lamenting in ſo ſenſible a
manner, that it moved the hearts of all that came to ſee him, and
evidently diſcovered the greatneſs of his affliction. But when I
was alone in his Chamber, he abandoned himſelf much more to his
grief; for walking up and down there, he recalled into his mind all
circumſtances that could augment it, he reflected on the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
merit of <hi>Publius,</hi> and diſcourſed to me of it, and then recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a thouſand teſtimonies of dearneſs he had received from him,
he ſuddenly ſtopt, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, diſpatch, cruel
deſtiny (cryed he) accompliſh thy fury, unmerciful fate! and ſince
'tis not enough to afflict me to make me ſee <hi>Italy</hi> ruinated by <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
to make me ſee <hi>Lucius</hi> dead, <hi>Aemilia</hi> afflicted, and deſtroy
<hi>Publius</hi> and <hi>Cnaeus</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> while I am at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end they
may not receive the aſſiſtance they might require of him. I would
not interrupt theſe complaints of <hi>Scipio,</hi> leaſt I ſhould augment
the violence of his grief by cauſing him to reſtrain it; ſo that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, I obſerved that after having a little muſed upon what
he had ſad ſaid, he lift up his eyes again to Heaven, and following
the motions of piety that all the world admires in him, he ſighed,
and then caſt down his eyes, as if to deſire pardon of the Gods for
his tranſport, for to ſubmit himſelf intirely to their providence.
<hi>Aemilius</hi> about this time entered into the Chamber where we were,
not ſtanding upon the caution that forbids perſons that have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
great loſſes to make viſits of this nature. For his own grief did
not hinder him from reſenting that of <hi>Scipio,</hi> of which he gave
ſo apparent tokens, that he ſeem'd by an undeſired gratitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
our Illuſtrious Mourner what he before received from him;
and indeed I think never two perſons gave teſtimonies of a real
dearneſs with more regret in the like occaſions. Yet they could have
no great converſation together, by reaſon of the great company
that began that day to viſit <hi>Scipio,</hi> who came ſo numerouſly during
ſeven or eight dayes, that it was impoſſible in that time for his beſt
friends to entertain him in the manner they deſired; for not only
men of quality came thither, but likewiſe almoſt all the Ladies,
thoſe that were young and fair, being accompanied by ſome relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of elder age. Yet <hi>Claudia</hi> was not there, either for that her mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dipens'd with her for making that viſit, or by reaſon of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
that hindered her; but ſhe ſent every day to enquire of
his health, in ſo obliging a manner, that without doubt he preferr'd
thoſe complements above all the honours that accompanied the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits
that were made him by others. Wherefore <hi>Scipio</hi> was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſirous to wait upon her with his remerciments, and ſee her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
daughter, which ſhe did, as ſoon as ſeemlineſs could permit
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aemylius,</hi> who came that day to our houſe, went thither with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60667:127"/>
him; and for that at his going in, he was told <hi>Claudia</hi> could not be
ſeen without diſturbance to her, he had <hi>Scipio</hi> to the Chamber of
his Siſter, where he tarried not long but left him. This paſſionate
Lover notwithſtanding his grief, could not hinder himſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<hi>Aemylia</hi> with all the tokens of a violent Love, ſo that this
diſcreet Lady fearing leaſt he ſhould mention a paſſion to her that
was not very conformable to her preſent ſtate, beheld him with an
air that ſufficiently ſhewed the greatneſs of her affliction, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuffered ſome tears to fall from her fair eyes: Alas! <hi>Scipio</hi>
(ſaid he to him) your preſence would ſoon remind me of the death
of the unfortunate <hi>Lucius,</hi> could I be unnatural enough to forget it;
for though you had not lately ſuffered a leſs reſembling mine, yet
there are many circumſtances which would not ceaſe to repreſent
to me the greatneſs of my misfortune, 'Tis true, Madam, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he ſighing) that we have ſuffered equal loſſes. But, Madam,
(added he) with an air extreamly paſſionate) ſince they are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
I find ſo much ſweetneſs in being miſerable while you are
not happy, that the reſemblance certainly lightens part of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
Ah! <hi>Scipio</hi> (replyed ſhe) you conſider not well what you
ſay, for if you reflected both on the publique and the private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
that we ought to reſent, you would unqueſtionably not
imagine there was any thing left to lighten part of your grief. Ah!
Madam (anſwered he) you little underſtand me, if you can believe
I ſpeak before you without conſidering what I ſay; and you little
imagine what paſſes in my heart, when you believe that grief alone
can intirely poſſeſs it. For indeed, Madam, when I revolve in my
mind the deſolation of <hi>Italy,</hi> the conſternation of <hi>Rome,</hi> the death
of <hi>Lucius</hi> whom I honoured infinitely, and that of a father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
was infinitely dear to me, I ſhould without queſtion dye with grief,
if I did not immediately conſider there was ſomething left me more
eſtimable then <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aly, Rome,</hi> and all the Kingdoms of the earth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more dear then <hi>Lucius,</hi> then <hi>Publius,</hi> and then all my relations
and friends; which is, Madam, (continued he, after having beheld
her after a manner perfectly paſſionate and moving) the paſſion
which I have for the faireſt perſon in the world. Yes, Madam (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he again, preventing <hi>Aemylia</hi> from interrupting him) that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
alone makes the felicity of my life, and being not dependant on
the Empire of Fortune, I may ſay the dominion of that inconſtant
Goddeſs extends not to the greatneſs of all my happineſſes, and that
it is impoſſible for her to hinder me from living and dying happy,
becauſe ſhe cannot hinder me from living and dying the adorer of
<hi>Aemilia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe laſt words of <hi>Scipio</hi> mightily perplexed the fair perſon
that heard them, becauſe if ſhe conſidered 'twas a lover perfectly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
that pronounced them, and that with infinite reſpect, and
a paſſion generally approved by all her relations, ſhe withal feared
to offend againſt virtue, or at leaſt againſt ſeemlineſſe, if ſhe ſhould
be capable to hear a diſcourſe concerning other ſubjects then that of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60667:127"/>
her affliction; wherefore ſhe took a way of anſwering <hi>Scipio</hi> without
wholly checking his ſentiments which ſhe could not condemn, or
infringing a certain ſeverity ſhe believed her ſelf obliged to obſerve
during this time of ſadneſs. But as ſhe was going to ſpeak, one came
to tell <hi>Scipio</hi> from <hi>Aemilius,</hi> that <hi>Claudia</hi> was awak'd and would be
glad to ſee him, ſo that this paſſionate Lover was conſtrained to
part from the perſon he loved, without knowing her ſentiments
upon what he had ſpoken. Indeed when he made her a profound
reverence, and beheld her eyes to conſult her mind from thence, he
had the ſatisfaction not to ſee any ſigns of hatred in them, and he
was willing to flatter himſelf by believing, that if he obſerved not
the contrary paſsion in them, it was grief alone that hindered it to
appear in the places were it ſelf had taken up its jurisdiction. This
flattering thought tempered part of his ſorrow, and even inſpired
him afterwards with more confident ſentiments then his affliction
ſeemed to permit him: for he came ſuddenly to imagine, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Claudia</hi> might conſent to the conſummation of his marriage
forthwith, that in probability ſhe would not inſiſt on the ſevere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and that eſpecially the abſence of <hi>Pynaeus</hi> was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
favourable conjuncture for it. Beſides, that if that King, whoſe
ſole intereſt had occaſioned the deferring of his happineſs, was
gone into <hi>Illyria</hi> to make new Levies there; his other Rivals were
as little able to prejudice his pretenſions, <hi>Fabius</hi> having not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his, and <hi>Varro</hi> reduc'd to a condition, diſabling him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with his former addreſſes. Upon which conſiderations the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<hi>Scipio</hi> determined to requeſt <hi>Claudia</hi> to conſent to render
him happy: but aſſoon as he was entered into her Chamber with
<hi>Aemilius,</hi> he was was far from being able to declare his deſign, his
grief, which had been onely ſuſpended by the preſence of <hi>Aemilia,</hi>
reſuming its former violence from the ſight of that of <hi>Claudia;</hi> ſo
that the converſation was extreamly ſad, and being onely employ'd
upon the ſubject of over-throws, deaths and deſolations, it fill'd the
imagination of the three afflicted perſons that were ingaged in it,
notwithſtanding but the images of Urns, Aſhes, Tombs and Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
But <hi>Scipio</hi> was no ſooner come away with <hi>Aemylius</hi> from
<hi>Claudia,</hi> then <hi>Aemilia</hi> returned again into his mind, and diſpelled
thence by her luſtre part of that gloomy humour, a mournful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
had poſſeſſed him with, ſo that he was again in a condition of
thinking of the means to render himſelf happy, and reſolved to
diſcover his ſentiments to <hi>Aemilius,</hi> as the onely perſon who might
beſt do him a favour in this important occaſion. Yet he received
not from him that ſatisfaction he deſired; for <hi>Aemilius</hi> weighing
the matter without paſſion, anſwered him, that it was not time to
think of celebrating his marriage, that though the intereſt of <hi>Pynaeus</hi>
were not annexed to that of Rome, their families had lately ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too conſiderable loſſes, to conſtrain the deferring the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of ſuch a Treaty. To which he added ſo much reaſon,
that <hi>Scipio</hi> was convinced of what he alledged; beſides that of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60667:128"/>
this generous Lover came to think that he was obliged to go
and revenge the death of <hi>Publius,</hi> and acquire a glory that might
not onely encourage him to demand in a more noble way that of
the poſſeſſing of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> but give occaſion to <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome of
thoſe extraordinary rejoycings that ſeemed neceſſary to a marriage
of that importance. In which heroical deſign being fully confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he departed, and with all ſpeed betook himſelf to demand the
Goverment, and command of the Armies of <hi>Spain,</hi> and obtained
the ſame, as you have unqueſtionably heard, thongh he; had not
yet arrived to the age required thereunto by our Laws. Thus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
we are going to ſee <hi>Scipio</hi> marching to Victory with a more
firm and glorious place, and we ſhall ſoon ſee him a conqueror,
becauſe we ſhall ſee him General; and moreover, we ſhall remark
what has hitherto bin unknown, that love will have a greater ſhare
in the brave actions he is going to perform, then either ambition or
the intereſt of his Country. I ſhall not detain you, Madam, with
any particulars preceding our departure, as the equipage of my
friend, which ſhewed both his magnificence and his affliction, the
Levies he cauſed to be made to recruit the Troop; which were ſcarce
any thing more then the Reliques of an Army, nor with the laſt
converſation he made with <hi>Aemilia.</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf with
telling you that their ſeparation was not without expreſſions infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
dear and extreamly heroical, and that <hi>Scipio</hi> left the Palace
of <hi>Claudia</hi> with ſo great regret, and yet with ſo noble an ardor, that
it was not difficult to remark in his countenance a mixture of fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
love, and ſorrow. After which, he ſpeedily took order for
all things requiſite to his voyage; and having had the goodneſs to
tell me he would give me the command of one of the two Armies;
we departed from Rome embarqued, and without the arrival of
anp accident that deſerves relation, happily landed with thirty ſhips
of War at the Port of <hi>Emporia,</hi> from whence we went to <hi>Taragona,</hi>
the to hold a Council of War, and receive the Embaſſadors of our
Allies.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, theſe Military affairs did not hinder <hi>Scipio</hi> from
reſenting a ſenſible ſorrow, when he conſidered how far remote he
was from <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and in a Country where his Father and Uncle
had bin ſlain. But if this circumſtace of place reduc'd into his mind
the death of thoſe two men, it was more lively repreſented to him
by the preſence of his young brother, and that of his kinſman
<hi>Naſica,</hi> whom we found at <hi>Tarrogona.</hi> It was in this City that
<hi>Scipio</hi> intended to add to the immortal glory of <hi>Publius</hi> and <hi>Cnaeus,</hi>
the magnificence of Monuments, which he did with ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that I eſteemed his affliction infinitely more valuable then the
marble and porpliry which he cauſed to be employed in the Work.
Nevertheleſs, if, as I ſaid, the Offices of a General did not hinder
him from performing the duty of a Son, his piety did as little hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from diſcharging that of Captain of an Army. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he drew his Forces into the field, aſſoon as he judg'd himſelf
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60667:128"/>
in a poſture to march againſt <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> who had made a confederacy
with the Kings of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and the <hi>Illergetes,</hi> and was moreover
advantaged by the valour of <hi>Lucius</hi> Prince of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> who
was deeply enamoured on the Princeſs of the <hi>Illergetes,</hi> for whoſe
ſake he was come into <hi>Spain.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Scipio</hi> reſolved to fight
thoſe three Confederates, whoſe Army was indeed gallant and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
and left the Naval Forces to be commanded by me, with a
ſatisfaction that was ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhould have a thouſand things to tel you of the great actions perform<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
by this admirable General, were they not already ſufficiently pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed

of the oppoſition of <hi>Lucius</hi> (who is one of the valianteſt Princes of
the world, and was dangerouſly wounded in this encounter) cut
in pieces part of their Army, put the other to flight, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the terror of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> reſolved upon the ſiege of their
capital City, the new <hi>Carthage,</hi> which was without doubt one of the
faireſt, richeſt, and ſtrongeſt Cities of <hi>Europe.</hi> I being at that time
not far diſtant from <hi>Scipio,</hi> he was pleaſed to require my judgment
upon the reſolution he had made, in order to which I was no ſooner
come to him upon his ſummons, but he called a Council of War.
But we ſcarce aſſembled to deliberate what courſe to take in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
enterpriſe, but we beheld a man enter, whoſe ſadneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
affected <hi>Scipio,</hi> and cauſed him to advance towards the door
of the chamber to enquire the cauſe of his coming, and his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
What intelligence do you bring us <hi>Valerius,</hi> ſaid he to him?
(for he was a perſon that belonged to <hi>Emilius</hi>) Is it any bad newes
of <hi>Claudia,</hi> your Maſter, or—he was not able to pronounce the
name of <hi>Emilia</hi> before one that came from her, and ſad too. I left
<hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Aemilia</hi> in good health (anſwered he) but, my Lord,
the caſe is not ſo well with my Maſter, who is wounded and priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in no <hi>Carthage.</hi> How? <hi>Aemylius</hi> priſoner, and wounded? (cryed
<hi>Scipio</hi> with great ſurpriſe, although with leſs grief then he would
have reſented, if he had not before heard good tydings of <hi>Aemylia</hi>)
'Tis moſt certain, he is ſo, my Lord, (anſwered he) and to tell you
in few words the circumſtances of this misfortune, you may pleaſe
to know that my Maſter would not go with you from <hi>Rome,</hi> fearing
leaſt the alliance which is ſhortly to be between you, might induce
you to offer him the moſt eminent employments even to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of <hi>Laelius;</hi> for which reaſon not to caſt you into the neceſſity
of being deficient either in relation to love or friendſhip, he would

till you had given your friend and your relations the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

ſooner underſtood that <hi>Laelius</hi> was to command the Naval Army,
and that you had alſo diſpoſed of the eminenteſt places, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from <hi>Rome,</hi> though not till after he had acquitted himſelf in
a combate with the Prince of <hi>Macedonia</hi> for the intereſts of <hi>Papyria.</hi>
But, my Lord, we accompliſht not our voyage ſo happily as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
it; for about ſeven or eight days ſince, we were ſet upon by a
party of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when we had but three or four hours jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to reach your Army. Although my Maſter had onely ſome
Officers of his houſe, and two or three ſlaves, yet he would not
yield himſelf, but with admirable valour for a long while reſiſted a
body of ſixty or eighty horſe. Nevertheleſs it behoved at length
to give way to number; <hi>Aemylius</hi> was wounded, taken, and led to
<hi>Carthage,</hi> where he is very well accommodated, but extream vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
guarded, becauſe the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having learnt who he is,
reſolve not to deliver him either for exchange or ranſome, but to
keep him, in order to advantage themſelves by him in making a
compoſition, in caſe your valour reduce them to that extreamity.
We ſhall, perhaps, have other means to free <hi>Aemylius</hi> (anſwered
<hi>Scipio</hi>) and ſince ranſom or exchange cannot avail for his liberty
(continued he, ſuffering himſelf to be tranſported by the greatneſs
of his courage) I will my ſelf go break his fetters, maugre the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our enemies, and the rampants of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe words, he remitted <hi>Valerius</hi> to the care of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lavius;</hi>
and without ſtaying to inquire in what manner he had eſcaped, he
turned towards the Officers that were aſſembled in his Chamber,
and told them with a fierce and ardent aſpect, that the ſiege of
<hi>Carthage</hi> was reſolved upon, and that he would either periſh or win
that City the ſame day he attaqued it.</p>
               <p>At theſe words all the company ſilently lookt upon him, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the greatneſs of the enterpriſe holding their
minds in ſuſpence what they ſhould anſwer; whereupon our famous
General again confirming what he had ſaid, all the Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
with him, not being able to believe him capable of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he could not execute. In the mean time, <hi>Martius,</hi> who had
not bin at <hi>Scipio</hi>'s quarters, becauſe he was at that time imploy'd in
preparing all conveniences for a journey to <hi>Rome</hi> (for, Madam, he
was not in a condition fit for ſervice, and had received in the laſt
skirmiſh a wound with a javelin in the right arm) <hi>Martius,</hi> I ſay,
was aſtoniſhed when the procedure of <hi>Scipio</hi> was related to him;
and for that he well knew the temper of that young Heroe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
his rare qualities, he was ſo apprehenſive leſt he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
precipitate himſelf into ſome great danger, that being of
more years then <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the ſervices he had performed warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the liberty to ſpeak his ſentiments in the like occaſions, he
writ to him that he ought not to ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported
any more by that noble ardor which had already gained him glory
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60667:129"/>
enough to merit immortally, intreated him to remember that he
was General of an Army, that it was no longer free for him to act
as a Volunteer, and that in a word be ought not to be prodigal of
a blood illuſtrious and abſolutely neceſſary to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio,</hi> who had his heroical qualities, conjoyned thoſe of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the intention of their Author, received this Letter of <hi>Martius</hi> with

in his Chamber with the Officer who waited for the anſwer

written it, read it aloud to me, and told me, he did not judge it

of the Sea, that on the other there is a Lake that waſhes the foot of
the walls, that the Lake and the Bay meet together, ſo that there is
onely a tongue of Land that hinders it from being wholly encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed:
Now you may eaſily enter with your ſhips into the Port,
and block up the City towards the Sea, and I will cauſe <hi>Syllanus</hi> to
poſſeſs himſelf of the Tongue of Land; and I conceive (added he)
I ſhall win the City on that ſide towards the Lake. But it is not foar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
(interrupted I). It ſeems not to be ſo (anſwered he) and all
the world believes it is not, which will be to my advantage; for the
walls that ſtand towards thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aters, being neither high nor well

with good ſucceſs. <hi>Trebellius</hi> has poſitively aſſured me of what I
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60667:130"/>
now tell you; you know he is not often miſtaken in ſuch affairs,
but after having a long time bin the diſciple of the famous <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi>
he has had the curioſity to ſee all the ſtrongeſt places in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
vvhoſe ſcituation he has exactly obſerved. Beſides, his skill
not hindering him from being couragious, he has deſired me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to follow me in this occaſion, which leaves us no reaſon
to doubt of the truth of his words. Yet, I have heard the contrary
reported (replyed I) to what you are aſſured of. The perſons then
that inform'd you (anſwered he) made not the ſame obſervations
with <hi>Trebellius,</hi> ſince they have not told you that the Bay and Lake
joyning together, the latter is greatly augmented by the flux of the
Sea, but afterwards decereaſing by the ebbe, there is not left water
enough in it to hinder it from being fordeable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> having added many other things tending to convince me,
after all (added he) ought not ſomething extraordinary to be done
for the deliverance of <hi>Emilia</hi>'s brother, and the taking of a City
which is not onely the chief of all <hi>Spain,</hi> but into which many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of greateſt quality of ſeverall Nations are retired with all
their wealth, and whatever they account precious? Which being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiev'd,
it will not be difficult for us afterwards to reward our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and gain the affection of the ſeveral Nations by gentle treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Soveraigns or Magiſtrates which we ſhall without
doubt find in <hi>Carthage.</hi> This, Madam, was the converſation I had
with <hi>Scipio,</hi> concerning the memorable enterpriſe; after which we
parted, and the next morning I took my way to my Ships, as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
did his to Rome. But not to be tedious to you, I ſhall proceed
to tell you, that <hi>Scipio</hi> having ordered all things neceſſary with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
diligence, he aſſaulted that important place three dayes after
he had taken the reſolution to do it. And he obſerved the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
I mentioned to you. For as I had the good fortune, in ſpight of
all reſiſtance made me, to enter into the Port of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi>
was come in the head of his Troop to aſſault the walls of it
by Land, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſome time after the reflux of the Sea, ſent us order
to redouble our ſtorm, ſo to draw the principal forces of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to thoſe parts, and conſequently to weaken that by which he
deſign'd to gain it. <hi>Syllanus</hi> and I had no ſooner obeyed him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeconded by <hi>Naſica,</hi> and the young <hi>Scipio,</hi> but our Heroe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Lake at the head of the troops which he had choſen;
My friends (cryed he with a ſprightly and fierce aſpect) I ſhould
be injurious to you, if I ſhould ſpeak much; words are needleſs to
to men of courage, therefore I ſhall onely tell you that you are going
where your General ſhall be your company, and the witneſs of your
valour. Let us on then, my friends, let us win <hi>Carthage;</hi> and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you the taking of this City ſhall render us Maſters of all <hi>Spain,</hi>
make <hi>Africa</hi> tremble, and crown us with immortal glory. He had
no ſooner ſpoke theſe few words, but he ſeized upon a Ladder, and
then caſting himſelf into the Lake, incited by his example a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
brave perſons to do the ſame. 'Tis true, he always preceded
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60667:130"/>
them, and being arrived at the foot of the walls, planted the firſt
Ladder againſt them; and then drawing his ſword, and covering
himſelf with his ſhield, he began to aſcend with an aſpect that no
doubt encouraged the hearts of all thoſe that followed him. The
walls were not ſo unguarded, but that they were ſuddenly bordered
with Souldiers at the firſt allarm that was given there, ſo that
our valiant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> General likewiſe redoubled his forces as the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
did their, and alwayes ſupporting his ſhield with a ſtrong arm,
continued to mount up with an heroical audacity, notwithſtanding
a ſhower of arrows and ſtones falling upon him; and though he
beheld a hundred Ladders overturn'd on each ſide. At length he got
up, and as a Souldier was ſtretching forth his arm to ſtrike at him
with his ſword, and hinder him from caſting himſelf upon the walls,
the couragious Generall prevented him, and by a great back blow
ſtrook off both arm and ſword down into the Lake. This remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
blow ſo terrified thoſe that beheld it, that <hi>Scipio</hi> had time to
leap upon the wall, before they were well enough recover'd out of
their amazement to hinder him, and afterwards caſting thoſe down
into the City that came to oppoſe his paſſage, he ſoon ſaw himſelf
backt by <hi>Trebellius, Digitius,</hi> and above twenty others whom his
example had emboldned; ſo that the fight becoming very diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
upon the wall, the Romans found fewer obſtacles in aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; after which the Illuſtrious <hi>Scipio</hi> did not delay to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the City, deſigning to gain one of the Gates, and open it
to <hi>Syllanus,.</hi> Yet he found great reſiſtance in the execution of his
purpoſe; for the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> ran thither, being followed
by a thouſand ſelected <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſignalizing themſelves in
this encounter, ſufficiently juſtifi'd the choice which the valiant
<hi>Lucius</hi> had made of them. But as lightning ſhafts, all that ſeems
to make a ſtrong reſiſtance, our invincible Conqueror beat down
all that oppoſed his paſſage; he ſtrikes, thruſts, kills, wounds <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
gains a Gate, cauſes the Romanes to enter, who ſuddenly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a great ſhout, diſplayed our Eagles in the conquered City,
and made the air reſound with the glorious name of <hi>Scipio.</hi> The
Governour of <hi>Carthage,</hi> with whom I was engag'd (for I had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and was ſo fortunate as to get into the City after I had gain'd
the Port) went to relieve <hi>Lucius,</hi> and repel our forces; but after a
very great reſiſtance he was taken priſoner, with the Prince of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiberia,</hi>
who caus'd us to admire his valour, and would vvithout
doubt have occaſioned himſelf to be ſlain, had not his ſvvord bin
ſuddenly broken, and he found himſelf inclos'd amidſt a thouſand
Souldiers. But I need not, Madam, particularize to you the actions
of that memorable day, ſince all the world has knovvn that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Scipio</hi> equall'd the ſublimeſt degree of that of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
Heroes, and that this famous Roman rais'd himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
an admiration for thoſe virtues vvhich are eſteemed much
more then that prodigious valour. For there is a paſſage I am
going to tell you, which more deſerves our vvonder then what I
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60667:131"/>
have hitherto related; and vve cannot but vvith aſtoniſhment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
a change in <hi>Scipio,</hi> vvhich moſt certainly is more to be extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
then the nobleſt conſtancy. For ſcarce vvas <hi>Carthage</hi> in the
Roman povver, and the brother of <hi>Aemylia</hi> at liberty, but our Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Roman appeared to be a <hi>Carthaginian;</hi> this young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
ſo fierce, ardent and terrible, becomes of a ſudden ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
ſo moderate, and ſo full of ſvveetneſs, that nothing is more
certain then that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> began infinitely to love
him, aſſoon as they ceas'd to fear him. But they ſhortly after accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
their love with veneration greater then what uſes to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
for men; which was not without cauſe, ſince our Heroe did
things which men are not accuſtomed to do. No doubt, Madam,
you have heard, that the Kings of <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and the <hi>Illergetes,</hi> with
the Queens their wives, being followed by the moſt conſiderable
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and five and twenty or thirty fair priſoners, were
preſented to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and received by him with a civility ſo great,
that they reſented pleaſure in the bitterneſs of their fortune, and
offered to their Conqueror that which certainly an Emperour of the
Romans, or the greateſt conqueror in the world ought not to have
hoped, and in a word, that which could not be rendred with juſtice
to any other then our Grand <hi>Scipio,</hi> who unqueſtionably ſhewed
himſelf perfectly worthy of it, ſince in the ardor of a moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
youth, he placed himſelf above the reach of the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
paſſions, and whatever is moſt charming in them, eſpecially in
an age where the intemperate heat of blood uſually favours tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
paſſions. 'Tis unknown to none, Madam, that our generous
Roman would not ſuffer himſelf to be proclaimed King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and anſwered thoſe that term'd him by that title, He was a Roman
Citizen, and that he onely us'd his ſword for glory, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Country. But if the moderation of a Conqueror
was eſteemed, who out of a perfectly heroical generoſity had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a potent Kingdom; the Ladies that were Priſoners much more
admired his virtue, when they found a Protector in a young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
and were treated by him with an aſpect that gave them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
that the faireſt among them were in abſolute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>afety.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Liberty was immediately granted to them, as alſo to
all the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but it was after ſuch a manner, that without doubt
gained their hearts, and ſo ſenſibly obliged them, that it may be
ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi> captiv'd all thoſe which he declared to be free. But ſcarce
had the Queens rendered thanks to ſo generous a Victor, but <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi>
and <hi>Iudibilis,</hi> their husbands proteſted ſolemnly that they
were not contented only to diſengage themſelves from the intereſt
of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> but that they gave themſelves up intirely to
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and were ready to hazard their Lives and States for whatever
concerned his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; the fair Priſoners which were in their train, were
willing alſo to teſtifie their acknowledgment, which they expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in ſhouts of joy and admiration; and there hapned to be heard
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60667:131"/>
amongſt them certain broken ſpeeches in which were confuſedly
pronounced the names of <hi>Scipio,, Olinda,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
But at length all the crowd being withdrawn, <hi>Scipio</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
with joy to ſee himſelf in a condition, enabling him to expreſs
to <hi>Aemylius</hi> the ſentiments of his eſteem and dearneſs; ſo that he
went preſently to his Chamber, where he embraced him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing
him between his arms, manifeſted to him the exceſs of joy
he reſented by his preſence, and by that what ſorrow he had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon underſtanding the news of his impriſonment and wounds.
After which he mentioned the obligation he had to him, for that in
reſpect to him, he had choſen rather to ſerve in <hi>Spain</hi> then in <hi>Italy,</hi>
complaining withal of that admirable modeſty which had conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from diſcovering to him his intention of coming to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
nor did he omit to ſpeak concerning the quarrel he had had
with the Prince <hi>Perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us,</hi> which he did with an ardency that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhewed the great intereſt he took in it.</p>
                  <p>When he had ended thoſe diſcourſes, he beheld <hi>Aemylius</hi> after
a manner which ſignifi'd, that what he was going to ſpeak, was yet
more agreeable then all he had already ſpoken. Which <hi>Emilius</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of, and beholding the amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> with an obliging
ſmile: To anſwer to your eyes (ſaid he) rather then to the careſſes
you have ſpoken, I will ſpeak concerning my ſiſter, and aſſure you,
that if we are not much obliged to thoſe who eſteem our enemies,
you are without queſtion not much obliged to <hi>Emilia.</hi> For as ſuch
enemies alone (continued he ſmiling again) are contemned who are
not feared, ſo they ſeem onely to be looked upon as conſiderable,
that are accounted terrible; and conſequently my ſiſter eſteems the
enemies of <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſince ſhe extreamly dreads them. Ah! <hi>Emilius</hi>
(anſwered this paſſionate Lover) how happy ſhould I be, if your
adorable ſiſter had ſuch an obliging fear! I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that fear conduces to
your happineſs (replyed he) you have no cauſe to complain of your
fortune, for <hi>Aemylia</hi> permitted me to diſcover a certain diſcontent
he had, which aſſuredly the intereſt of Rome alone did not produce,
when it was reported there, that the Kings of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> and <hi>Illerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
were united with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that the Prince <hi>Lucius</hi> was
arriv'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that their Armies were extreamly ſtrong.
Upon which their united forces ſeemed to her ſo formidable, that
verily (added he ſmiling) if you had had the ſame ſentiments with
her, we ſhould not now be making this converſation in New <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
in the manner we are.</p>
                  <p>He had ſcarce ended theſe words, but a Centurion entered with
very much haſte; and as he was going to ſpeak to his General, I
entered alſo, followed with ten or a dozen Officers, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
me to viſit <hi>Emilius;</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> retir'd to one of the
Windows to hear vvhat the Centurion had to ſay to him; My
Lord (ſaid he preſently with much commotion of countenance)
you have never ſeen any thing ſo handſom as what I ſhall cauſe you
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60667:132"/>
to ſee at this preſent. There are ſo many kinds of handſomneſs (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the moderate <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſmiling) that it is difficult for me to
comprehended what you mean, unleſs you ſpeak ſomewhat more
clearly concerning the thing you intend to ſhew me. 'Tis, my Lord
(replyed he immediately) the incomparable <hi>Olinda;</hi> 'tis the fair
Princeſs of the <hi>Illergetes;</hi> and in a word, 'tis that rare perſon whom
the Prince <hi>Lucius</hi> is infinitely enamoured of, and all <hi>Spain</hi> admires.
Yes, my Lord (added he) 'tis that charming Lady whom I have
cauſed to be put in a place of ſafety, and I am going to cauſe her to
be brought to you at this inſtant. You need only conduct me
where ſhe is (interrupted the generous <hi>Scipio</hi>) for it is inconſiſtent
with decency to give that kind of trouble to a perſon of her ſex,
merit, and quality. After theſe words, he accordingly went whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Centurion conducted him, before he ſo much as cauſed
ſome ſlight wounds he had received to be dreſſed, which he had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
before through his ardency to deliver <hi>Emilia's,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with him concerning his divine ſiſter; beſides that the great
number of priſoners I told you of were preſented to him of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>The Centurion had no ſooner opened the door of the Hall where
the Princeſs <hi>Olinda</hi> was, but offering to retire he was retain'd by
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and cauſed to follow him; but as he advanced towards that
young and handſome perſon, he perceived ſhe was all alone; upon
which he ſuddenly ſtopt, and inſtead of approachig to her, retired
after he had made her a low reverence. At which time he forthwith
ſent to call ſome Ladies of <hi>Carthage,</hi> deſiring them to abide with
the Princeſs of the <hi>Illergetes;</hi> and taking ſome Officers alſo with
him, he entered again and advanced towards her. The youth of the
Conqueror, and the beauty of the Priſoner would not without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
have promiſed the ſucceſs that was admired in this interview,
if <hi>Scipio</hi> had not bin the Conqueror; but <hi>Olinda</hi> knowing him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medately
by his goodly aſpect, and better by the action he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
at his entering the firſt time, ſhe aroſe up, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, offering to caſt her ſelf at his feet, not ſo much for her
own intereſt, being generous enough not to be capable of fear, but
to ſhew all kind of ſubmiſſion to a Conqueror, who by the right of
Arms had an abſolute power over the King and the Queen of the
<hi>Illergetes. Scipio</hi> preſently reſtrain'd her purpoſe, and told her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an obliging &amp; reſpectful manner, that it belonged to the Princeſs
<hi>Olinda</hi> to receive ſuch homages from men that approacht her. I
proteſt to you, my Lord (anſwered ſhe) that I would render that
reſpect to you leſs as conqueror of—Madam (interrupted he) if
you would render it with juſtice, I ſhall conduct you towards the
perſons to whom alone you owe it. For I am not come, Madam,
but to beſeech you moſt humbly, that you would pleaſe to pardon
thoſe who apparantly have not treated you with all the cautious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
that is due to you; I am not come but to declare so you,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60667:132"/>
that you are not only free, but that you are ſtill Princeſs of the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lergetes,</hi>
and to lead you my ſelf to the Queen your Mother, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
decency and affection require you to go, and whither virtue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
and the reſpect I owe you, oblige me to conduct you. <hi>Olin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
admired the high generoſity of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and having made him a
remerciment ſufficiently expreſſing her gratitude, and the eſteem
ſhe had of the grandeur of his mind, ſhe tendered him her hand,
and went accordingly to the Palace, whither the King her Father
was retired with the Queen his wife.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as <hi>Scipio</hi> had remitted the Princeſs <hi>Olinda</hi> into the hands
of the Queen her Mother, and received a thouſand thanks for it,
accompanied with praiſes and acclamations, he went to the houſe
he had made choiſe of to reſide in, and cauſed himſelf to be dreſs'd,
whence afterwards he went to ſee the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia. Lucius</hi>
immediately advanced towards <hi>Scipio,</hi> and without either pride or
lowneſs performed all the honours he judged befitting an Illuſtrious
Conqueror, which he never accompanied with that ſhameful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
that ſhe vanquiſhed, who preſerve not all their generoſity
in bad fortune, are wont to expreſs towards thoſe whom the lot of
Arms declares their Maſters. But the deportment of <hi>Lucius</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced,
that that Prince had a ſoul above his misfortune, ſince their
could not be obſerved in him that ferocity which is ſometimes
affected in like occaſions to ſhew greatneſs of courage; nor that
low yieldance, that is often made uſe of to draw the compaſſion of
a Conqueror. But if the Prince of <hi>Celtiberia</hi>'s acting in this ſort,
made it appear that he did not too much remember his defect, the
civilities that <hi>Scipio</hi> return'd him, ſhew'd ſufficiently that he forgot
his Victory. They parted therefore with very much eſteem one for
another, after the Illuſtrious Roman had told the generous <hi>Celti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berian</hi>
he was free; but yet he deſired him he would defer to make
uſe of the liberty he gave him till the next morning. After which
he retired; and as he was about to diſpatch <hi>Flavius</hi> to <hi>Aemilius,</hi>
and cauſe a kinſman of <hi>Flaminius</hi> to depart and advertiſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of all that had paſs'd, he beheld five or ſix men enter into his
Chamber, the firſt of which preceded two others which carried
two magnificent ſhields, fill'd, as was ſoon perceived, with Gold
and Jewels. He that was to preſent them advanc'd, and having
made a low reverence, told <hi>Scipio,</hi> that the King of the <hi>Illergetes</hi> his
Maſter, had ſent him the ranſom of the Princeſs his daughter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to levy forces in lieu of his own; and venture his life for
the ſervice of an Illuſtrious Victor who had ſo generouſly given
him it.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall tell the King your Maſter (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his friendſhip, but not his preſent; for ſince I have bin able to
reſtore him a treaſure of ineſtimable value, he ought not to believe
me capable to receive that which he now offers me. Ah! my Lord
(cryed the <hi>Illergete</hi>) what generoſity is this? After which having
muſed a little, he ſuddenly added, My Lord, I muſt in brief declare
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60667:133"/>
to you, notwithſtanding the concealed intereſt of my own in the
matter, that all the world wiſhes you would marry the Princeſs
<hi>Olinda,</hi> and that you would eſtabliſh your ſelf King of <hi>Spain.</hi> I ſhall
take your propoſals into conſideration (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi> ſmiling)
and in the mean time you may tell the fair Princeſs of the <hi>Illergetes,</hi>
that if I have broken her Chains to day, 'tis poſſible I may faſten
them to morrow with an indiſſoluble knot.</p>
                  <p>After theſe words, the <hi>Illergete</hi> retired, <hi>Scipio</hi> diſpatcht thoſe he
intended to ſend to <hi>Rome,</hi> entertained diſcourſe with <hi>Aemilius</hi> a
while, and ſo went to his reſt. The next morning he was no ſooner
in a condition to be ſeen by all perſons without diſtinction, but the
Kings of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> and the <hi>Illergetes,</hi> with the Queens their Wives,
followed by <hi>Olinda,</hi> and cauſing more magnificent preſents then
thoſe <hi>Scipio</hi> had returned to be brought with them, entered into his
Chamber, and immediately proteſted they would refuſe the liberty
<hi>Scipio</hi> had given them, if he would not accept that which they
came to offer him. <hi>Scipio</hi> anſwered, that he did not refuſe the
thing of greataſt value that had bin offered him, which was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the two Kings. But, my Lord (ſaid the Queen of the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lergetes</hi>
to him) it is requiſite, and that abſolutely too, either that
you receive the ranſom which we offer you for <hi>Olinda,</hi> or that <hi>Olin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
her ſelf reſume her fetters. To do yet more then you deſire, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi> ſmiling in an obliging manner) I will accept
all that you offer me, and I will conſent alſo that the Princeſs <hi>Olin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
ceaſe to be free. In ending which words, he whiſpered to an
Officer, after he had deſired the Queens permiſſion; and as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
preſently that ſhe of <hi>Celtiberia</hi> appeared to be very ſad, he
comforted her, by informing her that the Prince <hi>Lucius</hi> was not
dangerouſly wounded. You have ſeen him then, my Lord, (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
ſhe preſently with much ſatisfaction) and according to what
you ſay, he is your priſoner. 'Tis true, I have ſeen him, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(replyed he) but I do not agree with you as to the reſt, and
eſpecially before the fair Princeſs of the <hi>Illergetes,</hi> with whom I
ſhould be much troubled to have any conteſt in uſurping her
rights.</p>
                  <p>As he ended theſe words, <hi>Lucius</hi> entered, and his preſence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fill'd the Kings and Queens with joy, and caus'd the modeſt
<hi>Olinda</hi> to bluſh, alſo fill'd the ſpectators with contentment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.
But, Madam, it needs not that I ſhould here detain you
in particularizing an action all the world has wondered at, even
to the leaſt circumſtances. I ſhall content my ſelf to tell you, that
then it was that <hi>Scipio</hi> made the memorable marriage of <hi>Lucius</hi> and
<hi>Olinda,</hi> that he gave that Princeſs all that he was conſtrained to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a little before, that he wholly gain'd the hearts of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
and fill'd all the earth with veneration of his virtue, as it was
already fill'd with the fame of his Valour and his Victories. In fine,
Madam, I have now ſpoken of an action that all the Nations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,
all Painters repreſents, and all excellent wits write of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60667:133"/>
to eternity, and make admir'd as long as virtue ſhall be
known in the world. As <hi>Laelius</hi> was upon this part of his Narration,
the Prince <hi>Magasba</hi> entered into the Chamber of the Princeſs his
daughter, and told her with a kind of haſte and ſeverity, that ſhe
was to be reproved for not being at the Chamber of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> that
that Illuſtrious Roman Lady had bin in a condition to be ſeen above
a quarter of an hour ago, and that for his own part, he had not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to go to that of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and to yours alſo; My Lord (continued
he, addreſſing to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lius</hi>) where I had the unhappineſs not to find
you. <hi>Laelius</hi> made his remerciment with a low reverence, after
which obſerving <hi>Magasba,</hi> went out to return again to <hi>Scipio</hi> (as he
had told him) and that <hi>Palmira</hi> intended to go to the Chamber of
<hi>Emilia,</hi> he gave her his hand, and to <hi>Nadalia</hi> alſo, and ſo they went
all three thither, but it was with an air perfectly agreeable, and very
different from that of the Prince of <hi>Capſa.</hi> But for that it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
late, <hi>Aemilia</hi> delayed not to deſcend down into a low Hall, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Scipio, Magasba, Regulus</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> likewiſe repair'd, and were
all there magnificently treated. The converſation that was made
afterwards was extreamly pleaſing; and that which was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
was, that the modeſt <hi>Aemylia</hi> often ſhewed a lovely mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Carnation in her countenance, when it came into her mind
that <hi>Laelius</hi> had newly related her Hiſtory. In the evening this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
company went to walk in the Garden, where <hi>Magasba</hi> gave
the hand to <hi>Aemylia, Scipio</hi> to <hi>Palmira, Regulus</hi> to <hi>Nadalia,</hi> and <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
and <hi>Cato,</hi> went together, till inſenſibly <hi>Scipio, Aemilia, Magasba,</hi>
and <hi>Palmira,</hi> were ſeparated from the reſt, and entered into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Arbor of Jaſmine, <hi>Regulus</hi> and <hi>Nadalia</hi> reſted themſelves in a
Banquetting-houſe, and <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> continued walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a fair and ſpacious walk, that led to a gate of the Garden.
But as <hi>Laelius</hi> was at that time in expectation of news from the Camp,
and likewiſe from <hi>Carthage</hi> (for <hi>Terence</hi> who was there, was either
to write to him, or to come and find him at <hi>Capſa</hi> to ſpeak in favour
of the Delegates of his City, to the end <hi>Scipio</hi> might receive them
more graciouſly) he was ſuddenly ſurpris'd when he beheld three
ſtrangers enter into the Garden, whoſe faces were at firſt unknown
to him. But advancing towards them, he ſoon perceived that two
of them were young Romans of goodly perſonages, <hi>Rutilius</hi> and
<hi>Albinus,</hi> whereof the firſt was Couſin to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and had not
long before obtained the command of a Legion; after which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
his eyes upon the third, he was agreeably ſurpris'd when he
ſaw it was the famous <hi>Terence,</hi> whoſe wit was ſo celebrated in the
world, and whoſe Verſes were of a ſtrain ſo facil and agreeable,
that it was impoſſible not to be charmed by them. As ſoon as <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
had careſſed the three ſtrangers with affectionate civilities,
and ſutable to their qualitie and merit, he led them to the Arbour
where <hi>Aemilia</hi> was, who received them with an air extreamly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging,
though expreſſing ſuch tokens of affection to <hi>Rutilius,</hi> as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60667:134"/>
                     <hi>Albinus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> could not reaſonably expect. But when <hi>Scipio,
Aemilia, Magasba, Palmira, Laelius, Cato,</hi> and the three ſtrangers
had paſſed all the Ceremonies uſual in ſuch occaſions, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
became perfectly handſome; and that which rendered it
more agreeable, was, a pleaſant piece of Railery between <hi>Laelius</hi>
and <hi>Nadalia.</hi> For this lovely Virgin coming to rejoyn with the
company, <hi>Laelius</hi> advanced towards her, and preſenting <hi>Terence</hi>
to her without naming him: I do not content my ſelf, fair <hi>Nadalia</hi>
(ſaid he to her) to be your friend; but I deſire to make this ſtranger
known to you, who will ſoon be likewiſe that in quality. You aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the matter very confidently (anſwered ſhe). If perſons of the
ſame Country (interrupted he) have great inclinations to love and
kindneſs, when they meet at diſtance from it, you ought not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at what I ſay. How? (interrupted ſhe again) is this ſtranger a
Spaniard? Yes, Madam, I am ſo (anſwered <hi>Terence</hi> in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of that Nation) and if <hi>Laelius</hi> do not deceive himſelf, my
birth will be extreamly advantageous to me. Ah, <hi>Laelius</hi> (cryed ſhe
immediately) the accent of this ſtranger does little agree with your
words. Nevertheleſs (anſwered <hi>Laelius</hi> ſmiling) if he be not <hi>a
Spaniard,</hi> yet he is a rare wit, and conſequently better deſerves in
this latter quality the friendſhip of <hi>Nadalia.</hi> Believe him not, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
(anſwered <hi>Terence</hi> agreably) he deceives you a ſecond time;
but if my accent has already diſabus'd you, my words ſhall ſoon free
you from the ſecond error. In ſpeaking as you do (replyed ſhe)
you manifeſt that he does not delude me; yet I will not pardon him
the prank he has ſhewn me in repreſenting you to me for a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
unleſs he tells me who you are. That you ſhall not know (anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Laelius.</hi>) Upon which words <hi>Nadalia</hi> became ſo impatient, that
addreſſing to <hi>Aemilia,</hi> and having obſerved in the countenances,
ſhe beheld little readineſs to ſatisfie her; In the name of the Gods,
Madam (ſaid ſhe to her) make me know who this ſtranger is;
whoſe aſpect is ſo ſprightly, and who ſpeakes in ſo pleaſant a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I know not (anſwered the diſcreet <hi>Aemilia</hi>) whether you will
not be as much ſurpris'd as I was, when you are told 'tis the famous
<hi>Terence</hi> that you are diſcourſing with. Verily, Madam (replyed
<hi>Nadalia</hi>) I am extreamly joyful to know ſo vvorthy a perſon, and
to ſee that he is not at all diſordered; the firſt time he enters into a
great company where he is infinitely eſteemed. I ſee not that he has
cauſe to be ſo (anſwered <hi>Aemylia</hi>) ſince he is ſo eſteemed as you
ſay. But, Madam (replyed <hi>Nadalia</hi>) be pleaſed to conſider, there
is nothing more troubleſome then to go into a great aſſembly to
make good a great reputation; for if ſuch a perſon ſpeaks ſubli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he diſtaſts many of the company; And if he ſpeaks otherwiſe;
without doubt he does not maintain the eſteem that was conceived
of him. And this is ſo true (added ſhe ſmiling) that if I were
fame, I would not exceſſively commend perſons of wit in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they are to go.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:60667:134"/>
There is a greater unhappineſs in that vvhich you ſay (anſvver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Terence</hi> pleaſantly) which is, that vvhen a man is once receiv'd
for a vvit, though he ſhould aftervvards ſpeak the handſomeſt
things in the vvorld, and had the art even to pleaſe generally, yet
he vvould not be eſteemed the more, becauſe it vvould be alvvays
believ'd that he ſpeaks out of obligation, and that it is much eaſier
for him to acquit himſelf more agreeably then they vvho have not
the ſame deſign. That vvhich I apprehend inconvenient to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
we ſpeak of (ſaid the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi>) is, that it ſeems they
ought alvvays to have a peculiar language, and 'tis no longer free
for them to imploy ſuch terms as are ordinarily uſed. And that
which I find moſt unjuſt (ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi>) at leaſt in reference to their
vvorks, is, that there are certain people, vvho pretending to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vvit, ſpeak of a handſome Comedy, or ſuch like divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vvith a contemning judgement, and look upon them as meer
triflles, vvithout conſidering that the moſt excellent morality, and
the ſubtileſt policy may be learnt in them, after a pleaſing manner,
and far from the ſeverity of Maxims.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Scipio</hi> ended theſe vvords he obſerv'd a happy opportunity
offered to ſpeak to <hi>Aemilia;</hi> upon vvhich he turned tovvards her,
to entertain her vvith that profound reſpect that never abandon'd
him in the preſence of the fair perſon: For, advantageouſly for
him, <hi>Magasba</hi> vvas diſcourſing for ſome time vvith <hi>Cato,</hi> and ſo left
him liberty to ſpeak to the perſon he lov'd, though rather out of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
then addreſs. <hi>Palmira, Regulus, Rutilius,</hi> and <hi>Albinus,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
themſelves very agreeably, and the converſation of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalia,
Laelius,</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> vvas no queſtion gallant and debonair.
But vvhen it grevv late, the Illuſtrious company reunited their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
about vvhich time <hi>Nadalia</hi> vvas deſiring <hi>Terence</hi> to
give her ſome Verſes of his compoſing, and asking for them vvith
ſomething a loud voice; <hi>Cato,</hi> vvho vvas not far diſtant over-heard
her, and anſvvering her vvith a cold and ſerious ſmile; It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
then (ſaid he) that you give him ſome other thing, for in my
apprehenſion there is nothing of more povverfull inſpiration to
handſome Poetry, then that vvhich I underſtand. You have ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
experienc'd vvhat you ſay you underſtand (anſvvered <hi>Nadalia</hi>
ſmiling) that methinks you are not a very fit perſon to vvhom to
be referred in this caſe. 'Tis true indeed (ſaid <hi>Scipio</hi> to <hi>Cato</hi>) that
I cannot herein be of your opinion, though it be the ſame that moſt
of the vvorld follovvs: for I never could conceive it poſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
a violent paſſion vvell in meaſur'd vvords, and confine
tranſports that vvill ovvn no bounds to a limited of expreſſion.
Beſides (added <hi>Nadalia</hi>) I never can indure thoſe ſuperfluous
vvords (vvherewith ſuch kind of Verſes are ordinarily fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
though I vvere capable of not hating thoſe pieces of gallantry
as I certainly do. Yet I have a vvay to cauſe you to receive the
Verſes vve ſpeak of (anſvvered <hi>Terence</hi> ſmiling). But, <hi>Terence</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60667:135"/>
                     <hi>Laelius</hi>) how dare you ſpeak as you do, after what we
have from the mouth of <hi>Nadalia.</hi> Do you not know (continued
he) that that fair perſon would be as cruel a Miſtreſs, as ſhe is
really a good friend; that ſhe had rather ſee a Lover die, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
his paſſion: And laſtly, that there is nothing but the
death of a poor ſlave that could warrant a diſcovery, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing
her, that her fetters were worn. Aſſuredly <hi>Terence</hi> did not
remember all theſe things (ſaid <hi>Palmira</hi> ſmiling). Pardon me,
Madam (anſwered he to her) 'twas becauſe I did remember them,
that I ſpake after that manner that ſurpris'd <hi>Laelius.</hi> It would be a
deſirable pleaſure then (replyed ſhe) to hear the way you ſpeak of,
for I preſume it will be one of thoſe pleaſant turns of wit that you
are accuſtomed to uſe. Sincerely, Madam (anſwered he, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſpeak ſeriouſly) there will be neither mirth nor pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in what I intend to make. What is it then you intend to make?
(ſaid <hi>Aemilia</hi> with a little ſmile). My own Epitaph, Madam (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he with his affected ſeriouſneſs) for ſince <hi>Nadalia</hi> ſaies ſhe
would underſtand the paſſion of a dead man without being incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and that a dead man can ſpeak only by his Epitaph, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to judge, Madam, whether I have not reaſon to ſet upon the
making of mine, and ſend it to her.</p>
                  <p>All the company laughed at the agreeable conceit of <hi>Terence,</hi> and
<hi>Nadalia</hi> having beheld him ſmiling alſo; Verily (ſaid ſhe to him)
this conceit ſeems to me ſo exquiſitely ingenious, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
vvill be glad you make what you ſpeak of; and for my part,
I ſhall be extreamly pleaſed with it, for I confeſs to you ſuch kind
of fancies are perfectly correſpondent to my humour. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
was upon a ſubject ſo agreeable, that it would have bin
continued longer if time had permitted: but for that it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
late, the Illuſtrious Company retyr'd, and aſſoon as they came
into the low Hall, which was handſomely beſet with Lights, <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
and <hi>Terence</hi> went apart by themſelves to ſpeak of important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
though after <hi>Nadalia</hi> had ſmilingly told the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> ſhe
would expect his Epitaph.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Terence</hi> did not ſup that night at the Palace of <hi>Magasba;</hi> becauſe
having a friend that was unwilling yet to ſhew himſelf, he did
not account it fit to leave him alone: Beſides (added he ſmiling,
in anſwer to thoſe that deſired to ſtay him) I do not conceive a
Palace (where nothing but glorious and brave ſpectacles amaze
the eyes, and where all thoughts are unſutable but thoſe of joy)
a fit place to inſpire me with Funerall Verſes. But if the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of ſo worthy a perſon was wanting in this Illuſtrious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the productions of his Wit were not; for they had no
ſooner diſpoſed themſelves to paſs the evening with Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but a man who was preſently known to be a Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
entered, and after a low reverence delivered a Pacquet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of <hi>Nadalia.</hi> Aſſoon as this amiable Lady had
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60667:135"/>
her eyes upon it, ſhe perceived it was a rich Writing-Table,
wherein ſhe preſently read theſe words which were written in a
Character not unknown to her;</p>
                  <q>To a fair perſon, who will not underſtand

                  <p>

                  <p>All the company unanimouſly applauded the hand ſomneſs of
this conceit, and condemned the ſentiment of <hi>Nadalia,</hi> ſince in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
death has all the contrary qualities to thoſe we ſee in the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons of Lovers: but as they were going to attaque that fair
perſon, who was at that time not ſo debonair as uſual, ſhe gladly
took occaſion to avoid the on-ſet, by opening the other Tablets
which ſhe received, the cover of which was plain black without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription,
and in which ſhe read the following words,</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>I expect your Epitaph. Theſe, fair <hi>Nadalia,</hi> were the terrible words
you ſpoke at my parting from you. I know well you have demanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond your rights. I know you need onely declare your pleaſure to
perſons that know you as well as I do, and that I ought not to diſobey you,
even when you require my Epitaph. Nevertheleſs I preſume to ſay you
ought ſomething to ſweeten the matter, and might have ſhewn leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs
in pronouncing theſe cruel words, and moreover that you ought
not to demand my Epitaph with the ſame air that another Lady would
have askt me for a Sonnet. 'Tis true, that being you had rather behold
the death of a Lover then understand his paſsion, you are ſo often oblig'd
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60667:136"/>
to deſire Epitaphs, that being accuſtomed thereto, you ſpeak at preſent
not onely without reluctance, but even with your ordinary debonarity.
But ſince a dead man may tell you the ſentiments he has, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, I believe one that ſends you his Epitaph, ought to have the ſame
liberty, and conſequently I may declare to you that I am abſolutely yours.
But, fair <hi>Nadalia,</hi> I mean with all the reſpect that is due to you: for,
as for any thing more, in truth I feel my ſelf not yet dead enough to
preſume to ſpeak it.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>The end of this Letter immediately appeared ſo pleaſantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
that all the company was agreeably ſurpriſed with it: and as
they were going to ſpeak concerning the wit that was reſplendent
in all the works of <hi>Terence, Nadalia</hi> read the following Verſes;</p>
                  <lg>
                     <head>EPITAPH.</head>
                     <l>Stay Couſned Reader, and forbear to cry,</l>
                     <l>But rather envy my bleſt deſtiny.</l>
                     <l>It was <hi>Nadalia</hi> ſlew me; for her ſake</l>
                     <l>I paſs'd with gladneſs o're the Stygian Lake,</l>
                     <l>That I might bear the news to ſhades below;</l>
                     <l>'Twas to her eyes that I my Fate did owe.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>But after I had looked long in vain,</l>
                     <l>'Mongſt all the Ghoſts that in Elyſium raign,</l>
                     <l>I found it true; that, nor the world above,</l>
                     <l>Nor this had any, that deſerv'd her love.</l>
                     <l>Go, pray her then the favour we may have,</l>
                     <l>At leaſt to take repoſe within thy Grave.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>If the Letter of <hi>Terence</hi> was judg'd ingenious, his Verſes did not
ſeem leſs handſome; and as they obſerv'd the happineſs of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
in them, and that both pieces were of the ſame Author, the
opinions of this Illuſtrious company were divided, whilſt ſome
perſons of wit commended the Epitaph that was now read, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
repeated with applauſe the handſomeſt paſſages of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preceding it. But that which occaſioned a little wonder, was,
that <hi>Nadalia</hi> did not ſpeak ſo much in this occaſion as was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
it was remembred that ſhe appeared a little penſive before ſhe
opened the Tablets of <hi>Terence:</hi> and if ſome kind of pleaſantneſs
appeared in her countenance, it was eaſily obſervable not to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that ſprightly jollity that was natural to her. Whereupon ſhe
was ſet upon by <hi>Laelius,</hi> who told her ſmilingly, he wondered ſhe
had loſt her cheerfulneſs even before the apparition of <hi>Terence.</hi> Yet
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60667:136"/>
methinks (ſaid <hi>Aemilia</hi>) ſhe has very much left ſtill. No doubt,
Madam, (anſwered <hi>Regulus</hi> ſmiling) you apprehend ſo, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe has very much wit. But for that ſhe has alſo very many
enemies (replied the Princeſs of <hi>Hippo</hi>) it is fit that ſhe have alſo
ſome friends. If ſhe ſtood in need of friends after what you have
ſaid, Madam (anſwered <hi>Scipio</hi>) I ſhould preſently embrace her
party. You do me too great a favour, my Lord (ſaid <hi>Nadalia</hi>) but
I have no neceſſity of ſo great a ſuccour in this occaſion, and I ſhall
onely deſire a protection which two fair and Illuſtrious perſons will
without doubt not refuſe me: ſince therefore (added he ſmiling)
I need only my jolly humour to ſilence thoſe that attaque me, and
to manifeſt, that at leaſt in this encounter I am able to ſurmount my
enemies by laughing. But ſince laughter is a thing not voluntary
(anſwered <hi>Regulus</hi> pleaſantly) you cannot overcome us when you
pleaſe; yet I need only to expreſs my debonarity (replyed ſhe) to
manifeſt my triumph. But you know well, fair <hi>Nadalia</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>)
that mirth ought to be ſpontaneouſly produced, and when it
is enforc'd, it ceaſes to be agreeable, and our heart diſowns it as a
ſtranger: Moreover (added he ſmiling) the cheerfulneſs we ſpeak of,
methinks, ſeems conſtrain'd in the borrowed attire it is dreſs'd with;
and it is impoſſible it ſhould pleaſe when it beſpeaks obſervation
and effects to be taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>This conceit of <hi>Laelius</hi> gave the company occaſion of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and caus'd much divertiſement in this evening's converſation,
in which <hi>Rutilius</hi> &amp; <hi>Albinus</hi> ingaged themſelves agreeably: and even
the Prince of <hi>Capſa</hi> &amp; <hi>Cato</hi> ſpake ſome things of a ſtrain not very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
with them; <hi>Magasba</hi> conceiving himſelf oblig'd to ſpeak
to the perſons he entertained in ſuch manner as might be moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to them, and <hi>Cato</hi> judging it fit to remit a little of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
ſince he beheld nothing auſtere in the perſons in whom he
admired a noble prudence, and a ſublime virtue. But when it was
time for this Illuſtrious Company to ſeparate, the two famous
friends went to entertain themſelves after a very different ſort, ſince
they went to ſpeak of the charmes of the divine <hi>Aemilia,</hi> which they
never did, but after a manner in which might be ſeen a profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
mix'd with an exordinary admiration. Their converſation
indeed did not endure long; for it being extreamly late, <hi>Laelius</hi>
referred the relating of the important affairs he had to inform me
of, to the next morning, as alſo the giving him account of what he
had lately underſtood concerning the Deputations of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.
The amorous <hi>Scipio</hi> much uncapable to expect with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
what was promiſed him, reſented a ſenſible grief as ſoon
as <hi>Laelius</hi> was gone out of his Chamber: for when the Idea of
<hi>Aemylia</hi> preſently fill'd whole extent of his imagination, he could
not conſider that that admirable Lady was the faireſt perſon in the
world, and the perſon in the world that he loved moſt, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
repaſſing in his mind all the obſtacles that had hindered
him from being happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:60667:137"/>
This remembrance would without doubt have cauſed him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
with grief, if he had not ſweetned it by coming ſuddainly to
think that his rivals were yet more unhappy then himſelf; and that
beſides, that their pretenſions were not better favour'd, they had
not then the advantage of ſeeing <hi>Aemilia,</hi> of being lodg'd in the
ſame Palace, and having Illuſtrious perſons with her to promote
the intereſt of their paſſions. From theſe thoughts he was capable
to paſs to that of conquering his enemies; for in this conjuncture
he was able to beſtow a part of his cares for the intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi>
without ceaſing to think on the beauty of <hi>Aemilia,</hi> becauſe his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
was then a dependance of his love; ſo that it may be ſaid,
this Illuſtrious Lover in betaking himſelf to his bed, did leſs aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
himſelf to reſt, then to the tyranny of thoſe two violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
