            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherein <hi>SHIMEIES</hi> curses shall

late famine of Israel for the forgotten

what note God takes of our oathes, and
<pb facs="tcp:3837:4"/>
what sure vengeance of their violation.
<hi>DAVIDS</hi> muster seconded with the
plague of Israel teaches, how highly God
may be offended with sinnes of the least
appearance, how seuere to his owne, how
mercifull in that seueritie. If these my

heart, and a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
head, and a
weeping eie, and
bare feet, is <hi>Dauid</hi> gone away
from Hierusalem; neuer did he
with more ioy come vp to his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3837:6"/>
citie, then now he left it with
sorrow: how could he doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
whom the insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his owne Sonne droue
out from his house, from his
throne, from the Arke of God?
and now, when the depth of
this griefe deserued nothing but
compassion, the foule mouth of
<hi>Shimei</hi> entertaines <hi>Dauid</hi> with
curses: There is no small cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the picking out of a time
for mischiefe; That word would
scarce gall at one season, which
at another killeth. The same
shaft flying with the winde
pierces deepe, which against it,
can hardly finde strength to
sticke vpright. The valour, and
iustice of children condemnes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3837:6"/>
it for iniuriously cowardly to
strike their aduersary when he
is once downe. It is the murder
of the tongue to insult vpon
those, whom God hath hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and to draw bloud of that
backe, which is yet blew from
the hand of the Almightie. If
<hi>Shimei</hi> had not presumed vpon
<hi>Dauids</hi> deiection, he durst not
haue beene thus bold; now he
that perhaps durst not haue
lookt at one of those Worthies
single, defies them all at once,
and doth both cast, and speake
stones against <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all his
armie. The malice of a base spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
sometimes carries them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the courage of the
valiant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3837:7"/>
In all the time of <hi>Dauids</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie,
we heard no newes of
<hi>Shimei;</hi> his silence and coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obedience made him passe
for a good subiect; yet all that
while was his heart vnsound,
and trayterous. Peace and good
successe hides many a false heart;
(like as a snow-drift couers an
heape of dung) which once
melting away descryes the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse
that lay within: Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and welfare are but flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
glasses of mens affections;
aduersitie will not deceiue vs;
but will make a true report as of
our owne powers, so of the
dispositions of others.</p>
                  <p>He that smiled on <hi>Dauid</hi> in
his throne, curseth him in his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3837:7"/>
flight; if there be any quarrels,
any exceptions to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a man, let him looke to
haue them laid in his dish when
he fares the hardest. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
haue wicked men learnt
of their master to take the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
aduantages of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
He that suffers had need to
be double armed, both against
paine, and censure.</p>
                  <p>Euery word of <hi>Shimei</hi> was a
slaunder; He that tooke <hi>Sauls</hi>
speare from his head, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to haue but cut the lap of
his garment, is reproched as a
man of bloud; The man after
Gods owne heart is branded for
a man of <hi>Belial.</hi> He that was
sent for out of the fields to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3837:8"/>
anointed, is taxed for an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
If <hi>Dauids</hi> hands were stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with bloud, yet not of <hi>Sauls</hi>
house; it was his seruant, not
his master that bled by him; yet
is the bloud of the Lords anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cast in <hi>Dauids</hi> teeth, by the
spight of a false tongue. Did
we not see <hi>Dauid</hi> (after all the
proofes of his humble loyaltie)
shedding the bloud of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malakite
who did but say he
shed <hi>Sauls?</hi> Did we not heare
him lament passionately for the
death of so ill a master, chiding
the mountaines of Gilboa on
which he fell; and angerly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
that no dewe might fall
where that bloud was powred
out; and charging the daughters
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3837:8"/>
of Israel to weepe ouer <hi>Saul,</hi>
who had clothed them in scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let?
Did we not heare and see
him inquiring for any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> that he
might shew him the kindnesse
of God? Did we not see him
honouring lame <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>
with a princely seat at his owne
table? Did we not see him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging
the bloud of his riuall
<hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> vpon the heads of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab</hi>
and <hi>Baanah?</hi> What could
any liuing man haue done
more to wipe off these bloudy
aspersions? Yet is not a <hi>Shimei</hi>
ashamed to charge innocent
<hi>Dauid</hi> with all the bloud of the
house of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How is it likely this clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3837:9"/>
wretch had secretly tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the name of <hi>Dauid,</hi> all the
time of his gouernment, that
dares thus accuse him to his
face, before all the mightie men
of Israel, who were witnesses
of the contrary? The greater
the person is, the more open doe
his actions lie to mis-interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and censure. Euery tongue
speakes partially according to
the interest he hath in the cause,
or the patient. It is not possible
that eminent persons should be
free from imputations; Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
can no more protect
them, then power.</p>
                  <p>If the patience of <hi>Dauid</hi> can
digest this indignitie, his traine
cannot; their fingers could not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3837:9"/>
but itch to returne iron for
stones. If <hi>Shimei</hi> raile on <hi>Dauid,
Abishai</hi> railes on <hi>Shimei; Shimei</hi> is
of <hi>Sauls</hi> familie, <hi>Abishai</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids;</hi>
each speakes for his owne;
<hi>Abishai</hi> most iustly bends his
tongue against <hi>Shimei,</hi> as <hi>Shimei</hi>
against <hi>Dauid,</hi> most vniustly;
Had <hi>Shimei</hi> been any other then
a dog, he had neuer so rudely
barked at an harmlesse passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
neither could he deserue
lesse then the losse of that head
which had vttered such blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
against Gods anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
The zeale of <hi>Abishai</hi> doth
but plead for iustice, and is
checked; <hi>What haue I to doe
with you ye sonnes of Zeruiah?
Dauid</hi> said not so much to his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3837:10"/>
reuiler, as to his abettor: He
well saw that a reuenge was
iust, but not seasonable; he
found the present a fit time to
suffer wrongs, not to right
them: he therefore giues way
rather meekly to his owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
then to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of another; There are
seasons wherein lawfull moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not fit to be cherished;
Anger doth not become a
mourner; One passion at once
is enough for the soule. Vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
zeale may be more preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall,
then a cold remisnesse.</p>
                  <p>What if the Lord for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of his seruant haue said
vnto <hi>Shimei,</hi> Curse <hi>Dauid;</hi> yet is
<hi>Shimeies</hi> curse no lesse worthy of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3837:10"/>
                     <hi>Abishaies</hi> sword; the sinne of
<hi>Shimeies</hi> curse was his owne,
the smart of the curse was Gods;
God wils that as <hi>Dauids</hi> chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he hates as <hi>Shime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies</hi>
wickednesse; That lewd
tongue moued from God, it
moued lewdly from Satan. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men are neuer the freer
from guilt, or punishment, for
that hand which the holy God
hath in their offensiue actions;
Yet <hi>Dauid</hi> can say, <hi>Let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and let him curse, for the
Lord hath bidden him;</hi> as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to giue a reason of his
owne patience, rather then <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meies</hi>
impunitie; the issue showd
how well <hi>Dauid</hi> could distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
betwixt the act of God,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3837:11"/>
and of a traytor; how he could
both kisse the rod, and burne it;
There can be none so strong
motiue of our meeke submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to euils, as the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their originall; He that
can see the hand of God stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by the hand or tongue
of an enemie, shall more awe
the first mouer of his harme,
then maligne the instrument.</p>
                  <p>Euen whiles <hi>Dauid</hi> laments
the rebellion of his sonne, he
gaines by it; and makes that
the argument of his patience,
which was the exercise of it.
<hi>Behold, my sonne which came forth
of my bowels seeketh my life;
how much more now may this Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamite
doe it?</hi> The wickednesse
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3837:11"/>
of an <hi>Absalom</hi> may rob his
father of comfort, but shall
help to adde to his fathers good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
It is the aduantage of
great crosses, that they swallow
vp the lesse; One mans sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excused by anothers, the
lesser by the greater; If <hi>Absalom</hi>
be a traytor, <hi>Shimei</hi> may not
curse and rebell: But the passion
conceiued from the indignitie
of a stranger may be abated by
the harder measure of our
owne; If we can therefore suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
because we haue suffered, we
haue profited by our affliction.
A weake heart faints with euery
addition of succeeding trouble;
the strong recollects it selfe,
and is growne so skilfull that it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3837:12"/>
beares off one mischiefe with
another.</p>
                  <p>It is not either the vnnaturall
insurrection of <hi>Absalom,</hi> nor the
vniust curses of <hi>Shimei,</hi> that can
put <hi>Dauid</hi> quite out of heart. <hi>It
may be that the Lord will looke
on mine affliction, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
good for his cursing, this
day.</hi> So well was <hi>Dauid</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the proceedings
of God, that he knew cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
was euer wont to follow
stripes; after vehement euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cordialls; after a darke
night, the cleere light of the
morning: Hope therefore doth
not only vphold, but cheere vp
his heart, in the midst of his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
If we can looke beyond
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3837:12"/>
the cloud of our affliction, and
see the Sun-shine of comfort on
the other side of it, we cannot
be so discouraged with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of euill, as hartened with
the issue; As on the contrary,
let a man be neuer so mery
within, and see paine and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
waiting for him at the doore,
his expectation of euill shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
daunt all the sense of his
pleasure; The retributions of
temporall fauours goe but by
Peraduentures, <hi>It may be the
Lord will looke on mine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
of eternall, are certaine
and infallible; If we suffer, we
shall raigne; why should not
the assurance of raigning make
vs triumph in suffering?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:3837:13"/>
                     <hi>Dauids</hi> patience drawes on
the insolence of <hi>Shimei.</hi> Euill
natures grow presumptuous
vpon forbearance: In good
dispositions, iniury vnanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
growes weary of it selfe, and
dies in a voluntary remorse; but
in those dogged stomacks,
which are only capable of the
restraints of feare, the silent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of a former wrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokes
a second; Mercy had
need to be guided with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
lest it proue cruell to it
selfe.</p>
                  <p>Oh the base mindes of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant-Time-seruers!
Stay but a
while, till the wheele be a little
turned; you shall see humble <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi>
fall downe on his face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3837:13"/>
                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his returne ouer
Iordan; now his submission
shall equall his former rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
his praiers shall requite
his curses, his teares make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for his stones, <hi>Let not
my Lord impute iniquitie vnto me;
neither doe thou remember that which
thy seruant did peruersly, the day
that my Lord the King went out of
Ierusalem, that the King should
take it to heart; for thy seruant doth
know that I haue sinned;</hi> False-hearted
<hi>Shimei,</hi> had <hi>Absalom</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered,
thou hadst not sinned,
thou hadst not repented; then
hadst thou braggd of thine
insultation ouer his miseries,
whose pardon thou now beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
with teares. The changes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3837:14"/>
of worldly mindes are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
since they are neither
wrought out of conscience, nor
loue, but only by a slauish feare
of a iust punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> could say no more to
testifie his sorrow (for his hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sinnes against God) to
<hi>Nathan,</hi> then <hi>Shimei</hi> saies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to <hi>Dauid;</hi> whereto may be
added the aduantage of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
confession in this offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which in <hi>Dauid</hi> was extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the reproofe of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
yet is <hi>Dauids</hi> confession
seriously penitent, <hi>Shimeies</hi> craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
hypocriticall; Those altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are iustly suspected, which
are shaped according to the
times, and outward occasions;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3837:14"/>
the true penitent lookes only at
God, and his sinne, and is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
when all other things are
themselues.</p>
                  <p>Great offences had need of
answerable satisfactions; As
<hi>Shimei</hi> was the only man of the
house of <hi>Beniamin</hi> that came
forth and cursed <hi>Dauid</hi> in his
flight, so is he the first man (euen
before those of the house of
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> though neerer in situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that comes to meet <hi>Dauid</hi>
in his returne with praiers and
gratulation: Notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
may not thinke to sit
downe with the taske of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
seruices; The retributions
of their obedience must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to their crimes.</p>

we are matched with a strong

                  <p>Oh the policie of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauell

and when all Israel shall heare
that thou art abhorred of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the hands of all that are with
thee shall be strong.</hi> The first
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3837:16"/>
care must be to secure the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
There can be no safetie in
siding with a doubtfull rebell;
if <hi>Absalom</hi> be a Traitor yet he is a
sonne; Nature may returne to
it selfe; <hi>Absalom</hi> may relent, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
may remit; where then are
we that haue helpt to promote
the conspiracie: the danger is
ours, whiles this breach may be
peeced; There is no way but to
ingage <hi>Absalom</hi> in some further
act, vncapable of forgiuenesse;
Besides the throne, let him vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the bed of his father; vnto
his treason let him adde an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
no lesse vnnaturall; now
shall the world see that <hi>Absalom</hi>
neither hopes, nor cares for the
reconciliation of a father;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3837:16"/>
Our quarrell can neuer haue
any safe end but victorie; the
hope whereof depends vpon
the resolution of our followers;
they cannot be resolute, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the vnpardonable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their leader; Neither
can this villanie be shamefull
enough, if it be secret. The
closenesse of euill argues feare,
or modestie; neither of which
can beseeme him that would be
a succesfull traitor; Set vp a tent
on the top of the house, and let
all Israel be witnesses of thy sin,
and thy fathers shame; Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
crimes are for vulgar offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
Let <hi>Absalom</hi> sinne emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently;
and doe that which
may make the world at once
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3837:17"/>
to blush, and wonder.</p>
                  <p>Who would euer haue
thought that <hi>Achitophel</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at the Court, at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-table
of a <hi>Dauid?</hi> Who
would thinke that mouth had
euer spoken well? Yet had he
beene no other then as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of God to the religious
Court of Israel; euen whiles he
was not wise enough to be
good: Policie and grace are
not alwaies lodged vnder one
roofe; This man whiles he was
one of <hi>Dauids</hi> deepe Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
was one of <hi>Dauids</hi> fooles
that said in their hearts, <hi>There is
no God;</hi> Else he could not haue
hoped to make good an euill
with worse, to build the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3837:17"/>
of treason vpon incest.</p>
                  <p>Prophane hearts doe so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue
the plots of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as if there were no ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
power to crosse their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
or to reuenge them: He
that sits in heauen laughs them
to scorne, and so farre giues way
to their sinnes, as their sinnes
may proue plagues vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
                  <p>These two sonnes of <hi>Dauid</hi>
met with pestilent counsell:
<hi>Amnon</hi> is aduised to incest with
his sister; <hi>Absalom</hi> is aduised to
incest with his fathers Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;
That by <hi>Ionadab,</hi> this by
<hi>Achitophel:</hi> Both preuaile: It is as
easie at least to take ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
as to giue it: Pronenesse to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3837:18"/>
villanie in the great cannot
want either proiectors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
or parasites to execute the
most odious and vnreasonable
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>The tent is spred (lest it
should not be conspicuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough)
on the top of the house,
The act is done; in the sight of
all Israel: The filthinesse of the
sinne was not so great, as the
impudencie of the manner:
When the prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> came
with that heauie message of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,
and menace to <hi>Dauid,</hi>
after his sinne with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> he
could say from God, <hi>Behold I
will raise vp euill against thee, out of
thine owne house, and will take thy
wiues before thine eies, and giue them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3837:18"/>
vnto thy neighbour, and he shall lie
with thy wiues, in the sight of this
Sunne: For thou didst it secretly, but
I will doe this thing before all Israel,
and before this Sunne.</hi> The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and the lust of
<hi>Absalom</hi> haue fulfilled the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. Oh the wisdome
of the Almightie, that can vse
the worst of euils, well; and
most iustly make the sinnes of
men his executioners!</p>
                  <p>It was the sinne of <hi>Reuben</hi>
that he defiled his fathers bed;
yet not in the same height of
lewdnesse: what <hi>Reuben</hi> did in
a youthfull wantonnesse, <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
did in a malicious despight;
<hi>Reuben</hi> sinned with one; <hi>Absalom</hi>
with ten; <hi>Reuben</hi> secretly, <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:3837:19"/>
in the open eies of heauen
and earth; yet old <hi>Iacob</hi> could
say of <hi>Reuben, Thou shalt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
thy dignitie is gone;</hi> Whiles
<hi>Achitophel</hi> saies to <hi>Absalom, Thy
dignitie shall arise from incest;
Climbe vp to thy fathers bed, if thou
wilt sit in his throne;</hi> If <hi>Achitophel</hi>
were a politician, <hi>Iacob</hi> was a
Prophet; if the one spake from
carnall sense, the other from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
reuelation. Certainly, to
sinne is not the way to prosper;
what euer vaine fooles may
promise to themselues, there is
no wisdome, nor vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
nor counsell against the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>After the rebellion is secured
for continuance, the next care is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3837:19"/>
that it may end in victorie; this
also hath the working head of
<hi>Achitophel</hi> proiected. Wit and
experience told him that in
these cases of assault, celeritie
vses to bring forth the happiest
dispatch: whereas protraction
is no small aduantage to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.
<hi>Let me</hi> (saith he) <hi>choose
out now twelue thousand men, and I
will vp, and follow after Dauid this
night; and I will come vpon him
while he is wearie, and weak-handed.</hi>
No aduice could be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious:
For, besides the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and vnreadinesse of <hi>Dauid</hi>
and his armie, the spirits of that
worthy leader were daunted,
and deiected with sorrow, and
offered way to the violence of a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3837:20"/>
sudden assault. The field had
beene halfe won ere any blow
striken. <hi>Achitophel</hi> could not
haue beene reputed so wise, if He
had not learned the due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
betwixt actions and
times: He that obserueth euery
winde shall neuer sowe; but he
that obserues no Winde at all,
shall neuer reape.</p>
                  <p>The likeliest deuices doe not
alwaies succeed; The God that
had appointed to establish <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
throne, and determined <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
to his succession, findes
meanes to crosse the plot of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel,</hi>
by a lesse-probable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
<hi>Hushai</hi> was not sent backe
for nothing: where God hath
in his secret will decreed any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3837:20"/>
euent, he inclines the wills of
men to approue that which
may promote his owne purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
Neither had <hi>Hushai</hi> so deepe
an head; neither was his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
so sure, as that of <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
yet his tongue shal refell <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi>
and diuert <hi>Absalom:</hi> The
pretences were fairer; though
the grounds were vnsound;
First, to sweeten his opposition,
he yeelds the praise of wisdome
to his aduersarie in all other
counsells, that he may haue
leaue to denie it in this; His ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
contradiction in the present
insinuates a generall allowance.
Then, he suggests certaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
truths concerning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
valour, and skill, to giue
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3837:21"/>
countenance to the inferences
of his improbabilities; Lastly,
he cunningly feeds the proud
humour of <hi>Absalom,</hi> in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the power and extent of
his commands, and ends in the
glorious boasts of his fore-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
victorie; As it is with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so with counsell, that is faire
that pleaseth. He that giues the
vttrance to words, giues also
their speed: Fauour both of
speech and men is not euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to desert, but according
to fore-ordination: The tongue
of <hi>Hushai,</hi> and the heart of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi>
is guided by a power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
their owne; <hi>Hushai</hi> shall
therefore preuaile with <hi>Absalom,</hi>
that the treason of <hi>Absalom</hi> may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3837:21"/>
not preuaile; He that worketh
all in all things, so disposeth of
wicked men and spirits, that
whiles they doe most oppose
his reuealed will, they execute
his secret, and whiles they think
most to please, they ouerthrow
themselues.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Absalom</hi> first met <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shai</hi>
returned to Hierusalem, he
vpbraided him pleasantly with
the scoffe of his professed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to <hi>Dauid; Is this thy kindnesse
to thy friend?</hi> Sometimes there
is more truth in the mouth then
in the heart, more in iest then in
earnest; <hi>Hushai</hi> was a friend,
his stay was his kindnesse; and
now he hath done that for
which he was left at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3837:22"/>
disappointed <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
preserued <hi>Dauid;</hi> Neither did his
kindnesse to his friend rest here,
but (as one that was iustly iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of him, with whom he
was allowed to temporize) he
mistrusts the approbation of
<hi>Absalom;</hi> and not daring to put
the life of his master vpon such
an hazard, he giues charge to
<hi>Zadok,</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
vnto <hi>Dauid:</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be too suspicious when we
haue to doe with those that are
faithlesse: We cannot be too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of the safetie of good
Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hushai</hi> feares not to descry
the secrets of <hi>Absaloms</hi> counsell;
To betray a traitor is no other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3837:22"/>
then a commendable worke;
<hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> are fast
within the gates of Hierusalem;
their sonnes lay purposely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the fields; this message
that concerned no lesse then the
life of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Israel, must be trusted
with a maid: Sometimes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the wisdome of God, who
hath the varietie of heauen and
earth before him, to single out
weake instruments for great
seruices; and they shall serue his
turne, as well as the best; No
counsailour of state could haue
made this dispatch more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually;
<hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Ahimaaz</hi>
are sent, descried, pursued, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued;
The fidelitie of a maid
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3837:23"/>
instructed them in their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
the suttletie of a woman
saued their liues. At the well of
Rogel they receiued their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
in the Well of Bahurim
was their life saued; The sudden
wit of a woman hath choked
the mouth of her Well with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
corne, that it might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
the messengers; and now
<hi>Dauid</hi> heares safely of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and preuents it; and though
weary with trauell, and laden
with sorrow, he must spend the
night in his remoue. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of his deliuerance, and the
confirmation of his kingdome
may not make him neglect the

<hi>Achitophel</hi> will needs hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

yet set his house in order; there
is an act of wisdome; And
could it be possible, that he who
was so wise as to set his house
in order, should be so mad as to
hang himselfe? That he should
be carefull to order his house,
who regarded not to order his
impotent passions? That he
should care for his house, who
cared not for either body or

to be wise, if he be not wise in

for a righteous Soueraigne, and

a wicked sonne? The God of
hosts, with whom it is all one
to saue with many or with few,
takes part with iustice, and lets
Israel feele, what it is to beare
armes for a traiterous vsurper.
The sword deuoures twentie
thousand of them, and the
wood deuoures more then the
sword, It must needs be a very
vniuersall rebellion, wherein so
many perished; What vertue or
merits can assure the hearts of
the vulgar, when so gracious a
Prince findes so many reuolters?
Let no man looke to prosper by
rebellion; the very thickets, and
stakes, and pits, and wild beasts
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3837:32"/>
of the wood shall conspire to
the punishment of traitors; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest, see how a fatall
oke hath singled out the ring-leader
of this hatefull insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and will at once serue for his

of those spreading armes snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him away to speedy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Absalom</hi> was comely, and
he knew it well enough; His
haire was no small peece of his
beautie, nor matter of his pride:
It was his wont to cut it once a
yeere; not for that it was too
long, but too heauie; his heart
could haue borne it longer, if
his necke had not complained;
And now, the iustice of God
hath platted an halter of those
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3837:32"/>
lockes; Those tresses, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
hangd loosely disheueld
on his shoulders, now he hangs
by them; He had wont to
weigh his haire, and was proud
to finde it so heauie; now his
haire poyseth the weight of his
bodie, and makes his burden his
torment: It is no maruell if his
owne haire turnd traitor to
him, who durst rise vp against
his father. That part which is
misused by man to sinne, is
commonly imployed by God
to reuenge; The reuenge that it
worketh for God, makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the offence, whereto
it is drawne against God; The
very beast wheron <hi>Absalom</hi> sat, as
wearie to beare so vnnaturall a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3837:33"/>
burden, resignes ouer his lode
to the tree of Iustice; There
hangs <hi>Absalom</hi> betweene heauen
and earth, as one that was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and abandoned both of
earth, and heauen: As if God
meant to prescribe this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for traitors, <hi>Absalom, Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi>
and <hi>Iudas</hi> die all one
death: So let them perish that
dare lift vp their hand against
Gods anointed.</p>
                  <p>The honest souldier sees <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi>
hanging in the Oke, and
dares not touch him; his hands
were held with the charge of
<hi>Dauid, Beware that none touch the
young man Absalom; Ioab,</hi> vpon
that intelligence, sees him, and
smites him, with no lesse then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3837:33"/>
three darts; What the souldier
forbore in obedience, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
doth in zeale: not fearing
to preferre his Soueraignes safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to his command; and more
tendering the life of a King, and
peace of his Countrie, then the
weake affection of a father; I
dare not sit Iudge betwixt this
zeale and that obedience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the captaine and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;
the one was a good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
the other a good Patriot:
the one loued the King, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loued <hi>Dauid;</hi> and out of
loue disobeyed; the one meant
as well, as the other sped: As if
God meant to fulfill the charge
of his Anointed, without any
blame of his subiects, it pleased
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3837:34"/>
him to execute that immediate
reuenge vpon the rebell, which
would haue dispatcht him
without hand, or dart: only the
Mule and the Oke conspired to
this execution; but that death
would haue required more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
then it was safe for Israel to
giue; and still life would giue
hope of rescue; to cut off all
feares, <hi>Ioab</hi> lends the Oke three
darts to helpe forward so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a worke of iustice: All Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
did not afford so firme a
friend to <hi>Absalom,</hi> as <hi>Ioab</hi> had
beene; who but <hi>Ioab</hi> had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
the wittie widow of
<hi>Tekoah,</hi> to sue for the recalling of
<hi>Absalom,</hi> from his three yeeres
exile? Who but he went to fetch
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3837:34"/>
him from <hi>Geshur</hi> to Ierusalem?
Who but he fetcht him from his
house at Ierusalem (whereto he
had beene two yeeres confined)
to the face, to the lips of <hi>Dauid?</hi>
Yet now he that was his solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
for the Kings fauour, is his
executioner against the Kings
charge: With honest hearts all
respects either of bloud or
friendship cease in the case of
treason; well hath <hi>Ioab</hi> forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
himselfe to be friend to him
who had forgotten himselfe to
be a sonne. Euen ciuilly, the
King is our common father;
our countrie our common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nature hath no priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which should not glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giue place to these; He is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3837:35"/>
father, nor sonne, nor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor friend that conspires
against the common parent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Well doth he who spake para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
for his masters sonne, now
speake darts to his Kings ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
and pierces that heart
which was false to so good a
father: Those darts are secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Ioabs</hi> followers; each
man tries his weapon vpon so
faire a marke. One death is not
enough for <hi>Absalom;</hi> he is at
once hanged, shot, mangled,
stoned: Iustly was he lift vp to
the Oke, who had lift vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
against his father, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne;
Iustly is he pierced
with darts, who had pierced his
fathers heart with so many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3837:35"/>
Iustly is he mangled,
who had dismembred and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
all Israel; Iustly is he sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
who had not only cursed,
but pursued his owne parent.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Ioab</hi> sounds the retrait;
and calls off his eager troupes
from execution; howeuer he
knew what his rebellious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen
had deserued in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Absalom;</hi> Wise comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
know how to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the heads of a
faction, and the misguided mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
and can pittie the one,
whiles they take reuenge on the
other.</p>
                  <p>So did <hi>Absalom</hi> esteeme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that he thought it would
be a wrong to the world, to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3837:36"/>
want the memoriall of so good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a person. God had denied
him sonnes; How iust it was
that hee should want a sonne,
who had robd his father of a
sonne, who would haue robd
himselfe of a father, his father of
a Kingdome? It had beene
pitty so poysonous a plant
should haue beene fruitfull; His
pride shall supply nature, hee
reares vp a stately piller in the
Kings dale, and cals it by his
owne name, that he might liue
in dead stones, who could not
suruiue in liuing issue; and now,
behold this curious pile ends in
a rude heape, which speakes no
language, but the shame of that
carcasse which it couers: Heare
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3837:36"/>
this yee glorious fooles, that
care not to perpetuate any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of your selues to the
world, but of il-deseruing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
the best of this affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is vanity; the worst, infamy
and dishonour; whereas the
memoriall of the iust shall be
blessed; and if his humility shall
refuse an Epitaph, and chose to
hide himselfe vnder the bare
earth, God himselfe shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue
his name vpon the pillar
of eternity.</p>
                  <p>There now lies <hi>Absalom</hi> in the
pit, vnder a thousand graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
in euery of which is
written his euerlasting reproch;
well might this heape ouer-liue
that pillar; for when that ceased
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3837:37"/>
to be a piller, it began to be an
heape; neither will it cease to be
a monument of <hi>Absaloms</hi> shame,
whiles there are stones to bee
found vpon earth; Euen at this
day very Pagans and Pilgrims
that passe that way, cast each
man a stone vnto that heape,
and are wont to say in a solemne
execration; <hi>Cursed be the paricide
Absalom, and cursed be all vniust
persecutors of their parents, for euer;</hi>
Fasten your eies vpon this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
spectacle, ô all ye rebellious
and vngratious children, which
rise vp against the loynes and
thighes from which ye fell: and
know that it is the least part of
your punishment, that your
carcasses rot in the earth, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3837:37"/>
your name in ignominie; these
doe but shadow out those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sufferings, of your soules,
for your foule and vnnaturall
disobedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Absalom</hi> is sped; who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it to his father? Surely <hi>Ioab</hi>
was not so much afraid of the
fact, as of the message; There
are busie spirits that loue to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
newes, though thanklesse,
though purposelesse; such was
<hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Zadock;</hi>
who importunately thrusts
himselfe into this seruice; wise
<hi>Ioab,</hi> who well saw, how vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
tydings must be the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the first post, disswades
him in vaine; hee knew <hi>Dauid</hi>
too well to imploy a friend in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3837:38"/>
that errand. An Ethiopian ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
was a fitter bearer of such
a message, then the sonne of the
Priest. The entertainment of
the person doth so follow the
quality of the newes, that <hi>Dauid</hi>
could argue afar off, <hi>He is a good
man, he commeth with good tidings.</hi>
Oh how welcome deserue those
messengers to be that bring vs
the glad tidings of saluation;
that assure vs of the foile of all
spirituall enemies, and tell vs of
nothing but victories, and
Crownes, and Kingdomes; If
we thinke not their feet beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
our hearts are foule with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,

                  <p>As our care is wont to bee

Absalom:</hi> Like a wise, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

an honest insinuation, <hi>The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of my Lord the King, and all
that rise against thee to doe thee hurt,
be as that young man is;</hi> implying
both what was done, and, why
<hi>Dauid</hi> should approue it being
done; How is the good King
thunder-strooke with that word
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3837:39"/>
of his Black-moore? who, as if
he were at once bereaued of all
comfort, and cared not to liue,
but in the name of <hi>Absalom,</hi> goes
and weepes, and cries out, <hi>O my
sonne Absalom, my sonne, my sonne
Absalom; Would God I had died for
thee, O Absalom, my sonne, my sonne.</hi>
What is this we heare? that he
whose life Israel valued at ten
thousand of theirs, should be
exchanged with a traytors? that
a good King, whose life was
sought, should wish to lay
it downe for the preseruation
of his murtherer? The best men

Oh loue, like thy selfe, infinite,

through this chastisement it is
not hard to discerne a Type, of
that perpetuall succession of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,

O Sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> when didst
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3837:41"/>
thou euer want enemies? How
wert thou designed by thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

did the Gentiles rage, and the

The Kings of the earth assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

the subiects of thine owne
kingdome daily conspire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee? Euen now whiles

at thy Fathers right hand, as
soone shalt thou want friends,
as enemies vpon earth.</p>
                  <p>No eye of any traitor could

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3837:41"/>
and whiles Israel and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah

not to say, <hi>We haue no part in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
neither haue we inheritance in

saies, <hi>Euery man to his tents O Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
he calls euery man to his

libertie from a iust and loyall
subiection, he inuites Israel to
the bondage of an vsurper.</p>
                  <p>That a lewd conspirator
should breath treason, it is no
wonder; but is it not wonder
and shame, that vpon euery
mutinous blast Israel should
turne traitor to Gods anointed?
It was their late expostulation
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3837:42"/>
with <hi>Dauid,</hi> why their brethren
the men of Iudah should haue
stollen him from them; now
might <hi>Dauid</hi> more iustly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate,
why a rebell of their
brethren should haue stolne
them from him: As nothing is
more vnstable then the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
so nothing is more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to distastes, then Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
for as weake mindes seeke
pleasure in change; so euery
light conceit of irritation seems
sufficient colour of change;
Such as the false dispositions of

without the awfulnesse of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
What hold can there be of

fight against him, vnder the son

of <hi>Absalom,</hi> are apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
euery <hi>Sheba;</hi> It is vnsafe for
any State, that the multitude

He that could command all

hearts, will euer be followed by
some; God had rather glorifie
himselfe by a remnant.</p>
                  <p>Great commanders must haue
actiue thoughts; <hi>Dauid</hi> is not
so taken vp with the embroiled
affaires of his state, as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
domesticke iustice; His
ten concubines, which were
shamelesly defiled by his ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous

to ward, and widow-hood;
Had not that constupration
beene partly violent, their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
had not beene so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
had it not also beene partly

of either force, or will,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3837:43"/>
iustly are they sequestred from
<hi>Dauids</hi> bed; <hi>Absalom</hi> was not
more vnnaturall in his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then in his lust; If now
<hi>Dauid</hi> should haue returned to
his owne bed, he had seconded
the incest: How much more
worthy of separation are they,
who haue stained the mariage

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amasa</hi> was one of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and abettors of <hi>Absaloms</hi>
filthinesse, yet is he (out of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie)
receiued to fauour and
imployment, whiles the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines
suffer; Great men yeeld
many times to those things,
out of reasons of state, which if
they were priuate persons could
not be easily put ouer; It is no
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3837:44"/>
small wisdome to ingage a new
reconciled friend, that he may
be confirmed by his owne act:
Therefore is <hi>Amasa</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to leuie the forces of Iudah:
<hi>Ioab</hi> after many great merits and
atchieuements lies rusting in
neglect: he that was so intire
with <hi>Dauid</hi> as to be of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
for <hi>Vriahs</hi> bloud; and so
firme to <hi>Dauid,</hi> as to lead all his
battels against the house of <hi>Saul,</hi>
the Ammonites, the Aramites,
<hi>Absalom</hi> is now cashiered, and
must yeeld his place to a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
late an enemie: Who
knowes not that this sonne of
<hi>Zeruiah</hi> had shed the bloud of
warre in peace? But if the bloud
of <hi>Absalom</hi> had not beene louder
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3837:44"/>
then the bloud of <hi>Abner,</hi> I feare
this change had not been; Now
<hi>Ioab</hi> smarteth for a loyall disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
How slippery are the
stations of earthly honours, and
subiect to continuall mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Happy are they who are in
fauour with him, in whom
there is no shadow of change.</p>
                  <p>Where men are commonly
most ambitious to please with
their first imployments, <hi>Amaza</hi>
slackens his pace; The least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
in matters of rebellion is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous,
may be irrecouerable;
The sonnes of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> are not
sullen; <hi>Abishai</hi> is sent, <hi>Ioab</hi> goes
vnsent to the pursuit of <hi>Sheba.
Amasa</hi> was in their way; whom
no quarrell but their enuy had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3837:45"/>
made of a brother an enemy;
Had the heart of <hi>Amasa</hi> beene
priuy to any cause of grudge,
hee had suspected the kisse of
<hi>Ioab;</hi> now his innocent eyes
looke to the lips, not to the hand
of his secret enemy; The lips
were smooth, <hi>Art thou in health,
my brother;</hi> the hand was blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which smote him vnder the
fift ribbe; That vnhappie hand
knew wel this way vnto death;
which with one wound hath
let out the Soules of two great
Captaines, <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa;</hi>
Both they were smitten by <hi>Ioab,</hi>
both vnder the fift ribbe, both
vnder a pretence of friendship.
There is no enmity so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as that which comes mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3837:45"/>
with loue; Open hostility
cals vs to our guard; but there
is no fence against a trusted tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie:
wee neede not be bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to auoid an enemy, but
who would runne away from
a friend? Thus spiritually deales
the world with our soules; it
kisses vs, and stabs vs at once;
If it did not embrace vs with
one hand, it could not murther
vs with the other; Onely God
deliuer vs from the danger of
our trust, and we shall be safe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioab</hi> is gone, and leaues <hi>Amasa</hi>
wallowing in bloud; That spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
cannot but stay all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers;
The death of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
drawes euer many eyes;
Each man sayes, <hi>Is not this my
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3837:46"/>
Lord Amasa?</hi> Wherefore doe we
goe to fight, whiles our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
lyes in the dust? What a
sad presage is this of our owne
miscarriage? The wit of <hi>Ioabs</hi>
followers hath therefore soone
both remoued <hi>Amasa</hi> out of the
way, and couered him; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
so much the losse, as
the eye-sore of Israel. Thus
wicked Politicks care not so
much for the commission of
villany, as for the notice; Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
euils are as not done; If
oppressions, if murders, if trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may be hid from view, the
obdured heart of the offender
complaines not of remorse.</p>
                  <p>Bloudy <hi>Ioab,</hi> with what face,
with what heart canst thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3837:46"/>
a traitor to thy King, whiles
thy selfe art so foule a traytor to
thy friend, to thy cozen-ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and (in so vnseasonable a
slaughter) to thy Soueraigne,
whose cause thou professest to
reuenge? If <hi>Amasa</hi> were now in
an act of loyalty, iustly (on
Gods part) payd for the arera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his late rebellion, yet that
it should be done by thy hand,
then, and thus, it was flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
cruell; Yet, behold <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi>
runnes away securely with
the fact, hasting to plague that
in another, whereof himselfe
was no lesse guilty; So vast are
the gorges of some consciences,
that they can swallow the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
crimes, and finde no straine
in the passage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:3837:47"/>
It is possible for a man to be
faithful to some one person, and
perfidious to all others; I doe
not finde <hi>Ioab</hi> other then firme
and loyall to <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of all his priuate falshoods;
whose iust quarrell he pursues
against <hi>Sheba,</hi> through all the
Tribes of Israel. None of all the
strong Forts of reuolted Israel
can hide the Rebell from the
zeale of his reuenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Citie
of Abel lends harbour to that
conspirator, whom all Israel
would, and cannot protect;
<hi>Ioab</hi> casts vp a Mount against
it, and hauing inuironed it with
a siege, begins to worke vpon
the wall; and now, after long
chase, is in hand to digge out
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3837:47"/>
that Vermin, which had earth'd
himself in this borough of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maachah.
Had not the Citie
been strong and populous, <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
had not cast himselfe for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
within those wals; yet of all
the inhabitants, I see not any one
man moue for the preseruation
of their whole body: Onely a
woman vndertakes to treat with
<hi>Ioab,</hi> for their safety: Those men
whose spirits were great enough
to maintaine a traytor against a
mighty King, scorne not to
giue way to the wisdome of a
matrone; There is no reason
that Sex should disparage, where
the vertue and merit is no lesse
then masculine: Surely the soule
acknowledgeth no Sexe, neither
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3837:48"/>
is varied according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame; How oft haue wee
knowne female hearts in the
brests of Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contrarily
manly powers in the weaker
vessels? It is iniurious to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the act by the person, and
not rather to esteeme the person
for the act.</p>
                  <p>Shee, with no lesse prudence
then courage challengeth <hi>Ioab</hi>
for the violence of his assault;
and laies to him that law which
he could not be an Israelite, and
disauow; the Law of the God
of peace; whose charge it was,
that when they should come
neere to a Citie to fight against
it, they should offer it peace;
and if this tender must be made
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3837:48"/>
to forrainers, how much more
to brethren? So as they must
inquire of Abel, ere they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
it; Warre is the extreme
act of vindicatiue iustice; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth God euer approue it
for any other then a desperate
remedy; and if it haue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end then peace, it turnes
into publique murder. It is
therefore an inhumane crueltie
to shed bloud, where wee haue
not profered faire conditions of
peace: the refusall whereof is
iustly punished with the Sword
of reuenge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioab</hi> was a man of bloud, yet
when the wise woman of <hi>Abel</hi>
charged him with going about
to destroy a mother in Israel;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3837:49"/>
and swallowing vp the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Lord, with what
vehemencie doth he deprecate
that challenge, <hi>God forbid, God
forbid it me, that I should deuoure, or
destroy it;</hi> Although that citie
with the rest had ingaged it
selfe in <hi>Shebaes</hi> sedition, yet how
zealously doth <hi>Ioab</hi> remoue
from himselfe the suspicion of
an intended vastation? How
fearfull shall their answer be,
who vpon the quarrell of their
owne ambition haue not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to waste whole tribes of the
Israel of God? It was not the
fashion of <hi>Dauids</hi> Captaines to
assault any citie ere they sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
it; here they did; There
be some things that in the very
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3837:49"/>
fact carrie their owne conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
So did <hi>Abel</hi> in the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and abetting a knowne
conspirator; <hi>Ioab</hi> challenges
them for the offence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no other satisfaction
then the head of <hi>Sheba;</hi> This
Matrone had not deserued the
name of Wife, and faithfull in
Israel, if she had not both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the iustice of the
condition, and commended it
to her Citizens; whom she hath
easily perswaded to spare their
owne heads, in not sparing a
Traitors; It had beene pittie
those walls should haue stood if
they had beene too hie to throw
a Traitors head ouer.</p>
                  <p>Spiritually, the case is ours:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3837:50"/>
Euery mans brest is as a citie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed;
Euery sinne is a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
that lurkes within those
walls; God calls to vs for <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baes</hi>
head; neither hath he any
quarrell to our person, but for
our sinne: If we loue the head
of our Traitor, aboue the life of
our soule, we shall iustly perish
in the vengeance: we cannot
be more willing to part with
our sin, then our mercifull God
is to withdraw his iudgements.</p>
                  <p>Now is <hi>Ioab</hi> returned with
successe, and hopes by <hi>Shebaes</hi>
head to paie the price of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saes</hi>
bloud; <hi>Dauid</hi> hates the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

so great, so necessarie, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3837:50"/>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> may neither misse, nor
punish him: Policie led the
King to conniue at that which
his heart abhorred; I dare not
commend that wisdome which
holds the hands of Princes
from doing iustice; Great men
haue euer held it a point of
worldly state, not alwaies to
pay where they haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to a debt of either fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
or punishment; but to
make Time their seruant for
both; <hi>Salomon</hi> shall once defraie
the arerages of his father; In the

the sinne. Neuer man smarted
causelesly from the hand of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
iustice; Oh that when we
suffer, we could aske what we
haue done; and could guide
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3837:52"/>
our repentance to the root of
our euils.</p>
                  <p>That God whose counsells
are secret, euen where his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are open, will not be close
to his Prophet, to his Priest:
without inquirie we shall know
nothing; vpon inquirie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shall be concealed from
vs, that is fit for vs to know.</p>
                  <p>Who can choose but wonder
at once both at <hi>Dauids</hi> slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in consulting with God,
and Gods speed in answering so
slow a demand? He that so well
knew the way to Gods Oracle,
suffers Israel to be three yeeres
pinched with famine, ere he
askes why they suffer; Euen the
best hearts may be ouertaken
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3837:53"/>
with dulnesse in holy duties;
But oh the maruellous mercy of
our God, that takes not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of our weaknesses; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
question is not more slow,
then his answer is speedie, <hi>It is
for Saul, and for his bloudie house,
because he slew the Gibeonites.</hi> Israel
was full of sinnes, besides those
of <hi>Sauls</hi> house; <hi>Sauls</hi> house was
full of sinnes besides those of
bloud; Much bloud was shed
by them besides that of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites;
yet the iustice of God
singles out this one sinne of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
offered to the Gibeonites
(contrary to the league made
by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> some foure hundred
yeeres before) for the occasion
of this late vengeance. Where
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3837:53"/>
the causes of offence are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
it is iust with God to pitch
vpon some; it is mercifull not
to punish for all: Welneere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeeres are past betwixt the
commission of the sinne, and
the reckoning for it. It is a
vaine hope that is raised from
the delay of iudgement; No
time can be any preiudice to the
ancient of daies; When we
haue forgotten our sinnes, when
the world hath forgotten vs, he
sues vs afresh for our arerages.
The slaughter of the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
was the sinne not of the
present, but rather the former
generation; and now posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
paies for their forefathers;
Euen we men hold it not vniust
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3837:54"/>
to sue the heires and executors
of our debters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eternall pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
God vses only to require
of the person, temporarie oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of succession.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Saul</hi> was higher by the
head and shoulders then the rest
of Israel, both in stature and
dignitie, so were his sinnes
more conspicuous then those
of the vulgar. The eminence of
the person makes the offence
more remarkable to the eies
both of God and men.</p>
                  <p>Neither <hi>Saul</hi> nor Israel were
faultlesse in other kindes; yet
God fixes the eie of his reuenge
vpon the massacre of the Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites,
Euery sin hath a tongue,
but that of bloud ouer cries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:3837:54"/>
and drownes the rest. He who
is mercy it selfe abhorres cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in his creature aboue all other
inordinatenesse; That holy
soule which was heauie pressed
with the weight of an hainous
adulterie, yet cries out, <hi>Deliuer
me from bloud, O God, the God of my
saluation, and my tongue shall sing
ioyfully of thy righteousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If God would take account
of bloud, he might haue entred
the action vpon the bloud of
<hi>Vriah</hi> spilt by <hi>Dauid;</hi> or (if he
would rather insist in <hi>Sauls</hi>
house) vpon the bloud of <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi>
the Priest; and fourescore
and fiue persons that did weare
a linnen Ephod; but it pleased
the wisdome and iustice of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3837:55"/>
Almightie rather to call for the
bloud of the Gibeonites,
though drudges of Israel, and a
remnant of Amorites; Why
this? There was a periurie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
vpon this slaughter; It
was an ancient oath, wherein
the Princes of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had bound themselues (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Iosua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> league) to the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
that they would suffer
them to liue; an oath extorted
by fraud, but solemne, by no
lesse name, then the Lord God
of Israel; <hi>Saul</hi> will now thus
late either not acknowledge it;
or not keepe it; out of his zeale
therefore to the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and Iudah, he roots out
some of the Gibeonites, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3837:55"/>
in a zeale of reuenge of
their first imposture, or in a
zeale of inlarging the possessions
of Israel, or in a zeale of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Gods charge vpon the
brood of Canaanites, he that
spared <hi>Agag</hi> whom he should
haue smitten, smites the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
whom he should haue spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Zeale and good intention
is no excuse, much lesse a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for euill; God holds it an
hie indignitie that his name
should be sworne by, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
Length of time cannot
dispense with our oathes, with
our vowes; The vowes and
oathes of others may binde vs,
how much more our owne?</p>
                  <p>There was a famine in Israel;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3837:56"/>
a naturall man would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it vnto the drought; and
that drought perhaps to some
constellations; <hi>Dauid</hi> knowes
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> looke higher; and sees a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
hand scourging Israel for
some great offence; and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
those second causes to his
most iust executions. Euen the
most quick-sighted worldling
is pore-blinde to spirituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects;
and the weakest eyes of
the regenerate pierce the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
and espy God in all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occurrences.</p>
                  <p>So well was <hi>Dauid</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Gods proceedings, that
hee knew the remouall of the
iudgement must begin at the
satisfaction of the wronged;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3837:56"/>
At once therefore doth he pray
vnto God, and treat with the
Gibeonites; <hi>What shall I doe for
you, and wherewith shall I make the
attonement, that I may blesse the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the Lord?</hi> In vaine
should <hi>Dauid</hi> (though a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)
blesse Israel, if the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
did not blesse them: Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
done vs on earth giue vs
power in heauen; The oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
is in no mans mercy but his
whom he hath trampled vpon.</p>
                  <p>Little did the Gibeonites
thinke that God had so taken to
heart their wrongs, that for
their sakes all Israel should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
Euen when we thinke not
of it, is the righteous Iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging
our vnrighteous vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3837:57"/>
Our hard measures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hid from him, his returns
are hid from vs; It is sufficient
for vs, that God can be no more
neglectiue then ignorant of our
sufferings. It is now in the
power of these despised Hiuites
to make their own termes with
Israel; Neither Siluer, nor Gold
will sauour with them towards
their satisfaction; Nothing can
expiate the bloud of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but the bloud of seauen
sonnes of their deceased perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor;
Here was no other then
a iust retaliation; <hi>Saul</hi> had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in them the offence of
their predecessours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will
now reuenge <hi>Sauls</hi> sinne in his
children. The measure we mete 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3837:57"/>
vnto others, is with much equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
re-measured vnto our selues.
Euery death would not content
them, of <hi>Sauls</hi> sonnes, but a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and ignominious, hanging
on the Tree; Neither would that
death content them, vnlesse
their owne hands might be the
executioners; Neither would
any place serue for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but Gibeah, the Court of
<hi>Saul;</hi> neither would they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of this for the wreaking of
their owne fury, but for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
of Gods wrath, <hi>We will
hang them vp vnto the Lord in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah
of Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> might not refuse the

out seuen of the sonnes, and
grand-children of <hi>Saul;</hi> That
House had raysed long an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust

                  <p>The fiue sonnes of <hi>Adriel</hi> the

borne to him by <hi>Merab, Sauls</hi>

of marriage to <hi>Dauid,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
giuen away by <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driel;
Michol</hi> seemes to abet the

now in one act (not of <hi>Dauids</hi>

auenged vpon <hi>Saul, Adriel, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab,
Michol,</hi> the children: It is a
dangerous matter to offer iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to any of Gods faithful ones;
If their meeknesse haue easily
remitted it, their God will not
passe it ouer without a seuere
retribution.</p>
                  <p>These fiue, together with
two sonnes of <hi>Rizpah, Sauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
are hanged vp at once
before the Lord; yea and before

execution; The acts of iustice
as they are intended for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

and most terrifying; Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
courses of priuate
reuenge seeke to hide their
heads in secresie; The beautifull
face of iustice both affects the

                  <p>It was the generall charge of
Gods Law that no corps should
remaine all night vpon the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet;
The Almighty hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to dispense with his owne
command; so doubtlesse hee
did in this extraordinary case;
these carcasses did not defile,
but expiate. Sorrowfull <hi>Riz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:3837:59"/>
spreads her a Tent of Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
vpon the rocke, for a sad
attendance vpon those sons of
her wombe; Death might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
her of them, not them of
her loue; This spectacle was not
more grieuous to her, then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, and happy to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
Now the clouds drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the earth runs forth
into plenty. The Gibeonites
are satisfied, God reconciled,
Israel relieued.</p>
                  <p>How blessed a thing it is for
any Nation that iustice is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
executed euen vpon
the mighty. A few drops of
bloud haue procured large

carcasses are a rich compost to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3837:60"/>
the earth; The drought and
dearth remoue away with the

                  <p>The spirit of God else-where
ascribes this motion to Satan,
which here it attributes to God;
Both had their hand in the
worke; God by permission, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan

as in a iust punishment for sin,
Satan as in an act of sinne; God
in a wise ordination of it to

God moued, and Satan moued;
Neither is it any excuse to Satan

grounded a iudgement, yet as
before he had punisht them
with dearth for <hi>Sauls</hi> sinne, so
now he will not punish them
with plague, but for <hi>Dauids</hi> sin;
If God were not angrie with a

not for subiects to dispute but
to obey; That which authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

them with their seuerall Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
raises the summe of Israel
to the rate of eleuen hundred

puffe vp a carnall heart; but
how can an heart that is more

                  <p>Heere needed no <hi>Nathan</hi> by

him in the morning, <hi>Thus
saith the Lord, I offer thee three
things, choose thee which of them I
shall doe vnto thee.</hi> But what shall
we say to this? When vpon the
Prophets reproofe for an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
cloked with murder, <hi>Dauid</hi>
did but say, <hi>I haue sinned,</hi> it was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3837:66"/>
presently returned, <hi>God hath put
away thy sinne;</hi> neither did any
smart follow, but the death of
a mis-begotten infant; and now
when he voluntarily reproued
himselfe for but a needlesse mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and sought for pardon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
with great humiliation,
God sends him three terrible
scourges, famine, sword, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence;
that he may choose
with which of them he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bleed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he shall haue the
fauour of an election, not of a
remission. God is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
with a spirituall, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
affront offred to his
Maiestie, in our pride, and
false confidence in earthly
things, then with a fleshly crime
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3837:67"/>
though hainously seconded.</p>
                  <p>It was an hard and wofull
choice; of three yeeres famine
added to the three fore-past; or
of three moneths flight from
the sword of an enemie, or three
daies pestilence; The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that had fore determined his
iudgement, referres it to <hi>Dauids</hi>
will as fully, as if it were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vndetermined, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued,
yet <hi>Dauid</hi> may choose;
That infinite wisdome hath
foreseene the very will of his
creature; which whiles it freely
inclines it selfe to what it had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vnwittingly wills that
which was fore-appointed in
heauen.</p>
                  <p>We doe well beleeue thee, ô
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3837:67"/>
                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> that thou wert in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
straite; this very libertie
is no other then fetters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou
needst not haue famine, thou
needst not haue the sword,
thou needst not haue pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
one of them thou must
haue; There is miserie in all,
there is miserie in any; thou and
thy people can die but once;
and once they must die, either
by famine, warre, or pestilence.
Oh God, how vainely doe we
hope to passe ouer our sinnes
with impunitie, when all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
that <hi>Dauid</hi> and Israel can
receiue is to choose their bane?</p>
                  <p>Yet behold, neither sinnes,
nor threats, nor feares can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
a true penitent of his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3837:68"/>
faith, <hi>Let vs fall now into the
hands of the Lord, for his mercies are
great.</hi> There can be no euill of
punishment wherein God hath
not an hand; there could be no
famine, no sword without him;
but some euils are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
from a diuine stroke; such
was that plague into which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
is vnwillingly willing to fal,
He had his choyce of dayes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
yeares in the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and though the shortnesse
of time prefixed to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
pestilence might seeme to
offer some aduantage for the
leading of his election, yet
God meant (and <hi>Dauid</hi> knew
it) herein to proportion the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of time to the violence
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3837:68"/>
of the plague; neither should
any fewer perish by so few daies
pestilence, then by so many
yeares famine: The wealthiest
might auoyd the dearth, the
swiftest might run away from
the Sword; no man could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himselfe safetie from that
pestilence: In likelihood Gods
Angell would rather strike the
most guiltie; How euer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Dauid</hi> might well looke to
be in wrapped in the common
destruction, yet he rather choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to fal into that mercy which
he had abused, and to suffer
from that iustice which he had
prouoked; <hi>Let vs now fall into
the hands of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Humble confessions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3837:69"/>
penance cannot alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
temporall iudgements;
Gods Angell is abroad, and
within that short compasse of
time sweepes away seuentie
thousand Israelites; <hi>Dauid</hi> was
proud of the number of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
now they are abated; that
he may see cause of humiliation
in the matter of his glory; In
what we haue offended, wee
commonly smart; These thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Israel were not so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that they should onely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne; Their sins
were the motiues both of this
sinne, and punishment; besides
the respect of <hi>Dauids</hi> offence,
they die for themselues.</p>
                  <p>It was no ordinary pestilence
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3837:69"/>
that was thus suddenly and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersally
mortall; Common
eyes saw the botch, and the
markes, saw not the Angell;
<hi>Dauids</hi> clearer sight hath espyed
him (after that killing peragra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through the Tribes of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el)
shaking his sword ouer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
and houering ouer
Mount Sion; and now he who
doubtlesse had spent those three
dismall daies in the saddest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
humbly casts himselfe
downe at the feete of the auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and layes himselfe ready for
the fatall stroke of iustice; It
was more terror that God
intended in the visible shape
of his Angell, and deeper
humiliation; and what hee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3837:70"/>
meant, hee wrought; Neuer
Soule could be more deiected,
more anguished with the sense
of a iudgement; in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whereof hee cryes out, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I haue sinned, yea I haue done
wickedly; But these Sheepe what
haue they done? Let thine hand, I pray
thee, be against me, and against my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house.</hi> The better any man
is, the more sensible hee is of
his owne wretchednesse; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those Sheepe were Wolues
to <hi>Dauid;</hi> What had they done?
They had done that which was
the occasion of <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne,
and the cause of their owne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
But that gracious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
knew his owne sinne, he
knew not theirs; and therefore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3837:70"/>
can say, <hi>I haue sinned, What haue
they done?</hi> It is safe accusing,
where we may be boldest, and
are best acquainted, our selues.</p>
                  <p>Oh the admirable charitie of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> that would haue ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the plague to himselfe, and
his house, from the rest of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
and sues to interpose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
betwixt his people and the
vengeance; Hee that had put
himselfe vpon the pawes of the
Beare, and Lion, for the rescue
of his Sheepe, will now cast
himselfe vpon the sword of the
Angell, for the preseruation of
Israel; There was hope in those
conflicts; in this yeeldance there
could be nothing but death;
Thus didst thou, O sonne of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3837:71"/>
                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> the true and great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of thy Church, offer thy
selfe to death for them who had
their hands in thy bloud; who
both procured thy death, and
deserued their owne. Here hee
offred himselfe that had sinned,
for those whom hee professeth
to haue not done euill; thou
that didst no sinne, vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedst
to offer thy selfe for vs,
that were all sinne; He offered
and escaped, thou offeredst, and
diedst; and by thy death wee
liue, and are freed from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
destruction.</p>
                  <p>But, O Father of all mercies,
how little pleasure doest thou
take in the bloud of sinners?
it was thine owne pitty that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3837:71"/>
the destroyer; Ere <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
could see the Angell, thou
hadst restrayned him; <hi>It is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
hold now thine hand;</hi> If thy
compassion did not both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and abridge thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
what place were there
for vs out of hell?</p>
                  <p>How easie and iust had it
been for God to haue made the
shutting vp of that third eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
red with bloud? His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
repents of the slaughter;
and cals for that Sacrifice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he will be appeased; An
Altar must bee built in the
threshing-floore of <hi>Araunah</hi> the
Iebusite; Lo, in that very Hill
where the Angel held the sword
of <hi>Abraham</hi> from killing his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3837:72"/>
Sonne, doth God now hold the
Sword of the Angell from kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his people; Vpon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ground shall the Temple, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
stand; heere shall be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Altar, which shall send vp
the acceptable oblations of
Gods people in succeeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
                  <p>O God, what was the thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-floore
of a Iebusite to thee
aboue all other soyles? What
vertue, what merit was in this
earth? As in places, so in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
it is not to be heeded what
they are, but what thou wilt;
That is worthiest which thou
pleasest to accept.</p>
                  <p>Rich and bountifull <hi>Araunah</hi>
is ready to meete <hi>Dauid</hi> in so
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3837:72"/>
holy a motion; and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
offers his Sion for the
place, his Oxen for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
his Carts and Ploughes,
and other Vtensils of his Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
for the wood; Two
franke hearts are well met; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
would buy, <hi>Araunah</hi> would
giue; The Iebusite would not
sell, <hi>Dauid</hi> will not take:
Since it was for God, and to
<hi>Dauid, Araunah</hi> is loth to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
Since it was for God,
<hi>Dauid</hi> wisheth to pay deare, <hi>I
will not offer burnt Offering to the
Lord my God, of that which doth
cost mee nothing;</hi> Heroicall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
doe well become eminent
persons; Hee that knew it was
better to giue then receiue,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3837:73"/>
would not receiue but giue;
There can be no deuotion in a
niggardly heart; As vnto dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
palates, so to the godly soule,
that tastes sweetest that costs
most; Nothing is deare enough
for the Creator of all things. It
is an heartlesse piety of those
base-minded Christians, that
care onely to serue God
good cheape.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>AVID had not so
carefully husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his yeeres, as to
maintaine a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
age; he was therefore what
through warres, what with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
what with sicknesse,
decrepit betimes; By that time
he was seuentie yeeres old, his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3837:77"/>
naturall heate was so wasted,
that his clothes could not
warme him; how many haue
we knowne of more strength,
at more age? The holiest soule
dwells not in an inpregnable
fort; If the reuenging Angell
spared <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet age and Death
will not spare him; Neither his
new altar, nor his costly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
can be of force against de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of nature; Nothing but
death can preuent the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of age.</p>
                  <p>None can blame a people if
when they haue a good King,
they are desirous to hold him;
<hi>Dauids</hi> seruants and subiects
haue commended vnto his bed
a faire young virgin; not for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3837:77"/>
the heat of lust, but of life; that
by this meanes they might
make an outward supplie of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
for that vitall fire which was
well-neere extinguished with
age.</p>
                  <p>As it is in the market, or the
stage, so it is in our life; One
goes in, another comes out;
when <hi>Dauid</hi> was withering, <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah</hi>
was in his blossome; That
sonne, as he was next to <hi>Absalom</hi>
both in the beautie of his body,
and the time of his birth, so, was
he too like him in practise; He
also taking aduantage of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
infirmitie, will be caruing
himselfe of the kingdome of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
That he might no whit
vary from his patterne, he gets
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3837:78"/>
him also Charets and horse-men,
and fiftie men to run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: These two, <hi>Absalom</hi>
and <hi>Adonijah</hi> were the darlings of
their father; Their father had
not displeased them from their
childhood, therefore they both
displeased him in his age; Those
children had need to be very
gracious, that are not marred
with pampering; It is more
then God owes vs, if we receiue
comfort in those children
whom we haue ouer-loued;
The indulgence of parents at
last paies them home in crosses.</p>
                  <p>It is true that <hi>Adonijah</hi> was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
eldest sonne now remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and therefore might seeme
to challenge the iustest title to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3837:78"/>
the Crowne; But the kingdome
of Israel (in so late an erection)
had not yet knowne the right
of succession: God himselfe that
had ordained the gouernment,
was as yet the immediate ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor;
He fetcht <hi>Saul</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the stuffe, and <hi>Dauid</hi> from
the sheepfold; and had now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Salomon</hi> from the ferule,
to the Scepter.</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>Adonijah</hi> (which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
had not knowne this, yet
it had beene his part to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his father with him in this
claime of his succession; and not
so to preuent a brother, that he
should shoulder out a father;
and not so violently to preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupate
the throne, that he should
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3837:79"/>
rather be a rebell, then an heire.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Absalom,</hi> so <hi>Adonijah</hi> wants
not furtherers in this vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether spirituall, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall;
<hi>Ioab</hi> the Generall, and
<hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest giue both
counsell, and aid to so vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
a challenge; These two
had beene firme to <hi>Dauid</hi> in all
his troubles, in all insurrections;
yet now finding him fastned to
the bed of age, and death, they
shew themselues thus slipperie
in the loose; Outward happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and friendship are not
knowne till our last act. In the
impotencie of either our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
or recompence, it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
appeare who loued vs for
our selues, who for their owne
ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:3837:79"/>
Had not <hi>Adonijah</hi> knowne
that <hi>Salomon</hi> was designed to
the kingdome both by God,
and <hi>Dauid,</hi> he had neuer inuited
all the rest of the Kings sonnes,
his brethren, and left out <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>
who was otherwise the
most vnlikely to haue beene his
riuall in this honour; all the
rest were elder then he; and
might therefore haue had more
pretence for their competition:
Doubtlesse the Court of Israel
could not but know, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
vpon the birth of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
God sent him by <hi>Nathan</hi>
the Prophet, a name and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of loue; neither was it for
nothing that God called him
<hi>Iedidiah;</hi> and fore-promised him
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3837:80"/>
the honour of building an
house to his Name; and (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of so glorious a seruice)
the establishment of the throne
of his kingdome ouer Israel
for euer; Notwithstanding all
which, <hi>Adonijah</hi> backed by the
strength of a <hi>Ioab,</hi> and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
of an <hi>Abiathar,</hi> will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
<hi>Salomon,</hi> and iustle into
the not-yet-vacant seat of his
father <hi>Dauid.</hi> Vaine men, whiles
like proud and yet brittle clay,
they will be knocking their
sides against the solid, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
decree of God, break them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in peeces.</p>
                  <p>I doe not finde that <hi>Adonijah</hi>
sent any message of threats, or
vnkindnesse to <hi>Zadok</hi> the Priest,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3837:80"/>
or <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, or <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiah</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> and
the other worthies; only he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited
them not to his feast with
the Kings sonnes, and seruants;
Sometimes a very omission is
an affront, and a menace. They
well knew that since they were
not called as guests, they were
counted as enemies; Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of curtesie, though they be
in themselues sleight, and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
yet the neglect of them
in some cases may vndergoe a
dangerous construction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nathan</hi> was the man by
whom God had sent that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
of grace to <hi>Dauid,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Salomon,</hi> assuring him both
to raigne, and prosper; yet now
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3837:81"/>
when <hi>Adonijahs</hi> plot was thus
on foot, he doth not sit still,
and depend vpon the issue of
Gods decree, but he bestirres
him in the businesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
with <hi>Bathsheba</hi> how at
once to saue their liues, and to
aduance <hi>Salomon,</hi> and defeate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donijah;</hi>
Gods pre-determination
includes the meanes as well as
the end; the same prouidence
that had ordained a crowne to
<hi>Salomon,</hi> a repulse to <hi>Adonijah,</hi>
preseruation to <hi>Bathsheba</hi> and
<hi>Nathan,</hi> had fore-appointed the
wise and industrious endeuours
of the Prophet to bring about
his iust, and holy purposes; If
we would not haue God wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to vs, we must not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3837:81"/>
to our selues: Euen when
we know what God hath
meant to vs, we may not be
negligent.</p>
                  <p>The Prophets of God did
not looke for reuelation in all
their affaires, in some things
they were left to the counsell of
their owne hearts; the policie
of <hi>Nathan</hi> was of vse as well as
his prophecie: that alone hath
turned the streame into the
right channell; Nothing could
be more wisely contriued then
the sending in of <hi>Bathsheba</hi> to
<hi>Dauid,</hi> with so seasonable and
forceable an expostulation, and
the seconding of hers with his
owne.</p>
                  <p>Though lust were dead in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3837:82"/>
                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet the respects of his
old matrimoniall loue liued
still; the very presence of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba</hi>
pleaded strongly; but her
speech more; the time was,
when his affection offended in
excesse towards her being then
anothers; he cannot now neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
her being his owne; and if
either his age, or the remorse of
his old offence should haue set
him off; yet she knew his oath
was sure; <hi>My Lord thou swarest by
the Lord thy God vnto thine hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,</hi>
saying, <hi>Assuredly Salomon thy
sonne shall raigne after me, and he
shall sit vpon my throne;</hi> His word
had beene firme, but his oath
was inuiolable; we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
if we haue promised, but if
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3837:82"/>
we haue sworne, we are bound.</p>
                  <p>Neither heauen nor earth
hath any gieues for that man
that can shake off the fetters of
an oath; for he cares not for
that God whom he dares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
to a falshood; and he that
cares not for God, will not care
for man.</p>
                  <p>Ere <hi>Bathsheba</hi> can be ouer the
threshold, <hi>Nathan</hi> (vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact)
is knocking at the doore.
Gods Prophet was neuer but
welcome to the bed-chamber
of King <hi>Dauid;</hi> In a seemiug
strangenesse he falls vpon the
same suit, vpon the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
with <hi>Bathsheba:</hi> Honest
policies doe not mis-become
the holiest Prophets; She might
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3837:83"/>
seeme to speake as a woman, as
a mother, out of passion; the
word of a Prophet could not
be misdoubted; He therefore
that had formerly brought to
<hi>Dauid</hi> that chiding and bloudy
message concerning <hi>Bathsheba,</hi>
comes now to <hi>Dauid,</hi> to sue for
the life and honour of <hi>Bathshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
and he that was sent from
God (to <hi>Dauid</hi>) to bring the
newes of a gracious promise of
fauour vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi> comes
now to challenge the execution
of it from the hands of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and he whose place freed
him from suspicion of a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
complaines of the insolent
demeanure and proclamation
of <hi>Adonijah;</hi> What he began
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3837:83"/>
with an humble obeysance,
shutting vp in a lowly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
expostulation, <hi>Is this thing
done by my Lord the King, and thou
hast not shewed thy seruant who
should sit on the Throne of my Lord
the King after him?</hi> As <hi>Nathan</hi>
was of Gods counsell vnto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
so was he of <hi>Dauids</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
both to God, and the State;
As God therefore vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
told <hi>Nathan</hi> what he
meant to doe with <hi>Dauid,</hi> so had
<hi>Dauid</hi> wont to tell <hi>Nathan</hi> what
he meant to doe in his holy and
most important ciuill affaires.
There are cases wherein it is not
vnfit for Gods Prophets to
meddle with matters of State;
It is no disparagement to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3837:84"/>
Princes to impart their
counsels vnto them, who can
requite them with the counsels
of God.</p>
                  <p>That wood which a single
yron could not riue, is soone
splitted with a double wedge;
The seasonable importunitie of
<hi>Bathsheba</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> thus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding
each other, hath so
wrought vpon <hi>Dauid,</hi> that now
his loue to <hi>Adonijah</hi> giues place
to indignation, nature to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fidelitie; and now he renewes
his ancient oath to <hi>Bathsheba</hi>
with a passionate solemnitie; <hi>As
the Lord liueth, who hath redeemed
my soule out of all aduersitie, euen as
I sware vnto thee by the Lord God
of Israel,</hi> saying, <hi>Assuredly Salomon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3837:84"/>
thy sonne shall reigne after me, and
he shall sit vpon my throne in my
stead; so will I certainly doe this day;</hi>
In the decay of <hi>Dauids</hi> body I
finde not his intellectiue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
any whit impaired: As one
therefore that from his bed
could with a perfect (if weake)
hand stere the gouernment of
Israel; he giues wise and full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
for the inauguration of
<hi>Salomon; Zadok</hi> the Priest, and
<hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Benaiah</hi>
the Captaine receiue his graue
and Princely charge for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of that so weightie a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
They are commanded to
take with them the royall gard,
to set <hi>Salomon</hi> vpon his fathers
Mule, to carry him downe in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3837:85"/>
state to <hi>Gihon,</hi> to anoint him
with the holy oile of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
to sound the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
and proclaime him in the
streets, to bring him backe with
triumph and magnificence to
the Court, and to set him in the
royall Throne with all the due
ceremonies of Coronation.</p>
                  <p>How pleasing was this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to them who in <hi>Salomons</hi>
glorie saw their owne safetie?
<hi>Benaiah</hi> applauds it, and not
fearing a fathers enuie, in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
presence wisheth <hi>Salomons</hi>
throne exalted aboue his; The
people are rauished with the ioy
of so hopefull a succession;
and breake the earth, and fill
the heauen with the noise of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3837:85"/>
their Musicke and shoutings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomons</hi> guests had now at
last better cheere then <hi>Adonijahs;</hi>
whose feast (as all wicked
mens) ended in horror; No
sooner are their bellies full of
meat, then their eares are full of
the sound of those trumpets,
which at once proclaime <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
triumph, and their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
Euer after the meale is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
comes the reckoning; God
could as easily haue preuented
this iollitie, as marred it; But he
willingly suffers vaine men to
please themselues for the time in
the conceited successe of their
owne proiects, that afterwards
their disappointment may be so
much more grieuous; No
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3837:86"/>
doubt, at this feast there was
many an health drunke to <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah,</hi>
many a confident boast of
their prospering designe, many
a scorne of the despised faction
of <hi>Salomon;</hi> and now for their
last dish is serued vp astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and fearefull expectation
of a iust reuenge. <hi>Ionathan,</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest,
brings the newes of <hi>Salomons</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
and ioyfull enthronizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
now all hearts are cold, all
faces pale; and euery man hath
but life enough to run away;
How suddenly is this brauing
troupe dispersed? <hi>Adonijah</hi> their
new Prince flies to the hornes
of the Altar, as distrusting all
hopes of life, saue the Sanctitie
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3837:86"/>
of the place, and the mercie of
his riuall.</p>
                  <p>So doth the wise and iust
God befoole proud and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
sinners in those secret plots,
wherein they hope to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the true sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
the Prince of peace; he suffers
them to lay their heads together
and to feast themselues in a io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund
securitie, and promise of
successe; at last, when they are at
the height of their ioyes, and
hopes, he confounds all their
deuices, and laies them open to
the scorne of the world, and
to the anguish of their
owne guiltie
hearts.</p>

<hi>Dauid</hi> liues to see a wise sonne
warme in his seat, and now hee
that had yeelded to succession
yeelds to nature. Many good
counsels had <hi>Dauid</hi> giuen his
heire; now hee summes them
vp in his end. Dying words
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3837:87"/>
are wont to be weightiest; The

glory breathes nothing but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.
<hi>I goe the way of all the earth;</hi>
How well is that princely heart
content to subscribe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of humane mortalitie;
as one that knew Soueraigntie
doth not reach to the affaires of
nature? Though a King, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expects, nor desires an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
from dissolution; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
not account to goe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other then the common
tracke, to the vniuersall home
of mankinde, the house of age;
Whither should earth but to
earth? and why should wee
grudge to doe that, which all
doe? <hi>Be thou strong therefore, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3837:88"/>
shew thy selfe a man,</hi> Euen when
his spirit was going out, he puts
spirit into his Sonne; Age puts
life into youth, and the dying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimates
the vigorous. He had
well found that strength was
requisite to gouernment; that
he had need to be no lesse then
a man that should rule ouer
men; If greatnesse should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
receiue any opposition, yet
those worlds of cares, and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that attend the chayre of
State, are able to ouer-lay any
meane powers; A weake man
may obey, none but the strong
can gouerne. Gracelesse courage
were but the whet-stone of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
<hi>Take heed therefore to the
charge of the Lord thy God, to walke
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3837:88"/>
in his wayes, and to keepe his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi>
The best legacy that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
bequeathes to his heire, is
the care of piety; himselfe had
found the sweetnesse of a good
conscience, and now hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it to his successor. If
there be any thing that in our
desires of the prosperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our children, takes
place of goodnesse, our hearts
are not vpright. Here was the
father a King, charging the
King his sonne to keepe the
Statutes of the King of Kings;
as one that knew greatnesse
could neither exempt from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
nor priuiledge sinne;
as one that knew the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiation
in the greatest and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3837:89"/>
hiest Orbe, is both most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and most dangerous: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would he haue his sonne
to looke for any prosperity, saue
onely from well-doing; That
happinesse is built vpon sands
or Ice, which is raised vpon any
foundation besides vertue. If
<hi>Salomon</hi> were wise, <hi>Dauid</hi> was
good; and if old <hi>Salomon</hi> had
well remembred the counsell
of old <hi>Dauid,</hi> hee had not so
foulely mis-carried.</p>
                  <p>After the precepts of pietie,

The bloudinesse of <hi>Ioab</hi> had lien

hideous noyse of those treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
murders, as it had pierced

himselfe at last a faithfull deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
Now he will defray it by

and dignitie: How much more
doest thou, O sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:3837:90"/>
take to thy selfe those insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

<hi>Saul</hi> can touch a Christian here

                  <p>But, what shall we thinke of
this? <hi>Dauid</hi> was a man of war,
<hi>Salomon</hi> a King of peace; yet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
referres this reuenge to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
How iust it was that he
who shed the bloud of warre in
peace, and put the bloud of war
vpon his girdle that was about
his loynes, should haue his
bloud shed in peace, by a Prince
of peace; Peace is fittest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the out-rages of Warre;
Or whether is not this done in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3837:90"/>
type of that diuine administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein thou, O Father of
heauen, hast committed all
iudgement vnto thine eternall
sonne? Thou who couldst im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
either plague, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
sinners, wilt doe neither
but by the hand of a Mediator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> learned betimes what
his ripenesse taught afterwards,
<hi>Take away the wicked from the King,
and his Throne shall be established in
righteousnesse;</hi> Cruell <hi>Ioab,</hi> and
malicious <hi>Shimei,</hi> must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vpon the first opportunity
remoued; The one lay open to
present iustice, for abetting the
conspiracy of <hi>Adonijah;</hi> neither
needes the helpe of time for a
new aduantage; The other went
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3837:91"/>
vnder the protection of an oath
from <hi>Dauid,</hi> and therefore must
be fetcht in vpon a new chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.
The hoare head of both
must be brought to the graue
with bloud; else <hi>Dauids</hi> head
could not be brought to his
graue in peace; Due punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of malefactors is the debt
of authoritie; If that holy King
haue run into arerages; yet as
one that hates and feares to
breake the banke, he giues or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his pay-master; It shall
be defraid, if not by him, yet
for him.</p>
                  <p>Generous natures cannot be
vnthankfull: <hi>Barzillai</hi> had
shewed <hi>Dauid</hi> some kindnesse
in his extremitie; and now the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3837:91"/>
good man will haue posteritie
to inherit the thankes. How
much more bountifull is the
Father of mercies, in the remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of our poore vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

of generations shall fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for one good parent.</p>
                  <p>The dying words and
thoughts of the man after Gods
owne heart did not confine
themselues to the straites of
these particular charges, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
themselues to the care of
Gods publique seruice; As good
men are best at last, <hi>Dauid</hi> did
neuer so busily, and carefully
marshall the affaires of God, as
when he was fixed to the bed of
his age and death. Then did he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3837:92"/>
lode his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> with the
charge of building the house of
God; then did he lay before the
eies of his sonne the modell and
patterne of that whole sacred
worke whereof if <hi>Salomon</hi> beare
the name, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> no lesse me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
it: He now giues the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
of the Courts, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
He giues the gold and
siluer for that holy vse; an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand talents of Gold,
a thousand thousand talents of
Siluer; besides brasse and yron
passing weight; He weighes out
those precious mettalls for their
seuerall designements; Euery
future vessell is laid out already
in his poise, if not in his forme;
He excites the Princes of Israel
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3837:92"/>
to their assistance, in so high a
worke; He takes notice of their
bountifull offerings; He num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
vp the Leuites for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
seruice; and sets them their
taskes. He appoints the Singers,
and other Musitians to their
stations; the Porters to the Gates
that should be; And now when
he hath set all things in a desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
order, and forwardnesse, he
shuts vp with a zealous blessing
of his <hi>Salomon,</hi> and his people,
and sleepe with his fathers. Oh
blessed soule, how quiet a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
hast thou now taken (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many tumults) of a better
Crowne! Thou that hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
all things for the house of
thy God, how happily art thou
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3837:93"/>
now welcomed to that house
of his, not made with hands, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
in the heauens! Who
now shall enuie vnto good
Princes the honour of ouersee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the businesses of God, and
his Church; when <hi>Dauid</hi> was
thus punctuall in these diuine
prouisions? What feare can be
of vsurpation where they haue
so glorious a precedent?</p>
                  <p>Now is <hi>Salomon</hi> the second
time crowned King of Israel;
and now in his owne right (as
formerly in his fathers) sits
peaceably vpon the Throne of
the Lord; His awe and power
come on faster then his yeeres;
Enuie and ambition where it is
once kindled, may sooner be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3837:93"/>
hid in the ashes, then quite put
out; <hi>Adonijah</hi> yet hangs after his
old hopes; He remembers how
sweet he found the name of a
King; and now hath laid a new
plot for the setting vp of his
crackt title; He would make the
bed a step to the throne; His
old complices are sure enough;
His part would gather much
strength, if he might inioy <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shag</hi>
the relict of his father, to
wife; If it were not the Iewish
fashion (as is pretended) that a
Kings widow should mary
none but a King; yet certainly
the power both of the alliance,
and friendship of a Queene
must needs not a little aduance
his purpose; The craftie riuall
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3837:94"/>
dare not either moue the suit to
<hi>Salomon,</hi> or effect the mariage
without him; but would cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
vndermine the sonne by
the suit of that mother, whose
suit had vndermined him. The
weaker vessells are commonly
vsed in the most dangerous sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of euill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bathsheba</hi> was so wise a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that some of her counsels
are canonized for diuine, yet she
saw not the depth of this drift
of <hi>Adonijah;</hi> therefore she both
entertaines the suit, and moues
it: But what euer were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the suitor, could she
choose but see the vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of so incestuous a match?
It is not long since she saw her
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3837:94"/>
late husband <hi>Dauid</hi> abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the bed of those his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
that had beene touched
by his sonne <hi>Absalom;</hi> and can
she hold it lawfull that his son
<hi>Adonijah</hi> should climbe vp to
the bed of his fathers wife?
Sometimes euen the best eies
are dimme, and discerne not
those things which are obuious
to weaker sights: Or whether
did not <hi>Bathsheba</hi> well see the
foulenesse of the suit, and yet
in compassion of <hi>Adonijahs</hi> late
repulse (wherein she was the
chiefe agent) and in a desire to
make him amends for the losse
of the kingdome, she yeelds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thus to gratifie him. It is
an iniurious weaknesse to be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3837:95"/>
drawne vpon any by-respects to
the furtherance of faultie suits,
of vnlawfull actions.</p>
                  <p>No sooner doth <hi>Bathsheba</hi>
come in place, then <hi>Salomon</hi> her
sonne rises from his chaire of
State and meets her and bowes
to her, and sets her on his right
hand; as not so remembring
himselfe to be a King, that he
should forget he was a sonne.
No outward dignitie can take
away the rights and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of nature; Had <hi>Bathsheba</hi>
beene as meane, as <hi>Salomon</hi> was
mightie, she had carried away
this honour from a gracious
sonne: Yet for all these due
complements, <hi>Bathsheba</hi> goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a deniall, Reuerence
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3837:95"/>
she shall haue, she shall not haue
a condescent.</p>
                  <p>In the acts of Magistracie, all
regards of naturall relations
must giue way; That which she
propounded as a small request,
is now, after a generall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
ingagement reiected as
vnreasonable. It were pittie we
should be heard in all our suits.
<hi>Bathsheba</hi> makes a petition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her selfe, and knowes it
not; her safetie and life depends
vpon <hi>Salomons</hi> raigne, yet she vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly
moues for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
of <hi>Adonijah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> was too dutifull to
checke his mother, and too wise
to yeeld to her: In vnfit suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
wee are most heard
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3837:96"/>
when we are repelled. Thus
doth our God many times an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
our praiers with mercifull
denials and most blesseth vs in
crossing our desires.</p>
                  <p>Wise <hi>Salomon</hi> doth not finde
himselfe perplexed with the
scruple of his promise; he that
had said <hi>Aske on, for I will not say
thee nay,</hi> can now sweare, <hi>God
doe so to me, and more also, if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donijah
haue not spoken this word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his owne life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> His promise
was according to his suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
his supposition was of no

expedient; now he
holds himselfe free from that
grant, wherein there was at
once both sinne and danger.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3837:96"/>
No man can be intangled
with generall words against his
own iust and honest intentions.</p>
                  <p>The policies of wicked men
befoole them at last; this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
hath vndone <hi>Adonijah,</hi>
and in stead of the Throne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
his graue: The sword of
<hi>Benaiah</hi> puts an end to that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
riualitie. <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tbar</hi>
still held Champerty with
<hi>Adonijah;</hi> Their hand was both
in his claime of the kingdome,
and in the suit for <hi>Abishag;</hi> There
are crimes wherein there are no
accessories, such is this of treason.
<hi>Abiathar</hi> may thanke his burden
that he liues; Had he not borne
the Arke of the Lord before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
he had not now carried his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3837:97"/>
head vpon his shoulders; Had
he not beene afflicted with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
he had perished with <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah;</hi>
now though he were, in
his owne merit, a man of death,
yet he shall furuiue his partners,
<hi>Get thee to Anathoth vnto thine owne
fields;</hi> The Priesthood of <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,</hi>
as it aggrauated his crime,
so it shall preserue his life: Such
honour haue good Princes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the Ministers of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie,
that their very coate
hath beene defence enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sword of iustice; how
much more should it be of
proofe against the contempt of
base persons?</p>
                  <p>Besides his function, respect
is had to his sufferings; The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3837:97"/>
and brethren of <hi>Abiathar</hi>
were slaine for <hi>Dauids</hi> sake,
therefore for <hi>Dauids</hi> sake <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi>
(though worthy of death)
shall liue; He had beene now a
dead man, if he had not beene
formerly afflicted; Thus doth
our good God deale with vs; by
the rod he preuents the sword;
and therefore will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
vs for our sinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we haue suffered. If <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi>
doe not forfait his life, yet
his office he shall; he must
change Ierusalem for Anathoth,
and the Priesthood for a retired
priuacie. It was fourescore
yeeres agoe since the sentence of
iudgement was denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the house of <hi>Eli;</hi> now
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3837:98"/>
doth it come to execution; This

(the last of that line) shall make

The wickednesse of <hi>Elies</hi> house
was neither purged by sacrifice,
nor obliterated by time: If God
pay slowly, yet he paies sure;
Delay of most certaine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Altar; Fond <hi>Ioab</hi> hadst

hadst not now needed to seeke
to it for refuge; if thy deuotions
had not beene wanting to that

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3837:99"/>
Necessitie will driue the most
profane and lawlesse man to
God; But what do those bloudie
hands touching the holy Altar
of God? Miserable <hi>Ioab,</hi> what
helpe canst thou expect from
that sacred pile? Those hornes
that were besprinkled with the
bloud of beasts, abhorre to be
touched by the bloud of men;
that Altar was for the expiation
of sinne by bloud; not for the
protection of the sin of bloud.
If <hi>Adonijah</hi> fled thither and esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
it is murder that pursues
thee more then conspiracie;
God hath no sanctuary for a

                  <p>Yet such respect doth <hi>Benaiah</hi>
giue to that holy place, that his

Sword is vnwilling to touch
him that touches the Altar:
Those hornes shall put off death
for the time; and giue protracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

preseruation of life; How sweet
is life euen to those who haue
beene prodigall of the bloud of

<hi>Benaiah</hi> returnes with <hi>Ioabs</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

vnsheath his Sword against a

without a new commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Yong <hi>Salomon</hi> is so well
acquainted with the Law of
God, in such a case, that he sticks
not at the sentence: Hee knew
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3837:100"/>
that God had enacted, <hi>If a man
come presumptuously vpon his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
to slay him with guile, thou shalt

he sends <hi>Benaiah</hi> to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the offender, both from
God, and men, from the Altar,
and the world.</p>
                  <p>No Subiect had merited more
then <hi>Ioab;</hi> When proclamation
was made in Israel, that who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
should smite the Iebusites
first, he should be the Chiefe and
Captaine; <hi>Ioab</hi> was the man;
When <hi>Dauid</hi> built some part of

both for recouery, and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
No man held so close to

bloud to <hi>Amasa,</hi> and <hi>Abner:</hi> It is

                  <p>The honest simplicity of

infamy in the execution of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<hi>Benaiah,</hi> who was the

thinkes not his fingers defiled
with that fatall stroke. It is a

then in the violating of it.</p>
                  <p>In one act <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued

                  <p>Bloud is a restlesse suitor,
and will not leaue clamoring
for iudgement, till the mouth
be stopped with reuenge. In this

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3837:102"/>
cruelty to the fauourer.</p>
                  <p>Now hath <hi>Ioab</hi> paid all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages
by the sword of <hi>Bena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah;</hi>
there is no suit against his
corps; that hath the honor of a
buriall fit for a Peere of Israel,
for the neere cozen to the King.
Death puts an end to all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels;
<hi>Salomon</hi> strikes off the
skore, when God is satisfied;
The reuenge that suruiues death
and will not be shut vp in the
Coffin, is barbarous, and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
true Israelites.</p>
                  <p>Onely <hi>Shimei</hi> remaines vpon
the file; his course is next, yet
so, as that it shall be in his owne
liberty to hasten his end; Vpon
<hi>Dauids</hi> remission, <hi>Shimei</hi> dwels
securely in Bahurim, a towne
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3837:102"/>
of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin;</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
when he saw so round iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
done vpon <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and
<hi>Ioab,</hi> his guiltie heart could not

ought but his execution;
and now he cannot but be well
pleased with so easie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of dwelling at Ierusalem,
and not passing ouer the brooke
Kidron; What more delightfull
place could he choose to liue in,
then that citie, which was the
glorie of the whole earth? What
more pleasing bounds could he
wish then the sweet bankes of
Kidron? Ierusalem could be no
prison to him, whiles it was a
Paradise to his betters; and if
he had a desire to take fresh aire,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3837:103"/>
he had the space of six furlongs
to walke from the citie to the
brooke; He could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
to be so delectably confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
And besides, thrice euery

                  <p>Wise <hi>Salomon</hi> whiles he cared
to seeme not too seuere an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actor
of that, which his father
had remitted; prudently laies
insensible twigs for so foule an
offender; Besides the old
grudge, no doubt <hi>Salomon</hi> saw
cause to suspect the fidelitie of
<hi>Shimei;</hi> as a man who was euer
knowne to be hollow to the
house of <hi>Dauid;</hi> The obscuritie
of a Countrie life would easily
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3837:103"/>
afford him more safe oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of secret mischiefe; Many
eies shall watch him in the citie;
he cannot looke out vnseene,
he cannot whisper, vnheard:
Vpon no other termes shall he
inioy his life, which the least
straying shall forfait.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shimei</hi> feeles no paine in this
restraint; How many Nobles
of Israel doe that for pleasure,
which he doth vpon command?
Three yeeres hath he liued
within compasse; limited both
by <hi>Salomons</hi> charge and his
owne oath; It was still in his
power (notwithstanding <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
Caueat) to haue laid downe
his hoare-head in the graue,
without bloud; The iust God
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3837:104"/>
infatuates those whom he
meanes to plague; Two of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meies</hi>
seruants are fled to Gath;
and now he saddles his Asse and
is gone to fetch them backe;
Either (he thinkes) this word
of <hi>Salomon</hi> is forgotten, or in
the multitude of greater affaires,
not heeded; or this so small an
occurrence will not come to his
eare: Couetousnesse and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of impunitie are the
destruction of many a soule;
<hi>Shimei</hi> seekes his seruants, and
loses himselfe; How many are
there who crie out of this folly,
and yet imitate it; These earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things either are our seruants,
or should be; How commonly
doe we see men run out of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3837:104"/>
bounds, set by Gods law, to
hunt after them, till their soules
incurre a fearefull iudgement?</p>
                  <p>Princes haue thousands of
eies, and eares; If <hi>Shimei</hi> will for

his iourney cannot be hid from
<hi>Salomon;</hi> How warie had those
men need to be which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious?
Without delay is <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi>
complained of, conuented,
charged with violation both of
the oath of God, and the iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Salomon;</hi> and that all
these might appeare to be but
an occasion of that punishment,
whose cause was more remote,
now is all that old venome laid
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3837:105"/>
before him, which his malice
had long since spit at Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed:
<hi>Thou knowst all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
whereto thine heart is priuie,
that thou didst to Dauid my father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had this old tallie beene stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off; yet could not <hi>Shimei</hi>
haue pleaded ought for his life;
For, had he said; Let not my
Lord the King be thus mortally
displeased for so small an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
Who euer died for passing
ouer Kidron? What man is the
worse for my harmlesse iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
It had soone beene retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
If the act be small, yet the
circumstances are deadly; The
commands of Soueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
make the sleightest du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
weightie; If the iourney be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3837:105"/>
harmlesse, yet not the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
It is not for subiects to
poyse the Princes charge in the
scales of their weake constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
but they must suppose
it euer to be of such importance,
as is pretended by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.
Besides the precept,
here was a mutuall adiuration;
<hi>Shimei</hi> swore not to goe, <hi>Salomon</hi>
swore his death if he went; the
one oath must be reuenged, the
other must be kept: If <hi>Shimei</hi>
were false in offending; <hi>Salomon</hi>
will be iust in punishing. Now
therefore, that which <hi>Abishai</hi>
the sonne of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> wished to
haue done in the greenenesse of
the wound, and was repelled;
after long festering <hi>Benaiah</hi> is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3837:106"/>
commanded to doe, The stones
that <hi>Shimei</hi> threw at <hi>Dauid,</hi>
strucke not so deepe, as <hi>Benaiahs</hi>
sword; The tongue that cursed
the Lords anointed hath paid
the head to boot. Vengeance
against rebells may sleepe, it
cannot die; A sure, if late, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
attends those that dare lift
vp either their hand, or tongue
against the sacred persons of
Gods Vice-gerents. How much
lesse will the God of heauen suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vnreuenged the insolencies,
and blasphemies against his
owne diuine Maiestie? It is a
fearefull word, he should not
be iust, if he should hold
these guiltlesse.</p>

The night followes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the day; and the heart so
vseth to sleepe, as it wakes: Had
not the thoughts of <hi>Salomon</hi> bin
intent vpon wisdome by day,
he had not made it his suit in his
dreame: There needs no leisure
of deliberation; The heart was
so fore-stalled with the loue, and
admiration of wisdome, that
not abiding the least motion of
a competition, it fastens on that
grace it had longed for; <hi>Giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy seruant an vnderstanding hart,
to iudge thy people.</hi> Had not <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
beene wise before, hee had
not knowne the worth of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
he had not preferred it in
his desires; The dung-hill cocks
of the World cannot know the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3837:109"/>
price of this pearle; those that
haue it, know that all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
are but trash, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
vnto it. <hi>Salomon</hi> was a great
King, and saw that he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
enough, but withall, he found
that royalty, without wisdome,
was no other then eminent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour;
There is no trade of
life whereto there belongs
not a peculiar wisdome; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there is nothing but
a tedious vnprofitablenesse:
much more to the hiest, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
vocation, the regiment of
men; As God hath no reason to
giue his best fauours vnasked;
so hath he no will to withhold
them where they are asked.</p>
                  <p>He that in his cradle had the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3837:109"/>
title of <hi>Beloued of God,</hi> is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
more in the Throne for
the loue and desire of wisdome;
This soyle could neuer haue
borne this fruit alone; <hi>Salomon</hi>
could not so much as haue drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of wisdome, if God had not
put it into him; and now God
takes the suit so well, as if hee
were beholden to his creature
for wishing the best to it selfe:
and because <hi>Salomon</hi> hath asked
what he should, hee shall now
receiue both what he asked, and
what he asked not: Riches and
honor shall be giuen him in to
the match. So doth God loue
a good choyse, that hee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
it with ouer-giuing;
Could wee but first seeke the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3837:110"/>
kingdome of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
all these earthly things
should be super-added to vs;
Had <hi>Salomon</hi> made wealth his
boone, hee had failed both of
riches and wisdome; now hee
askes the best, and speeds of all;
They are in a faire way of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
that can pray well; It
was no dis-comfort to <hi>Salomon,</hi>
that he awaked and found it
a dreame; for hee knew this
dreame was diuine, and oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and he already found in his
first waking, the reall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of what was promised
him sleeping: Such illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did he sensibly finde in all
the roomes of his heart, as if
God had now giuen him a new
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3837:110"/>
soule: No maruell if <hi>Salomon</hi>
now returning from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
to the Arke, testified his
ioy and thankfulnesse by burnt-offerings,
and peace-offerings,
and publique feastings; The
heart that hath found in it selfe
the liuely testimonies of Gods
presence, and fauour, cannot
containe it selfe from outward
expressions.</p>
                  <p>God likes not to haue his gifts
lie dead where he hath confer'd
them; Israel shall soone witnesse
that they haue a King inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from heauen; in whom
wisdome did not stay for heires;
did not admit of any parallel in
his predecessors; The all-wise
God wil find occasions to draw
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3837:111"/>
forth those graces to vse, and
light, which he hath bestowed
on man. Two Harlots come
before young <hi>Salomon</hi> with a
difficult plea; It is not like the
Princes eare was the first that
heard this complaint; there was
a subordinate course of iustice
for the determination of these
meaner incidences: the hardnes
of this decision brought the
matter, through all the benches
of inferiour iudicature, to the
Tribunall of <hi>Salomon;</hi> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Israelitish Harlots were not
so vnnaturall as some now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
that counterfait honesty;
These striue for the fruit of their
wombe, ours to put them off;
One sonne is yet aliue, two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3837:111"/>
contend for him. The
children were alike for features,
for age; the mothers were alike
for reputation, here can be no
euidence from others eyes;
Whethers now is the liuing
Childe, and whethers is the
dead? Had <hi>Salomon</hi> gone about
to wring forth the truth by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
he had perhaps plagued
the innocent, and added paine
to the misery of her losse; the
weaker had beene guilty, and
the more able to beare, had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away both the Childe, and
the victory: The countenance
of either of the mothers bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an equality of passion; Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
possessed the one, for the
sonne shee had lost; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3837:112"/>
for the sonne shee was in
danger to leese: Both were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
peremptory, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
in their claime; It is in
vaine to think that the true part
can be discerned by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of their challenge; Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is oft-times more clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then truth; No witnesses
can be produced; They two
dwelt apart vnder one roofe;
and if some neighbours haue
seene the children at their birth,
and circumcision; yet how
little difference, how much
change is there in the fauour of
infants? how doth death alter
more confirmed lines?</p>
                  <p>The impossibility of proofe
makes the guilty more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3837:112"/>
more impudent; the true
mother pleads that her childe
was taken away at midnight
by the other; but in her sleepe;
She saw it not, she felt it not;
and if all her senses could haue
witnessed it, yet, here was but
the affirmation of the one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the deniall of the other,
which in persons alike credible
doe but counterpoise. What is
there now to leade the Iudge,
since there is nothing either in
the act, or circumstances, or
persons, or plea, or euidence
that might sway the sentence?
<hi>Salomon</hi> well saw that when all
outward proofes failed, there
was an inward affection, which
if it could be fetcht out, would
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3837:113"/>
certainly bewray the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
He knew sorrow might
more easily be dissembled then
naturall loue; both sorrowed
for their owne; both could not
loue, one, as theirs; To draw
forth then this true proofe of
motherhood, <hi>Salomon</hi> calls for a
sword; Doubtlesse, some of the
wiser hearers smiled vpon each
other; and thought in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
What, will the young
King cut these knottie causes in
peeces? Will he diuide iustice
with edge-tooles? will he smite
at hazard before conuiction?
The actions of wise Princes are
riddles to vulgar constructions;
neither is it for the shallow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of the multitude to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3837:113"/>
the deepe proiects of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
authority: That sword
which had serued for execution,
shall now serue for triall; <hi>Diuide
ye the liuing childe in twaine, and giue
the one halfe to the one, and the other
halfe to the other;</hi> Oh diuine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of iustice, commanding that
which it would not haue done,
that it might finde out that
which could not be discouered;
Neither God, nor his Deputies
may be so taken at their words,
as if they alwaies intended their
commands for action, and not
sometimes for probation.</p>
                  <p>This sword hath alreadie
pierced the brest of the true
mother; and diuided her heart
with feare, and griefe, at so kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3837:114"/>
a sentence; There needs no
other racke to discouer nature;
and now she thinkes, woe is
me that came for iustice, and am
answered with crueltie; <hi>Diuide
yee the liuing childe?</hi> Alas, what
hath that poore infant offended
that it suruiues, and is sued for?
How much lesse miserable had
I beene, that my childe had
beene smothered in my sleepe,
then mangled before mine eies?
If a dead carcasse could haue
satisfied me, I needed not to
haue complained; What a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
condition am I falne into,
who am accused to haue beene
the death of my supposed child
already, and now shall be the
death of my owne? If there
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3837:114"/>
were no losse of my childe, yet
how can I indure this torment
of mine owne bowels? How
can I liue to see this part of my
selfe sprawling vnder that blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
sword? And whiles she
thinkes thus, she sues to that
suspected mercie of her iust
Iudge, <hi>Oh my Lord, giue her the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
childe, and slaie him not:</hi> as
thinking, if he liue, he shall but
change a mother; if he die, his
mother loseth a sonne; Whiles
he liues, it shall be my comfort
that I haue a sonne, though
I may not call him so; dying,
he perisheth to both; it is better
he should liue to a wrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then to neither: Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
her enuious competitor as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3837:115"/>
holding her selfe well satisfied
that her neighbour should be as
childlesse, as her selfe, can say,
<hi>Let it be neither mine, nor thine, but
diuide it;</hi> Well might <hi>Salomon,</hi>
and euery hearer conclude, that
either she was no mother, or a
monster, that could be content
with the murder of her childe;
and that if she could haue beene
the true mother, and yet haue
desired the bloud of her infant,
she had beene as worthy to be
stript of her childe for so foule
vnnaturalnesse, as the other had
beene worthy to inioy him for
her honest compassion. Not
more iustly then wisely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth <hi>Salomon</hi> trace the true
mother by the footsteps of loue,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3837:115"/>
and pittie; and adiudgeth the
childe to those bowels that had
yearned at his danger.</p>
                  <p>Euen in moralitie it is thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
Truth as it is one, so it loues
intirenesse; falshood, diuision:
Satan that hath no right to the
heart, would be content with a
peece of it; God that made it
all, will haue either the whole,
or none; The erroneous Church
striues with the true, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
childe of sauing doctrine;
each claimes it for her owne;
Heresie conscious of her owne
iniustice, could be content to
goe away with a legge, or an
arme of sound principles, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to make vp the rest with
her owne mixtures; Truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3837:116"/>
abide to part with a ioynt;
and will rather indure to leese
all by violence, then a

If there be a Tyrian that can

is God to his creature, that
he requires vs not to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyled

seruice. Due respirations are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in the holiest acts. The
maine stresse of the worke lies
vpon Proselytes; whose both
number, and paines was herein
more then the Natiues: An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

are imployed in bearing bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,

                  <p>There is no man so meane

cannot worke in gold, and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

hewe; and those that can doe
neither, yet may carry burdens;
Euen the seruices that are more
homely, are not lesse necessarie:
Who can dis-hearten himselfe
in the conscience of his owne
insufficiency, when he sees God
can as well serue himselfe of his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3837:120"/>

                  <p>The Temple is framed in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,
and set vp in Sion; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hammer nor axe was heard

nothing in Sion but si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and peace; What euer tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
are abroad, it is fit there
should be all quietnesse &amp; sweet

God, that the axes of schisme, or
the hammers of furious conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be heard within
thy Sanctuary! Thine house is
not built with blowes, with
blowes it is beaten downe: Oh

and the bond of peace; that

                  <p>Now is the foundation laid,
and the wals rising of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

admired, and all times haue
celebrated; Euen those stones
which were laid in the Base of
the building were not ragged
and rude, but hewne and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the part that lyes couered
with earth from the eyes of all
beholders, is no lesse precious,
then those that are most conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous:
God is not all for the
eye, hee pleaseth himselfe with
the hidden value of the liuing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3837:121"/>
stones of his spirituall Temple;
How many noble graces of his
feruants haue beene buried in
obscurity; not discerned so much
as by their owne eyes? which
yet as he gaue, so he crowneth:
Hypocrites regard nothing but
shew; God nothing but truth.</p>
                  <p>The matter of so goodly a
frame striues with the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether shall more excell;
Here was nothing but white
Marble without; nothing but
Cedar and Gold within; Vpon
the Hill of Sion stands that glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and snowy pile, which
both inuiteth and dazeleth the
eyes of passengers a farre off; so
much more precious within, as
Cedar is better then stone, Gold
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3837:121"/>
then Cedar; No base thing goes
to the making vp of Gods
house; If Satan may haue a
dwelling, he cares not though
he patch it vp of the rubbish of
stone, or rotten sticks, or drosse
of mettals; God will admit of
nothing that is not pure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite;
His Church consists of
none but the faithfull, his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is in no heart but the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <p>The fashion was no other
then that of the Tabernacle; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this was more costly, more
large, more fixed; God was the
same that dwelt in both, hee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
not, the same mystery was
in both; Onely it was fit there
should be a proportion betwixt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3837:122"/>
the worke and the builder; The
Tabernacle was erected in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
estate, the Temple in a
Monarchy; it was fit this should
fauour of the munificence of a
King, as that of the zeale of a
multitude; That was erected in
the flitting condition of Israel
in the desert; this, in their setled
residence in the promised Land;
it was fit therefore that should
be framed for motion, this for
rest. Both of them were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
into three remarkable
diuisions, whereof each was
more noble, more reserued
then other.</p>
                  <p>But what doe we bend our
eies vpon stone, and wood, and
mettals? God would neuer haue
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3837:122"/>
taken pleasure in these dead ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
for their owne sakes, if
they had not had a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment:
Me thinkes I see
foure Temples in this one. It is
but one in matter, as the God
that dwels in it is but one; three
yet more in resemblance: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the diuision of them in
whom it pleases God to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite;
For where euer God
dwels, there is his temple; Oh
God, thou vouchsafest to dwell
in the beleeuing heart: as we thy
sillie creatures haue our being
in thee, so thou the Creator of
heauen and earth hast thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in vs. The heauen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
is not able to containe
thee, and yet thou disdainest
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3837:123"/>
not to dwell in the strait lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
of our renewed soule. So
then, because Gods children are
many, and those many diuided
in respect of themselues, though
vnited in their head, therefore
this Temple which is but one
in collection as God is one, is
manifold in the distribution, as
the Saints are many; each man
bearing about him a little shrine
of this infinite Maiestie; And
for that the most generall diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Saints is in their
place and estate; some strugling,
and toyling in this earthly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
others triumphing in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
glorie, therefore hath God
two other, more vniuersall
Temples; One the Church of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3837:123"/>
his Saints on earth, the other,
the hiest heauen of his Saints
glorified. In all these, ô God,
thou dwellest for euer, and this
materiall house of thine is a
cleere representation of these
three spirituall; Else what were
a temple made with hands vnto
the God of spirits? And tho one
of these was a true type of all,
yet how are they all exceeded
each by other? This of stone,
though most rich and costly, yet
what is it to the liuing Temple
of the holy Ghost, which is our
body? What is the Temple of
this body of ours, to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Christs body which is his
Church? And what is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Gods Church on earth,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3837:124"/>
to that which triumpheth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in heauen?</p>
                  <p>How easily doe we see all
these in this one visible Temple?
which as it had three distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of roomes; the Porch, the
Holy-place, the Holy of Holies;
so is each of them answered
spiritually; In the porch we
finde the regenerate soule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the blessed societic of
the Church; In the holy place,
the Communion of the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church on earth, selected
from the world; In the holy of
holies (whereinto the hie-Priest
entred once a yeere) the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heauen, into which our true
hie-Priest, Christ Iesus, entred
once for all to make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3837:124"/>
betwixt God, and man. In
all these what a meet correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
there is both in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
matter, situation?</p>
                  <p>In proportion; The same rule
that skilfull caruers obserue in
the dutting out of the perfect
statue of a man, that the height
be thrice the breadth, and the
breadth one third of the height,
was likewise dulie obserued in
the fabrike of the Temple;
whose length was double to
the height, and treble to the
breadth; as being sixtie cubits
long, thirtie hie, and twentie
broad; How exquisite a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie
hast thou ordained (ô
God) betwixt the faithfull heart,
and thy Church on earth, with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3837:125"/>
that in heauen; how accurate
in each of these, in all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and parts compared with
other; So hath God ordered the
beleeuing soule that it hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too much shortnesse of
grace, nor too much height of
conceit, nor too much breadth
of passion; So hath he ordered
his visible Church, that there is
a necessarie inequalitie, without
any disproportion; an height
of gouernment, a length of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
a breadth of iurisdiction
duly answerable to each other;
So hath he ordered his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Church aboue, that it
hath a length of eternitie, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with an height of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and a breadth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3837:125"/>
glorie.</p>
                  <p>In matter; All was here of
the best; The wood was preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
sweet, lasting; The stone
beautifull, costly, insensible of
age; The gold pure and glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
So are the graces of Gods
children, excellent in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
deare in their acceptation,
eternall in their vse: So are the
ordinances of God in his
Church, holy, comfortable, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable.
So is the perfection
of his glorified saints incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
vnconceiuable.</p>
                  <p>In Situation; the outer parts
were here more common, the
inner more holy, and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reserued: I finde one Court
of the Temple open to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3837:126"/>
to the vncircumcised;
Within that; another open only
to the Israelites, and of them,
to the cleane; within that, yet
another, proper only to the
Priests and Leuites; where was
the Brazen Altar for sacrifice,
and the Brazen sea for washings;
The eies of the Laitie might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their oblations in hither,
their feet might not.</p>
                  <p>Yet more, in the couered
roomes of the Temple, there is,
whither the Priests only may
enter, not the Leuites; there is,
whither the hie-priest only may
enter, not his brethren.</p>
                  <p>It is thus in euery renewed
man, the indiuiduall temple of
God; the outward parts are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3837:126"/>
common to God and
the world; the inwardest and
secretest, which is the heart, is
reserued only for the God that
made it. It is thus in the Church
visible, the false and foule-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hypocrite hath accesse to the
holy ordinances of God, and
treads in his Courts; only the
true Christian hath intire and
priuate conuersation with the
holy one of Israel. He only is
admitted into the Holy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and enters within the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
vaile of heauen.</p>
                  <p>If from the walls we looke
vnto the furniture; What is the
Altar whereon our sacrifices of
praier and praises are offered to
the Almightie but a contrite
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3837:127"/>
heart? What the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks,
but the illumined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
wherein the light
of the knowledge of God, and
his diuine will shineth for euer?
What the Tables of Shew-bread,
but the sanctified memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which keepeth the bread of
life continually? Yea, if we shall
presume so farre as to enter into
the very closet of Gods oracle;
Euen there, ô God, doe we finde
our vnworthy hearts so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by thee, that they are made
thy very Arke, wherein thy
Royall law, and the pot of
thine heauenly Manna is kept
for euer; and from whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie,
shaded with the
wings of thy glorious Angels,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3837:127"/>
thou giuest the gratious Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of thy good spirit, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
with ours, that we are
the children of thee the liuing
God.</p>
                  <p>Behold, if <hi>Salomon</hi> built a
Temple vnto thee, thou hast
built a Temple vnto thy selfe in
vs; We are not only through
thy grace liuing stones in thy
Temple, but liuing Temples in
thy Sion: Oh doe thou euer
dwell in this thine house; and
in this thy house let vs euer serue
thee: Wherefore else hast thou
a Temple, but for thy presence
with vs, and for our worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of thee?   The time was,
when, as thy people, so thy selfe;
didst lodge in flitting Tents, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3837:128"/>
shifting, euer mouing;
thence thou thoughtest best to
soiourne both in Shilo; and the
roofe of Obed-Edom; After
that, thou condescendedst to
settle thine abode with men,
and wouldst dwell in an house
of thine owne, at thy Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
So didst thou in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
lodge with our first
Parents as in a Tent; Soiourne
with Israel vnder the law; and
now makest a constant resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
vnder the Gospell, in the
hearts of thy chosen children;
from whence thou wilt remoue
no more; they shall remoue
from the world, from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
thou shalt not remoue
from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:3837:128"/>
Wheresoeuer thou art, ô
God, thou art worthie of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
Since thou euer wilt
dwell in vs, be thou euer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in vs; Let the Altars of
our cleane hearts send vp euer
to thee the sweetly-perfumed
smokes of our holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and faithfull praiers, and
cheerefull thanks-giuings; Let
the pure lights of our faith, and
godly conuersation shine euer
before thee, and men, and neuer
be put out; Let the bread of
life stand euer readie vpon the
pure, and precious tables of our
hearts. Locke vp thy Law, and
thy Manna within vs; and
speake comfortably to vs from
thy mercie-seat. Suffer nothing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3837:129"/>
to enter in hither that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane;
Sanctifie vs vnto thy

There is no speech, nor

                  <p>No doubt many from all

none with so much note
as this noble daughter of <hi>Cham:</hi>
Who her selfe deserues the next
wonder to him whom she
came to heare, and admire;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3837:130"/>
That a woman, a Princesse, a
rich and great Queene, should
trauell from the remotest south,
from Saba, a region famous for
the greatest delicacies of nature,
to learne wisdome, is a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
example. We know Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
that venture to either
Indies for wealth; Others we
know daily to crosse the seas for
wanton curiositie; Some few
Philosophers we haue knowne
to haue gone farre for learning,
and amongst Princes it is no
vnusuall thing to send their
Embassadors to farre-distant
kingdomes, for transaction of
businesses either of State, or
commerce; but that a royall
Lady should in person vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3837:131"/>
and ouercome so tedious a
iourney, only to obserue, and
inquire into the mysteries of
nature, art, religion, is a thing
past both parallel, and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Why doe we thinke any
labour great, or any way long
to heare a greater then <hi>Salomon?</hi>
How iustly shall the Queene of
the South rise vp in iudgement,
and condemne vs, who may
heare wisdome crying in our
streets, and neglect her?</p>
                  <p>Certainly so wealthy a
Queene, and so great a louer of
wisdome could not want great
schollers at home; them she had
first apposed with her enigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
demands; and now fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her selfe vnsatisfied she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3837:131"/>
her selfe to this Oracle of
God; It is a good thing to
doubt, better to be resolued:
The minde that neuer doubts
shall learne nothing; the minde
that alwaies doubts shall neuer
profit by learning; Our doubts
only serue to stir vs vp to seeke
truth; Our resolutions settle vs
in the truth we haue found.
There were no pleasure in reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
if we had not beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
troubled with doubts;
There were nothing but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort
and disquietnesse in
doubts, if it were not for the
hope of resolution; It is not
safe to suffer doubts to dwell
too long vpon the heart; there
may be good vse of them as

Happie are we if we can
finde a <hi>Salomon</hi> to remoue them.</p>
                  <p>Fame as it is alwaies a blab,
so oft-times a lyer. The wise
Princesse found cause to distrust
so vncertaine an informer,
whose reports are still either
doubtfull, or fabulous; and like
windes, or streames, increase in
passing: If very great things
were not spoken of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
fame should haue wrongd him;
and if but iust rumors were
spread of his wisdome, there
needed much credulitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
them. This great Queene
would not suffer her selfe to be
lead by the eares; but comes in
person to examine the truth of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3837:133"/>
forraine relations. How much
more vnsafe is it in the most
important businesses of our
soules, to trust the opinions and
reports of others? Those eares
and eies are ill bestowed that
doe not serue to choose and
iudge for their owners.</p>
                  <p>When we come to a rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
we need not be bidden to
carrie away what we are able.
This wise Lady as she came far
for knowledge, so finding the
plentie of this veine, she would
not depart without her full
lode: There was nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she would leaue her selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied:
she knew that she
could not euery day meet with
a <hi>Salomon;</hi> and therefore shee
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3837:134"/>
makes her best vse of so learned
a master; Now she empties her
heart of all her doubts, and fils
it with instruction. It is not
good neglecting the oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of furnishing our soules
with profitable, with sauing
knowledge. There is much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in mouing a question
well, though there be more in
assoyling it: What vse doe we
make of <hi>Salomons</hi> teacher, if sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the feet of Christ we
leaue our hearts either ignorant,
or perplexed?</p>
                  <p>As if the errand of this weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Queene had beene to buy
wisdome, she came with her
Camels laden with Gold, and
precious stones, and rich odors:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3837:134"/>
Though to a mightie King she
will not come to schoole emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie-handed;
If she came to fetch
an inualuable treasure, she findes
it reason to giue thankes vnto
him that kept it. As he is a
foole that hath a price in his
hand to get wisdome, and
wants an heart; So is he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
that hath an heart to
get wisdome, and hath no price
in his hand; A price, not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruailable
to what he seekes,
but retributorie to him of
whom he seekes. How shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is it to come alwaies with
close hands to them that teach
vs the great mysteries of
saluation.</p>
                  <p>Expectation is no better then
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3837:135"/>
a kinde enemy to good deserts.
Wee leese those obiects which
we ouer-looke. Many had been
admired if they had not beene
ouer-much befriended by fame;
who now in our iudgement are
cast as much below their ranke,
as they were fore-imagined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
it. This disaduantage had
wife <hi>Salomon</hi> with this stranger;
whom rumour had bid to look
for incredible excellencies; yet
so wonderfull were the graces
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that they ouercame
the hiest expectation, and the
liberallest beleefe: So as when
shee saw the architecture of his
buildings, the prouisions of his
tables, the order of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
the religion of his sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3837:135"/>
shee confessed both her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
incredulity in not beleeuing
the report of his wisdome, and
the iniury of report in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
it. <hi>I beleeued not the words till
I came, and mine eyes had seene it; and
loe the one halfe was not told mee.</hi>
Her eyes were more sure infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
then her eares. She did not
so much heare as see <hi>Salomons</hi>
wisdome in these reall effects.
His answers did not so much
demonstrate it, as his prudent
gouernment. There are some
whose speeches are witty, whiles
their carriage is weake, whose
deeds are incongruities, whiles
their words are Apothegmes.
It is not worth the name of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that may be heard onely,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3837:136"/>
and not seene; Good discourse
is but the froth of wisdome; the
pure and solid substance of it is
in well-framed actions; if wee
know these things, happy are
we if we doe them.</p>
                  <p>And if this great person ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
the wisdome, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
the domesticke order of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> and chiefly his stately
ascent into the House of the
Lord; how should our soules
be taken vp with wonder at
thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O thou true sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
and Prince of euer-lasting
peace, who receiuedst the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
not by measure? who hast
built this glorious house, not
made with hands, euen the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of heauens? whose infinite
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3837:136"/>
prouidence hath sweetly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of all the family of thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
both in heauen and earth;
and who lastly didst ascend vp
on hie, and ledst captiuity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
and gauest gifts to men?</p>
                  <p>So well had this studious
Lady profited by the Lectures
of that exquisite Master, that
now shee enuies, shee magnifies
none but them who may liue
within the ayre of <hi>Salomons</hi> wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<hi>Happy are thy men, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are thy seruants, which stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
before thee, and that heare
thy wisdome;</hi> As if she could haue
beene content to haue changed
her Throne for the foot-stoole
of <hi>Salomon.</hi> It is not easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
how great a blessing it is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3837:137"/>
to liue vnder those lips, which
doe both preserue knowledge,
and vtter it: If wee were not
glutted with good counsell, we
should finde no relish in any
worldly contentment in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
hereof; But, hee that is
full, despiseth an hony-combe.</p>
                  <p>Shee, whom her owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
had taught how happy a
thing it is to haue a skilfull Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote
sitting at the sterne of the
State, blesseth Israel for <hi>Salomon,</hi>
blesseth God for Israel, blesseth
<hi>Salomon</hi> and Israel mutually in
each-other; <hi>Blessed be the Lord
thy God which delighted in thee, to
set thee on the Throne of Israel. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lord loued Israel for euer,
therefore made hee the King to doe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3837:137"/>
judgement and justice.</hi> It was not
more <hi>Salomons</hi> aduancement to
be King of Israel, then it was
the aduancement of Israel to be
gouerned by a <hi>Salomon.</hi> There is
no earthly proofe of Gods loue
to any Nation comparable to
the substitution of a wise, and
pious gouernour: to him wee
owe our peace, our life, and
which is deseruedly dearer, the
life of our soules, the Gospell.
But, oh God, how much hast
thou loued thine Israel for euer,
in that thou hast set ouer it that
righteous Branch of <hi>Iesse,</hi> whose
name is <hi>Wonderfull, Counsellor, the
mightie God, the euerlasting Father,
the Prince of peace: in whose dayes
Iudah shall be saued, and Israel shall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3837:138"/>
dwell safely? Sing O heauen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
O earth, and breake forth into
singing, O mountaines, for God hath
comforted his people, and will haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
mercie vpon his afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queene of Sheba did
not bring her gold and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones to looke on, or to
re-carry, but to giue to a weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
then her selfe. Shee giues
therefore to <hi>Salomon</hi> an hundred
and twenty talents of Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
costly stones and odors.
He that made siluer in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
as stones, is yet richly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
on all hands. The riuers
still runne into the Sea; To him
that hath shall be giuen: How
should wee bring vnto thee, O
thou King of Heauen, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3837:138"/>
gold of thine owne graces,
the sweetest odors of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences?
Was not this withall
a type of that homage which
should be done vnto thee, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
by the heads of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<hi>The Kings of Tarshish and
the Iles bring presents; the Kings of
Sheba and Saba bring gifts; yea all
Kings shall worship thee, all Nations
shall serue thee:</hi> They cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themselues but by giuing
vnto thee.</p>
                  <p>It could not stand with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
magnificence to receiue
rich curtesies without a returne;
The greater the person was, the
greater was the obligation of
requitall; The gifts of meane
persons are taken but as tributes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3837:139"/>
of dutie; it is dishonourable to
take from equalls, and not to
retribute: There was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more freedome in her gift,
then in her receit; Her owne
will was the measure of both;
She gaue what she would, she
receiued what soeuer she would
aske; And she had little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Salomons</hi> schoole, if she
had not learned to aske the best:
She returnes therefore more
richly laden then she came; she
gaue to <hi>Salomon</hi> as a thankfull
Client of wisdome; <hi>Salomon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
to her as a munificent
Patrone, according to the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
of a King; We shall be
sure to be gainers by whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we giue vnto thee, ô thou
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3837:139"/>
God of wisdome and peace:
Oh that we could come from

the world hath
not yeelded either so
great an example of wisdome,
or so fearefull an example of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie
as <hi>Salomon:</hi> What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
knowledge <hi>Adam</hi> had in
the perfection of nature by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<hi>Salomon</hi> had by infusion;
both fully, both from one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
If <hi>Adam</hi> called all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
by their names, <hi>Salomon</hi>
spake from the Cedars of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,
to the mosse that springs
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3837:140"/>
out of the wall; and besides
these vegetables, there was no
Beast, nor Fowle, nor Fish, nor
creeping thing that escaped his
discourse. Both fell, both fell by
one meanes; as <hi>Adam,</hi> so might
<hi>Salomon</hi> haue said, <hi>The woman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
mee;</hi> It is true indeed, that
<hi>Adam</hi> fell as all; <hi>Salomon</hi> as one;
yet so as that this one is the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of the frailty of all. If
knowledge could haue giuen
an immunity from sinne, both
had stood: Affections are those
feet of the soule, on which it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stands, or fals; <hi>Salomon lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
many out-landish women;</hi> I
wonder not if the wise King
mis-carried; Euery word hath
bane enough for a man; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3837:141"/>
many women, out-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,
idolatrous, and those not
onely had, but doted on; Sexe,
multitude, nation, condition, all
conspired to the ruine of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;</hi>
If one woman vndid all
mankind, what maruell is it if
many women vndid one? yet
had those many bin the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Israel, they had tempted
him onely to lust, not to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuotion;
now they were of
those Nations, whereof the
Lord had said to the children
of Israel, <hi>Goe not yee in to them, nor
let them come in to you, for surely
they will turne your hearts after their
Gods;</hi> to them did <hi>Salomon</hi> ioyne
in loue; who can maruell if they
disioyned his heart from God?
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3837:141"/>
Satan hath found this bait to
take so well, that he neuer chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it since he crept into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.
How many haue wee
knowne whose heads haue bin
broken with their owne ribbe?</p>
                  <p>In the first world the sonnes of
God saw the daughters of men,
and tooke them wiues of all
they liked; they multiplied not
children, but iniquities; <hi>Balaam</hi>
knew well if the dames of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab
could make the Israelites
wantons, they should soone
make them Idolaters: All lies
open where the couenant is not
both made with the eye, and
kept.</p>
                  <p>It was the charge of God to
the Kings of Israel, before they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3837:142"/>
were, that they should not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
Wiues. <hi>Salomon</hi> hath gone
beyond the stakes of the law,
and now is ready to leese him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
amongst a thousand bed-fellowes:
Who so laies the reines
in the necke of his carnall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
cannot promise where
he will rest. Oh <hi>Salomon,</hi> where
was thy wisdome, whiles thine
affections run away with thee
into so wilde a voluptuousnes?
What bootes it thee to discourse
of all things, whiles thou mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowest
thy selfe? The perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of speculation doe not
argue the inward powers of
selfe-gouernment; The eye may
be cleare whiles the hand is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied.
It is not so much to be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3837:142"/>
heeded how the soule is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as how it is disciplined;
The light of knowledge doth
well, but the due order of the
affections doth better: Neuer
any meere man since the first,
knew so much as <hi>Salomon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> many
that haue knowne lesse haue
had more command of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
A competent estate well
husbanded, is better then a vast
patrimony neglected.</p>
                  <p>There can be no safety to that
soule where is not a strait curbe
vpon our desires; If our lusts be
not held vnder as slaues, they
will rule as tyrans. Nothing
can preuent the extremity of
our mis-carriage but early and
strong denials to our concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3837:143"/>
Had <hi>Salomon</hi> done thus,
delicacie and lawlesse greatnesse
had not led him into these bogs
of intemperance.</p>
                  <p>The waies of youth are steep
and slipperie, wherein as it is
easie to fall, so it is commonly
releeued with pittie; but the
wanton inordinations of age
are not more vnseasonable then
odious; yet behold <hi>Salomons</hi>
younger yeeres were studious,
and innocent, his ouer-hastened
age was licentious and misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned;
<hi>For, when Salomon was
old, his wiues turned away his heart
after other Gods;</hi> If any age can
secure vs from the danger of a
spirituall fall, it is our last; and
if any mans old-age might se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3837:143"/>
him, it was <hi>Salomons;</hi> the
beloued of God, the Oracle, the
miracle of wisdome; who
would haue looked but that
the blossoms of so hopefull a
spring, should haue yeelded a
goodly and pleasant fruit, in the
Autumne of age? yet behold
euen <hi>Salomons</hi> old age vicious.
There is no time wherein we
can be safe, whiles we carrie this
body of sinne about vs; Youth
is impetuous, mid-age stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
old age weake, all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
Say not now; <hi>The furie
of my youthfull flashes is ouer; I shall
henceforth finde my heart calme and
impregnable;</hi> whiles thou seest old
<hi>Salomon</hi> doting vpon his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
yea vpon their Idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:3837:144"/>
It is no presuming vpon
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or meanes, or strength;
how many haue begun and
proceeded well, who yet haue
shamed themselues in their last
stage? If God vphold vs not,
we cannot stand; If God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
vs, we cannot fall; when
we are at our strongest, it is best
to be weake in our selues; and
when at our weakest, strong in
him, in whom we can doe all
things.</p>
                  <p>I cannot yet thinke so hardly
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
his person to <hi>Ashtaroth</hi> the
Goddesse of the Sidonians, or
Milchom the Idoll of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,
or Chemosh the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of <hi>Moab:</hi> He that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3837:144"/>
knew all things from the shrub,
to the Cedar, could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that these statues were
but stocks, or stones, or mettals,
and the powers resembled by
them, Deuils. It is not like he
could be so insensate to adore
such deities; but so farre was
the vxorious King blinded with
affection, that he gaue not
passage only to the Idolatrie
of his heathenish wiues, but
furtherance.</p>
                  <p>So did he dote vpon their
persons, that he humord them
in their sins: Their act is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his, because his eies winkt
at it; his hand aduanced it; He
that built a Temple to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God, for himselfe and Israel
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3837:145"/>
in Sion, built a Temple to
Chemosh in the mount of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
for his mistresses of Moab,
in the very face of Gods house:
No hill about Ierusalem was
free from a Chappell of Deuils;
Each of his dames had their
Puppets, their altars, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense;
Because <hi>Salomon</hi> feedes
them in their superstition, he
drawes the sinne home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and is branded for what he
should haue forbidden. Euen
our very permission appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
crimes to vs; We need no
more guiltinesse of any sinne
then our willing toleration.</p>
                  <p>Who can but yearne, and
feare to see the wofull wracke
of so rich and goodly a vessell?
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3837:145"/>
O <hi>Salomon,</hi> wert not thou he
whose younger yeeres God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with a message and stile
of loue? To whom God twice
appeared; and in a gracious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
renewed the couenant of
his fauour? Whom he singled
out from all the generation of
men to be the founder of that
glorious Temple which was
no lesse cleerely the Type of
heauen, then thou wert of
Christ the Sonne of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing
God? Wert not thou
that deepe Sea of wisdome
which God ordained to send
forth riuers and fountaines of
all diuine, and humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to all nations, to all ages?
Wert not thou one of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3837:146"/>
Secretaries, whose hand it
pleased the Almightie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
in three peeces of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

Scriptures? Which of vs dares
euer hope to aspire vnto thy
graces? Which of vs can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to secure our selues from
thy ruines? We fall, ô God, we
fall to the lowest hell, if thou
preuent vs not, if thou sustaine
vs not: <hi>Vphold thou me according
to thy word that I may liue, and let
me not be ashamed of my hope. Order
my steps in thy word, and let not any
iniquitie haue dominion ouer me.</hi>
All our weaknesse is in our
selues, all our strength is in thee.
O God be thou strong in our
weaknesse, that our weake knees
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3837:146"/>
may be euer steddie in thy
strength.</p>
                  <p>But in the midst of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of this spectacle (able to
affright all the sonnes of men)
behold some glimpse of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
was it of <hi>Salomon</hi> that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
his father prophesied; <hi>Though
he fall, he shall not be vtterly cast
downe; for the Lord vpholdeth him
with his hand?</hi> If sensible grace,
yet finall mercy was not taken
from that beloued of God; In
the hardest of this winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
sappe was gone downe to the
root, though it shewed not in
the branches: Euen whiles <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
remoued, that word stood
fast, <hi>He shall be my Sonne, and I will
be his Father.</hi> He that foresaw his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3837:147"/>
sinne, threatned and limited his
correction. <hi>If he breake my sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and keepe not my commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
then will I visit his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
with a rodde, and his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with stripes; Neuerthelesse my
louing kindnesse will I not vtterly
take from him, nor suffer my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to faile; My Couenant will I
not breake; nor alter the thing that
is gone out of my mouth;</hi> Behold
the fauour of God doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon <hi>Salomons</hi> obedience;
If <hi>Salomon</hi> shall suffer his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to faile towards his
God; God will not requite him
with the failing of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to <hi>Salomon;</hi> If <hi>Salomon</hi>
breake his couenant with God;
God will not breake his Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3837:147"/>
with the father of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
with the Sonne of <hi>Dauid;</hi> He
shall smart, he shall not perish.
Oh gracious word of the God
of all mercies, able to giue
strength to the languishing,
comfort to the despairing,
to the dying, life. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wee are, thou wilt be still
thy selfe, O holy one of Israel,
true to thy Couenant, constant
to thy Decree; The sinnes of
thy chosen can neither frustrate
thy counsell, nor out-strip thy
mercies.</p>
                  <p>Now I see <hi>Salomon</hi> of a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
louer, a graue Preacher of
mortification; I see him quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
those inordinate flames
with the teares of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3837:148"/>
Me thinkes I heare him
sighing deeply betwixt euery
word of that his solemne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which he would needs
inioyne himselfe before all the
world, <hi>I haue applied my heart to
know the wickednesse of folly, euen
the foolishnesse of madnesse; and I
finde more bitter then death the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whose heart is as nets and
snares, and her hands as bands; Who
so pleaseth God shall be deliuered
from her, but the sinner shall be taken
by her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> was taken as a sinner,
deliuered as a penitent. His soule
escaped as a bird out of the snare
of the fowlers; the snare was
broken, and he deliuered; It is
good for vs that he was both
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3837:148"/>
taken, and deliuered; Taken,
that wee might not presume;
and that we might not despaire,
deliuered. He sinned, that we
might not sinne; he recouered,
that we may not sinke vnder
our sinne.</p>
                  <p>But, oh the iustice of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
from his mercie; <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
sinne shall not escape the
rod of men; Rather then so
wise an offender shall want ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
God shall raise vp three
aduersaries vnto <hi>Salomon, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>
the Edomite, <hi>Rezon</hi> the
King of Aram, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the son
of <hi>Nebat,</hi> whereof two were
forraine, one domesticall: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but loue and peace soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the name of <hi>Salomon;</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:3837:149"/>
nothing else was found in his
raigne, whiles he held in good
termes with his God; But when
once he fell foule with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
all things began to be
troubled. There are whips laid
vp against the time of <hi>Salomons</hi>
fore-seene offence, which are
now brought forth for his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
On purpose was <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>
the sonne of the King of
Edom hid in a corner of Egypt
from the sword of <hi>Dauid</hi> and
<hi>Ioab,</hi> that he might be reserued
for a scourge to the exorbitant
sonne of <hi>Dauid:</hi> God would
haue vs make account that our
peace ends with our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
The same sinne that sets
debate betwixt God and vs,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3837:149"/>
armes the creatures against vs;
It were pittie we should be at
any quiet whiles we are
falne out with the
God of

                  <p>But more, a young man, the
only sonne, the only childe of
his mother: No condition can
make it other then grieuous for
a well-natu'rd mother to part
with her owne bowells; yet
surely store is some mitigation
of losse: Amongst many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
one may be more easily
missed; for still we hope the
suruiuing may supplie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the dead; but when all
our hopes and ioyes must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liue or die in one, the
losse of that one admits of no
consolation.</p>
                  <p>When God would describe
the most passionate expression
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3837:155"/>
of sorrow that can fall into the
miserable, he can but say, Oh
daughter of my people gird
thee with sack-cloth, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
thy selfe in the ashes, make
lamentation and bitter mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as for thine onely sonne;
Such was the losse, such was the
sorrow of this disconsolate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
neither words, nor teares
can suffice to discouer it.</p>
                  <p>Yet more; had she beene ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the counsell and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a louing yoke-fellow,
this burden might haue seemed
lesse intolerable; A good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
may make amends for the
losse of a sonne; had the root
beene left to her intire, she might
better haue spared the branch;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3837:156"/>
now both are cut vp, all the stay
of her life is gone; and she
seemes abandoned to a perfect
miserie. And now when she
gaue her selfe vp for a forlorne
mourner, past all capacitie of
redresse, the God of comfort
meets her, pitties her, relieues
her; Here was no solicitor but
his owne compassion; In other
occasions he was sought, and
sued to; The Centurion comes
to him for a seruant, the Ruler
for a sonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Iairus</hi> for a daughter,
the neighbours for the Paraly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke;
here he seekes vp the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and offers the cure vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested;
Whiles we haue to doe
with the Father of mercies, our
afflictions are the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3837:156"/>
suitors. No teares, no prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
can moue him so much as
his owne commiseration. Oh
God, none of our secret sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
can be either hid from
thine eies, or kept from thine
heart: and when we are past all
our hopes, all possibilities of
helpe; then art thou neerest to
vs for deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>Here was a conspiration of
all parts to mercie. The heart
had compassion, the mouth
said, <hi>Weepe not,</hi> the feet went to
the Beere, the hand touched the
coffin, the power of the Deitie
raised the dead: What the heart
felt was secret to it selfe, the
tongue therefore expresses it in
words of comfort, <hi>Weepe not;</hi>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:3837:157"/>
Alas what are words to so
strong and iust passions? To
bid her not to weepe that had
lost her only sonne, was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her to be miserable, and
not feele it; to feele, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it: to regard, and yet to
smother it; Concealement doth
not remedie but aggrauate sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
That with the counsell
of not weeping therefore, she
might see cause of not weeping;
his hand seconds his tongue:
He arrests the coffin, and frees
the Prisoner; <hi>Young man I say
vnto thee arise;</hi> The Lord of life,
and death, speakes with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
No finite power could
haue said so without presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or with successe: That is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3837:157"/>
the voice that shall one day call
vp our vanished bodies from
those elements, into which they
are resolued, and raise them out
of their dust; Neither sea, nor
death, nor hell can offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their dead, when he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
them to be deliuered: Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
nature, what dost thou
shrinke at the possibilitie of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
when the God of
nature vndertakes it? It is no
more hard for that almightie
Word which gaue being vnto
all things, to say, <hi>Let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,</hi>
then, <hi>Let them be made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doe not see our Sauiour
stretching himselfe vpon the
dead corps, as <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Elisha,</hi>
vpon the sonnes of the Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3837:158"/>
and Sareptan, nor knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe, and praying by the
Beere, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Dorcas,</hi> but
I heare him so speaking to the
dead, as if he were aliue, and so
speaking to the dead that by the
word he makes him aliue, <hi>I say
vnto thee, arise;</hi> Death hath no
power to bid that man lie still,
whom the Sonne of God bids
<hi>Arise.</hi> Immediatly he that was
dead sate vp. So at the sound
of the last trumpet by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the same voice, we shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
out of the dust, and stand
vp glorious; this mortall shall
put on immortalitie, this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
incorruption; This bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
shall not be buried, but
sowne; and at our day shall
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3837:158"/>
therefore spring vp with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
increase of glorie; How
comfortlesse, how desperate
should be our lying downe, if it
were not for this assurance of
rising? And now, behold, lest
our weake faith should stagger
at the assent to so great a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
he hath alreadie by what
he hath done, giuen vs tastes of
what he will doe; The power
that can raise one man, can raise
a thousand, a million, a world;
no power can raise one but that
which is infinite; and that
which is infinite admits of no
limitation; Vnder the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
God raised one by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi>
another by <hi>Elisha</hi> liuing, a
third by <hi>Elisha</hi> dead; By the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3837:159"/>
hand of the Mediator of the
new Testament he raised here
the sonne of the widow, the
daughter of <hi>Iairus, Lazarus,</hi> and,
in attendance of his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
he made a gaole-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of holy prisoners, at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.
He raises the daughter
of <hi>Iairus</hi> from her bed; this
widowes sonne from his coffin;
<hi>Lazarus</hi> from his graue, the dead
saints of Ierusalem from their
rottennesse, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
no degree of death can
hinder the efficacie of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
command; He that
keepes the keyes of death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
only make way for himselfe
through the common hall, and
outer-roomes, but through the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3837:159"/>
inwardest, and most reserued
closets of darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Me thinkes I see this young
man who was thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
awaked from his deadly
sleepe, wiping and rubbing
those eies that had beene shut
vp in death; and descending
from the Beere, wrapping his
winding sheet about his loines,
cast himselfe downe in a passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
thankfulnesse, at the feet of
his Almightie restorer; adoring
that diuine power which had
commanded his soule backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to her forsaken lodging;
and though I heare not what
he said, yet I dare say they were
words of praise and wonder,
which his returned soule first
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3837:160"/>
vttered; It was the mother
whom our Sauiour pittied in
this act, not the sonne; (who
now forced from his quiet rest
must twice passe through the
gates of death.) As for her sake
therefore he was raised, so to her
hands was he deliuered; that she
might acknowledge that soule
giuen to her, not to the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor:
Who cannot feele the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
and extasie of ioy
that was in this reuiued mother,
when her sonne now salutes her
from out of another world?
And both receiues and giues
gratulations of his new life?
How suddenly were al the tears
of that mournfull traine dried
vp with a ioyfull astonishment?
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3837:160"/>
How soone is that funerall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
turned into a new Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
feast? What striuing was
here to salute the late carcasse of
their returned neighbour? What
awfull and admiring lookes
were cast vpon that Lord of
life, who seeming homely, was
approued omnipotent? How
gladly did euery tongue cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
both the worke, and the
author? <hi>A great Prophet is raised
vp amongst vs, and God hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
his people.</hi> A Prophet was
the hiest name they could finde
for him whom they saw like
themselues in shape, aboue
themselues in power; They
were not yet acquainted with
God manifested in the flesh;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3837:161"/>
This miracle might well haue
assured them of more then a
Prophet; but he that raised the
dead man from the Beere would
not suddenly raise these dead
hearts from the graue of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie;
they shall see reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to know that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
who was raised vp to
them, was the God that now vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
them, and at last should
doe as much for them as he had
done for the young man,
raise them from death to
life, from dust to
glorie.</p>

he is; It was some great Peere,

was now a suitor to him for his

is no defence against afflictions:
We men forbeare the mightie;
Disease and death know no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

would be too rich; why should

This noble Ruler, listens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christs returne into Galile;
The most eminent amongst
men will be glad to harken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ in their necessitie:
Happie was it for him that his
sonne was sicke; he had not else
beene acquainted with his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
his soule had continued
sicke of ignorance, and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe;
Why else doth our good
God send vs paine, losses, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
but that hee may bee
sought to? Are we afflicted,
whither should we goe but to
Cana, to seeke Christ? whither
but to the Cana of heauen,
where our water of sorrow is
turned to the wine of gladnesse,
to that omnipotent Physitian,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3837:163"/>
who healeth all our infirmities;
that we may once say, <hi>It is good
for me that I was afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was about a daies iourney
from Capernaum to Cana;
Thence hither did this Courtier
come for the cure of his sonnes
feuer; What paines euen the
greatest can be content to take
for bodily health? No way is
long, no labour tedious to the
desirous: Our soules are sicke
of a spirituall feuer, labouring
vnder the cold fit of infidelitie,
and the hote fit of selfe-loue;
and we sit still at home, and see
them languish vnto death.</p>
                  <p>This Ruler was neither faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
nor faithfull; Had he beene
quite faithlesse, he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3837:163"/>
such paines to come to
Christ. Had he beene faithfull,
he had not made this suit to
Christ, when he was come,
<hi>Come downe, and heale my sonne, ere
he die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come downe, as if Christ
could not haue cured him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
Ere he die, as if that power
could not haue raised him being
dead; how much difference was
here betwixt the Centurion, and
the Ruler; That came for his
seruant, this for his sonne. This
sonne was not more aboue that
seruant, then the faith which
sued for the seruant surpassed
that which sued for the sonne;
The one can say, <hi>Master come
not vnder my roofe, for I am not
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3837:164"/>
worthy, only speake the word; and my
seruant shall be whole;</hi> The other
can say, Master, either come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my roofe, or my sonne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be whole. <hi>Heale my sonne,</hi>
had beene a good suit, for Christ
is the only Physitian for all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases;
but, <hi>Come downe, and heale
him,</hi> was to teach God how
to worke.</p>
                  <p>It is good reason that he
should challenge the right of
prescribing to vs, who are euery
way his owne; it is presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in vs to stint him vnto our
formes: An expert workman
cannot abide to be taught by a
nouice; how much lesse shall
the all-wise God indure to be
directed by his creature? This
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3837:164"/>
is more then if the patient
should take vpon him to giue a
Recipe to the Physitian: That
God would giue vs grace is a
beseeming suit, but to say, Giue
it me by prosperitie, is a saucie
motion.</p>
                  <p>As there is faithfulnesse in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the end, so modestie and
patience in referring the meanes
to the author. In spirituall
things God hath acquainted vs
with the meanes whereby he
will worke, euen his owne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
ordinances; Vpon th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

because they haue his owne
promise, we may call absolutely
for a blessing; In all others, there
is no reason that beggers should
be choosers; He who doth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3837:165"/>
whatsoeuer he will, must doe it
how he will; It is for vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
not to appoint.</p>
                  <p>He who came to complaine
of his sonnes sicknesse, heares
of his owne, <hi>Except ye see signes
and wonders, yee will not beleeue.</hi>
This noble man was (as is like)
of Capernaum; There had
Christ often preached; there was
one of his chiefe residences: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this man had heard our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
oft, or might haue done;
yet because Christs miracles
came to him only by heare-say
(for as yet we finde none at all
wrought where he preached
most) therefore the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues
not enough; but so speaks
to Christ as to some ordinarie
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3837:165"/>
Physitian, <hi>Come downe and
heale;</hi> It was the common dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
of the Iewes, incredulitie;
which no receit could heale but
wonders; A wicked and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
generation seekes signes.
Had they not beene wilfully
gracelesse; there was alreadie
proofe enough of the Messias;
the miraculous conception and
life of the fore-runner; <hi>Zacharies</hi>
dumbnesse; The attestation of
Angels, the apparition of the
Starre, the iourney of the Sages,
the vision of the Shepherds, the
testimonies of <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi>
the prophesies fulfilled, the
voice from heauen at his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
the diuine words that he
spake; and yet they must haue
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3837:166"/>
all made vp with miracles;
which though he be not vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to giue at his owne times,
yet he thinkes much to be tied
vnto, at theirs; Not to beleeue
without signes, was a signe of
stubborne hearts.</p>
                  <p>It was a foule fault, and a
dangerous one; <hi>Ye will not beleeue:</hi>
What is it that shall condemne
the world but vnbeleefe? What
can condemne vs without it?
No sinne can condemne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant,
Repentance is a fruit of
faith; where true faith is then,
there can be no condemnation;
as there can be nothing but
condemnation without it. How
much more foule in a noble Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaite,
that had heard the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3837:166"/>
of so diuine a Teacher?
The greater light we haue, the
more shame it is for vs to
stumble.</p>
                  <p>Oh what shall become of vs,
that reele and fall in the cleerest
Sun-shine that euer looked
forth vpon any Church? Be
mercifull to our sinnes, ô God,
and say any thing of vs, rather,
then, <hi>Ye will not beleeue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Sauiour tells him of his
vnbeleefe; he feeles not himselfe
sicke of that disease; All his
minde is on his dying sonne;
As easily doe we complaine of
bodily griefes, as we are hardly
affected with spirituall. Oh the
meeknesse and mercy of this
Lambe of God; When wee
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3837:167"/>
would haue lookt that he
should haue punished this suitor
for not beleeuing, he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
to him, that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
<hi>Goe thy way, thy sonne liueth.</hi>
If we should measure our hopes
by our owne worthinesse, there
were no expectation of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
but if we shall measure
them by his bountie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
there can be no doubt of
preuailing. As some tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that giues the brest to her
vnquiet childe, in stead of the
rod, so deales he with our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersnesses.</p>
                  <p>How God differences men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to no other conditions,
then of their faith! The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions
seruant was sicke, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3837:167"/>
sonne; The Centurion doth
not sue vnto Christ to come;
only saies, <hi>My seruant is sicke of a
Palsie;</hi> Christ answers him, <hi>I will
come, and heale him:</hi> The Ruler
sues vnto Christ that he would
come, and heale his sonne,
Christ will not goe; only saies,
<hi>Goe thy way, thy sonne liues;</hi> Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things carrie no respect
with God; The Image of that
diuine Maiestie shining inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the graces of the soule, is
that which wins loue from him
in the meanest estate; The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions
faith therfore could doe
more then the Rulers great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and that faithfull mans
seruant hath more regard then
this great mans sonne.</p>

                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:3837:168"/>
The Rulers request was, <hi>Come
and heale;</hi> Christs answer was,
<hi>Goe thy way, thy sonne liues;</hi> Our
mercifull Sauiour meets those
in the end, whom he crosses in
the way: How sweetly doth
he correct our praiers, and
whiles he doth not giue vs what
we aske, giues vs better then we
asked.</p>
                  <p>Iustly doth he forbeare to
goe downe with this Ruler, lest
he should confirme him in an
opinion of measuring his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by conceits of localitie, and
distance; but he doth that in
absence, for which his presence
was required with a repulse;
<hi>Thy sonne liueth;</hi> giuing a greater
demonstration of his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:3837:168"/>
then was craued; How
oft doth hee not heare to
our will; that he may heare vs
to our aduantage? The chosen
vessell would be rid of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he heares of a supplie of
grace; The sickeman askes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,
receiues patience: life, and
receiues glorie: Let vs aske
what we thinke best, let him
giue what he knowes best.</p>
                  <p>With one word doth Christ
heale two Patients, the sonne,
and the father, the sonnes feuer,
the fathers vnbeleefe; That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratiue
word of our Sauiour
was not without the intention
of a triall; Had not the Ruler
gone home satisfied with that
intimation of his sonnes life,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3837:169"/>
and recouerie, neither of them
had beene blessed with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse:
Now the newes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
meets him one halfe
of the way; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
somewhat ere he came,
and more when hee went,
grew to more faith in the
way; and when he came
home, inlarged his faith to all
the skirts of his familie; A
weake faith may be true, but
a true faith is growing: Hee
that boasts of a full stature
in the first moment of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
may presume, but doth
not beleeue.</p>
                  <p>Great men cannot want cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
their example swaies some,
their authoritie more; they
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:3837:169"/>
cannot goe to either of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worlds alone; In vaine
doe they pretend power ouer
others, who labour not

our peace might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
his perfect vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
wheresoeuer hee met
with the Prince of darknesse he
foiled him, he eiected him; He
found him in heauen, thence
did he throw him headlong;
and verified his Prophet, <hi>I haue
cast thee out of mine holy mountaine;</hi>
And if the Deuils left their first
habitation, it was because (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Deuils) they could not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3837:170"/>
keepe it; Their estate indeed
they might haue kept, and did
not; their habitation they
would haue kept, and might
not; How art thou falne from
heauen ô Lucifer? He found
him in the heart of man; (for in
that closet of God did the euill
spirit after his exile from heauen
shrowd himselfe; Sinne gaue
him possession, which he kept
with a willing violence) thence
he casts him by his word, and
spirit; He found him tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
in the bodies of some pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
men, and with power
commands the vncleane spirits
to depart.</p>
                  <p>This act is for no hand but
his: When a strong man keeps
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:3837:171"/>
possession, none but a stronger
can remoue it: In voluntarie
things the strongest may yeeld
to the weakest; <hi>Sampson</hi> to a
<hi>Dalilah;</hi> but in violent, euer the
mightiest carries it; A spirituall
nature must needs be in ranke
aboue a bodily; neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
power be aboue a spirit, but
the God of spirits.</p>
                  <p>No otherwise is it in the
mentall possession; Where euer
sinne is, there Satan is; As on
the contrarie, whosoeuer is
borne of God, the seed of God
remaines in him; That euill one
not only is, but rules in the sons
of disobedience: in vaine shall
we trie to eiect him, but by the
diuine power of the Redeemer;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3837:171"/>
For this cause the Sonne of God
was manifested, that he might
destroy the workes of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill;
Doe we finde our selues
haunted with the familiar De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
of Pride, selfe-loue, sensuall
desires, vnbeleefe? None but
thou, ô Sonne of the euer-liuing
God, can free our bosomes of
these hellish guests; Oh cleanse
thou me from my secret sinnes,
and keepe me that presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sinnes preuaile not ouer
me. O Sauiour, it is no Paradox
to say that thou castest out
more Deuils now, then thou
didst whiles thou wert vpon
earth; It was thy word, <hi>When I
am lifted vp, I will draw all men
vnto me;</hi> Satan weighes downe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3837:172"/>
at the feet, thou pullest at the
head, yea at the heart; In euery
conuersion which thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest,
there is a dispossession.
Conuert me, ô Lord, and I shall
bee conuerted; I know thy
meanes are now no other then
ordinarie; if we expect to be
dispossessed by miracle, it would
be a miracle if euer we were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed;
Oh let thy Gospell
haue the perfect worke in me, so
only shall I be deliuered from
the powers of darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can be said to be
dumbe, but what naturally
speakes; nothing can speake na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
but what hath the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of speech; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
spirits want, they can no
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3837:172"/>
otherwise speake vocally, then
as they take voices to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
in taking bodies; This
deuill was not therefore dumbe
in his nature, but in his effect;
The man was dumbe by the
operation of that deuill, which
possessed him; and now the
action is attributed to the spirit,
which was subiectiuely in the
man; It is not you that speake,
saith our Sauiour, but the spirit
of your Father that speaketh
in you.</p>
                  <p>As it is in bodily diseases, that
they doe not infect vs alike,
some seaze vpon the humors,
others vpon the spirits; some
assault the braine, others the
heart, or lungs; so in bodily and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3837:173"/>
spirituall possessions; In some
the euill spirit takes away their
senses, in some their limms, in
some, their inward faculties;
like as spiritually they affect to
moue vs vnto seuerall sinnes;
One to lust, another to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
or ambition, another
to crueltie, and their names
haue distinguished them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these various effects:
This was a dumbe deuill; which
yet had possessed not the tongue
only of this man, but his eare;
nor that only, but (as it seemes)
his eies too.</p>
                  <p>O suttle and tyrannous spirit,
that obstructs all waies to the
soule: that keeps out all meanes
of grace both from the doores,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3837:173"/>
and windowes of the heart; yea
that stops vp all passages whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of ingresse, or egresse; Of
ingresse at the eie, or eare; of
egresse at the mouth; that there
might bee no capacitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse.</p>
                  <p>What holy vse is thereof our
tongue but to praise our Maker,
to confesse our sins, to informe
our brethren? How rife is this
dumbe Deuill euery-where,
whiles he stops the mouthes of
Christians from these vsefull
and necessarie duties?</p>
                  <p>For what end hath man those
two priueledges aboue his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
creatures, Reason, and
Speech, but, that, as by the one
he may conceiue of the great
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:3837:174"/>
workes of his Maker, which
the rest cannot, so by the other
he may expresse what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues,
to the honour of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
both of them, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
And why are all other
creatures said to praise God, and
bidden to praise him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they doe it by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
by the expression of
man? If the heauens declare
the glory of God, how doe they
it but to the eies, and by the
tongue of that man, for whom
they were made? It is no small
honour whereof the enuious
spirit shall robbe his Maker, if
he can close vp the mouth of
his only rationall, and vocall
creature; and turne the best of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3837:174"/>
his workmanship into a dumbe
Idoll, that hath a mouth and
speakes not; <hi>Lord open thou my
lips, and my mouth shall shew forth
thy praise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Praise is not more necessarie
then complaint; praise of God,
then complaint of our selues,
whether to God, or men; The
only amends we can make to
God, when we haue not had
the grace to auoid sinne, is to
confesse the sinne we haue not
auoided: This is the sponge
that wipes out all the blots and
blurrs of our liues; If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
our sinnes, he is faithfull
and iust to forgiue vs our sins,
and to cleanse vs from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:3837:175"/>
                     <hi>That cunning man-slayer
knowes there is no way to
purge the sicke soule, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by casting out the vicious
humor wherewith it is clogged;
and therefore holds the lips
close, that the heart may not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden
it selfe by so wholsome
euacuation.</hi> When I kept silence,
my bones consumed; For day and
night thy hand, ô Lord, was heauie
vpon me; my moisture is turned into
the drought of Summer; O let me
confesse against my selfe my wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
vnto thee, that thou maist for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
the punishment of my sinne.</p>
                  <p>We haue a tongue for God,
when we praise him; for our
selues, when we pray, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse;
for our brethren, when
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3837:175"/>
we speake the truth for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
which if we hold
backe in vnrighteousnesse, we
yeeld vnto that dumbe Deuill:
where doe we not see that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
spirit? He is on the Bench,
when the mute, or partiall Iudge
speakes not for truth, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
He is in the pulpit, when
the Prophets of God smother,
or halue, or adulterate the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of their master; He is at
the barre, when irreligious Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
dare lend an oath to feare,
to hope, to gaine: He is in the
market, when godlesse chapmen
for their pennie sell the truth,
and their soule; Hee is in the
common conuersation of men,
when the tongue belies the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3837:176"/>
heart, flatters the guiltie, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
reproofes euen in the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
crimes: O thou, who only
art stronger then that strong
one, cast him out of the hearts,
and mouthes of men; <hi>It is time
for thee, Lord, to worke, for they haue
destroyed thy law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it might well appeare
this impediment was not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
so soone as the man is freed
from the spirit, his tongue is free
to his speech: The effects of
spirits as they are wrought, so
they cease at once. If the Sonne
of God doe but remoue our
spirituall possession, we shall
presently brake forth into the
praise of God, into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our vilenesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:3837:176"/>
the profession of truth.</p>
                  <p>But, what strange varietie doe
I see in the spectators of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
some wondring, others
censuring, a third sort tempting,
a fourth applauding; There
was neuer man, or action, but
was subiect to varietie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions:
What man could
be so holy, as he that was God?
What act could be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
then the dispossession of an
euill spirit? yet this man, this
act passeth these differences of
interpretation: What can we
doe to vndergoe but one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
If we giue almes, and fast;
some will magnifie our charity,
and deuotion, others will taxe
our hypocrisie: If we giue not,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3837:177"/>
some will condemne our hard-heartednesse,
others will allow
our care of iustice; If we preach
plainly, to some it will sauour
of a carelesse slubbering, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of a mortified sinceritie;
Elaborately, some will tax our
affectation, others will applaud
our diligence in dressing the
delicate viands of God; What
maruel is it, if it be thus with our
imperfection, when it fared no
otherwise with him that was
puritie, and righteousnesse it
selfe? The austere fore-runner
of Christ came neither eating
nor drinking, they say, <hi>He hath
a Deuill;</hi> The sonne of man
came eating and drinking, they
say, <hi>This man is a glutton, a friend
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3837:177"/>
of Publicans and sinners:</hi> and here
one of his holy acts carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at once wonder, censure,
doubt, celebration. There is
no way safe for a man but to
square his actions by the right
rule of iustice, of charitie; and
then let the world haue leaue to
spend their glosses at pleasure.
It was an heroicall resolution of
the chosen vessell, <hi>I passe very
little to be iudged of you, or of
mans day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I maruell not if the people
maruelled; for here were foure
wonders in one; The blinde
saw, the deafe heard, the dumbe
spake, the demoniacke is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered;
Wonder was due to so
rare, and powerfull a worke,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3837:178"/>
and, if not this, nothing; We
can cast away admiration vpon
the poore deuices, or actiuities
of men, how much more vpon
the extraordinarie workes of
omnipotencie? Whoso knowes
the frame of heauen and earth
shall not much be affected with
the imperfect effects of fraile
humanitie; but shall with no
lesse rauishment of soule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the miraculous
workes of the same almightie
hand. Neither is the spirituall
eiection worthy of any meaner
intertainment; Raritie and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
are wont to cause won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
There are many things
which haue wonder in their
worth, and leese it in their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3837:178"/>
there are some which
haue it in their strangenesse, and
leese it in their facilitie; Both
meet in this. To see men haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yea possessed with a dumbe
Deuill is so frequent, that it is a
iust wonder to finde a man free;
but to finde the dumbe spirit
cast out of a man, and to heare
him praising God, confessing
his sinnes, teaching others the
sweet experiments of mercie,
deserues iust admiration. If the
Cynick sought in the market
for a man amongst men, well
may we seeke amongst men, for
a conuert. Neither is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
lesse then the rarenesse:
The strong man hath the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
all passages are blockt
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3837:179"/>
vp, all helpes barred, by the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie
of our nature; If any
soule be rescued from these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
wickednesses, it is the
praise of him that doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
alone.</p>
                  <p>But whom doe I see won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring?
The multitude; The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
beholders follow that
act with wonder, which the
learned Scribes entertaine with
obloquie: God hath reuealed
those things to babes, which he
hath hid from the wise, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
With what scorne did
those great Rabbins speake of
these sonnes of the earth, <hi>This
people that knowes not the Law is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed?</hi>
Yet the mercie of God
makes an aduantage of their
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3837:179"/>
simplicitie; in that they are
therefore lesse subiect to cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and incredulitie; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
his iustice causes the
proud knowledge of the other
to lie as a blocke in their way,
to the readie assent vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
power of the Messias; Let
the pride of glorious aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
disdaine the pouertie of the
clients of the Gospell; it shall
not repent vs to goe to heauen
with the vulgar, whiles their
great ones goe in state to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>The multitude wondered;
Who censured but Scribes great
Doctors of the law, of the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the Iewes? What Scribes,
but those of Ierusalem, the most
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3837:180"/>
eminent Academie of Iudea?
These were the men, who out
of their deepe-reputed iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cast these foule aspersions
vpon Christ. Great wits oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mis-lead both the owners
and followers; How many shall
once wish they had beene borne
dullards, yea idiots, when they
shall finde their wit to haue bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them out of heauen? Where
is the Scribe, where is the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this world? Hath not
God made the wisdome of the
world foolishnesse? Say the
world what it will, a dramme of
holinesse is worth a pound of
wit; Let others censure with
the Scribes, let me wonder with
the multitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:3837:180"/>
What could malice say worse,
<hi>He casteth out Deuils through Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub
the Prince of Deuils?</hi> The
Iewes well knew that the Gods
of the heathen were no other
then Deuils; Amongst whom
for that the <hi>Lord of Files</hi> (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
whether for the concourse
of flies to the abundance of his
sacrifices, or for his aide implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against the infestation of
those swarmes) was held the
chiefe, therefore they stile him,
<hi>The Prince of Deuils.</hi> There is a
subordination of spirits; some
hier in degree, some inferiour to
others; Our Sauiour himselfe
tels vs of the Deuill, and his
Angels; Messengers are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to those that send them:
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:3837:181"/>
The seuen Deuils that entred
into the swept, and garnished
house, were worse then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
Neither can Principalities,
and Powers, and Gouernours,
and Princes of the darknesse of
this world designe other then
seuerall rankes of euill Angels;
There can be no being, without
some kinde of order, there can
be no order in paritie; If wee
looke vp into heauen, there is
<hi>The King of Gods, The Lord of
Lords;</hi> hier then the hiest. If to
the earth, There are Monarchs,
Kings, Princes, Peeres, people;
If we looke downe to hell,
<hi>There is the Prince of Deuils;</hi> They
labour for confusion that call
for paritie; What should the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:3837:181"/>
Church doe with such a forme,
as is not exemplified in heauen,
in earth, in hell?</p>
                  <p>One deuill (according to
their supposition) may be vsed
to cast out another: How farre
the command of one spirit ouer
another may extend, it is a secret
of infernall state, too deepe for
the inquirie of men: The thing
it selfe is apparent; vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
and precontracted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
one giues way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the common aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
As we see it in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of Cheaters, and
Cut-purses; one doth the fact,
another is feed to bring it out,
and to procure restitution: both
are of the trade; both conspire
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:3837:182"/>
to the fraud; the actor falls not
out with the reuealer; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
with him that cunning
spoile.</p>
                  <p>One malicious miscreant sets
the Deuill on worke to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
of disease, or death; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
vpon agreement, for a
further spirituall gaine, takes
him off; There is a Deuill in
both; And if there seeme more
bodily fauour, there is no lesse
spirituall danger in the latter;
In the one Satan wins the agent,
the suitor in the other; It will be
no cause of discord in hell, that
one deuill giues ease to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which another tormented,
that both may triumph in the
gaine of a soule. O God, that
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3837:182"/>
any creature which beares thine
Image, should not abhorre to
be beholden to the powers of
hell for aid, for aduice? <hi>Is it not
because there is not a God in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
that men goe to inquire of
the god of Ekron?</hi> Can men be
so sottish to thinke that the
vowed enemie of their soules
can offer them a baite, without
an hooke? What euill is there
in the citie which the Lord hath
not done, what is there which
he cannot as easily redresse: He
wounds, he heales againe; And
if he will not, it is the Lord, let
him doe what seemes good in
his eies; If he doe not deliuer
vs, he will crowne our faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in a patient perseuerance.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:3837:183"/>
The wounds of a God are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the salues of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Was it possible that the wit of
Enuie could deuise so hie a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Beelzebub was a God of the
heathen; therefore herein they
accuse him for an Idolater; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elzebub
was a Deuill to the
Iewes, therefore they accuse him
for a coniurer; Beelzebub was
the chiefe of Deuils, therefore
they accuse him for an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorcist,
for the worst kinde of
Magician; Some professors of
this blacke Art, though their
worke be deuillish, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to doe it in the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and will presumptuously
seeme to doe that by command,
which is secretly transacted by
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3837:183"/>
agreement; the Scribes accuse
Christ of a direct compact with
the Deuill; and suppose both a
league and familiaritie, which
by the law of <hi>Moses</hi> (in the very
hand of a <hi>Saul</hi>) was no other
then deadly; Yea so deepe doth
this wound reach, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
searching it to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
findes no lesse in it then
the sinne against the Holy-ghost;
inferring hereupon that
dreadfull sentence of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiblenesse
of that sinne vnto
death: And if this horrible
crimination were cast vpon
thee, ô Sauiour, in whom the
Prince of this world found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
what wonder is it if we
thy sinfull seruants be branded
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:3837:184"/>
on all sides with euill tongues?</p>
                  <p>Yea (which is yet more) how
plaine is it that these men forced
their tongue to speake this slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
against their owne heart?
Else, this blasphemie had beene
only against the sonne of man,
not against the holy Ghost; but
now, that the searcher of hearts
findes it to be no lesse then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the blessed spirit of God,
the spight must needs be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
their malice doth wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crosse their conscience. Enuie
neuer regards how true, but
how mischieuous; So it may
gall, or kill, it cares little, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with truth, or falshood;
For vs, <hi>Blessed are we when men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
vs, and say all manner of euill of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3837:184"/>
vs, for the name of Christ;</hi> For
them: <hi>What reward shall be giuen
to thee, thou false tongue? Euen
sharpe arrowes with hote burning
coles;</hi> Yea those very coles of
hell from which thou wert en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled.</p>
                  <p>There was yet a third sort that
went a mid-way betwixt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and censure; These were
not so malicious as to impute
the miracle to a Satanicall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
they confesse it good,
but not enough; and therefore
vrge Christ to a further proofe;
<hi>Though thou hast cast out this dumbe
Deuill, yet this is no sufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy diuine power; Wee haue
yet seene nothing from thee like those
ancient miracles, of the times of our
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3837:185"/>
fore-fathers. Iosua caused the Sunne
to stand still; Elias brought fire
downe from heauen; Samuel astonisht
the people with thunder and raine in
the midst of haruest; If thou wouldst
command our beleefe, doe somewhat
like to these; The casting out of a
Deuill, shewes thee to haue some pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ouer hell; shew vs now, that thou
hast no lesse power ouer heauen.</hi>
There is a kinde of vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of desire, and insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
in infidelitie; it neuer
knowes when it hath euidence
enough; This which the Iewes
ouer-looked, was a more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
demonstration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
then that which they
desired. A Deuill was more then
a Meteor, or a parcell of an
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:3837:185"/>
element; to cast out a Deuill by
command, more then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
fire from heauen: Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
euer loues to be her owne
caruer.</p>
                  <p>No sonne can be more like
a father, then these Iewes to
their progenitors in the desert;
that there might be no feare of
degenerating into good, they
also of old tempted God in the
Wildernesse: First, they are
wearie of the Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and are readie to fall out
with God, and <hi>Moses,</hi> for their
stay in those fornaces: By ten
miraculous plagues they are
freed, and going out of those
confines; the Egyptians follow
them, the sea is before them;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:3837:186"/>
now they are more afflicted
with their libertie, then their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude;
The sea yeelds way, the
Egyptians are drowned; and
now, that they are safe on the
other shore, they tempt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God for water; The
rocke yeelds it them; then, no
lesse for bread and meat; God
sends them Manna, and Quailes,
they crie out of the food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
Their present enemies in
the way are vanquished, they
whine at the men of measures,
in the heart of Canaan; Nothing
from God but mercie; nothing
from them but Temptation.</p>
                  <p>Their true brood both in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and sinne had abundant
proofes of the Messiah; if curing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:3837:186"/>
the blinde, lame, diseased, deafe,
dumbe, eiecting deuils, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
the elements, raising the
dead could haue beene suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet still they must haue a
signe from heauen; and shut vp
in the stile of the Tempter, <hi>If
thou be the Christ.</hi> The gracious
heart is credulous; Euen where
it sees not, it beleeues; and where
it sees but a little, it beleeues a
great deale; Neither doth it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to prescribe vnto God
what, and how he shall worke;
but takes what it findes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueably
rests in what it takes.
Any miracle, no miracle serues
enough for their assent, who
haue built their faith vpon the
Gospell of the Lord Iesus.</p>

The condition was not in it

the Secretary-ship of God; Who

bountie of him that calleth vs?
Merits doe not carrie it in the

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3837:188"/>
his meere fauour. There sate
<hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican busie in
his Counting-house, reckoning
vp the summes of his Rentalls;
raking vp his arerages, and
wrangling for denied duties,
and did so little thinke of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
that he did not so much
as looke at his passage, but, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

and now thou goest pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
that way, that thou

mightst see, and call: Nothing
can be hid from that piercing
eie; one glance whereof hath
discerned a Disciple in the
clothes of a Publican; That
habit, that shop of extortion
cannot conceale from thee a
vessell of election; In all formes
thou knowest thine owne; and
in thine owne time shalt fetch
them out of the disguises of their
foule sins, or vnfit conditions;
What sawst thou, ô Sauiour, in
that Publican, that might either
allure thine eie, or not offend it?
What but an hatefull trade, an

                     <hi>Thy birth and natiuitie is of the

wast not salted at all; thou wast not
swadled at all; None eie pittied thee,
but thou wast cast out in the open
fields, to the loathing of thy person, in

when I passed by thee, and saw

<hi>Matthew</hi> the Euangelist tells vs

himselfe will not smother,

                  <p>That word was enough, <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

If any commoditie be

                  <p>Here was not a more cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thankfulnesse in the inuiter,
then a gracious humilitie in the

master, the Publican his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and is honoured with so
blessed a presence. I doe not
finde where Iesus was euer bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to any table, and refused;
If a Pharisee, if a Publican in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited
him, he made not daintie
to goe; Not for the pleasure of
the dishes; what was that to
him who began his worke in a
whole Lent of daies? But (as it
was his meat and drinke to doe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:3837:192"/>
the will of his Father,) for the
benefit of so winning a conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
If he sate with sinners,
he conuerted them; If with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts,
he confirmed and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them; If with the poore,
he sed them; If with the rich in
substance, he made them richer
in grace. At whose board did
he euer sit, and left not his host
a gainer? The poore Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
entertaines him, and
hath his water-pots filled with
wine: <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
him, and hath his table
honoured with the publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of a penitent sinner,
with the heauenly doctrine of
remission: <hi>Zacheus</hi> entertaines
him, saluation came that day to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:3837:192"/>
his house, with the author of it;
that presence made the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
a sonne of <hi>Abraham; Matthew</hi>
is recompenced for his feast
with an Apostle-ship: <hi>Martha,</hi>
and <hi>Mary</hi> entertaine him, and
besides diuine instruction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
their brother from the
dead; O Sauiour, whether thou
feast vs, or we feast thee, in both
of them is blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>Where a Publican is the Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
it is no maruell if the
guests be Publicans, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
whether they came alone
out of an hope of that mercie,
which they saw their fellow
had found; or whether <hi>Matthew</hi>
inuited them to be partners of
that plentifull grace, whereof
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:3837:193"/>
he had tasted, I inquire not:
Publicans and sinners will
flocke together; the one, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for their trade, the other for
their vicious life. Common
contempt hath wrought them
to an vnanimitie; and sends
them to seeke mutuall comfort
in that societie, which all others
held loathsome and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Moderate correction hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
and shameth the offender;
whereas a cruell seueritie makes
men desperate; and driues them
to those courses, whereby they
are more dangerously infected;
How many haue gone into the
prison faultie, and returned fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious?
If Publicans were not
sinners, they were no whit
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:3837:193"/>
beholden to their neighbours.</p>
                  <p>What a table full was here?
The Sonne of God beset with
Publicans, and sinners: O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
Publicans, and sinners, that
had found out their Sauiour;
Oh mercifull Sauiour, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
not Publicans and
sinners.</p>
                  <p>What sinner can feare to
kneele before thee, when he sees
Publicans and sinners sit with
thee? Who can feare to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
of thy meeknesse, and
mercy, which didst not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre,
to conuerse with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts
of men? Thou didst not

weeping vpon thy feet, nor the

Cananite crying to thee in the

nor the odious Publican,
nor the forswearing Disciple,
nor the persecutor of Disciples,
nor thine owne executioners,
how can we be vnwelcome to

as the consorts of these

                  <p>The squint-eid Pharisees look
a-crosse at all the actions of
Christ; where they should haue
admired his mercie, they cauill
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:3837:194"/>
at his holinesse; <hi>They said to his
Disciples; why eateth your master
with Publicans, and sinners?</hi> They
durst not say thus to the Master,
whose answer (they knew)
would soone haue conuinced
them; This winde (they hoped)
might shake the weake faith of
the Disciples; They speake
where they may be most likely
to hurt; All the crue of Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
instruments haue learnt this
craft of their old Tutor in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise:
Wee cannot reuerence
that man, whom we thinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy;
Christ had lost the hearts
of his followers, if they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the least suspicion of
his impuritie; which the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
of these enuious Pharisees
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:3837:195"/>
would faine insinuate; <hi>He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be worthy to be followed that is
vncleane; He cannot but be vncleane
that eateth with Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi>
Proud and foolish Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
ye fast whiles Christ eateth;
ye fast in your houses, whiles
Christ eateth in other mens; ye
fast with your owne, whiles
Christ feasts with sinners; but
if ye fast in pride, whiles Christ
eats in humilitie; if ye fast at
home, for merit, or popularitie,
whiles Christ feasts with sinners
for compassion, for edification,
for conuersion, your fast is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
his feast is holy, ye shall
haue your portion with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,

When these censurers thought
the Disciples had offended, they
speake not to them, but to their
Master; Why doe thy Disciples
that which is not lawfull?
now, when they thought Christ
offended, they speake not to
him, but to the Disciples; Thus,
like true make-bates they goe
about to make a breach in the
familie of Christ, by setting off
the one from the other; The
quicke cie of our Sauiour hath
soone espied the packe of their
fraud, and therefore he takes
the words out of the mouthes
of his Disciples, into his owne;
They had spoke of Christ to
the Disciples; Christ answers
for the Disciples concerning
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:3837:196"/>
himselfe, <hi>The whole need not the
Physitian, but the sicke.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the two qualities of
pride; scorne, and ouer-wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
these insolent Pharisees
ouer-rated their owne holinesse,
contemned the noted vnholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of others; As if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
were not tainted with
secret sinnes, as if others could
not be cleansed by repentance;
The searcher of hearts meets
with their arrogance, and findes
those iusticiaries sinfull, those
sinners iust; The spirituall
Physitian findes the sicknesse
of those sinners wholsome, the
health of those Pharisees despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
that, wholsome, because
it calls for the helpe of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3837:196"/>
this, desperate, because it
needs not. Euery soule is sicke;
those most, that feele it not;
Those that feele it, complaine,
those that complaine, haue
cure; those that feele it not,
shall finde themselues dying
ere they can wish to recouer.
Oh blessed Physitian, by whose
stripes we are healed, by whose
death we liue, happie are they
that are vnder thy hands, sicke,
as of sin, so of sorrow for sin; it
is as vnpossible they should die,
as it is vnpossible for thee to
want either skill, or power, or
mercy; Sin hath made vs sicke
vnto death, make thou vs but as

not alwaies: There is no master
so barbarous as to require of his
slaue a perpetuall vnintermitted
toyle; yet, though he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:3837:199"/>
eate, sleepe, rest, he is a
vassall still; If that wicked one
haue drawne vs to a customarie
perpetration of euill, and haue
wrought vs to a frequent itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same sinne, this is
gage enough for our seruitude,
matter enough for his tyrannie,
and insultation; He that would
be our tormentor alwaies,
cares only to be sometimes our
Tempter.</p>
                  <p>The possessed is bound, as
with the inuisible fetters of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
so with the materiall
chaines of the inhabitants;
What can bodily force preuaile
against a spirit? Yet they inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
this restraint of the man,
whether out of charitie, or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:3837:200"/>
Charitie, that he might
not hurt himselfe; Iustice, that
he might not hurt others; None
doe so much befriend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacke
as those that binde
him; Neither may the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
possessed be otherwise han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled;
for though this act of the
enemie be plausible, and, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
pleasant, yet there is
more danger in this deare, and
smiling tyrannie; Two sorts of
chaines are fit for outragious
sinners; Good lawes, vnpartiall
executions; That they may not
hurt, that they may not be hurt
to eternall death.</p>
                  <p>These yron chaines are no
sooner fast, then broken; There
was more then an humane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:3837:200"/>
in this disruption; It is not
hard to conceiue the vtmost of
nature, in this kinde of actions;
<hi>Sampson</hi> doth not breake the
cords, and ropes like a threed
of towe, but God by <hi>Sampson;</hi>
The man doth not breake these
chaines, but the spirit. How
strong is the arme of these euill
angels, how farre transcending
the ordinarie course of nature?
They are not called Powers for
nothing; what flesh and bloud
could but tremble at the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inequalitie of this match, if
herein the mercifull protection
of our God did not the rather
magnifie it selfe, that so much
strength, met with so much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
hath not preuailed against
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:3837:201"/>
vs: In spight of both we are in
safe hands; Hee that so easily
brake the yron fetters, can neuer
breake the adamantine chaine
of our faith; In vaine doe the
chafing billowes of hell beate
vpon that rocke, whereon we
are built; And though these
brittle chaines of earthly met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
be easily broken by him, yet
the sure-tempered chaine of
Gods eternall decree, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
breake; that almightie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter
of heauen, and earth, and
hell, hath chained him vp in
the bottomlesse pit, and hath so
restrained his malice, that (but,
for our good) wee cannot be
tempted; we cannot be foyled,
but for a glorious victorie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:3837:201"/>
Alas it is no otherwise with
the spiritually possessed; The
chaines of restraint are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
broken by the furie of
wickednesse; What are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
of ciuilitie, feare of God,
feare of men, wholsome lawes,
carefull executions to the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
licentious, but as cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs
to an harnet? Let these
wilde Demoniacks know, that
God hath prouided chaines for
them, that will hold, euen <hi>euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
chaines vnder darknesse;</hi>
these are such as must hold the
Deuils themselues (their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters)
vnto the iudgement of
the great day, how much more
those impotent vassals? Oh that
men would suffer themselues to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:3837:202"/>
be bound to their good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
by the sweet, and easie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances
of their dutie to
their God, and the care of their
owne soules, that so they might
rather be bound vp in the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of life.</p>
                  <p>It was not for rest, that these
chaines were torne off, but for
more motion; This prisoner
runs away from his friends, he
cannot run away from his Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor;
He is now carried into the
wildernesse; Not by meere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
force, but by internall
impulsion; Carried by the same
power that vnbound him, for
the oportunitie of his Tyrannie,
for the horror of the place, for
the affamishment of his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:3837:202"/>
for the auoidance of all meanes
of resistance. Solitarie deserts
are the delights of Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is
an vnwise zeale that moues vs
to doe that to our selues, in an
opinion of merit, and holinesse,
which the Deuill wishes to doe
to vs for a punishment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie
of tentation. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
spirit is for solitarinesse;
God is for societie; <hi>He dwells in
the assembly of his Saints, yea, there
he hath a delight to dwell;</hi> Why
should not we account it our
happinesse that we may haue
leaue to dwell, where the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all happinesse loues to
dwell?</p>
                  <p>There cannot be any miserie
incident into vs, whereof our
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:3837:203"/>
gracious Redeemer is not both
conscious, and sensible; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intreatie therefore of
the miserable Demoniack, or
suit of any friend; the God of
spirits takes pittie of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse;
and, from no motion
but his owne, commands the
ill spirit to come forth of the
man: O admirable precedent
of mercy, preuenting our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
exceeding our thoughts,
forcing fauours vpon our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence;
doing that for vs,
which we should, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
desire. If men vpon our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
solicitations would giue
vs their best aid, it were a iust
praise of their bountie, but it
well became thee, ô God of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:3837:203"/>
mercie, to goe without force, to
giue without suit; And doe
we thinke thy goodnesse is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
by thy glory? If thou
wert thus commiseratiue vpon
earth, art thou lesse in heauen?
How doest thou now take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all our complaints, of all
our infirmities? How doth
thine infinite pittie take order to
redresse them? What euill can
befall vs which thou knowest
not, feelest not, relieuest not?
How safe are we that haue such
a Guardian, such a Mediator in
heauen?</p>
                  <p>Not long before had our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
commanded the windes,
and waters, and they could not
but obey him; now, he speakes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:3837:204"/>
in the same Language to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
spirit; he intreats not, he
perswades not, he commands;
Command argues superioritie,
He only is infinitely stronger
then the strong one in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Else, where powers are
matcht, though with some ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie,
they tugge for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie;
and without a resistance
yeeld nothing. There are no
fewer sorts of dealing with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
then with men; Some haue
dealt with him by suit, as the old
Satanian heretickes, and the
present Indian Sauages, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to him, that he hurt not:
Others by couenant, condicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their seruice vpon his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
as Witches and Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3837:204"/>
Others by insinuation of
implicite compact, as charmers
and Figure-casters; Others by
adiuration, as the sonnes of <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi>
and moderne Exorcists, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
charging him by
an hier name then their owne;
None euer offred to deale with
Satan by a direct and primarie
command, but the God of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
The great Archangel, when
the strife was about the body of
<hi>Moses,</hi> commanded not, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated
rather, <hi>The Lord rebuke
thee, Satan;</hi> It is only the God
that made this spirit an Angel of
light, that can command him,
now that he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the Prince of darknesse. If
any created power dare to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:3837:205"/>
vsurpe a word of command, he
laughs at their presumption;
and knowes them his vassals
whom he dissembles to feare as
his Lords; It is thou only, ô Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
at whose becke those
stubburne Principalities of hell
yeeld, and tremble: no wicked
man can be so much a slaue to
Satan, as Satan is to thee; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of grace may defeat
that dominion of Satan; thy
rule is absolute, and capable of
no let. What need we to feare,
whiles we are vnder so omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
a commander? The
waues of the deepe rage horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
yet the Lord is stronger
then they; Let those Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and powers doe their worst;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3837:205"/>
Those mightie aduersaries are
vnder the command of him,
who loued vs so well as to bleed
for vs, What can we now doubt
of? His power, or his will?
How can we professe him a
God, and doubt of his power?
How can we professe him a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
and doubt of his will?
He, both can, and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
those infernall powers;
we are no lesse safe, then they are
malicious.</p>
                  <p>The Deuill saw Iesus by the
eies of the Demoniack; For the
same saw, that spake; but it was
the ill spirit, that said, <hi>I beseech
thee torment me not;</hi> It was sore
against his will that he saw so
dreadfull an obiect; The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3837:206"/>
power of Christ dragged
the foule spirit into his presence.
Guiltinesse would faine keepe
out of sight; The limmes of so
wofull an head shall once call
to the hills, and rockes to hide
them from the face of the
Lambe; such Lyon-like terror
is in that milde face, when it
lookes vpon wickednesse: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall it be one day the least
part of the torment of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to see the most louely
spectacle that heauen can afford:
He, from whom they fled in his
offers of grace, shall be so much
more terrible, as he was, and is
more gracious; I maruell not
therefore that the Deuill, when
he saw Iesus, cryed out; I could
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3837:206"/>
maruell that he fell downe, that
he worshipped him: That
which the proud spirit would
haue had Christ to haue done to
him, in his great duell, the same
he now doth vnto Christ, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
seruilely, forcedly; Who
shall henceforth bragge of the
externall homage he performes
to the Sonne of God, when he
sees Satan himselfe fall downe,
and worship? What comfort
can there be in that, which is
common to vs with Deuils;
who as they beleeue, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so they tremble, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
The outward bowing is
the body of the action, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the soule is the soule
of it; therein lies the difference
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3837:207"/>
from the counterfait stoopings
of wicked men, and spirits:
The religious heart <hi>serues the
Lord in feare, and reioyces in him with
trembling;</hi> What it doth is in
way of seruice; In seruice to his
Lord, whose soueraintie is his
comfort, and protection; In the
feare of a sonne, not of a slaue;
In a feare tempered with ioy;
In a ioy, but allaied with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
whereas the prostration
of wicked men, and deuils is
only an act of forme, or of
force; as to their Iudge, as to
their tormentor, not as to their
Lord; in meere seruilitie, not in
reuerence, in an vncomfortable
dulnesse, without all delight;
in a perfect horror, without
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3837:207"/>
capacitie of ioy; These worship
without thankes, because they
fall downe without the true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of worship.</p>
                  <p>Who so maruells to see the
Deuill vpon his knees, would
much more maruell to heare
what came from his mouth;
<hi>Iesa the sonne of the most high God;</hi>
A confession, which if wee
should heare without the name
of the author, we should aske,
from what Saint it came. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the same name giuen to
Christ by the Deuill, which was
formerly giuen him by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
<hi>Thou shalt call his name Iesus;</hi>
That awfull name, whereat eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
knee shall bow, in heauen, in
earth, and vnder the earth, is
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3837:208"/>
called vpon, by this prostrate
Deuill: and lest that should
not import enough, (since o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue beene honoured by
this name in Type,) he addes,
for full distinction, <hi>The Sonne of
the most hie God,</hi> The good Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophenician,
and blinde <hi>Barti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus</hi>
could say, The <hi>Sonne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi>
It was well to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the true descent of his
pedigree, according to the flesh;
but this infernall spirit lookes
aloft, and fetcheth his line out
of the most heauens, <hi>The Sonne
of the most hie God;</hi> The famous
confession of the prime Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
(which honoured him with
a new name to immortalitie,)
was no other then, <hi>Thou art the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3837:208"/>
Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God;</hi>
and what other doe I heare
from the lips of a fiend? None
more diuine words could
fall from the hiest Saint; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hinders but that the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
miscreant on earth, yea the
foulest Deuill in hell may
speake holily: It is no passing of
iudgement vpon loose senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
So <hi>Peter</hi> should haue beene
cast for a Satan, in denying, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing,
cursing; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
should haue beene set vp for
a Saint, in confessing, <hi>Iesus the
Sonne of the most hie God;</hi> Fond
hypocrite, that pleasest thy selfe,
in talking well, heare this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and when thou canst speake
better then he; looke to fare
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:3837:209"/>
better; but in the meane time
know, that a smooth tongue,
and a foule heart, carries away
double iudgements.</p>
                  <p>Let curious heads dispute
whether the Deuil knew Christ
to be God; In this I dare beleeue
himselfe, though in nothing
else; he knew what he beleeued,
he beleeued what he confessed,
<hi>Iesus the Sonne of the most hie God;</hi>
To the confusion of those semi-Christians,
that haue either held
doubtfully, or ignorantly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
or blasphemously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
what the very Deuils haue
professed. How little can a bare
speculation auaile vs in these
cases of Diuinitie? So farre this
Deuill hath attained, to no ease,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:3837:209"/>
no comfort. Knowledge alone
doth but puffe vp; it is our loue
that edifies; If there be not a
sense of our sure interest in this
Iesus, a power to applie his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and obedience, we are no
whit the safer, no whit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
only we are so much the
wiser, to vnderstand who shall
condemne vs.</p>
                  <p>This peece of the clause was
spoken like a Saint, <hi>Iesus the Son
of the most hie God;</hi> the other
peece, like a Deuill, <hi>What haue I
to doe with thee?</hi> If the disclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were vniuersall, the latter
words would impugne the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for whiles he confesses Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to be the Sonne of the most
hie God, he withall confesses
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3837:210"/>
his owne ineuitable subiection;
Wherefore would he beseech, if
he were not obnoxious; Hee
cannot, he dare not say, <hi>What
hast thou to doe with mee;</hi> but,
<hi>What haue I to doe with thee;</hi> Others
indeed I haue vexed, thee I feare;
in respect then of any violence,
of any personall prouocation,
<hi>What haue I to doe with thee?</hi>
And doest thou aske, ô thou
euill spirit, what thou hast
to doe with Christ, whiles thou
vexest a seruant of Christ? Hast
thou thy name from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and yet so mistakest him
whom thou confessest, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be done to him,
but what immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
his owne person? Heare
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3837:210"/>
that great, and iust Iudge sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing
vpon his dreadfull Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall;
<hi>In as much as thou didst
it vnto one of these little ones,
thou didst it vnto mee;</hi> It is an idle
misprision to seuer the sense of
an iniurie done to any of the
members, from the head.</p>
                  <p>He that had humilitie enough
to kneele to the Sonne of God,
hath boldnesse enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate,
<hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vs before our time?</hi> Whether
it were, that Satan, who vseth
to inioy the torment of sinners,
whose musicke it is to heare our
shriekes, and gnashings, held it
no small peece of his torment,
to be restrained in the exercise
of his tyrannie; Or, whether the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3837:211"/>
very presence of Christ were his
racke: For, the guiltie spirit
proiecteth terrible things, and
cannot behold the Iudge, or the
executioner without a renouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of horror, Or, whether (as
himselfe professeth) he were
now in a fearefull expectation
of being commanded downe
into the deepe, for a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of actuall torment, which
he thus deprecates.</p>
                  <p>There are tortures appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the very spirituall natures
of euill Angels; Men, that are
led by sense, haue easily granted
the body subiect to torment,
who yet, haue not so readily
conceiued this incident to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
substance: The holy
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:3837:211"/>
Ghost hath not thought it fit to
acquaint vs with the particular
manner of these inuisible acts,
rather willing that we should
herein feare, then inquire; but,
as all matters of faith, though
they cannot be proued by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(for that they are in an hier
sphere) yet afford an answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to stop the mouth of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that dares barke against
them, (since truth cannot be
opposite to it selfe) so, this of
the sufferings of spirits; There
is therefore both an intentionall
torment incident to spirits, and
a reall: For, as in blessednesse
the good spirits finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
ioyned vnto the chiefe
good; and, hereupon feele a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3837:212"/>
perfect loue of God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
ioy in him, and rest
in themselues, so contrarily, the
euill spirits perceiue themselues
eternally excluded from the
presence of God, and see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
setled in a wofull dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and, from the sense of
this separation arises an horror
not to be expressed, not to be
conceiued; How many men
haue we knowne to torment
themselues with their owne
thoughts? There needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gibbet then that, which
their troubled spirit hath erected
in their owne heart: and if some
paines begin at the body, and
from thence afflict the soule in
a copartnership of griefe, yet
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:3837:212"/>
others arise immediately from
the soule, and draw the body
into a participation of miserie;
Why may we not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
meere and separate spirits
capable of such an inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciation?</p>
                  <p>Besides which, I heare the
Iudge of men and Angels say,
<hi>Goe ye cursed into euerlasting fire,
prepared for the Deuill, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;</hi>
I heare the Prophet say, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
is prepared of old;</hi> If with
feare, and without curiositie we
may looke vpon those flames;
Why may we not attribute a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
nature to that more then
naturall fire? In the end of the
world, the elements shall be
dissolued by fire: and if the pure
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3837:213"/>
quintessentiall matter of the
skie, and the element of fire it
selfe, shall be dissolued by fire,
then that last fire shall be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
nature, then that which
it consumeth; what hinders
then but that the omnipotent
God hath from eternitie created
a fire of another nature propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
euen, to spirituall es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences?
Or why may we not
distinguish of fire, as it is it selfe,
a bodily creature, and, as it is
an instrument of Gods iustice,
so working, not by any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
vertue, or power of it owne,
but by a certaine height of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
efficacie, to which
it is exalted by the omnipotence
of that supreme and righteous
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3837:213"/>
Iudge? Or lastly, why may we
not conceiue that though spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
haue nothing materiall in
their nature, which that fire
should worke vpon, yet by the
iudgement of the almightie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter
of the world, iustly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their torment, they may be
made most sensible of paine,
and, by the obedible submission
of their created nature, wrought
vpon immediately by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
tortures; Besides, the
very horror, which ariseth from
the place, whereto they are euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
confined: For if the
incorporeall spirits of liuing
men may be held in a loathed,
or painfull body, and conceiue
sorrow to be so imprisoned;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3837:214"/>
Why may we not as easily yeeld
that the euill spirits of Angels,
or men may be held in those
direfull flames, and much more
abhorre therein to continue for
euer? Tremble rather, ô my
soule, at the thought of this
wofull condition of the euill
Angels; who, for one only act
of Apostasie from God, are
thus perpetually tormented,
whereas we sinfull wretches
multiplie many, and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
offences against the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
of our God; And withall
admire, and magnifie that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
mercie to the miserable ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of man; which, after
this holy seueritie of iustice to
the reuolted Angels, so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3837:214"/>
forbeares our hainous ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
and both suffers vs to
be free for the time, from these
hellish torments, and giues vs
oportunitie of a perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from them for euer;
<hi>Praise the Lord, ô my soule, and all
that is within mee, praise his holy
name, who forgiueth all thy sinnes,
and healeth all thine infirmities; Who
redeemeth thy life from destruction,
and crowneth thee with mercie and
compassions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no time wherein the
euill spirits are not tormented;
there is a time, wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be tormented yet more;
<hi>Art thou come to torment vs before
our time?</hi> They knew that the
last Assises are the prefixed terme
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3837:215"/>
of their full execution; which
they also vnderstood to be not
yet come; For though they
knew not when the day of
Iudgement should be; (a point
concealed from the glorious
Angels of heauen) yet they
knew when it should not be;
and therefore can say, <hi>Before the
time.</hi> Euen the very euill spirits
confesse, and fearfully attend a
set day of vniuersall Sessions;
They beleeue lesse then Deuils,
that either doubt of, or denie
that day of finall retribution.</p>
                  <p>Oh the wonderfull mercie of
our God, that both to wicked
men, and spirits, respites the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of their torment; He
might vpon the first instant of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3837:215"/>
the fall of Angels, haue inflicted
on them the hiest extremitie of
his vengeance; He might vpon
the first sinnes of our youth
(yea of our nature) haue swept
vs away, and giuen vs our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that fierie lake; he staies
a time for both; Though, with
this difference of mercie to vs
men, that here, not only is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
but, may be, an vtter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention
of punishment, which
to the euill spirits is altogether
impossible; They doe suffer,
they must suffer; and though
they haue now deserued to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all they must, yet they must
once suffer more then they doe.</p>
                  <p>Yet, so doth this euill spirit
expostulate, that hesues; <hi>I beseech
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3837:216"/>
thee torment me not.</hi> The world
is well changed, since Satans
first onset vpon Christ; Then,
he could say, <hi>If thou be the Sonne
of God;</hi> now, <hi>Iesus, the Sonne of
the most hie God;</hi> then, <hi>All these
will I giue thee if thou wilt fall
downe, and worship me;</hi> now, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee torment mee not;</hi> The
same power, when he lists, can
change the note of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to vs; How happie are we
that haue such a Redeemer as
can command the Deuils to
their chaines? Oh consider this
ye lawlesse sinners, that haue
said, <hi>Let vs breake his bonds, and
cast his cords from vs;</hi> How euer
the Almightie suffers you, for
a iudgement to haue free scope
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3837:216"/>
to euill, and ye can now impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
resist the reuealed will of
your Creator, yet the time shall
come, when ye shall see the very
masters, whom ye haue serued,
(the powers of darknesse) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to auoide the reuenges of
God; How much lesse shall
man striue with his Maker;
man, whose breath is in his
nosthrills, whose house is clay,
whose foundation is in the
dust?</p>
                  <p>Nature teaches euery creature
to wish a freedome from paine:
the foulest spirits cannot but
loue themselues; and this loue
must needs produce a depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of euill; Yet, what a thing
is this, to heare the Deuill at his
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3837:217"/>
praiers? <hi>I beseech thee torment me
not;</hi> Deuotion is not guiltie of
this, but feare; There is no
grace in the suit of Deuils, but
nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no respect of glory to
their Creator, but their owne
ease; They cannot pray against
sinne, but against torment for
sinne. What newes is it now, to
heare the profanest mouth, in
extremitie, imploring the sacred
name of God, when the Deuils
doe so? The worst of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
hates punishment, and can
say, <hi>Lead me not into paine;</hi> only
the good heart can say, <hi>Lead me
not into temptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> If we can as
heartily pray against sinne, for
the auoiding of displeasure, as
against punishment, when we
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3837:217"/>
haue displeased, there is true
grace in the soule: Indeed, if we
could feruently pray against
sinne, we should not need to
pray against punishment; which
is no other then the inseparable
shadow of that body; but if we
haue not laboured against our
sinnes, in vaine doe we pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
punishment; God must
be iust; and the wages of sinne
is death.</p>
                  <p>It pleased our holy Sauiour,
not only to let fall words of
command vpon this spirit, but
to interchange some speeches
with him: All Christs actions
are not for example: It was the
error of our Grand-mother to
hold chat with Satan; That
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3837:218"/>
God, who knowes the craft of
that old Serpent, and our weake
simplicitie, hath charged vs not
to inquire of an euill spirit; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the Disciples returning to
<hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, wondred to see
Christ talke with a woman, well
may we wonder to see him tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with an vncleane Spirit;
Let it be no presumption, ô Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
to aske vpon what
grounds thou didst this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we may not follow thee:
We know, that sinne was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in thy conformitie of
thy selfe to vs; we know there
was no guile found in thy
mouth, no possibilitie of taint
in thy nature, in thine actions;
Neither is it hard to conceiue
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3837:218"/>
how the same thing may be
done by thee without sinne,
which we cannot but sinne in
doing. There is a vast difference
in the Intention, in the Agent;
For, on the one side, thou didst
not aske the name of the spirit,
as one that knew not, and
would learne by inquiring; but,
that by the confession of that
mischiefe, which thou pleasedst
to suffer, the grace of the cure
might be the more conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the more glorious; so, on
the other, God and man might
doe that safely, which meere
man cannot doe, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
thou mightest touch the
leprosie, and not be legally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
because thou touchedst
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:3837:219"/>
it to heale it, didst not touch it
with possibilitie of infection;
So mightest thou, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the perfection of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
nature, wert vncapable of
any staine, by the interlocution
with Satan, safely conferre with
him, whom corrupt man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
to the danger of such a
pearle, may not meddle with,
without sinne, because not
without perill; It is for none
but God to hold discourse with
Satan; Our surest way is to haue
as little to doe with that euill
one, as we may; and if he shall
offer to maintaine conference
with vs by his secret tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to turne our speech vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our God, with the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:3837:219"/>
                     <hi>The Lord rebuke thee Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the presupposition of
him that knew it, that not only
men but spirits haue names;
This then he askes; not out of
an ignorance, or curiositie; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be hid from him
who calleth the starres, and all
the hosts of heauen by their
names; but, out of a iust respect
to the glory of the miracle he
was working; whereto the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the name would not a
little auaile: For, if without
inquirie, or confession, our
Sauiour had eiected this euill
spirit, it had passed for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
dispossession of one onely
Deuill, whereas now, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
there was a combination
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:3837:220"/>
and hellish champertie in these
powers of darknesse, which
were all forced to vaile vnto
that almightie command.</p>
                  <p>Before, the Deuill had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
singularly of himselfe, <hi>What
haue I to doe with thee;</hi> and, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee torment me not;</hi> Our
Sauiour yet, knowing that
there was a multitude of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
lurking in that brest,
who dissembled their presence,
wrests it out of the Spirit by
this interrogation, <hi>What is thy
name?</hi> Now can those wicked
ones no longer hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
He that asked the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
forced the answer, <hi>My
name is Legion.</hi> The author of
discord hath borrowed a name
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:3837:220"/>
of warre: from that militarie
order of discipline (by which
the Iewes were subdued) doth
the Deuill fetch his denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
They were many, yet they
say, <hi>My name,</hi> not, <hi>Our name;</hi>
though many, they speake as
one, they act as one, in this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:
There is a maruellous
accordance euen betwixt euill
spirits; that Kingdome is not
diuided, for then it could not
stand; I wonder not that wicked
men doe so conspire in euill; that
there is such vnanimitie in the
brochers, and abettors of errors,
when I see those deuils, which
are many in substance, are one
in name, action, habitation;
Who can bragge too much of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3837:221"/>
vnitie, when it is incident into
wicked spirits? All the praise of
concord is in the subiect; if that
be holy, the consent is Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
if sinfull, deuillish.</p>
                  <p>What a fearfull aduantage
haue our spirituall enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs? If armed troupes
come against single straglers,
what hope is there of life, of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie?
How much doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
vs to band our hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in a communion of
Saints? Our enemies come vpon
vs like a torrent; Oh let not vs
run asunder like drops in the
dust; All our vnited forces
will be little enough, to make
head against this league of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:3837:221"/>
Legion imports Order, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
conflict. Order, in that there
is a distinction of regiment,
a subordination of Officers;
Though in hell there be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of faces, yet not confusion
of degrees; Number; Those
that haue reckoned a Legion at
the lowest, haue counted it six
thousand; others, haue more
then doubled it; though here it
is not strict, but figuratiue, yet
the letter of it implies multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
How fearfull is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the number of
Apostate-Angels? And if a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
can attend one man, how
many must we needs thinke are
they, who, all the world ouer,
are at hand to the punishment
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3837:222"/>
of the wicked, the exercise of
the good, the tentation of both;
It cannot be hoped there can be
any place, or time, wherein we
may be secure from the onsets
of these enemies; Be sure, ye
lewd men, ye shall want no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
to euill, no torment for
euill; Be sure, ye godly, ye shall
not want combatants to trie
your strength, and skill; Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
your courages to resist, and
stirre vp your hearts to make
sure the meanes of your safetie;
There are more with vs then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs; The God of heauen is
with vs, if we be with him; and
our Angels behold the face of
God; If euery deuill were a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
we are safe: Though wee
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3837:222"/>
walke through the valley of the
shadow of death, we shall feare
no euill; Thou, ô Lord, shalt
stretch forth thine hand against
the wrath of our enemies, and
thy right hand shall saue vs.</p>
                  <p>Conflict; All this number is
not for sight, for rest; but for
motion, for action; Neither
was there euer houre, since the
first blow giuen to our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
wherein there was so
much as a truce betwixt these
aduersaries. As therefore strong
frontier-Townes, when there is
a peace concluded on both
parts, breake vp their garrison,
open their gates, neglect their
Bull-warkes; but, when they
heare of the enemie mustering
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:3837:223"/>
his forces, in great and vnequall
numbers, then they double their
guard; keepe Sentinell, repaire
their Sconces, so must we, vpon
the certaine knowledge of our
numerous, and deadly enemies,
in continuall aray against vs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
our selues alwaies to a
warie and strong resistance.
I doe not obserue the most to
thinke of this gostly hostilitie;
Either they do not find there are
tentations, or those tentations
hurtfull; they see no worse then
themselues; and if they feele
motions of euill, arising in
them, they impute it to fancie,
or vnreasonable appetite; to no
power, but natures; and; those
motions they follow, without
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:3837:223"/>
sensible hurt; neither see they
what harme it is to sinne: Is it
any maruell that carnall eies
cannot discerne spirituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects?
That the world who is
the friend, the vassall of Satan,
is in no warre with him? <hi>Elishaes</hi>
seruant, when his eies were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
saw troupes of spirituall
soldiers, which before he discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not; If the eies of our soules
be once enlightened by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
knowledge, and the
cleere beames of faith, we shall
as plainly descrie the inuisible
powers of wickednesse, as now
our bodily eies see heauen, and
earth. They are, though we see
them not, wee cannot be safe
from them, if we doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:3837:224"/>
not oppose them.</p>
                  <p>The Deuils are now become
great suitors to Christ; That he
would not command them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deepe; that he would
permit their entrance into the
swine. What is this deepe but
hell? both for the vtter separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the face of God; and
for the impossibilitie of passage
to the region of rest and glory?
The very euill spirits, then, feare,
and expect a further degree of
torment; they know themselues
reserued in those chaines of
darknesse for the iudgement of
the great day; There is the same
wages due to their sinnes, and
to ours; neither are the wages
paid till the worke be done;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3837:224"/>
they, tempting men to sinne,
must needs sinne grieuously in
tempting; as with vs men those
that mislead into sinne, offend
more then the actors; not till
the vpshot therefore of their
wickednesse shall they receiue
the full measure of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
This day, this
deepe they tremble at; what
shall I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of those men that
feare it not? It is hard for men
to beleeue their owne vnbeleefe:
If they were perswaded of this
fierie dungeon, this bottomlesse
deepe, wherein euery sinne shall
receiue an horrible portion
with the damned, durst they
stretch forth their hands to
wickednesse? No man will put
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:3837:225"/>
his hand into a fierie crucible to
fetch gold thence, because he
knowes it will burne him; Did
we as truly beleeue the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
burning of that infernall
fire, we durst not offer to fetch
pleasures, or profits, out of the
midst of those flames.</p>
                  <p>This degree of torment they
grant in Christs power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
they knew his power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible;
had he therefore but
said, <hi>Backe to hell, whence ye came,</hi>
they could no more haue staid
vpon earth, then they can now
climbe into heauen. O the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
dispensation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie;
who though he could
command all the euill spirits
downe to their dungeons in an
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:3837:225"/>
instant; so as they should haue no
more oportunitie of temptation,
yet thinkes fit to retaine them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth; It is not out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or improuidence of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
hand, that wicked spirits ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannzie
here vpon earth, but out
of the most wise, and most holy
ordination of God, who knowes
how to turne euill into good;
how to fetch good out of euill;
and by the worst instruments, to
bring about his most iust decrees:
Oh that we could adore that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and infinite power, and
cheerefully cast our selues vpon
that prouidence, which keepes
the Keyes euen of hell it selfe, and
either lets out, or returnes the
Deuils to their places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:3837:226"/>
Their other suit hath some mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
in mouing it, more in the
grant; <hi>That they might be suffred to
enter into the heard of Swine.</hi> It was
their ambition of some mischiefe,
that brought forth this desire;
that since they might not vexe
the bodie of the man, they might
yet afflict men in their goods;
The malice of these enuious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
reacheth from vs, to ours; It
is sore against their wills, if we be
not euery way miserable: If the
Swine were legally vncleane for
the vse of the table, yet they were
naturally good; Had not Satan
knowne them vsefull for man, he
had neuer desired their ruine;
But as Fencers will seeme to fetch
a blow at the legge, when they
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3837:226"/>
intend it at the head; so doth this
deuill; whiles he driues at the
Swine, he aimes at the soules of
these Gadarens; by this meanes, he
hoped well (and his hope was
not vaine) to worke in these
Gergesens a discontentment at
Christ, an vnwillingnesse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
him, a desire of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
he meant to turne them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Swine, by the losse of their
Swine: It was not the rafters, or
stones of the house of <hi>Iobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that he bore the grudge to,
but to the owners; nor to the
liues of the children so much, as
the soule of their father; There is
no affliction wherein he doth not
strike at the heart; which, whiles
it holds free, all other dammages
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:3837:227"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:3837:228"/>
are light; but a wounded spirit
(whether with sinne or sorrow)
who can beare? What euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of goods, or limmes, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
are wee if (like wise souldiers)
we gard the vitall parts; whiles
the soule is kept sound from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
from distrust, our enemy
may afflict vs, he cannot hurt vs.</p>
                  <p>They sue for a sufference; not
daring other then to grant that
without the permission of Christ,
they could not hurt a very swine;
If it be fearfull to thinke how
great things euill spirits can doe
with permission; it is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to thinke how nothing
they can doe without permission:
We know they want not malice
to destroy the whole frame of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3837:228"/>
Gods worke; but of all, man; of
all men, Christians; but if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaue they cannot set vpon an
hogge, what can they doe to the
liuing Images of their Creator?
They cannot offer vs so much as
a suggestion, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our Sauiour; And can
he that would giue his owne
most precious bloud for vs, to
saue vs from euill, wilfully giue
vs ouer to euill?</p>
                  <p>It is no newes that wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
wish to doe mischiefe, it is
newes that they are allowed it; If
the owner of all things should
stand vpon his absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
who can challenge him
for what he thinkes fit to doe
with his creature? The first Fole
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3837:229"/>
of the Asse is commanded, vnder
the law, to haue his necke broken,
what is that to vs? The creatures
doe that they were made for, if
they may serue any way to the
glory of their Maker; But, seldome
euer doth God leaue his actions
vnfurnished with such reasons, as
our weaknesse may reach vnto.
There were sects amongst these
Iewes that denied spirits, they
could not be more euidently,
more powerfully conuinced then
by this euent: Now shall the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens
see from what a multitude
of Deuils they were deliuered; and
how easie it had beene for the
same power to haue allowed
those spirits to seaze vpon their
persons, as well as their Swine;
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:3837:229"/>
Neither did God this without a
iust purpose of their castigation;
His iudgements are righteous,
where they are most secret;
though we cannot accuse these
inhabitants of ought, yet hee
could; and thought good thus to
mulct them: And if they had not
wanted grace to acknowledge it,
it was no small fauour of God,
that he would punish them in
their Swine, for that, which he
might haue auenged vpon their
bodies, and soules: Our goods are
furthest off vs; If but in these we
smart, we must confesse to finde
mercie.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it pleaseth God to
grant the suits of wicked men, and
spirits, in no fauour to the suitors:
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:3837:230"/>
Hee grants an ill suit, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
a good; He grants an ill
suit in iudgement, and holds
backe a good one, in mercie; The
Israelites aske meat; hee giues
Quailes to their mouthes, and
leanenesse to their soules; The
chosen vessell wishes Satan taken
off, and heares only, <hi>My grace is
sufficient for thee:</hi> Wee may not
euermore measure fauour by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descent;
These Deuils doubtlesse
receiue more punishment for that
harmefull act, wherein they are
heard. If we aske what is either
vnfit to receiue, or vnlawfull to
begge, it is a great fauour of our
God to be denied.</p>
                  <p>Those spirits which would goe
into the Swine by permission, goe
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3837:230"/>
out of the man by command;
they had staied long, and are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
suddenly; The immediate
workes of God are perfect in an
instant, and doe not require the
aid of time for their maturation.</p>
                  <p>No sooner are they cast out of
the man, then they are in the
Swine; They will leese no time,
but passe without intermission
from one mischiefe to another; If
they hold it a paine not to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of euill; Why is it not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to be euer doing good? The
impetuousnesse was no lesse, then
the speed, <hi>The heard was carried with
violence from a steep-downe place into
the lake, and was choked.</hi> It is no small
force that could doe this; but if
the Swine had beene so many
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3837:231"/>
mountaines, these spirits, vpon
Gods permission, had thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
them: How easily can they
carrie those soules (which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their power,) to destruction?
Vncleane beasts that wallow in
the mire of sensualitie, brutish
drunkards, transforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
by excesse, euen they, are the
swine, whom the Legion carries
headlong to the pit of perdition.</p>
                  <p>The wicked spirits haue their
wish; The Swine are choked in
the waues; What ease is this to
them? Good God; that there
should be any creature that seekes
contentment in destroying, in
tormenting the good creatures
of their Maker! This is the diet
of hell; Those fiends feed vpon
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:3837:231"/>
spight; towards man so much
more, as he doth more resemble
his Creator: Towards all other
liuing substances, so much more
as they may be more vsefull to
man.</p>
                  <p>The Swine ranne downe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
what maruell is it if their
keepers fled; that miraculous
work which should haue drawne
them to Christ, driues them
from him: They run with the
newes; the countrie comes in
with clamour; <hi>The whole multitude
of the countrie about, besought him to
depart;</hi> The multitude is a beast of
many heads; euery head hath a
seuerall mouth, and euery mouth
hath a seuerall tongue, and euery
tongue a seuerall accent; Euery
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3837:232"/>
head hath a seuerall braine, and
euery braine thoughts of their
owne; so as it is hard to finde a
multitude, without some diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
At least seldome euer hath a
good motion found a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance;
it is not so infrequent
for a multitude to conspire in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill;
Generalitie of assent is no
warrant for any act; Common
error carries away many; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not into the reason of ought,
but the practise: The way to hell
is a beaten road through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
feet that tread it; when vice
growes into fashion, singularitie
is a vertue.</p>
                  <p>There was not a Gadarene
found, that either dehorted their
fellowes, or opposed the motion;
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:3837:232"/>
it is a signe of people giuen vp to
iudgement, when no man makes
head against proiects of euill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
what can one strong man doe
against a whole throng of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse?
Yet this good comes of
an vnpreuailing resistance, that
God forbeares to plague, where he
findes but a sprinkling of faith:
Happie are they, who (like vnto
the celestiall bodies, which being
carried about, with the sway of
the hiest sphere, yet creepe on their
owne waies) keepe on the courses
of their owne holinesse, against
the swinge of common corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
They shall both deliuer their
owne soules, and helpe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
iudgement from others.</p>
                  <p>The Gadarenes sue to Christ
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3837:233"/>
for his departure; It is too much
fauour to attribute this to their
modestie, as if they held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnworthie of so diuine a
guest; Why then did they fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this suit in a time of their losse?
Why did they not taxe themselues,
and intimate a secret desire of
that, which they durst not begge?
It is too much rigor to attribute
it to the loue of their hoggs, and
an anger at their losse; then, they
had not intreated, but expelled
him; It was their feare that moued
this harsh suit: A seruile feare of
danger to their persons, to their
goods, Least hee that could so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
command the Deuils,
should haue set these tormentors
vpon them; Least their other
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:3837:233"/>
Demoniacks should be disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with like losse. I cannot blame
these Gaderens that they feared;
This power was worthy of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at; Their feare was iust, the
vse of their feare was vniust; They
should haue argued, <hi>This man
hath power ouer men, beasts, Deuils, it is
good hauing him to our friend; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is our safetie &amp; protection;</hi> Now
they contrarily mis-inferre, <hi>Thus
powerfull is he, it is good he were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off;</hi> What miserable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
misconstructions do men
make of God; of diuine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and actions? God is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,
able to take infinite ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of sinne, Oh that he were
not; He is prouident, I may be
carelesse; He is mercifull, I may
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:3837:234"/>
sinne; He is holy, Let him depart
from me, for I am a sinfull man;
How wittie sophisters are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men to deceiue their owne
soules, to rob themselues of a
God? Oh Sauiour, how worthy
are they to want thee that wish to
be rid of thee? Thou hast iust
cause to be wearie of vs, euen
whiles we sue to hold thee; but
when once our wretched vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
growes wearie of
thee, who can pittie vs to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with thy departure? Who
can say it is other then righteous,
that thou shouldst regest one
day vpon vs, <hi>Depart
from mee yee
wicked.</hi>
