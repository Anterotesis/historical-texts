         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Dear Wife, after eight
Month's Illneſs (though
ſhe never perfectly recoved her
weakneſs the Year before, which
held her about ſix Months) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36257:3"/>
this Life the 23<hi>d</hi> of the
12<hi>th</hi> Month, 1693/4 about half
an hour paſt two in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
being the ſixth Day of the
Week, and the Fiftieth Year of
her Age, and was ſenſible to the
very laſt.</p>
            <p>During her Illneſs, ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many living and weighty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
upon divers Occasions,
both before and near her End:
Some of which I took down for
mine and her dear Childrens
Conſolation.</p>
            <p>At one of the many Meetings
held in her Chamber, we and
our Children, and one of our
Servants, being only preſent, in
a tendering and living Power,
ſhe broke out, as ſhe ſate in her
Chair, <q>Let us all prepare, not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36257:3"/>
knowing <hi>what Hour or Watch
the Lord cometh.</hi> O I am full
of Matter! Shall we receive
Good, and ſhall we not receive
<hi>Evil things at the hands of the
Lord?</hi> I have caſt my care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord, he is the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
of Value;</hi> my Expectation
is wholly from him: He can
<hi>raiſe up,</hi> and He can <hi>caſt down.</hi>
               </q>
A while after ſhe ſaid, <q>Oh
what ſhall be done to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable</hi>
Servant?</q>
            </p>
            <p>At another Meeting, before
which much Heavineſs ſeemed
to lie upon her Natural Spirits,
ſhe ſaid, <q>This has been a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
Opportunity to me, I am
finely <hi>relieved</hi> and <hi>comforted,</hi>
Bleſſed be the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:36257:4"/>
At another time, as I was
ſpeaking to her of the Lord's
Love, and Witneſs of his Spirit,
that was with her, to give her
the Peace of <hi>Well-doing;</hi> ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to me, looking up, <q>For,
ſaid ſhe, I never did, to my
<hi>a</hi> knowledge, a <hi>wicked</hi> thing in
all my Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To a Friend, Aged 75 Years,
that came to ſee her, ſhe ſaid,
<q>Thou and I, to all appearance,
are <hi>near our Ends.</hi>
               </q> And to
another, about 65 Years old,
that came alſo to ſee her, ſhe
ſaid, <q>How much older has the
Lord made me by this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than thou art? <hi>But I am
contented; I do not murmur; I
ſubmit to his Holy Will.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36257:4"/>
In the ſtrength of her Fits
and Vapours, ſhe ſaid, <q>'Tis
the great Goodneſs of the
Lord, that I ſhould be able to
lie thus ſtill. He is the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
of <hi>Value</hi> to me, can I
ſay: <hi>Let my Tongue ſet forth
his Praiſe, and my Spirit Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Him whilſt I have Breath.</hi>
O I am ready to be <hi>tranſported</hi>
beyond my ſtrength. God was
not in the <hi>Thunder,</hi> nor in the
<hi>Lightening,</hi> but he was heard
in the <hi>Still</hi> Voice.</q> She did at
ſeveral times pray very ſweetly,
and in all her Weakneſs mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
the moſt equal, undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and reſigned Spirit, as well
as in all other reſpects; ſhe was
an excelling Perſon, both as <hi>Child,
Wife, Mother, Miſtreſs, Friend</hi> and
<hi>Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36257:5"/>
She called the Children one
day, when weak, and ſaid, <q>Be
not frighted Children, I do
not call you to take my leave
of you, but to ſee you, and
I would have you walk in the
<hi>Fear of the Lord, and with his
People in his Holy Truth;</hi>
               </q> or to
that Effect.</p>
            <p>Speaking at another time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to the Children, ſhe
ſaid, <q>I never deſired any <hi>Great
Things</hi> for you, but that you
may fear the Lord, and walk
in his Truth, among his
People, to the end of your
days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>She would not ſuffer me to
neglect any publick Meeting,
after I had my Liberty, upon
her Account; ſaying often, <q>O
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36257:5"/>
go my deareſt! Don't hinder
any Good for me. <hi>I deſire thee
go,</hi> I have caſt my care upon
the Lord: <hi>I ſhall ſee thee again.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>About three hours before her
End, a Relation taking leave of
her, ſhe ſaid again, <q>I have caſt
my care upon the Lord: My
dear Love to all Friends, and
(<hi>lifting up her Dying Hands and
Eyes</hi>) pray'd the Lord to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them and bleſs them.</q>
About an hour after, cauſing all
to withdraw, we were half an
hour together, in which we
took our laſt leave, ſaying all
that was fit upon that ſolemn
Occaſion. She continued <hi>Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and eat ſomething about an
hour before her Departure; at
which time our Children, and
moſt of the Family, were preſent,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36257:6"/>
ſhe quietly Expired in my Arms,
her Head upon my Boſom, with
a ſenſible and Devout Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her Soul to Almighty
God. I hope I may ſay, ſhe
was a Publick, as well as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Loſs; for ſhe was not only
an excellent Wife and Mother,
but an Entire and Conſtant
Friend, of a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Capacity, and greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
and Humility; yet moſt
equal and undaunted in Danger,
Religious as well as Ingenuous,
without Affectation. An eaſie
Miſtreſs, and good Neighbour,
eſpecially to the Poor. Neither
laviſh nor penurious, but an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Induſtry, as well as of
other Vertues: Therefore our
great Loſs, tho' her own Eternal
Gain.</p>

            <head>Sorrow and Joy
IN THE
LOSS and END
OF
Springet Penn.</head>
            <p>MY very Dear Child and
Eldeſt Son, <hi>Springet
Penn,</hi> did from his Childhood
manifeſt a Diſpoſition to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and gave me hope of a
more than ordinary Capacity,
and time ſatisfied me in both
reſpects. For beſides a good
ſhare of Learning, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Mathematical</hi> Knowledge, he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36257:7"/>
ſhewed a judgment in the uſe
and application of it, much
above his Years. He had the
Seeds of many good Qualities ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in him, that made him Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and conſequently La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
but eſpecially his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Plaineneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> with
a <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Softneſs</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that if I may ſay it, were
an improvement upon his other
Good Qualities. But though
theſe were no Security againſt
<hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> yet they went
a good way to facilitate a due
Preparation for them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Good Ground that was
in him, ſhewed it ſelf very
plainly ſometime before his Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
For more than half a Year
before it pleaſed the Lord to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36257:7"/>
viſit him with Weakneſs, he
grew more <hi>Retired,</hi> and much
diſengaged from Youthful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
ſhewing a remarkable
Tenderneſs in Meetings even
when they were ſilent: But
when He ſaw himſelf doubtful
as to his Recovery, he turn'd
his Mind and Meditations more
apparently towards the Lord;
ſecretly (as alſo when they
were in the Room that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon him) Praying of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
with great Fervency to the
Lord, and uttering very many
<hi>Thankful</hi> Expreſſions and <hi>Praiſes</hi>
to him, in a deep and ſenſible
manner. One day he ſaid to
us, I am <hi>Reſigned; what God
Pleaſeth; he knows what's beſt.</hi> I
would live if it <hi>Pleaſed him,</hi> that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36257:8"/>
I might ſerve him: But, <hi>O
Lord, not my Will, but thy Will
be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One ſpeaking to him of the
Things of this World, and what
might Pleaſe him when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
He anſwered, <hi>My Eye
looks another way, where the trueſt
Pleaſure is.</hi> When he told me
he had Reſted well, and that I
ſaid it was a Mercy to him;
he quickly Replied upon me,
with a ſerious, yet ſweet Look,
<hi>All is Mercy, dear Father, every
thing is Mercy.</hi> Another time
when I went to Meeting, at
Parting, he ſaid, <hi>Remember me,
my dear Father, before the Lord:
Though I cannot go to Meetings, yet
I have many good Meetings; the
Lord comes in upon my Spirit, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36257:8"/>
have Heavenly Meetings with him
by my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not many days before
he died, the Lord appearing
by his Holy Power upon his
Spirit, when alone, at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
asking him how he did,
he told me, <hi>O I have had a Sweet
Time, a Bleſſed Time! great Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
the Power of the Lord over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
my Soul, a ſweet Time indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And telling him how ſome of
the Gentry that had been to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
him, were gone to their <hi>Games,</hi>
and <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and how
little Conſideration the Children
of Men had of God and their
latter End, and how much Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
he was in this Weakneſs to
have been <hi>otherwiſe</hi> Educated,
and to be preſerved from thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36257:9"/>
Temptations to Vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he
Anſwered, <hi>It is all ſtuff, my dear
Father: It is ſad ſtuff. O that
I might live to tell them ſo!</hi> Well,
my dear Child, I Replied, Let
this be the time of thy entering
into ſecret <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> that
if he Raiſe thee, thou wilt dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
thy Youth, Strength and
Life to him, and his People,
and Service: He returned, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is not now to do, it is
not now to do;</hi> with great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
upon his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Being ever almoſt near him,
and doing any thing for him
he wanted or deſired, he broke
out with much Sence and Love,
<hi>My dear Father, if I live, I will
make Thee amends.</hi> And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him of Divine Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36257:9"/>
that the Eye of Man
ſaw not, but the Soul, made
alive by the Spirit of Chriſt,
plainly felt; he, in a lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
cried out, <hi>O I had
a ſweet Time yeſterday by my ſelf!
O the Lord hath preſerved me to
this day! O Bleſſed be his Name;
my Soul Praiſes him for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy!
O Father, it is of the Goodneſs
of the Lord that I am ſo well as
I am!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fixing his Eyes upon his
Siſter, he took her by the Hand,
ſaying, <hi>Poor</hi> Tiſhe, <hi>Look to good
things: Poor Child there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
without it: One drop of the
Love of God is worth more than
all the World.</hi> I KNOW IT,
I HAVE TASTED IT:
I have felt as much or more of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36257:10"/>
the Love of God in this Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
than in all my Life before.
At another time, as I ſtood by
him, he looked up upon me,
and ſaid, <hi>Dear Father, ſit by me,
I love thy Company, and I know
thou loveſt mine; and if it be the
Lord's Will that we muſt Part, be
not troubled, for that will trouble
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taking ſomething one Night
in Bed, juſt before his going to
Reſt, he ſat up and fervently
Prayed thus. <hi>O Lord God,
Thou whoſe Son ſaid to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
Whatever ye ask in my
Name, ye ſhall receive; <hi>I Pray
thee, in his Name, Bleſs this to me
this Night, and give me Reſt, if
it be thy Bleſſed Will, O Lord!</hi>
And accordingly he had a very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36257:10"/>
Comfortable Night, of which he
took a Thankful Notice before
us, next day.</p>
            <p>And when he at one time
more than ordinary, Expreſſed
a deſire to Live, and entreated
me to pray for him; he added,
<hi>And dear Father, if the Lord ſhould
Raiſe me, and Enable me to ſerve
him and his People, then I might
Travel with thee ſometimes, and
we might Eaſe one another</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Miniſtry.) He ſpoke
it with great Modeſty: Upon
which I ſaid to him, My dear
Child, if it pleaſe the Lord to
Raiſe thee, <hi>I am ſatisfied it will
be ſo;</hi> and if not, then in as
much as it is thy Fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
in the Lord, <hi>he will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee juſt as if thou didſt Live to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36257:11"/>
ſerve him,</hi> and thy Comfort will
be the ſame: So either way it
will be well. For if thou
ſhould'ſt not Live, I do verily
believe thou wilt have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of thy good Deſires,
without the Temptations and
Troubles that would attend, if
long Life were granted to thee.</p>
            <p>Saying one day thus, I am a
reſolved I will have ſuch a thing
done; he immedately catch'd
himfelf, and fell into this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
with much Contrition,
<hi>Did I ſay I will? O Lord forgive
me that irreverent and haſty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion!
I am poor weak Creature,
and live by thee, and therefore I
ſhould have ſaid,</hi> If it pleaſeth
thee that I Live, I intend to do
ſo or ſo: <hi>Lord forgive my Raſh
Expreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:36257:11"/>
Seeing my preſent Wife rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be helpful, and do any
thing for him, he turned to her
and ſaid, <hi>Don't thee do ſo, let
them; don't trouble thy ſelf ſo
much for ſuch a poor Creature
at I am.</hi> And taking leave of
him a few Nights before his
end, he ſaid to her, <hi>Pray for
me, dear Mother, thou art good
and innocent, may be the Lord may
hear thy Prayers for me, for I deſire
my ſtrength again, that I might live,
and employ it more in the Lord's
Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two or three days before his
departure, he called his Brother
to him, and looking <hi>Awefully</hi>
upon him, ſaid, <hi>Be a good Boy,
and know there is a God, a Great
and Mighty God, who is a Rewarder
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36257:12"/>
of the Righteous, and ſo he is of the
Wicked, but their Rewards are not
the ſame. Have a care of Idle Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and idle Company, and love good
Company, and good Friends, and the
Lord will Bleſs thee. I have ſeen
good things for thee ſince my Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if thou doſt but fear the Lord:
And if I ſhould not live</hi> (though
the Lord is All-ſufficient) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what I ſay to thee, when I
am dead and gone: Poor Child,
the Lord Bleſs thee, come and
Kiſs me!</hi> Which melted us all
into great Tenderneſs, but his
Brother more particularly.</p>
            <p>Many good Exhortations he
gave to ſome of the Servants,
and others that came to ſee him,
that were not of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as well as thoſe that were,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36257:12"/>
which drew Tears from their
Eyes.</p>
            <p>The day but one before he
died, he went to take the Air
in a Coach; but ſaid at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<hi>Really Father I am exceeding
weak, thou canſt not think how weak
I am:</hi> My dear Child, I repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
thou art weak, but God is
ſtrong, who is the <hi>Strength of thy
Life: Ay that is it,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which
upholds me.</hi> And the day before
he departed, being alone with
him, he deſired me to faſten the
Door, and looking earneſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, ſaid, <hi>Dear Father, thou
art a dear Father, and I know thy
Father, come let us two have a little
Meeting, a private Ejaculation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
now no Body elſe is here.
O my Soul is ſenſible of the Love of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36257:13"/>
God!</hi> And indeed a ſweet time
we had, like to Precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his Burial.</p>
            <p>He deſired to go home; if not
to Live, <hi>to Die there;</hi> and we
made Preparation for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Twenty Miles from my
Houſe; and ſo much ſtronger
was his Spirit than his Body,
that he ſpoke of going next
Day, which was the Morning
he departed; and a Symptom it
was of his <hi>greater Journey</hi> to his
longer Home. That Morning
he left us, growing more and
more Senſible of his extreme
Weakneſs, he asked me, as
doubtful of himſelf, <hi>How ſhall
I get Home?</hi> I told him, in a
Coach; he anſwered, <hi>I am beſt
in a Coach.</hi> But obſerving his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36257:13"/>
decay, I ſaid, Why Child?
Thou art at home every where;
<hi>Ay,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſo I am in the Lord.</hi>
I took that Opportunity to ask
him, If I ſhould remember his
Love to his Friends at <hi>Briſtol,
London,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yes, Yes,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>my Love in the Lord; my Love to
all Friends in the Lord:</hi> And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
too? He ſaid, <hi>Ay to be
ſure.</hi> Being asked, if he would
have his Aſs's Milk, or eat any
thing? He anſwered, <hi>No more
outward Food, but Heavenly Food
is provided for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Time drawing on a-pace,
he ſaid to me, <hi>My dear Father,
Kiſs me, thou art a dear Father;
I deſire to prize it; how can I make
thee amends?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo called his Siſter, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36257:14"/>
ſaid to her, <hi>Poor Child, come and
Kiſs me;</hi> between whom ſeemed
a <hi>tender and long Farewell.</hi> I ſent
for his Brother, that he might
Kiſs him too, which he did, all
were in Tears about him. Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Head to me, he ſaid
ſoftly, <hi>Dear Father, haſt no hope
for me?</hi> I anſwered, My dear
Child, I am afraid to hope, and
I dare not deſpair; but am, and
have been Reſigned, <hi>though one
of the hardeſt Leſſons I ever Learned:</hi>
He Pauſed a while, and with a
Compoſed Frame of Mind, he
ſaid, <hi>Come Life, come Death, I am
Reſigned. O the Love of God
overcomes my Soul!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Feeling himſelf decline a-pace,
and ſeeing him not able to bring
up the Matter that was in his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36257:14"/>
Throat, ſome Body fetch'd the
Doctor; but ſo ſoon as he came
in, he ſaid, <hi>Let my Father ſpeak to
the Doctor, and I'll go ſleep;</hi> which
he did, and waked no more;
<hi>Breathing his laſt on my Breaſt,</hi>
the 10th Day of the 2d Month,
between the Hours of Nine and
Ten in the Morning, 1696. in
his One and Twentieth Year.</p>
            <p>So ended the Life of my <hi>Dear
Child, and Eldeſt Son;</hi> much of my
<hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> and one of the
moſt <hi>Tender</hi> and <hi>Dutiful,</hi> as well
as <hi>Ingenuous</hi> and <hi>Vertuous</hi> Youths
I knew, if I may ſay ſo, of my
own Dear Child: In whom I
loſt all that any Father can loſe
in a Child, ſince he was capable
of any thing that became a Sober
Young Man: My <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:36257:15"/>
as well as moſt Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
and Dutiful Child.</p>
            <p>May this Loſs and End have
its due Weight and Impreſſion
upon all his dear Relations and
Friends, and thoſe to whoſe
hands this Account may come,
for their Remembrance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for their great and laſt
Change, and I have my End in
making my Dear Child's thus
