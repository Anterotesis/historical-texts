            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Government by Arch-Bishops and Bishops, was in <hi>Scotland</hi> restored <hi>An. 1662,</hi> as being <hi>most agreeable to the Word of God, most convenient for the preservation of Truth, Order, and Unity, and most suitable to Monarchy, and the peace and quiet of the State.</hi> Those motives for its Restitution are every way so great, that none others can be so worthy of the <hi>Wisdom of that Nation,</hi> which challengeth a more early Profession of Christianity, and an Ancienter Race of Kings, than any of these parts of Christendom can well pretend to. But that Ecclesiastical Government, which in its self is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Scriptures, and best fitted against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie and Schism, may to prejudiced Men seem burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and by them be Misrepresented to others.</p>
            <p>From this it hath happened, that the Episcopacy (as Exercised in <hi>Scotland</hi> these 26 years) hath been of late abolished, <hi>as an unsupportable Grievance to the Nation, contrary to the general Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People, and inconsistent with the Legal Establishment of that Church at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52778:3"/>
Whoever duly compares the Narratives of these Two Acts, the one, about its Restitution, and the other, about its Abolishment, may find some of their Reasons why no other Ecclesiastick Politie is yet settled in its place; For by this delay, every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament hath had time to consider what Church Government for Essentials is of Divine Right, and may both preserve the Church from Heresie and Schism, and the State from Usurpation and Rebellion; and which may best conduce to the satisfaction of all Religious Protestants, and Loyal Subjects in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For this Effect, the due consideration of the following Questions is doubtless of great importance, and the impartial Resolution of them cannot but be at this time very seasonable. Whether they are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here with such impartiality as this matter requires, is submitted to the unbyassed Iudgment of the Reader: Whom I shall desire that if he has any thing to object, he will tell the world in Charity and Meekness, that are the proper Characters of Christianity, and not in that Unchristian way of Evil Speaking and Reviling, which sufficiently shews what Spirt he is of, that writ, <hi>The brief and true Account of the Sufferings of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>occasioned by the</hi> Episcopalians <hi>since the year 1660.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish I had seen that Pamphlet before this was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Press. It would have <hi>Occasion'd</hi> me to add some things more, tho' I do not find my self obliged by it, to alter any thing that I have Written.</p>

            <head>SOME Questions, &amp;c.</head>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <head>
                  <hi>QUESTION I.</hi> Whether <hi>Presbytery</hi> (as contrary to the <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> restored in <hi>Scotland, An. 1662.)</hi> was settled by Law when the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> came to have the Legal Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Kingdom?</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALL the Dispute here, intrinsick to the notion of a Church Governour, is purely this; Whether he should be nominated by the State or by the Church; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after Nomination, the power to Elect him should be entrusted to a Delegated Number, or remain in the mixt Synod of Clergy and Laity; and whether after the Election is past, his Institution unto his Office should be for Life, or only during Pleasure; and lastly, whether in the Exercise of his Function he have a Negative voice over his Synod, or they a Conclusive Voice over him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Presbyterian Moderator <hi>An.</hi> 1662. abolished,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52778:4"/>
is rightly defined, the Church-Moderator, Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Elected by the Clergy, Lay-Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of the Synod; instituted unto his Office during their pleasure; invested with no fixed Power of Ordination; nor any Negative Voice in the exercise of his Jurisdiction. And the Episcopacy which was then restored, is by the Rule of contraries a Church-Government of a Moderator Nominated by the King; Elected by the Chapter; invested with a fixed power of Ordination regulated by Cannons; and of Jurisdiction balanced by assisting Presbyters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now although such an Episcopacy was in <hi>Scotland</hi> taken away <hi>April</hi> last, yet since Presbytery is not yet setl'd by Law, this question of Fact propos'd about it, may be stated and resolved according to Truth, without the crime of <hi>LEE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SING MAKING.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not to be doubted, but that the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had the Legal Establishment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1567, in which year by Parliamentary Statutes Popery was<note place="margin">
                     <hi>K. Iames</hi> 6. Parl. 1. Act. 2, 3, 8.</note> Abolished, a Protestant Confession of Faith Authorized, and their Kings by the Coronation Oath obliged to maintain it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the Nature of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Monarchy, neither the King without Advice of his Estates, nor they without his Royal Consent touching the Publick Act with his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, can make or unmake Laws to govern the People: Wherefore the Constitution of Bishops having then the Publick Authority, (the Popish Bishops sitting in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which thus setl'd the Reformation) must in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spotswood</hi>'s 3 Book</note> of the Law be confest to remain firm and valid from the aforesaid year 1567, till the full Legislative Power of the King in Parliament, concur'd to shake or destroy it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But whatever was done at that time in favour of Mr.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spotswood</hi> Book 3. <hi>p.</hi> 152. Book 6. <hi>p.</hi> 289.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> his Book of <hi>POLICY,</hi> (proposing a superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency which is another Model of Episcopacy) or Mr. <hi>An. Melvil</hi> his Book of <hi>DISCIPLINE,</hi> (proposing Presbytery, <hi>An.</hi> 1578) by Acts of <hi>Privy Council</hi> extorted in tumultuous times, through the Menacing Applications of Clergy Men Assembling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52778:4"/>
themselves without Warrant; yet before the year 1592, there is no Act of Parliament either in Print or Unprinted, setling that Presbytery which is contrary to the Episcopacy Established before, and remaining in substance at the time of the Reformation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore the impartial Resolution of the Question proposed, is in short this, That Presbytery, as contrary to the Episcopacy restored in <hi>Scotland An.</hi> 1662, was not by Law setled 35 years after the Protestant Religion had the Legal Establishment in that Kingdom.</p>

                  <hi>QUESTION IV,</hi> Whether between the Year 1662. and the Year 1689. Presbyterian Separatists were guilty of sinful Separation?</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Larger Catechism</hi> agreed upon by the pretended Assembly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> with assistance of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the <hi>Kirk of Scotland,</hi> and thereafter approved by their general Assembly, teacheth such Doctrine, as from it can be demonstrated how necessary it is for Salvation that every person keep Communion with the <hi>particular Church</hi> established by the <hi>Laws of the State</hi> he liveth in; unless she either <hi>enjoyn</hi> in her <hi>Canons</hi> any sinful <hi>term of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> or <hi>propose</hi> in her <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> any Heretical <hi>Article,</hi> or <hi>prescribe</hi> in her <hi>Directory for Worship,</hi> any <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous</hi> impurity. So that the Question here proposed plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolves into this, Whether the Episcopal Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> these 27 years enjoyn'd any sinful <hi>Canon</hi> as a <hi>term of Communion,</hi> or prosess'd any <hi>erroneous Doctrine</hi> to be <hi>believed,</hi> or <hi>directed</hi> any <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be performed in <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. All the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the World cannot produce one <hi>Canon</hi> of any <hi>Synod</hi> of the <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from 1662<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the last year, with which they will not readily comply, excepting those <hi>Canons</hi> that <hi>qualifie Ministers</hi> to the Exercise of the <hi>holy Function:</hi> and none of those are enjoyned the Clergy of that Perswasion, as a term of their Communion, but as a condition of their Ministration: So that however these should debar any Ministers from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> they cannot shut them out of the <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Nay, when it hath been demonstrated to them (in a Letter for Union, dated at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>March</hi>

               <p n="3">3. In the second place, the <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyterians, for <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith,</hi> adhere to the <hi>Westminster</hi> Consession, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Act of their General Assembly: Now let any<note place="margin">Aug. 1647.</note> Presbyterian discover, if he can, one single <hi>Article</hi> of all the three and thirty <hi>Chapters</hi> of that <hi>Confession,</hi> that was ever condemn'd by the late Episcopal Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in any whatsoever <hi>Synod,</hi> since the time of its Restitution.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, <hi>Scotch Presbyterians,</hi> for publick Worship in the Church, retain the <hi>Directory,</hi> composed by the foresaid pretended Assembly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and thereafter approved<note place="margin">Feb. 1645.</note> by the General Assemblies of their <hi>Kirk.</hi> Now to this Rule of Divine Service the established <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> there hath these 27 years been more conformable than the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians ever were or are. It is true, that those who have Sworn in the <hi>Solemn Leagne</hi> to preserve the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as it stood reformed in <hi>Scotland, An.</hi> 1638. and to reform the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the same point of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> according to the <hi>Example of the Church of Scotland,</hi> are by virtue of this their Solemn Oath obliged to ling the <hi>Doxologie</hi> after the singing Psalms, ever after the year Forty Eight, as well as they did it all the ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and to avoid the sin of <hi>Perjury,</hi> they were bound to make their English Brethren to sing it, rather than at <hi>their</hi> instigation to forbear to sing it themselves. But not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon this <hi>Covenant-Obligation,</hi> doubtless when the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

                  <hi>Church of</hi> Scotland continues that Christian Hymn, which the <hi>Directory</hi> hath no where forbidden, their sin of <hi>Commission</hi> is not half so great as the <hi>Omission of the Lords Prayer,</hi> which the <hi>Directory</hi> enjoyneth to be said at Sermon times, of which Omission the Presbyterians are only guilty, of all the Christians in the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, in <hi>Administration</hi> of both <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> observeth the <hi>Directory</hi> in all things, save one which is a very justifiable Practice; and that is in the Office of Baptism, the solemn <hi>Confession</hi> of the <hi>Apostolick Creed,</hi> which both the pretended Assembly here at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the General Assembly there in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (at the end of the shorter Catechism) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be a <hi>Brief Sum of the Christian Faith,</hi> agreeable <hi>to the Word of God, and amiently received in the Churches of Christ:</hi> This their acknowledgment of its Antiquity and Scripture Purity, must force any <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterian, to grant that there is no more sin in saying the Apostles Creed publickly in the Church, tho' there be no precept for saying it, than there is in sprinkling water upon the Baptized Infant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now laying all these considerations together, that the purity in <hi>Doctrine</hi> which Presbyterian <hi>Synods</hi> confess, and the purity of <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> doing nothing which the <hi>Directory</hi> forbids, could be as well retained in the <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> these 27 years, as in any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Meeting-House:</hi> And that no Confession of any Reformed Church, asserts the Divine Right of their <hi>Presbytery</hi> as before defined: And that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant abjures not the Epis opacy likewise defin'd, but on the contrary it was peti<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

number of Godly, Learned, and Grave Men to fill up the vacant places of those who, for any of the Motives before mentioned, had left their charges; and till that deplorable want (especially in the West,) the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the regular Meetings for Divine Service, was so little observable, that before <hi>June</hi> 1663, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that Nation had by no Act provided against it.</p>
               <p n="10">10.

               <p n="11">11. They considered <hi>how seditious, and of how dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and consequence Seperation from the rugular Church might prove</hi> for the future: And therefore for security of the State from the confusions they had so lately smarted under, they were forced to enact a Penal Law against it, importing, <hi>That every Person having an Inheritance, should pay the fourth part of</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. But notwithstanding this Penal Law, the contagion of those Books and Sermons which poisoned so many with Principles of Separation from the established Church, produced the renovation of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> contrary to the Authority of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was followed by an open Rebellion of the Western parts (known by the name of <hi>Pentlin Hills</hi>) in the Year 1666, defeated by the King's Army, so that they were out of capacity of resisting: However, the <hi>King</hi> in his

Royal Clemency, at the Address of some States-men, gave them indulgence to convene in Meeting-Houses for Divine Worship; and they made this good use of his Mercy, as that by them the incumbent Ministers (whose Characters would have secured them any where but in the West of <hi>Scotland</hi>) <hi>had their Houses in the night time invaded, their Persons assaulted, wounded and pursued for their Lives.</hi> Then indeed, that <hi>merciful Prince,</hi> with advice of his Estates in Parliament, <hi>having a just indignation of such horrid and unchristian Villanies, thought fit to brand the same with a</hi>

                     <hi>K.</hi> Ch. 2. Parl. 2. Ses. 2.

               <p n="14">14 And the Penalties therein contained (as nigh as I can value <hi>Scottish</hi> Mony by the current Coin in <hi>England</hi>) are these following: <hi>That every Minister, preaching at a Conventicle, should be imprisoned till he find surety for 275 l. that he should not do the like thereafter, or else oblige himself by Bond to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

out of the Kingdom, and never to return without his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties leave; that every one of any Inheritance should pay the fourth part of his yearly Estate; that every Servant should pay the fourth part of his yearly Wages; that every Farmer should pay Forty Shillings, and every Tenant under them Twenty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Further, <hi>His Majesty understanding that divers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Persons had been so maliciously wicked and disloyal, as to convocate his Subjects to open Meetings in the Fields; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that those Meetings were the rendezvous of Rebellion, and tending in a high measure to the disturbance of the publick Peace, declares, that those who in Arms did convocate in Field Conventicles, should be punishable by Death, and confiscation of Goods; and that those present at them, should be punished in double the respective Fines appointed against House-Meetings.</hi> This Act is dated <hi>Aug.</hi> the <hi>30th.</hi> 1670.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>These acts against Separation in Meeting-houses, or in the Fields, were appointed to endure only for the space of three years, unless his Majesty should think fit to continue them longer; wherefore his Majesty considering that they had not received due Obedience, and that the execution thereof had not been so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, as by the Tenor of the same is prescribed, found it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, with the advise of his Estates in Parliament, in</hi> Sept. 1672. <hi>that they should remain in force for other three Years to come.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. These are the Penal Laws in <hi>Scotland</hi> against the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, made by divers free Parliaments against their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Separation from the Church, to frequent Meeting-houses or Field-Conventicles, upon mature consideration of the inconsistency of it, with Religion towards God; Affection to the Laws; Loyalty to the King; or Study of the publick Peace of the State: And three Rebellions in 23 years (from the year 1663 to the year 1686) have justifyed the Justice and Wisdom of these Parliaments. But none ever

suffered for meer Separation but in purse; and never any was punished that way, but such as came to Church to save their Money, notwithstanding all their pretended scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Conscience: Wherefore unless we derogate from the Authority of King and Parliament, justify Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and prefer private Humour to publick Peace, the impartial Resolution of the present Question is this, That the Penal Laws against the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Persecution in them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOtwithstanding that the Presbyterians are pleas'd to say, they were dragoon'd by the Bishops and Episcopal Clergy, alluding to that way of Conversion in <hi>France,</hi> which indeed was procur'd by an Address of the Assembly of the Clergy of that Kingdom; yet this is a palpable Injustice and Calumny. For certain it is, that all these twenty four years never produced one Address of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial, Diocesan, Provincial,</hi> or <hi>National Assembly</hi> of the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> either beseeching the High Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the <hi>Lords of the Privy Council,</hi> to make or execute Laws against <hi>Protestant Dissenters:</hi> Wherefore, notwithstanding all the passionate Exhortations in private, and the publick Sermons in the Church, concerning the guiltiness of <hi>Schism,</hi> and the necessity of <hi>Union</hi> among
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52778:12"/>
                  <hi>Protestants,</hi> against their <hi>common Adversaries,</hi> the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy there cannot be possibly charged with the Spirit of <hi>Persecution</hi> against <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Nay, upon the contrary, our Clergy were so averse from giving obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Act that enjoyned them to present written Lists of the Dissenters in their respective Parishes, and so very inflexible to the Publick Order for their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial informing upon Oath against Separatists, that the Judges competent, and Officers of State chid them in Publick for disaffection to the Royal Government; so that under that Imputation they had nothing but their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to support them, in the Spirit of Meekness and Charity to their sworn Enemies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, it were a great Injustice to the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the Bishops, to charge any of them as having been the first movers of those Penal Laws against Separation; but since the repeated Rebellions of Forty Years past, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced all Mankind of the necessity of those Laws for the security of Religion and the Peace of the State, the Bishops consenting, or even advising to those Laws, is so far from inferring their having a Persecuting Spirit, that on the contrary, their doing otherwise, had demonstrated them to be Enemies to the Commonwealth, in all its concerns both Sacred and Civil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But withal, it cannot but be acknowledged by any one that considers things calmly, that none of those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had it ever in their power to shew acts of Compassion towards deluded Separatists of whatever quality, but he chearfully did it, in relieving their Necessities, or mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the execution of the Penalties by Law enjoin'd. To make a proof of this by enumerating particular Acts of Charity (which Presbyterians, to this day alive, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) would make the Resolution of this Question swell Four times bigger than all the Four Letters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the present Persecution of their Clergy; therefore I shall forbear it.</p>

Now since Private <hi>Exhortations,</hi> and Publick <hi>Sermons</hi> against <hi>Schism,</hi> and recommending <hi>Union,</hi> were all the appearances made by that Inferiour Clergy against Separatists; and since all the Bishops in Parliament ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd to no <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against Separation, but such as were justified to the World by a <hi>Threefold Rebellion,</hi> to be necessary in <hi>Policy</hi> as well as <hi>Religion,</hi> for the common good of the <hi>State</hi> as well as <hi>Church;</hi> I say, after all, the impartial Resolution of the present Question is this, That the Episcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the year 1662 to the year 1686, shewed nothing of the Spirit of Persecution against Presbyterians.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

every one of these Societies of Protestants may be considered in reference to the matter of fact in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to begin with their Episcopal Church Diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. The Two Estates of Barons (great and less) and Burgesses, fully represent them, in Parliamentary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies; the free and full Parliament convened <hi>An.</hi> 1685. consisted of such Men as had all of them sworn in the <hi>Test</hi> against the <hi>Covenant-Principles</hi> of <hi>Presbytery:</hi> This Episcopal Parliament so resolutely own'd themselves to be averse from taking away these Legal Restraints upon <hi>Papists,</hi> that the Vote about repealing those <hi>Penal Laws</hi> came never further than the <hi>Lords of the Articles:</hi> All this the Episcopal Church Diffusive did, with the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hazard of displeasing the Prince, who was then so zealous for an extensive Liberty to Papists, that for the disappointment which he found therein from that <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> he chose to turn out of his Service, some who had been the most faithful to him both in Civil and Military Affairs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, for the Church Representative of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the most malicious Enemies to the Episcopal Order, asperse but two of fourteen Bishops, for their complyance to these designs; and it is as well known that two of the twelve were depriv'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then as for the inferior Clergy, they were constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faithful in Preaching against the Doctrines of the Roman Church, notwithstanding the necessity they were under, of reading the Law against <hi>LEESING MAKING,</hi> every quarter of the year, to affright them into silence; they as often as they preached, remembred in their Publick Prayers, the persecuted Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> notwithstanding all that was done to stifle and disparage the belief of the Persecution; nay, in none of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52778:14"/>
their Synodical Sermons, was the eminent danger from the busie Jesuites and other Papists forgotten; nor in any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the miserable Fopperies of Popery omitted, even before his Majesties own Commissioner, whether in the Cathedral Church at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> or the Chappel Royal at <hi>Holy-Rood-House:</hi> And in the Synod of <hi>April</hi> 1685, (when the Bishops could not be with them, by reason of the approaching Parliament) they drew up their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances against Popery; and like dutiful Sons and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Protestants, shewed their ready concurrence with the Bishops, in that day of Tryal: And it's certain, that to their Interest with the Country, it is chiefly to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, that the Penal Laws against Papists were not then repealed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All this they did, not with connivance of the Court, but with apparent hazard of its heaviest displeasure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in the censuring of some, suspension of others, and deposition of others, who were all patient and chearful Confessors for that Holy Religion, which they Professed and Taught in season and out of season: Wherefore the impartial Resolution to the present Question, is this, That neither the Episcopal Church Diffusive, nor Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the Clergy, whether Superior, or Inferior, were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliers with the Designs for taking away the Penal Laws against Papists.</p>

                  <hi>QUESTION VIII.</hi> Whether the <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyterians were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers with the Designs for taking away the Penal Laws against Papists?</head>
               <p>IN satisfying this Question, let us take the same method which we took to satisfie the former: And to begin with the Laity of the Presbyterian Perswasion, none of these were ignorant that the Convening of the Parliament in 1685, was to obtain of them a free admission of Papists into all places of Trust; King <hi>Iames</hi> his Principles for Liberty of Conscience, fill'd up all his Declarations for Indulgence within his Kingdoms; none of the Presbyterians were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that he had sent an Ambassador to the Pope, and that the Pope had his <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> none of them believed that the <hi>English</hi> Court in those circumstances, would do any thing relating to Religion, but what was agreeable to the measures of the Conclave; none of them were ignorant, that Papists call all Protestants Hereticks, and that they damn all Hereticks to Hell; and that King <hi>Iames</hi> oft declared, that Presbyterians could not be Loyal; and that he could never so much forget the Murder of his Royal Father of ever Blessed Memory, as to trust them himself: There was none of them but knew, that every Zealous <hi>Papist</hi> believes the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Infallible; and that Infallibility is inconsistent with Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And therefore all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Laity were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less conscious, that the Indulgence given to them by a <hi>Popish</hi> King, assented unto by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio,</hi> conformable to the Sense of the Roman Conclave, could never be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52778:15"/>
intended for the Ease of <hi>Protestant Dissenters,</hi> but with design of making <hi>Papists</hi> share in the Blessing; and that by this step <hi>Papists,</hi> got into Power, might apply it to the overthrow of the Reformation, was doubtless obvious to every <hi>Presbyterian:</hi> And therefore the acceptance of, and thanksgiving for such an Indulgence, was a gross comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the designs for <hi>Popery,</hi> tending to the destruction of the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. All this Charge lies equally heavy upon the Ministers of that Perswasion, with these aggravating circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that whereas in the Reign of a <hi>Protestant</hi> King, they preached against <hi>Popery</hi> as imminent and at hand; they in the Reign of a <hi>Popish</hi> King, were guilty (for the most part) of shameful silence; yea when one of their number (more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the rest) <hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Hardy,</hi> in a Sermon at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> which he preached at their <hi>Provincial Assembly,</hi> had Exhorted them to take heed, that the Indulgence to <hi>Prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Dissenters, might not be an Engine for bringing <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> into the Kingdom; and when for the preaching of this Sermon, he was Arraigned for his Life, none of all his Brethren, nor any of the Laity, (except the good Mr. <hi>R. B—d</hi> Merchant in <hi>Edenborough)</hi> would shew him any Friendship: But on the contrary, they did openly condemn his doing his Duty, as <hi>indiscreet Zeal:</hi> And certainly he had suffered as the worst of Malefactors; had it not been for the Episcopal Advocates that pleaded for him, and the Episcopal Judges that acquitted him, and took all his danger upon themselves: Wherefore the impartial Resolution to the present Question, is this, That the <hi>Scotch Presbyterians</hi> were Compliers with the late Designs for taking away the legal Restraints against <hi>Papists.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A Third <hi>Prerogative Royal</hi> in the <hi>Crown of Scotland,</hi> is that of <hi>making Leagues and Conventions of the Subjects.</hi> Now that cannot consist with the Principles which flow from that <hi>Covenant</hi> which was entred into by the Assembly of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> without the <hi>King;</hi> and more particularly is it Invaded by those Principles by which they emitted an <hi>Act declaring against the bond subscribed by the</hi> Scotch <hi>Lords at</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iune 3. 1644.</note> Oxford, <hi>and inflicting the highest Ecclesiastical Censures against any who subscribed, or framed, or were accessary to the Execution of the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The making Peace and War with Foreign Princes, is another Branch of this Prerogative of the Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

acknowledged to be in the King. But this also, according to the Principles of Presbytery, is Usurped upon by that<note place="margin">K. Ch. 2. Part. 1. Act. 5.</note> Kirk; for she, in the Explication of the Sixth Article of the Covenant (already mention'd in the Fourth number concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Third Question) declares her self in her <hi>solemn and seasonable warning</hi> to all her Children of the Covenant, after this manner, <hi>Whosoever he be that will not according to</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Now the King's Power to <hi>chuse Officers of State, Counsellours and Iudges</hi> qualified by Law, to <hi>Call and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Parliaments</hi> by himself, and <hi>make Laws</hi> with their Advice, to make <hi>Leagues and Conventions of the Subjects,</hi> and to <hi>make Peace and War,</hi> being all <hi>Prerogatives</hi> Royal of the <hi>Crown of Scotland,</hi> asserted by <hi>Acts of Parliament unrepealed;</hi> and all these being so notoriously Usurped upon by the Presbyterian <hi>Kirk,</hi> the impartial Resolution of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is this, That this <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbytery in the Church, is Not Consistent with legal Monarchy in that Kingdom.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>QUESTION X.</hi> Whether <hi>Scottish Presbytery</hi> be agreeable to the general Inclination of that People?</head>
               <p n="1">1. AFter it hath been Demonstrated that the Principles of <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery are inconsistent with that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52778:17"/>
to say that Presbyterian Church-Government were agreeable to the mind of the Representatives of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the current Parliament, might be constructed the capital Crime of <hi>LEISING MAKING</hi> to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, against his Supreme Judicature: And therefore this Question hath Reference to the People whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and resolveth into this, Whether the generality of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation would be glad to accept of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> instead of the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> lately abolished.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the clearer resolution of the Question thus stated, that Kingdom may be distinguished into the <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy;</hi> and the <hi>Laity</hi> distinguished into the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Commons:</hi> And the <hi>Clergy</hi> again into the <hi>Bishops</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Pastors, after whom we may consider the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> and <hi>Colledges</hi> of Learning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the Nobility. Since that Honourable Estate of the Kingdom have by birth their Peerage in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, beside that it were <hi>Scandalum magnatum</hi> to say that they inclin'd to that Church Government, which is not consistent with their Monarchy; it were also a <hi>Scandalum Christianorum,</hi> to say that those Men of Honour and Conscience, who (a very few excepted) swore in the Test against all Fanatical Principles, and renounced all Covenant-Obligations, do incline to Presbytery. And it's well known that there never were in <hi>Scotland</hi> above a dozen of Peers so much Presbyterian as to refuse the Declaration against the Covenant-Principles, the taking of which qualified them to sit in Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, for the <hi>Scottish Gentry,</hi> it's certain, that not One of Forty in all <hi>Scotland</hi> but has taken the <hi>Test;</hi> and Four years ago, not Fifty in all <hi>Scotland</hi> (out of the <hi>West</hi>) did upon the Indulgence, forsake their Churches to frequent Meeting-Houses. And it cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52778:18"/>
of any who have so generous Blood in their Veins, that they should have so little Honour or Conscience as to Incline to that Church Government, which usurps the <hi>Priviledge of entring into Covenants and Leagues, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening in Assemblies, for Treating, Consulting and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in matters Ecclesiastical, without the Royal Command, or express License:</hi> Which is a Practice contradicting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory part of that Oath of the Test.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then for the Commons; it is certain that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them (as well as the richest and most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part) live in Cities and Market Towns; now all such Burgesses who were either worthy to be of the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the Towns they lived in, or were able to follow any ingenuous Trade, were obliged to take the <hi>Test</hi> before they could be qualified to elect Burgesses for Parliament; and therefore, according to their Sense and Conscience of an Oath, they cannot but have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version against <hi>Presbytery;</hi> yea, their loud Cries and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Tears at the Farewel-Sermons of their Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal-Pastors (for whom they would have pluckt out their right Eyes) in all other parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> but the <hi>Western</hi> Shires, heighteneth the probability, that they are not in love with Presbytery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then for the Clergy; since they all have owned Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination, sworn the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance, Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> and the <hi>Test,</hi> it cannot be suspected of any of them, without a blemish of their Integrity or Constancy, that they should be inclin'd to Presbyterian Government. And if Twenty of a Thousand are Trimmers betwixt the Bishop and the Presbyterian Moderator, yet sure those Twenty added to all the Field-Preachers and Meeting-house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not make up the number of a fifth part of the <hi>Episcopal Clergy:</hi> No doubt they will say, that what they want in the number, they have in the worth of their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52778:18"/>
Ministers: But how far we may believe them in their setting value upon themselves, may partly appear from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their late Commissioners to this Court; for doubtless, for the managing of their Cause, they made choice of the fittest Men they had, as for all other Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so especially for soundness in the Principles of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, also of the greatest moderation; and yet one of the Three, Mr. <hi>W—son,</hi> before he got his First Wife, was a malignant Lecturer under Bishops, and so continued, till his first disappointment of getting his Rectors Place, made him desert his own with Indignation, and that made him an enemy to Episcopacy. Another of them, Mr. <hi>K—dy,</hi> was, before the restitution of Bishops, deprived by his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Brethren, (to use their own Words as near as I can remember) <hi>as a Firebrand of Hell to inflame the Church on Earth.</hi> The Third is so famous, that I never heard of him till he came in this Character.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then in all the Four Universities, it is certain that not Four Masters, Head or Fellow, incline to Presbytery; and the Colledges of Justice and Physick at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> were so averse from it, that the generality of them were ready last Summer, to take Arms in defence of their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Ministers. Wherefore, since neither the most part of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Noblemen, Gentry or Commons, Clergy, Universities or Colleges, are for Presbytery, or in Honour or Conscience can be; we conclude, That <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbytery is not agreeable to the mind of that People.</p>
