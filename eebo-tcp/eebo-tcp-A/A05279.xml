            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee are heere assembled this day (as I trust in the feare of GOD and loue of our CHRIST) not to pray for the dead, or sorowe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as<note place="margin">1. Th. 4. 13</note> other that haue no hope, being taught by the Spirit, that who dye<note place="margin">Reuel. 14. 13.</note> in the Lord, rest from their labours and are fully blessed: But we are assembled rather to gaine by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seueritie of death, that which
<pb facs="tcp:8856:5"/>
for the most parte, we loose in the securitie of our life, <hi>viz:</hi> A true touch and feeling of our owne frailtye, taken from the dailye doomes of this declining worlde, whose flower (as you heere see) is fading, &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie but a blossome.</p>
            <p>For surely it is true in the steddie bole of all the worlde, which is heere falne out in a tender branch: There is an appointed time<note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 1</note> for all thinges vnder the Sunne: a time to plante, and a time to plucke vp: a time to build, and a time to pull downe: a time to gather, and a time to scatter: a time to rent and a time to sowe: a time to speake, and a time to keep silence: a time to laugh, and a time to weepe: a time to liue, and a time to dye: yea to dye, there is no remedie: <hi>Uni Deo nunquam senectus atra, nec mors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sophocles.</note> 
               <hi>sed alia miscet domitor aetas omnia.</hi> Onelye God, neither olde age nor blacke death can ouertake, but for al other things, deuouring time, hath and will turne them topsie turuye.</p>
            <p>In regard whereof, holy &amp; pacient <hi>Iob</hi> after much debate &amp; many pleadings with the sinnes of his soule and sorowes of his heart, doth at last (as you may heere see) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre
<pb facs="tcp:8856:5"/>
vpon the plea with death &amp; doome, thereby bringing vnto him selfe (in solace of his soule) a state of inheritance indefea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zible, with a Crowne of glorye that withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not.</p>
            <p>And this is done by a thrreefolde neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie laid vpon all flesh: 1. The first of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that's but once: 2. The second of liuing againe, and that's for euer: 3. The third and last of watchfulnes, and that's but for a time, euen till the day of our changing shall come.</p>
            <p>The necessitye of our dying is the doore of life, the necessitye of our liuing againe, is the doome of death: the necessitye of our watchfulnes is the Calender of our daies, to witte, how we haue liued, how we doe liue, and how we purpose to liue vntil our chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging shall come.</p>
            <p>Or thus: that of death, we deeme it the day of miserye: That of life againe, we holde it the day of glorye: That of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, we reckon it for the day of grace: And so, as one floud puts on an other, these three hale and help vs on to happy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whereof if you loose a linke, you break the Chayne and silken thrid should winde
<pb facs="tcp:8856:6"/>
you out of the laberinth of this worlde, to the porte and paradice of your God. For no blessed life without a blessed death, and no blessed death without a blessed life: and then are we blessed in both, when we stand vpon our guard and are found watchfull.</p>
            <p>1. Now for the first I say with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The crie of death.</hi> Ps. 89. 48. Gen. 2. 17. Heb. 9. 27 Dan. 6. 8.</note> What man liueth and shall not see death? shal he deliuer his soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of the graue? no, no, the decree of death is an imperial lawe, acted in paradice vpon Gods fayrest Creature, where sinne no sooner seizd but death entred, and hath euer since (like the lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi>) bene irreuocable.</p>
            <p>And though happily from the first death there lye an appeale to a better life, in the prerogatiue Court and high consistorie of our Christ, dead for our sinnes, but risen againe for our iustification: yet is there no repeale of that first lawe, by any latter acte, I say, no parliment to disanull the doome of death: No place priuiledged, no person ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, no time to interrupt the decree ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but like an omnipotent Queene and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of al the world, where sinne hath kist, she euer killeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8856:6"/>There is no safetie any where. If An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen sinne, downe they must: If <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice transgresse, out he must: If <hi>Iudas</hi> faile at the side of Christ, away hee must: where is a practise of sinning, there is euer a necessitie of dying, without either priuiledge of place, person, or presence: for thorow enuie of the Deuill came death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Wisd. 2. 24</note> this world, &amp; they that hold on his part shall prooue it.</p>

Must thou needes sinne? then surely shalt thou die: sinne and death are hereditarie, they dwel in one house, &amp; like <hi>Hipocrates</hi> twins, they laugh togeather, they weepe togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they liue together, they die together. And so shall till time bee no more, for no<note place="margin">Reu. 10. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>For conclusion of all, let Christ his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bee <hi>instar omnium</hi> and stand for all; who to take away the doubt, forbids the wonder of our new repaire, saying, maruell<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 28 29</note> not at this, for the houre shall come, in the which all that are in graues shall heare his voice and come forth.</p>

            <p>6, A sixt assurance is the pawne of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God within vs: for, as the Apostle<note place="margin">Ro. 8. 11</note> saith, if the spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead dwel in you, he that raised vp Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his spirit that dwelleth in you.

            <p>8. The eight and last, yet not the least Anchor of our sure hope and hold, is our possession of heauen already taken, whither our head is gon before, and there sits in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioribus</hi>
