            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE AUTHOR's PROLOGUE TO THE FIFTH BOOK.</head>
                  <p>INdefatigable Topers, and you Thrice precious Martyrs of the Smock, give me leave to put a ſerious Queſtion to your Worſhips, while you are idly ſtroak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Codpieces, and I my ſelf not much better employ'd: Pray, Why is it that people ſay, that men are not ſuch Sots now-a-days as they were in the days of Yore? <hi>Sot</hi> is an old word, that ſignifies a Dunce, Dullard, Jolthead, Gull, Wittal, or Noddy, one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Guts in his Brains, whoſe Cockloft is unfurniſh'd, and in ſhort, a Fool. Now would I know, Whether you would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by this ſame Saying, as indeed you lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically may, That formerly men were Fools,
<pb facs="tcp:100385:3"/>
and this Generation is grown Wiſe? How many and what diſpoſitions made them Fools? How many and what diſpoſitions were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make 'em Wiſe? Why were they Fools? How ſhould they be Wiſe? Pray, how came you to know that men were formerly Fools? How did you find that they are now Wiſe? Who the Devil made 'em Fools? Who a God's name made 'em Wiſe? Who d'ye think are moſt, thoſe that lov'd Mankind Fooliſh, or thoſe that love it Wiſe? How long has it been Wiſe? How long otherwiſe? Whence proceeded the foregoing Folly? Whence the following Wiſdom? Why did the old Folly end now, and no later? Why did the Modern Wiſdom begin now, and no ſooner? What were we the worſe for the former Folly? What the better for the ſucceeding Wiſdom? How ſhould the Ancient Folly be come to nothing? How ſhould this ſame new Wiſdom be ſtarted up and eſtabliſh'd?</p>
                  <p>Now anſwer me, an't pleaſe you; I dare not adjure you in ſtronger Terms, Reverend Sirs, leſt I make your pious fatherly Worſhips in the leaſt uneaſy. Come, pluck up a good heart, ſpeak the Truth, and ſhame the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Be cheery, my Lads, and if you are for me, take me off three or five Bumpers to the beſt, while I make an halt at the firſt part of the Sermon; then anſwer my Queſtion. If you are not, avaunt! avoid Satan! For I ſwear by my great Grandmother's Placket,
<pb facs="tcp:100385:3"/>
(and that's a horrid Oath!) that if you don't help me to ſolve that puzzling Problem, I will, nay, I already do repent, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it: For ſtill I muſt remain netled and gravell'd, and the Devil a bit I know how to get off. Well, what ſay you? I' faith, I begin to ſmell you out. You are not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to give me an anſwer; nor I neither, by theſe Whiskers. Yet to give ſome light into the buſineſs, I'll e'en tell you what had been anciently foretold in the matter, by a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Doc, who being mov'd by the Spirit in a Prophetic Vein, wrote a Book eclip'd, <hi>The Prelatical Bagpipe.</hi> What d'ye think the Old Fornicator ſaith? hearken, you Old Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, hearken now or never.

Now you have it, what do you make on't? The Seer is Ancient, the Style Laconic, the Sentences dark, like thoſe of <hi>Scotus,</hi> though they treat of matters dark enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The beſt Commentators on that good Father take the Jubilee after the Thirtieth, to be the years that are included in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age tili <hi>1550, [there being but one Jubilee every fifty years.]</hi> Men ſhall no longer be thought Fools next Green Peaſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>The Fools whoſe number, as <hi>Solomon</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies, is infinite, ſhall go to pot like a parcel of mad Bedlamites as they are; and all manner of Folly ſhall have an end, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo numberleſs, according to <hi>Avicenna, Maniae infinitae ſunt ſpecies.</hi> Having been driven back and hidden towards the Centre, during the rigour of the Winter, 'tis now to be ſeen on the Surface, and buds out like the Trees. This is as plain as a Noſe in a man's Face; you know it by experience, you ſee it. And it was formerly found out by that great good man <hi>Hippocrates, Aphoriſm. Verae etenim maniae, &amp;c.</hi> The World therefore, wiſifying it ſelf, ſhall no longer dread the Flower and Bloſſoms of Beans every coming
<pb facs="tcp:100385:4"/>
Spring; that is, as you may believe, Bumper in hand, and Tears in Eyes in the woful time of Lent, which us'd to keep them company.</p>
                  <p>Whole Cartloads of Books that ſeem'd flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid flouriſhing and flowry, gay and gawdy as ſo many Butterflies; but in the main were tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, dull, ſoporiferous, irkſome, miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, crabbed, knotty, puzzling, and dark as thoſe of Whining <hi>Heraclytus,</hi> as unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible as the Numbers of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that King of the Bean according to <hi>Horace</hi>: Thoſe Books, I ſay, have ſeen their beſt days, and ſhall ſoon come to nothing, being deliver'd to the executing Worms, and mercileſs Petty-Chandlers; ſuch was their Deſtiny, and to this they were Predeſtinated.</p>
                  <p>In their ſtead Beans in Cod are ſtarted up; that is, theſe Merry and Fructifying <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruelian</hi> Books, ſo much ſought now-a-days, in expectation of the following Jubilee's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; to the Study of which Writings all People have given their Minds; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly have gain'd the Name of Wiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, I think, I have fairly ſolv'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd your Problem; then reform and be the better for it. Hem once or twice like hearts of Oak, ſtand to your Pan-puddings, and take me off your Bumpers Nine go downs, and Huzza! ſince we are like to have a good Vintage, and Miſers hang themſelves: Oh! they'll coſt me an Eſtate in Hempen Collars if fair Weather hold. For I hereby promiſe to
<pb facs="tcp:100385:5"/>
furniſh them with twice as much as will do their buſineſs, on free coſt, as often as they will take the pains to dance at a Rope's end, providently to ſave Charges, to the no ſmall diſappointment of the Finiſher of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now my Friends, that you may put in for a ſhare of this new Wiſdom, and ſhake off the antiquated Folly, this very moment, ſcratch me out of your ſcrouls, and quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card the ſymbol of the old Philoſopher with the Golden Thigh, by which he has forbidden you to eat Beans: For you may take it for a truth granted among all Profeſſors in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good eating, that he enjoyn'd you not to taſte of them, only with the ſame kind intent that a certain freſh-water Phyſitian had, when he did forbid to <hi>Amer,</hi> late Lord of <hi>Camelotiere,</hi> kinſman to the Lawyer of that Name, the Wing of the Partridge, the Rump of the Chicken, and the Neck of the Pigeon, ſaying, <hi>Ala mala, Rumpum du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, Collum bonum pelle remotâ.</hi> For the Dunſical Dog-leech was ſo ſelfiſh, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them for his own dainty Chops, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his poor Patients little more than the bare Bones to pick, leſt they ſhould overload their ſqueemiſh Stomachs.</p>
                  <p>To the Heathen Philoſopher ſucceeded a pack of <hi>Capuſions,</hi> Monks, who forbid us the uſe of Beans, that is, <hi>Pantagruelian</hi> Books. They ſeem to follow the Example of <hi>Philox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus</hi> and <hi>Gnatho, Sicilians</hi> of fulſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb facs="tcp:100385:5"/>
the Ancient Maſter-Builders of their Monaſtick Cramgut Voluptuouſneſs; who when ſome dainty Bit was ſerv'd up at a Feaſt, filthily us'd to ſpit on it, that none but their naſty ſelves might have the ſtomach to eat of it, though their lickeriſh Chops watered never ſo much after it.</p>
                  <p>So thoſe hideous, ſnotty, pthiſicky, eves-dropping, muſty, moving Forms of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, both in publick and private, curſe thoſe dainty Books, and like Toads ſpit their Venom upon them.</p>
                  <p>Now though we have in our Mother-Tongue ſeveral excellent Works in Verſe and Proſe, and, Heav'n be prais'd, but little left of the Traſh and Trumpery ſtuff of thoſe dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Mumblers of <hi>Avemaries,</hi> and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harous foregoing <hi>Gothick</hi> Age; I have made bold to chuſe to chirrup and warble my plain Ditty, or as they ſay, to whiſtle like a Gooſe among the Swans, rather than be thought deaf among ſo many pretty Poets and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orators. And thus I am prouder of Acting the Clown, or any other under-part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many Ingenious Actors in that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Play; than of herding among thoſe Mutes, who, like ſo many ſhadows and Cyphers, only ſerve to fill up the Houſe, and make up a number, gaping and yawning at the Flies, and pricking up their Lugs, like ſo many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian</hi> Aſſes at the ſtriking up of the Muſick, thus ſilently giving to underſtand, that their
<pb facs="tcp:100385:6"/>

                  <p>Having taken this Reſolution, I thought it would not be amiſs to move my <hi>Diogenical</hi> Tub, that you might not accuſe me of living without Example.

Their Works are all <hi>Parian</hi> Marble, Alebaſter, Porphiry, and Royal Ciment, They treat of nothing but Heroick Deeds, Mighty things, grave and difficult matters, and this in a Crimſon Alamode Rhetorical Style. Their Writings are all Divine Nectar, rich, racy, ſparkling, delicate and luſcious Wine. Nor does our Sex wholly engroſs this Honour; Ladies have had their ſhare of the Glory: One of them of the Royal Blood of <hi>France,</hi> whom it were a Prophanation but to name here, ſurprizes the Age at once by her tranſcendent and Inventive Genius in her Writings, and the admirable Graces of her Style. Imitate thoſe great Exomples, if you can, for my part I cannot. Every one, you know, cannot go to <hi>Corinth.</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple, all could not give Gold by handfuls.</p>

                     <p>PUrſuing our Voyage, we ſail'd three days without diſcovering any thing; on the fourth we made Land. Our Pilot told us, That it was the <hi>Ringing Iſland,</hi> and indeed we heard a kind of a confus'd and often-repeated Noiſe, that ſeem'd to us at a great diſtance not unlike the ſound of great, middle-ſiz'd and little Bells rung all at once as 'tis cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary at <hi>Paris, Tours, Gergeau, Nantes,</hi> and elſewhere on high Holidays; and the nearer

we came to the Land, the louder we heard that Jangling.</p>
                     <p>Some of us doubted that this was the <hi>Dodonoan</hi> Kettles, or the <hi>Portico</hi> call'd <hi>Hepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone</hi> in <hi>Olympia,</hi> or the Eternal humming of the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> rais'd on <hi>Memnon</hi>'s Tomb in <hi>Thebes</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the horrid Din that us'd formerly to be heard about a Tomb at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para,</hi> one of the <hi>Eolian</hi> Iſlands. But this did not ſquare with Chorography.</p>
                     <p>I don't know, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> but that ſome ſwarms of Bees here abouts may be taking a Ramble in the Air, and ſo the Neighbourhood make this dingle dangle with Pans, Kettles, and Baſons, the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let's har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken! when we were nearer, among the everlaſting Ringing, we heard the indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Singing (as we thought) of ſome Men. For this Reaſon, before we offer'd to Land on the <hi>Ringing Iſland, Pantagruel</hi> was of opinion that we ſhould go in the Pinnace to a ſmall Rock, near which we diſcover'd an Hermitage, and a little Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. There we found a diminutive old Hermit, whoſe name was <hi>Braguibus,</hi> born at <hi>Glenay.</hi> He gave us a full Account of all the Jangling, and regal'd us after a ſtrange ſort of a faſhion; four live-long-days, did he make us faſt, aſſuring us, That we ſhould not be admitted into the <hi>Ringing

To deal plainly with you, my dear <hi>Pater,</hi> cri'd <hi>Panurge,</hi> being at Sea, I much more fear being wet, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warm, and being drown'd than being burnt.</p>
                     <p>Well, however, let us faſt a God's Name; yet I have faſted ſo long, that it has quite undermin'd my Fleſh, and I fear that at laſt,

the Baſtions of this Bodily Fort of mine will fall to ruin. Beſides, I am much more affraid of vexing you in this ſame Trade of Faſting, for the Devil a bit I underſtand any thing in it, and it becomes me very ſcurvily, as ſeveral People have told me, and I am apt to believe them. For my part, I have no great Stomach to Faſting; for alas, 'tis as eaſy as piſſing a Bed, and a Trade of which any body may ſet up, there needs no Tools. I am much more inclin'd not to faſt for the future; for to do ſo, there's ſome Stock requir'd, and ſome Tools are ſet a work. No matter, ſince you are ſo ſtedfaſt, and have us faſt, let's faſt as faſt as we can, and then break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the name of Famine; now we are come to theſe <hi>eſurial</hi> idle Days. I vow, I had quite put them out of my head long ago. If we muſt faſt, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> I ſee no other Remedy but to get rid of it as ſoon as we can, as we would out of a bad way. I'll in that ſpace of time ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what look over my Papers, and examine whether the Marine Study be as good as ours at Land.

                     <p>HAving faſted as aforeſaid, the Hermit gave us a Letter for one whom he call'd <hi>Albiam Camar,</hi> Maſter <hi>Aedituus</hi> of the <hi>Ringing Iſland</hi>; but <hi>Panurge</hi> greeting him, call'd him, Maſter <hi>Antitus.</hi> He was a little quear old Fellow, bald pated, with a Snout whereat you might eaſily have light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Card-match, and a Phiz as red as a Cardinal's Cap.

                     <p>There I had a full Account of all that <hi>Atteius Capito, Paulus Marcellus, A.

After this the Devil a word we could get out of him but of Birds and Cages.</p>
                     <p>The Cages were ſpacious, coſtly, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, and of an admirable Architecture. The Birds were large, fine, and neat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; looking as like the men in my Country, as one Pea do's like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they eat and drank like men, muted like men, endued or digeſted like men, farted like men, but ſtunk like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſlept, bill'd and trod their Females like men, but ſomewhat oftener; in ſhort, had you ſeen and examin'd 'em from Top to Toe, you would have laid your head to a Turnip, that they had been meer men. However, they were nothing leſs, as Maſter

                        <hi>Aedituus</hi> told us; aſſuring us at the ſame time, that they were neither Secular nor Layick; and 'truth is, the diverſity of their Feathers and Plumes, did not a little puzzle us..</p>
                     <p>Some of them were all over as white as Swans, others as black as Crows, many as grey as Owls, others black and white like Magpyes, ſome all red like Red-birds, and others purple and white like ſome Pigeons. He call'd the Males, Clerghawks, Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, Prieſthawks, Abbothawks, Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, Cardinhawks, and one, Popehawk, who is a Species by himſelf. He call'd the Females, Clergkites, Nunkites, Prieſtkites, Abbeſskites, Biſhkites, Cardinkites, and Popekites.</p>
                     <p>However, ſaid he, as Hornets and Drones, will get among the Bees, and there do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but buzz, eat and ſpoil every thing, ſo, for theſe laſt Three hundred Years, a vaſt Swarm of Bigottello's flockt I don't know how among theſe goodly Birds eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fifth full Moon, and have bemuted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray'd, and conskited the whole Iſland.

                     </p>
                     <p>Of this laſt kind, there never is more than one at a time, as in a Beehive there

                     <p>When the <hi>Popehawk</hi> dies, another ariſes in his ſtead out of the whole Brood of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinhawks,</hi> that is, as you muſt underſtand it all along, without carnal Copulation. So that there is in that Species an individual Unity, with a perpetuity of Succeſſion, neither more nor leſs than in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phoenix.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that about Two thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred and ſixty Moons ago, two <hi>Popehawks</hi> were ſeen upon the Face of the Earth; but then you never ſaw in your lives ſuch a woful Rout and Hurly-burly as was all over this Iſland. For all theſe ſame Birds did ſo peck, clapperclaw and maul one another all that time, that there was the Devil and all to do, and the Iſland was in a fair way of being left without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Some ſtood up for this <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk,</hi> ſome for t'other.

                     <p>During theſe troubleſome Times, they call'd to their Aſſiſtance the Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths of the World that live on t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the water; nor was this Schiſm

and Sedition at an end, till one of them died, and the Plurality was reduc'd to Unity.</p>
                     <p>We then ask'd what mov'd thoſe Birds to be thus continually chanting and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? he anſwer'd, that it was the Bells that hang'd on the Tops of their Cages.

others Green, ſome Red, others Purple, and ſome Blue. Who are thoſe, ask'd <hi>Panurge,</hi> and how do you call them? They are Mongrels, quoth <hi>Aedituus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We call them Knighthawks, and they have a great number of rich <hi>Commanderies,</hi> (fat Livings) in your World. Good your Worſhip, ſaid I, make them give us a Song, an't pleaſe you, that we may know how they ſing. They ſcorn your words, cry'd <hi>Aedituus,</hi> they are none of your Singing Birds; but to make amends, they feed as much as the beſt two of them all. Pray, where are their Hens, where are their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, ſaid I? They have none, anſwer'd <hi>Aedituus.</hi> How comes it to paſs then, ask'd <hi>Panurge,</hi> that they are thus beſcabb'd, beſcurf'd, all embroider'd o're the Phiz with Carbuncles, Puſhes, and Pockroyals; Some of which undermine the handles of their Faces.

                     <p>He then acquainted us with the occaſion of their coming. This, next to us, ſaid he, looks ſo wiſtfully upon you, to ſee whether he may not find among your Company a ſtately gawdy kind of huge dreadful Birds of Prey, which yet are ſo untoward, that they ne're could be brought

All that's true enough, good Maſter <hi>Aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> but we have not the honour to be acquainted with their Knight-ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Come on, cry'd <hi>Aedituus</hi> in a merry mood, we have had Chat enough o' Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! let's e'en go Drink, — and Eat, quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>: Eat, reply'd <hi>Aedituus,</hi> and Drink bravely old Boy; Twiſt like Plough-jobbers, and Swill like Tinkers, Pull away and ſave Tide; for nothing is ſo dear or precious as Time, therefore we'll be ſure to put it to a good uſe.</p>

Stormy for four days together. We can give no other reaſon for it, but that it is a piece of its Civility, that thoſe who come among us may ſtay whether they will or no, and be copiouſly Feaſted all the while with the incomes of the Ringing.

                     <p>AS ſoon as we had caſt Anchor and had mor'd the Ship, the Pinnace was put over the Ship's ſide, and Mann'd by the Coxſwain's Crew. When the good <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had prayed publickly, and given thanks to the Lord that had deliver'd him from ſo great a Danger, he ſtept into it with his whole Company, to go on ſhore, which was no ways difficult to do; for as the Sea was Calm, and the Winds laid, they ſoon got to the Cliffs. When they were ſet on ſhore, <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the Scituation of the Place, and the ſtrange ſhape of the Rocks, diſcover'd ſome of the Natives.

of Satin, and the upper part of them Leather, a Coif like a Black Pot tipp'd with Tin; he was a good likely ſort of a Body, and his name, as we heard afterwards, was <hi>Double-fee. Epiſtemon</hi> ask'd him, how they call'd thoſe ſtrange Craggy Rocks and Deep Vallies? he told him it was a Colony, brought out of <hi>Attorney-land,</hi> and call'd <hi>Proceſs</hi>; and that if we forded the River ſomewhat further beyond the Rocks, we ſhould come into the Iſland of the <hi>Apede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</hi> By the memory of the <hi>Decretals,</hi> ask'd Fryer <hi>Ihon,</hi> tell us, I pray you, what you honeſt men here live on?

                     <p>Still talking on, they got to the Iſland of the <hi>Apedefers,</hi> for they were ſoon got over the Ford. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was not a little

taken up with admiring the Structure and Habitation of the People of the Place. For they live in a ſwindging Wine-preſs, fifty ſteps up to it; you muſt know there are ſome of all ſorts, little, great, private, middleſiz'd, and ſo forth. You go through a large <hi>Periſtile, alias</hi> a long Entry ſet about with Pillars, in which you ſee in a kind of Landskip the Ruins of almoſt the whole World; beſides ſo many great Robbers Gibbets, ſo many Gallows and Racks, that 'tis enough to fright you out of your ſeven Senſes. <hi>Double-fee</hi> perceiving that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was taken up with Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe things, Let us go further, Sir, ſaid he to him, all this is nothing yet.

I had rather be drinking, than ſtaring on thoſe Ruins.

You need not ask whether Maſter <hi>Ihon</hi> and <hi>Panurge</hi> made much of their ſweet ſelves there; 'tis enough that I tell you, there was no want of <hi>Bolonia</hi> Sawcidges, Turky-poots, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Buſtards, Malmeſy, and all other ſorts of good Belly-Timber, very well dreſt.</p>

                     <p>Then <hi>Double-fee</hi> led us up a private Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and ſhew'd us into a Room, whence, without being ſeen, out at a Loop-hole, we could ſee their Worſhips in the great Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, where none could be admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their leave. Their Worſhips, as he call'd them, were about a ſcore of fuſty Crackropes and Gallowclappers, or rather more, all poſted before a Bar, and ſtaring at each other like ſo many dead Pigs: Their Paws were as long as a Crane's Foot, and their Claws four and twenty Inches long at leaſt; for you muſt know, they are injoin'd never to pair off the leaſt Chip of them, ſo that they grow as crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Welch Hook, or a Hedging Bill.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw a ſwindging Bunch of Grapes that are gather'd and ſqueez'd in that

                     <p>
                        <hi>Double-fee</hi> told us they had not often ſuch huge Bunches, but, let the worſt come to the worſt, they were ſure never to be without others in their Preſs. But hark you me, Maſter of mine, ask'd <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge,</hi> Have they not ſome of different growth? ay marry have they, quoth <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-fee</hi>; do you ſee here this little Bunch, to which they are going to give 'tother wrinch; 'Tis of Tyth-growth you muſt know; they cruſh'd, wrung, ſqueez'd and ſtrain'd out the very heart's blood of it but t'other day, but it did not bleed freely, the Oil came hard, and ſmelt of the Prieſt's Cheſt; ſo that they found there was not much good to be got out of 't. Why then, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> do they put it again into the Preſs? only, anſwer'd <hi>Double-fee,</hi> for fear there ſhould ſtill lurk ſome Juice among the Husks, and Hullings, in the Mother of the Grape. The Devil be damn'd, cri'd Frier <hi>Ihon,</hi> do you call theſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100385:21"/>
ſame Folks illiterate Lobcocks, and Dunſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doddipoles? may I be broil'd like a Red-herring, if I don't think they are wiſe enough to skin a Flint, and draw Oil out of a Brick-wall. So they are, ſaid <hi>Double-fee,</hi> for they ſometimes put Caſtles, Parks and Foreſts into the Preſs, and out of them all extract <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> You mean, <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> I ſuppoſe, cri'd <hi>Epiſtemon, ſuch as may be born.</hi> I mean as I ſaid, repli'd <hi>Double-fee, Potabile, ſuch as may be drunk</hi>; for it makes them drink many a good Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than otherwiſe they ſhould.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot better ſatisfy you as to the growths of the Vine-tree Syrup that is here ſqueez'd out of Grapes, than in deſiring you to look your ſelf yonder in that Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, where you'll ſee above a thouſand different growths that lie a waiting to be ſqueez'd every moment. Here are ſome of the publick, and ſome of the private growth; ſome of the Builders, Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Loans, Gifts and Gratuities, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheats, Forfeitures, Fines and Recoveries, Penal Statutes, Crown-Lands and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne, Privy-Purſe, Poſt-Office, Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Lordſhips of Mannors, and a world of other growths for which we want Names. Pray, quoth <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> tell me of what growth is that great one with all thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Grapelings</hi> about it. Oh, oh! return'd <hi>Double-fee,</hi> that plump one is of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,

the very beſt growth in the whole Countrey; whenever any one of that growth is ſqueez'd, there is not one of their Worſhips but gets Juice enough out of it to ſoak his Noſe ſix Months together. When their Worſhips were up, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> deſir'd <hi>Double-fee</hi> to take us into that great Wine-preſs, which he readily did.

                     <p>From thence, as he was leading us to ſee a thouſand little puny Preſſes, we ſpy'd another paltry Bar, about which ſate four or five ignorant waſpiſh Churls, of ſo teſty, fuming a Temper, and ſo ready to take Pepper in the Noſe for Yea and Nay, that a Dog would not have liv'd with 'em. They were hard at it, with the lees and dregs of the Grapes, which they grip'd over and over again, might and main, with their clench'd Fiſts.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> who had always twenty yards of Gut ready empty, to ſwallow a Gallimaufry of Lawyers, began to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of humour, and deſir'd <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> to remember he had not din'd, and bring <hi>Double-fee</hi> along with him.

                     <p>WHen we had cramm'd and cramm'd again, <hi>Aedituus</hi> took us into a Chamber that was well furniſh'd, hung with Tapeſtry, and finely gilt.

With theſe Antidotes, that were like a ſweeter <hi>Lethe,</hi> he invited us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the hardſhips of our Voyage; and at the ſame time he ſent plenty of Proviſions on Board our Ships that rid in the Harbour. After this, we e'en jogg'd to Bed for that Night, but the Devil-a-bit poor Pilgarlic could ſleep one wink, the everlaſting jingle-jangle of the Bells kept me awake whether I would or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100385:24"/>About midnight <hi>Aedituus</hi> came to wake us, that we might drink. He himſelf ſhew'd us the way, ſaying, You Men of t'other World ſay that Ignorance is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Evil, and ſo far you are right; yet for all that, you don't take the leaſt care to get rid of it, but ſtill plod on, and live in it, with it, and by it, for which cauſe a plaguy-deal of miſchief lights on you every day, and you are right enough ſerv'd; you are perpetually ailing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, making a moan, and never right. 'Tis what I was ruminating upon juſt now. And, indeed, Ignorance keeps you here faſten'd in Bed, juſt as that Bully-rock <hi>Mars</hi> was detain'd by <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Art; for all the while you don't mind that you ought to ſpare ſome of your Reſt, and be as laviſh as you can of the Goods of this famous Iſland. Come, come, you ſhou'd have eaten three Breakfaſts already, and take this from me for a certain Truth, That if you wou'd conſume the Mouth-Ammunition of this Iſland, you muſt riſe betimes; Eat them, they multiply; Spare them, they dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
                     <p>For Example: Mow a Field in due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Graſs will grow thicker and better; don't mow it, and in a ſhort time 'twill be floor'd with Moſs. Let's drink, and drink again my Friends; come, let's all carouſe it. The leaneſt of our Birds are

                     <p>When Day peeping in the Eaſt, made the Sky turn from Black to Red, like a boiling Lobſter, he wak'd us again to take a Diſh of Monaſtical Broweſs. From that time we made but one Meal that only laſted the whole Day, ſo that I cannot well tell how I may call it, whether Dinner, Supper, Nunchion, or After-Supper; only to get a Stomach, we took a turn or two in the Iſland, to ſee and hear the bleſſed ſinging Birds.</p>
                     <p>At Night <hi>Panurge</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aedituus,</hi> give me leave, ſweet Sir, to tell you a merry Story of ſomething that happen'd ſome three and twenty Moons ago in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Chaſtelleraudland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Groom, <hi>Roger</hi> by Name, was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter's Horſes in ſome fallow ground. There 'twas his good Fortune to find a pretty Shepherdeſs, feeding her bleeting Sheep, and harmleſs Lambkins, on the Brow of a neighbouring Mountain, in the ſhade of an adjacent Grove: Near her, ſome frisking Kids tripp'd it o're a green Carpet of Nature's own ſpreading, and to compleat the Paſtoral Landskip, There ſtood an Aſs. <hi>Roger,</hi> who was a Wag, had a Diſh of Chat with her, and after ſome If's, And's,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100385:25"/>
and But's, Hem's, and Heighs on her ſide, got her in the mind to get up behind him, to go and ſee his Stable, and there take a Bit by the bye in a Civil way. While they were holding a parley, the Horſe directing his diſcourſe to the Aſs (for all Brute Beaſts ſpoke that year in divers places) whiſper'd theſe words in his Ear: Poor Aſs, how I pitty thee! Thou ſlaveſt like any Hack, I read it on thy Crupper; thou do'ſt well, however, ſince God has created thee to ſerve Mankind; thou art a very honeſt Aſs: But not to be better Rub'd down, Curri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd, Trap'd, and Fed than thou art, ſeems to me indeed to be too hard a Lot. Alas! Thou art all Rough-coated, in ill Plight; Jaded, Foundred, Creſtfallen, and Drooping like a Mooting Duck, and Feedeſt here on nothing but courſe Graſs, or Bryars and Thiſtles: Therefore do but Pace it along with me, and thou ſhalt ſee how we noble Steeds, made by Nature for War, are Treated; come, thou'lt loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by coming, I'll get thee a taſte of my Fare. I' troth Sir, I can but love you and thank you, return'd the Aſs; I'll wait on you, good Mr. Steed. Methinks, Gaffer Aſs, you might as well have ſaid, Sir <hi>Grandpaw</hi> Steed: Oh! Cry mercy, good Sir <hi>Grandpaw,</hi> return'd the Aſs; we Country Clowns are ſomewhat groſs, and apt to knock Words out of joynt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

an't pleaſe you, I'll come after your Worſhip at ſome diſtance, leſt for taking this Run my ſide ſhould chance to be Firk'd and Curried with a Vengeance, as 'tis but too often, the more's my ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>The Sheperdeſs being got behind <hi>Roger,</hi> the Aſs followed, fully reſolv'd to Bate like a Prince with <hi>Roger</hi>'s Steed. But when they got to the Stable, the Groom who ſpy'd the Grave Animal, order'd one of his Underlings to welcome him with the Pitch-fork, and Curricomb him with a Cudgel. The Aſs who heard this, recommended himſelf <hi>Mentally</hi> to the God <hi>Neptune,</hi> and was packing off, thinking, and ſyllogiſing within himſelf thus; Had not I been an Aſs, I had not come here among great Lords, when I muſt needs be ſenſible that I was only made for the uſe of the ſmall Vulgar; <hi>Aeſop</hi> had given me a fair warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this in one of his Fables.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Sheperdeſs who ſaw her Aſs ſcour off, told <hi>Roger</hi> that 'twas her Cattle, and deſir'd he might be kindly us'd, or elſe ſhe would not ſtir her foot over the Threſhold
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100385:26"/>
Friend <hi>Roger</hi> no ſooner knew this, but he order'd him to be fetch'd in, and that my Maſter's Horſes ſhould rather chop Straw for a Week together, than my Miſtreſs's Beaſt ſhould want his Belly full of Corn.</p>
                     <p>The moſt difficult point was to get him back; for in vain the youngſters compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and cox'd him to come; I dare not, ſaid the Aſs, I am baſhful; and the more they ſtrove by fair means to bring him with them, the more the ſtubborn Thing was untoward, and flew out at heels; Inſomuch that they might have been there to this hour, had not his Miſtreſs advis'd them to toſs Oats in a Sive, or in a Blanket, and call him, which was done, and made him wheel about, and ſay; Oats with a witneſs, Oats ſhall go to pot, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniat</hi>; Oats will do, there's Evidence in the Caſe; but none of the Rubbing down, non of the Firking. Thus Melodiouſly Singing, for as you know that <hi>Arcadian</hi> Bird's Note is very Harmonious, he came to the young Gentlemen of the Horſe, <hi>alias</hi> Blackgarb, who brought him into the Stable.</p>
                     <p>When he was there, they plac'd him next to the great Horſe, his Friend, Rub'd him him down, Curricom'd him, laid clean Straw under him up to his Chin, and there he lay at Rack and Manger; the firſt ſtuff'd with ſweet Hay, the latter with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100385:27"/>
Oats; which when the Horſe-<hi>Valets-de Chambre</hi> ſifted, he clap'd down his Lugs to tell them by Signs that he would Eat it but too well without ſifting, and that he did not deſerve ſo great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>When they had well Fed, quoth the Horſe to the Aſs, Well poor Aſs, how is it with thee now? How doſt thou like this Fare?

As for any thing elſe we are as happy as our Maſter, and perhaps more. By this Packſaddle, my old Acquaintance, quoth the Aſs, I have done with you, a fart for thy Litter and Hay, and a fart for thy Oats: Give me the Thiſtles of our Fields, ſince there we leap when we liſt: Eat leſs, and leap the more, I ſay; 'tis Meat, Drink and Cloath to us. Ah! Friend <hi>Grandpaw,</hi> it would do thy heart good to ſee us at a Fair when we hold our Provincial Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!

Come on, I am of your mind.</p>
                     <p>As we went back to have t'other fud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling Bout, we ſpy'd an old green-headed <hi>Biſhhawk,</hi> who ſate moping with his Mate and three jolly <hi>Bitter</hi> Attendants, all ſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring under an Arbor. Near the old Chuff ſtood a buxom <hi>Abbeskite,</hi> that ſung like any Linet; and we were ſo mightily tickl'd with her ſinging, that I vow and ſwear we could have wiſh'd all our Members but one turn'd into Ears, to have had more of the melody. Quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> This pretty Cherubin of Cherubins is here breaking her Head with chanting to this huge, fat, ugly-face, who lies grunting all the while like a Hog as he is. I'll make him change his Note preſently in the Devil's Name.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100385:29"/>
With this he rang a Bell that hung over the <hi>Biſhhawk's</hi> Head; but tho he rang and rang again, the Devil a-bit <hi>Biſhawk</hi> would hear; the lowder the ſound, the lowder his ſnoring. There was no making him ſing. By G—quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> You old Buzzard, If you won't ſing by fair means, you ſhall by foul. Having ſaid this, he took up one of St. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Loaves, <hi>alias</hi> a Stone, and was going to hit him with it about the middle. But <hi>Aedituus</hi> cry'd to him, Hold, hold, honeſt Friend, ſtrike, wound, poyſon, kill and murther all the Kings and Princes in the world, by Treachery, or how thou wilt, and as ſoon as thou wouldſt, unneſtle the Angels from their Cockloft, <hi>Popehawk</hi> will pardon thee all this. But never be ſo mad as to meddle with theſe ſacred Birds, as much as thou lov'ſt the profit, welfare and life not only of thy ſelf, and thy Friends and Relations alive or dead, but alſo of thoſe that may be born hereafter to the thouſandth Generation; for ſo long thou wouldſt entail miſery upon them. Do but look upon that Baſin.

                     <p>The third day (after we had drank, as you muſt underſtand) <hi>Aedituus</hi> diſmiſs'd us.

                     <p>HAving well ballaſted the holds of our Human Veſſels, we weigh'd Anchor, hois'd up Sail, ſtow'd the Boats, ſet the Land, and ſtood for the Offing with a fair loom Gale, and for more haſt unparrell'd the Miſen yard, and lanch'd it and the Sail over her Lee-quarter, and fitted Gives to keep it ſteady, and boom'd it out; ſo in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100385:30"/>
three days we made the Iſland of <hi>Tools,</hi> that is altogether uninhabited. We ſaw there a great number of Trees which bore Mattocks, Pickaxes, Crows, weeding Hooks, Sythes, Sickles, Spades, Trowels, Hatchets, hedging Bills, Saws, Addes, Bills, Axes, Sheers, Pincers, Bolts, Piercers, Augres and Wimbles.</p>
                     <p>Others bore Dags, Daggers, Poniards, Bayonets, Square-bladed Tucks, Stilet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, Poinadoes, Skenes, Penknives, Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons, Bodkins, Swords, Rapiers, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwords, Cutlaſſes, Semiters, Hangers, Falchions, Glaives, <hi>Raillons,</hi> Whittles and Whinyards.</p>
                     <p>Whoever would have any of theſe, needed but to ſhake the Tree, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they dropp'd down as thick as Hops, like ſo many ripe Plumbs; nay, what's more, they fell on a kind of Graſs call'd Scabbard, and ſheath'd themſelves in it cleverly. But when they came down there was need of taking care leſt they happen'd to touch the Head, Feet, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts of the Body. For they fell with the point downwards, and in they ſtuck, or ſlit the <hi>continuum</hi> of ſome Member, or lopt it off like a Twig; either of which generally was enough to have kill'd a man though he were a hundred year old, and worth as many thouſand Spankers, Spur-royals and Roſe-nobles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100385:31"/>Under ſome other Trees, whoſe names I can't juſtly tell you, I ſaw ſome certain ſorts of Weeds that grew and ſprouted like Pikes, Lances, Javelins, Javelots, Darts, Dartlets, Halbarts, Boarſpears, Eelſpears, Partiſans, Tridentes, Prongs, Trout-ſtaves, Spears, Half-pikes and Hunting Staffs. As they ſprouted up and chanc'd to touch the Tree, ſtrait they met with their Heads, Points and Blades, each ſuitable to its Kind, made ready for them by the Trees over them; as ſoon as every individual Wood was grown up, fit for its Steel; even like the Childrens Coats that are made for them as ſoon as they can wear them, and you Weane them of their Swadling Clothes; nor do you mutter, I pray you, at what <hi>Plato, Anaxogoras</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> have ſaid; Od's fiſh! they were none of your Lower-Form Gimcracks; were they?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Trees ſeem'd to us Terreſtrial Animals, in no wiſe ſo different from Brute Beaſts as not to have Skin, Fat, Fleſh, Veins, Arteries, Ligaments, Nerves, Cartilages, Kernels, Bones, Marrow, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, <hi>Matrices,</hi> Brains and Articulations; for they certainly have ſome, ſince <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> will have it ſo; but in this point they differ'd from other Animals, that their Heads, that is, the part of their Trunks next to the Root are downwards;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100385:31"/>
their Hair, that is, their Roots, in the Earth; and their Feet, that is their Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, upſide down; as if a man ſhould ſtand on his Head with out ſtretch'd Legs. And as you, batter'd Sinners, on whom <hi>Venus</hi> has beſtow'd ſomething to remember her, feel the approach of Rains, Winds, Cold, and every Change of Weather, at your <hi>Iſchiatic</hi> Legs, and your <hi>Omoplates,</hi> by means of the perpetual Almanac which ſhe has fix'd there; So theſe Trees have notice given them by certain ſenſations which they have at their Roots, Stocks, Gums, Paps or Marrow, of the growth of the Staffs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; and accordingly they prepare ſuitable Points and Blades for them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. Yet as all things, except God, are ſometimes ſubject to Error, Nature its ſelf not free from it, when it produceth Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous things; likewiſe I obſerv'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs in theſe Trees. For a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike that grew up high enough to reach the Branches of one of theſe Inſtrumentiferous Trees, happen'd no ſooner to touch them, but inſtead of being join'd to an Iron-head, it impal'd a ſtubb'd Broom at the Fonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Well, no matter, 'twill ſerve to ſweep the Chimney. Thus a Pertuſan met with a Pair of Garden-ſhears; Come, all's good for ſomething, 'twill ſerve to nip off little Twigs, and deſtroy Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars. The Staff of a Halbert got the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100385:32"/>
Blade of a Sythe, which made it look like an Hermaphrodite; happy be lucky, 'tis all a caſe, 'twill ſerve for ſome Mower. Oh 'tis a great bleſſing to put our truſt in the Lord! As we went back to our Ships, I ſpy'd behind I don't know what Buſh, I don't know what Folks, doing I don't know what buſineſs, in I don't know what poſture, ſcowring I don't know what Tools, in I don't know what manner, and I don't know what place.</p>

                     <p>WE left the Iſland of Tools to purſue our Voyage, and the next day ſtood in for the Iſland of Sharping, the true Image of <hi>Fontainbleau</hi>; for the Land is ſo very lean there, that the Bones, that is the Rocks, ſhoot through its Skin. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis ſandy, barren, and unpleaſant. Our Pilot ſhew'd us there two little ſquare Rocks, which had eight equal Points in the ſhape of a Cube; they were ſo white that I might have miſtaken them for Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter or Snow, had he not aſſur'd us they were made of Bone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100385:32"/>He told us that twenty chance Devils, very much fear'd in our Countrey, dwelt there in ſix different Stories, and that the biggeſt Twins or Braces of them were call'd Sixes, and the ſmalleſt Amb'ſace; the reſt Cinques, Quaters, Treys and Dewſes. When they were conjur'd up, otherwiſe coupled, they were call'd either, Sice cincq, Sice quater, Sice trey, Sice dewſe, and Sice ace; or Cincq quater, Cincq trey, and ſo forth. I made there a ſhrewd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; would you know what 'tis, Gameſters? 'Tis that there are very few of you in the world but what call upon and invoke the Devils. For the Dice are no ſooner thrown on the board, and the greedy gazing Sparks have hardly ſaid, <hi>two ſixes, Frank,</hi> but <hi>ſix Devils damn it,</hi> cry as many of them; If amb's Ace, then, <hi>A Brace of Devils broil me,</hi> will they ſay. <hi>Quater Deuſe,</hi> Tom; <hi>The Dewſe take it,</hi> cries another, and ſo on to the end of the Chapter. Nay, they don't forget ſometimes to call the Black Cloven-footed Gentlemen by their Criſten-names and Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names; and what's ſtranger yet, they uſe them as their greateſt Cronies, and make them ſo often the Executors of their Wills, not only giving themſelves, but every body and every thing to the Devil, that there's no doubt but he takes care to ſeize, ſoon or late, what's ſo zealouſly bequeath'd him.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100385:33"/>
Indeed 'tis true, <hi>Lucifer</hi> do's not always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear by his lawful Attornies; but alas!

                     <p>He then told us, that more Wrecks had happen'd about thoſe Square-rocks, and a greater loſs of Body and Goods, than about all the <hi>Syrtes, Sylla's</hi> and <hi>Charibdes, Sirens, Scrophades</hi> and <hi>Gulphs</hi> in the Univerſe.

                     <p>He alſo told us that there was a Phial of <hi>Sang real,</hi> a moſt divine thing, and known but to a few. <hi>Panurge</hi> did ſo ſweeten up the Syndics of the place, that they bleſt us with the ſight of't: But it was with three times more pother and ado, with more Formalities and antick Tricks, than they ſhew the Pandects of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> or the Holy <hi>Veronica</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> I never ſaw ſuch a ſight of Flambeaux, Torches and

                     <p>All that we ſaw there worth ſpeaking of, was a good face ſet upon an ill game, and the ſhells of the two Eggs formerly laid up and hatch'd by <hi>Leda,</hi> out of which came <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> fair <hi>Helen</hi>'s brothers. Theſe ſame Syndics ſold us a piece of 'em for a Song, I mean, for a morſel of bread.

                     <p>FRiar <hi>Ihon</hi> had hardly ſaid thoſe words e're he perceiv'd Seventy Eight Gallies and Frigats juſt arriving at the Port. So he hied him thither to learn ſome News; and as he ask'd what Goods they had o'board, he ſoon found that their whole Cargo was Veniſon, Hares, Capons, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, Pigs, Swine, Bacon, Kids, Calves, Hens, Ducks, Teals, Geeſe, and other Poultry and Wild-fowl.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:100385:41"/>He alſo ſpy'd among theſe ſome pieces of Velvet, Satin and Damask. This made him ask the New-comers whither and to whom they were going to carry thoſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Goods? They anſwer'd that they were for <hi>Gripe-men-all,</hi> and the Furr'd Law-Cats.</p>
                     <p>Pray, ask'd he, what's the true name of all theſe things, in your Countrey Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage? <hi>Corruption,</hi> they repli'd. If they live on Corruption, ſaid the Friar, they'll periſh with their Generation; May the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be damn'd, I have it now: Their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers devour'd the good Gentlemen, who, according to their ſtate of life, us'd to go much a Hunting and Hawking to be the better inur'd to Toil in time of War; For Hunting is an Image of a Martial Life; and <hi>Xenophon</hi> was much in the right on't, when he affirm'd that Hunting had yielded a great number of excellent War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, as well as the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe. For my part I am no Scholar, I have it but by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, yet I believe it. Now the Souls of thoſe brave Fellows, according to <hi>Gripe-men-all</hi>'s Riddle, after their deceaſe, enter into Wild-boars, Stags, Roe-bucks, Herns, and ſuch other Creatures, which they lov'd, and in queſt of which they went while they were men; and theſe Furr'd Law-Cats having firſt deſtroy'd and devour'd their Caſtles, Lands, Demeſnes, Poſſeſſions,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100385:41"/>
Rents and Revenues, are ſtill ſeeking to have their Blood and Soul in another Life. What an honeſt Fellow was that ſame Mumper who had forewarn'd us of all theſe things, and bid us take notice of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> above the <hi>Racks</hi>!</p>
                     <p>But, ſaid <hi>Panurge</hi> to the New-comer, how do you come by all this Veniſon? methinks the Great King has iſſued out a Proclamation ſtrictly inhibiting the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Stags, Does, Wild-boars, Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucks, or other Royal Game, on pain of Death. All this is true enough anſwer'd one for the reſt: But the Great King is ſo good and gracious, you muſt know, and theſe Furr'd Law-Cats ſo curſt and cruel, ſo mad and thirſting after Chriſtian Blood, that we have leſs cauſe to fear in treſpaſſing againſt that Mighty Sovereign's Commands, than reaſon to hope to live, if we do not continually ſtop the mouths of theſe Furr'd Law-Cats with ſuch Bribes and Corruption.

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100385:44"/>Well, quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> as good ſit ſtill as riſe up and fall; what can't be cur'd, muſt be endur'd. But, pr'ythee, let's hear one another ſpeak. Come, wert thou not a wiſe Doctor, to fling away a whole Purſe of Gold on thoſe mangy Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels? Hah? A Squinzy choak thee, we were too rich, were we? Had it not been enough to have thrown the Hell-hounds a few cropt Pieces of white Caſh?</p>
                     <p>How could I help it, return'd <hi>Panurge</hi>? Did you not ſee how <hi>Gripe-men-all</hi> held his gaping Velvet-Pouch, and every moment roar'd and bellow'd, <hi>By Gold, give, give me out of hand; By Gold, give, give, give me preſently.</hi> Now, thought I to my ſelf, we ſhall never come off ſcotfree; I'll e'en ſtop their mouths with Gold, that the Wicket may be open'd, and we may get out; the ſooner the better. And I judg'd that lowſy Silver would not do the buſineſs; for, d'ye ſee, Velvet-Pouches don't uſe to gape for little paultry clipt Silver, and ſmall Caſh: No, they are made for Gold, my Friend <hi>Ihon,</hi> that they are my dainty Cod. Ah! when thou haſt been larded, baſted, and roaſted, as I was, thou'lt hardly talk at this rate, I doubt. But now what's to be done —we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd by them to go for-<hi>Wards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Scabby Slabberdegullions ſtill wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us at the Port, expecting to be greas'd in the Fiſt as well as their Maſters.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100385:44"/>
Now when they perceiv'd that we were ready to put to Sea, they came to Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> and begg'd that we might not forget to gratify the Apparitors before we went off, according to the Aſſeſsment for the Fees at our Diſcharge. Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cry'd Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> Are you here ſtill, ye Bloodhounds, ye citing, ſcribling Imps of Satan? Rot you, Am I not vext enough already, but you muſt have the impudence to come and plague me, ye ſcurvy Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catchers you? By Cob's-Body I'll gratify your Ruffianſhips as you deſerve, I'll <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorize</hi> you preſently, with a Wannion, that I will. With this he lugg'd out his ſlaſhing Cutlas, and, in a mighty heat, came out of the Ship, to cut the couſening Varlets into Stakes, but they ſcamper'd away, and got out of ſight in a Trice.</p>
                     <p>However, there was ſomewhat more to do; for ſome of our Sailors, having got leave of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to go o' ſhoar, while we were had before <hi>Gripe-men-all,</hi> had been at a Tavern near the Haven to make much of themſelves, and roar it, as Seamen will do when they come into ſome Port. Now I don't know whether they had paid their Reck'ning to the full or no; but, however it was, an old fat Hoſteſs meeting Friar <hi>Ihon</hi> on the Key, was making a woful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, before a Sergeant, Son-in-law to one of the Furr'd Law-Cats, and a Brace of Bums his Aſſiſtants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100385:45"/>The Friar, who did not much care to be tir'd with their impertinent Prating, ſaid to them, Harkee me, ye lubbardly Gnats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nappers, Do you preſume to ſay, that our Seamen are not honeſt Men? I'll maintain they are, ye Dotterells, and will prove it to your brazen Faces, by <hi>Juſtice</hi>; I mean this truſty piece of cold Iron by my ſide; with this, he lugg'd it out, and flouriſh'd with it. The forlorn Lobcocks ſoon ſhew'd him their backs, betaking themſelves to their heels: But the old fuſty Landlady kept her ground, ſwearing, like any Butter-whore, that the Tarpawlins were very honeſt Cods; but that they had only forgot to pay for the Bed on which they had lay'n after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſhe ask'd Five-pence <hi>French</hi> money for the ſaid Bed. May I never ſup, ſaid the Friar, if it be not Dog-cheap; they are ſorry Gueſts, and unkind Cuſtomers, that they are; they don't know when they have a Penniworth, and will not always meet with ſuch Bargains; Come, I my ſelf will pay you the money, but I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſee it firſt.</p>
                     <p>The Hoſteſs immediately took him home with her, and ſhew'd him the Bed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prais'd it for all its good <hi>qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſaid that ſhe thought, as Times went, ſhe was not out of the way, in asking Five-pence for't.

In the mean time the old Hag came down, and roar'd out for help, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Murther, to ſet all the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in an uproar. Yet ſhe alſo fell to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Feathers that flew up and down in the Air, being ſcatter'd by the wind.

He gave them away to the Sailers, then ſaid to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> that Beds were much cheaper at that place than in <hi>Chinnonois,</hi> tho we have there the famous Geeſe of <hi>Pantile</hi>; for the old Belda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WE put to Sea that very moment, ſteering our Courſe For-<hi>wards,</hi> and gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> a full account of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, which ſo deeply ſtruck him with compaſſion, that he wrote ſome Elegies on that Subject, to divert himſelf during the Voyage. When we were ſafe in the Port, we took ſome Refreſhment, and took in freſh water and wood. The People of the place, who had the countenance of jolly Fellows, and boon Companions, were all of them For-<hi>ward</hi> Folks, bloated and pufft up with Fat; and we ſaw ſome who ſlaſh'd and pink'd their Skin, to open a paſſage to the Fat, that it might ſwell out at the ſlits and gaſhes which they made: neither more nor leſs than the ſhitbreech Fellows in our Countrey-bepink and cut open their Breeches, that the Tafety on the inſide may ſtand out and be puff'd up. They ſaid that what they did was not out of Pride or Oſtentation, but becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Skins would not hold them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much pain. Having thus ſlaſh'd their Skin, they us'd to grow much bigger, like
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100385:46"/>
the young Trees, on whoſe Barks the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners make Inciſions, that they may grow the better.</p>
                     <p>Near the Haven, there was a Tavern which <hi>forwards</hi> ſeem'd very fine and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we repair'd thither, and found it fill'd with People of the Forward Nation, of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions; ſo that we thought ſome notable Feaſt or other was getting ready: But we were told that all that Throng were Invited to the Burſting of mine Hoſt, which caus'd all his Friends and Relations to haſten thither.</p>
                     <p>We did not underſtand that Jargon, and therefore thought that in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, by that Burſting they meant ſome Merry meeting or other, as we do in ours, by Betrothing, Wedding, Groaning, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening, Churching [<hi>of Women</hi>] Shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing [<hi>of Sheep</hi>] reaping [<hi>of Corn,</hi> or Harveſt home] and many other Junket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bouts that end in <hi>ing.</hi> But we ſoon heard that there was no ſuch matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter of the Houſe, you muſt know, had been a Good-fellow in his time, lov'd heartily to wind up his Bottom, to bang the Pitcher, and lick his Diſh; he us'd to be a very fair ſwallower of gravy Soupe, a notable accountant in matter of Hours; and his whole life was one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Dinner, like mine Hoſt at <hi>Rouillac.</hi>

ſtrangely amaze us (and not without reaſon, I think) that down we fell on our faces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining proſtrate like men raviſh'd in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy, and were not able to utter one word thro the exceſs of our Admiration, till ſhe came, and having touch'd <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with a fine fragrant Noſegay of white Roſes, which ſhe held in her hand, thus made us reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Senſes and get up. Then ſhe made us the following Speech in <hi>Byſſin</hi> Words, ſuch as <hi>Pariſatis</hi> deſir'd ſhould be ſpoken to her Son <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or at leaſt of Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Alamode.</p>
                     <p>The Probity that ſcintillizes in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of your Perſons, informs my ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinating Faculty, in a moſt ſtupendous manner, of the radiant Vertues, latent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precious Caskets and Ventricles of your Minds. For, contemplating the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous Suavity of your thrice diſcreet Reverences, 'tis impoſſible not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded with Facility, that neither your Affections nor your Intellects are vitiated with any defect, or Privation of liberal and exalted Sciences; far from it, all muſt judge that in you are lodg'd a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> an <hi>Encyclopedia,</hi> an unmeaſurable Profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of Knowledge in the moſt peregrine and ſublime Diſciplines; ſo frequently the Admiration, and ſo rarely the Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the imperite vulgar. This gently compels me, who in preceding Times
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100385:54"/>
indefatigably kept my private Affectious abſolutely ſubjugated, to condeſcend to make my Application to you in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Phraſe of the Plebeian World; and aſſure you, that you are well, moſt well, moſt heartily well, more than moſt hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome.</p>
                     <p>I have no hand at making of Speeches, quoth <hi>Panurge</hi> to me privately; prithee, man, make anſwer to her for us if thou canſt; this would not work with me however, neither did <hi>Pantagruel</hi> return a word; ſo that Queen-<hi>Whims,</hi> or Queen <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence</hi> (which you pleaſe) perceiving that we ſtood as mute as Fiſhes, ſaid: Your Taciturnity ſpeaks you not only Diſciples of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> from whom the venerable Antiquity of my Progenitors in ſucceſſive propagation was eman'd and derives its Original; but alſo diſcovers, that, through the Revolution of many Retrograde Moons, you have in <hi>Egypt</hi> preſs'd the Extremities of your Fingers, with the hard Tenants of your Mouths, and ſcalptiz'd your heads with frequent applications of your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guicules. In the School of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citurnity was the Symbol of abſtracted and ſuperlative Knowledge; and the ſilence of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> was agnited as an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manner of Divine Adoration: This caus'd the Pontifs of <hi>Hieropolis</hi> to Sacrifice to the great Deity in ſilence, impercuſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100385:54"/>
without any vociferous or obſtreporous Sound. My deſign is not to enter into a Privation of Gratitude towards you; but by a vivacious formality, tho matter were to abſtract it ſelf from me, excen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate to you my Cogitations.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpoken this, ſhe only ſaid to her Officers, <hi>Tabachins a Panacea</hi>; and ſtrait they deſir'd us not to take it amiſs, if the Queen. did not invite us to dine with her; for ſhe never eat any thing at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but ſome Categories, Jecabots, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins, Dimions, Abſtractions, Harborins, Chelimins, ſecond Intentions, Caradoſh, Antitheſes, Metempſycoſes, tranſcendent Prolepſies and ſuch other light Food.</p>
                     <p>Then they took us into a little Cloſet, lin'd through with Alarums, where we were treated God knows how. 'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> writes whatever is tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World, on the <hi>Diphthera</hi> or Skin of the <hi>Amalthaean</hi> Goat that ſuckled him in <hi>Crete,</hi> which Pelt ſerv'd him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Shield againſt the <hi>Titans,</hi> whence he was Nick-nam'd <hi>Egiochos.</hi> Now, as I hate to drink water, Brother Topers, I proteſt, it would be impoſſible to make Eighteen Goat-skins hold the Deſcription of all the good Meat they brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; tho it were written in Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters as ſmall as thoſe in which were penn'd

                     <p>For my part, had I one hundred Mouths, as many Tongues, a Voice of Iron, a Heart of Oak, and Lungs of Leather, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the mellifluous <hi>Abundance</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi>; yet I never could give you a full account of a Third part of a ſecond of the whole.</p>

                        <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was telling me, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Queen had given the Symbolic Word us'd among her Subjects, to denote Sovereign good Chear, when ſhe ſaid to her <hi>Tabachins, A Panacea</hi>; juſt as <hi>Lucullus</hi> us'd to ſay, in <hi>Apollo,</hi> when he deſign'd to give his Friends a ſingular Treat, tho ſometimes they took him at unawares, as among the reſt, <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Hortenſius</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times us'd to do.</p>

                     <p>Afterwards ſhe gave orders that they ſhould ſhow us the Apartments and Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities in her Palace; accordingly we ſaw there ſuch new ſtrange and wonderful things, that I am ſtill raviſh'd in Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every time I think of't. However
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100385:56"/>
nothing ſurpriz'd us more than what was done by the Gentlemen of her Houſhold, Abſtractors, Pazarons, Nebidins, Spodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zators, and others, who freely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſſembling, told us, That the Queen their Miſtreſs did all impoſſible things, and cur'd Men of incurable Diſeaſes; and they, her Officers, us'd to do the reſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw there a young Parazon cure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the new Conſumption, I mean the Pox, tho they were never ſo pepper'd; had it been the rankeſt <hi>Roan</hi>-ague [<hi>Anglicè,</hi> the <hi>Covent-garden Gout</hi>] 'twas all one to him, touching only their <hi>Dentiform Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> thrice with a piece of a Wooden-ſhooe, he made them as wholeſome as ſo many Sucking-pigs.</p>
                     <p>Another did thoroughly cure Folks of Dropſies, Tympanies, Aſcites, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarcidies, ſtriking them on the Belly nine times with a Tenedian Satchel, without any Solution of the Continuum.</p>
                     <p>Another cur'd of all manner of Fevers and Agues, on the ſpot, only with hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fox-tail on the left ſide of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Girdle.</p>
                     <p>One remov'd the Tooth-ach only with waſhing the root of the aking Tooth with Elder-vinegar, and letting it dry half an hour in the Sun.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:100385:56"/>Another, the Gout, whether hot or cold, natural or accidental, barely making the Gouty-perſon ſhut his Mouth, and open his Eyes.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw another eaſe nine good Gentlemen of <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>A Conſumption in the Pocket, or want of Money; thoſe of St.</hi> Francis<hi>'s Order muſt carry none about 'em.</hi>
                        </note> St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Diſtemper, in a very ſhort ſpace of time, having clapt a Rope about their Necks, at the end of which hang'd a Box with ten thouſand Gold Crowns in't.</p>
                     <p>One with a wonderful Engine, throw'd the Houſes out at the Windows, by which means they were purg'd of all Peſtilential Air.</p>
                     <p>Another cur'd of all the three kinds of Hectics, the Tabid, Atrophes, and Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, without bathing, Tabian Milk, Dropax, <hi>alias</hi> Depilatory, or other ſuch Medicaments: Only turning the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for three Months into Monks; and he aſſur'd me, that if they did not grow fat and plump in a Monaſtick way of living, they never would be fatten'd in this World, either by Nature, or by Art.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw another ſurrounded with a Croud of two ſorts of Women; ſome were young, quaint, clever, neat, pretty, juicy, tight, brisk, buxom, proper, kind-hearted, and as right as my Leg, to any Man's thinking.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100385:57"/>
The reſt were old, weather-beaten, over-ridden, toothleſs, blear-ey'd, tough, wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhrivell'd, tawny, mouldy, ptyſicky, decrepit hags, beldams, and walking Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes. We were told that his Office was to caſt anew thoſe She-pieces of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make them ſuch as the pretty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whom we ſaw, who had been made young again that day, recovering at once the Beauty, Shape, Size, and Diſpoſition, which they enjoy'd at Sixteen, except their Heels that were now much ſhorter than in their former Youth.</p>
                     <p>This made them yet more apt to fall backwards whenever any Man happen'd to touch 'em, than they had been before. As for their Counterparts, the old Mother-ſcratch-tobies, they moſt devoutly waited for the bleſſed hour, when the Batch that was in the Oven was to be drawn, that they might have their turns, and in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty haſte they were pulling and hawling the Man like mad, telling him, that 'tis the moſt grievous and intollerable thing in nature, for the Tail to be o' Fire, and the Head to ſcare away thoſe who ſhould quench it.</p>
                     <p>The Officer had his hands full, never wanting <hi>Patients</hi>; neither did his place bring him in little, you may ſwear. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> ask'd him, whether he could alſo make old Men young again? He ſaid,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100385:57"/>
he could not. But the way to make them new men, was to get 'em to cohabit with a new-caſt Female; for thus they caught that fifth kind of Crinckams, which ſome call <hi>Pellade</hi>; in <hi>Greek,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that makes them caſt off their old Hair and Skin, juſt as the Serpents do; and thus their Youth is renew'd like the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phoenix's. This is the true Fountain of Youth, for there the Old and Decrepit become Young, Active and Luſty.</p>
                     <p>Juſt ſo, as <hi>Euripides</hi> tells us, <hi>Jolaus</hi> was tranſmogrifi'd; and thus <hi>Phaon,</hi> for whom kind-hearted <hi>Sappho</hi> run wild, grew young again for <hi>Venus</hi>'s uſe; ſo <hi>Tithon</hi> by <hi>Aurora</hi>'s means; ſo <hi>Aeſon</hi> by <hi>Medea,</hi> and <hi>Jaſon</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who, if you'll believe <hi>Pherecides</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> was new-vamp'd and died by that Witch; and ſo were the Nurſes of Jolly <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and their Husbands, as <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinus</hi> relates.</p>

                     <p>Others made Chalk of Cheeſe, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of a Dog's T—d.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw a knot of others, about a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's dozen in Number, tippling under an Arbour. They top'd out of jolly bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Cups, four ſorts of cool, ſparkling, pure, delicious Vine-tree Syrup, which went down like Mother's Milk; and Healths and Bumpers flew about like Lightning.

                     <p>In a blind Corner, I met four more very hot at it, and ready to go to Logger-heads. I ask'd what was the cauſe of the ſtir and ado, the mighty coil and pother they made?

her King, as it were to ask leave to fight; and thus ſaluting her Company at the ſame time, ſhe mov'd two Squares forwards, and ſaluted the adverſe Party.</p>
                     <p>Now the Muſick of the Golden Brigade ceas'd playing, and their Antagoniſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again. I ought to have told you, That the Nymph, who began by ſaluting her Company, had by that Formality alſo given them to underſtand that they were to fall on. She was ſaluted by them in the ſame manner with a full turn to the left, except the Queen, who went aſide towards her King to the right; and the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Salution was obſerv'd on both ſides, during the whole Ball.</p>
                     <p>The Silver'd Nymph that ſtood before her Queen likewiſe mov'd, as ſoon as the Muſick of her Party ſounded a Charge; her Salutations, and thoſe of her ſide, were to the Right, and her Queens to the left. She mov'd into the ſecond Square forwards, and ſaluted her Antagoniſts, facing the firſt Golden Nymph, ſo that there was not any diſtance between them, and you would have thought they two had been going to fight, but they only ſtrike ſide-ways.</p>
                     <p>Their Comrades, whether Silver'd or Golden, follow'd 'em in an intercalary Figure, and ſeem'd to Skirmiſh a while, till the Golden Nymph, who had firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100385:65"/>
the Liſts, ſtriking a Silver'd Nymph in the hand on the right, put her out of the Field, and ſet her ſelf in her place. But ſoon the Muſick playing a new Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhe was ſtruck by a Silver'd Archer, who after that was oblig'd himſelf to retire. A Silver'd Knight then ſallied out, and the Golden Queen poſted her ſelf before her King.</p>
                     <p>Then the Silver'd King dreading the Golden Queen's Fury, remov'd to the right, to the place where his Warden ſtood which ſeem'd to him ſtrong and well-guarded.</p>
                     <p>The two Knights on the left, whether Golden or Silver'd, march'd up, and on either ſide took up many Nymphs, who could not retreat, principally the Golden Knight, who made this his whole buſineſs: But the Silver'd Knight had greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, diſſembling all along, and even ſometimes not taking a Nymph when he could have done it, ſtill moving on till he was come up to the main Body of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in ſuch a manner, that he ſaluted their King with a, <hi>God ſave you, Sir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole Golden Brigade quak'd for fear and anger, thoſe words giving notice of their King's danger; not but that they could ſoon relieve him, but becauſe their King being thus ſaluted, they were to loſe their Warden on the right Wing, without
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100385:65"/>
any hopes of a Recovery. Then the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den King retir'd to the Left, and the ſilver'd Knight took the golden Warden, which was a mighty Loſs to that Party. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they reſolv'd to be reveng'd, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Knight that he might not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; he try'd to get off, behaving himſelf with a great deal of Gallantry, and his Friends did what they could to ſave him, but at laſt he fell into the golden Queen's hands and was carried off.</p>
                     <p>Her Forces not yet ſatisfied, having loſt one of their beſt men, with more Fury than Conduct mov'd about, and did much miſchief among their Enemies: The ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd Party warily diſſembled, watching their opportunity to be even with them, and preſented one of their Nymphs to the golden Queen, having laid an Ambuſcado, ſo that the Nymph being taken, a golden Archer had like to have ſeiz'd the ſilver'd Queen. Then the golden Knight under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to take the ſilver'd King and Queen, and ſays, good morrow.

                     <p>The Fight was obſtinate and ſharp: The Wardens left their Poſts, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to relieve their Friends. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was doubtful, and Victory hover'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both Armies. Now the Silver Hoſt

promiſing them certainly to have them Crown'd if they could do this. The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Nymphs were beforehand with the others, and out of their number was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Queen, who was dreſt in Royal Robes, and had a Crown ſet on her head. You need not doubt the ſilver'd Nymphs made alſo what haſte they could to be Queens; one of them was within a ſtep of the Coronation Place; but there the golden Knight lay ready to intercept her, ſo that ſhe could go no further.</p>
                     <p>The new golden Queen, reſolv'd to ſhew her ſelf valiant and worthy of her Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Crown, atchiev'd great Feats of Arms, But in the mean time, the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd Warden takes the golden Knight who guarded the Camp; and thus there was a new ſilver'd Queen, who, like the other, ſtrove to excel in Heroic Deeds at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her Reign. Thus the Fight grew hotter than before. A thouſand Stratagems, Charges, Rallyings, Retreats and Attacks were try'd on both ſides; till at laſt the ſilver'd Queen, having by ſtealth advanc'd as far as the golden King's Tent, cry'd; God ſave you, Sir. Now none but his new Queen could relieve him; ſo ſhe bravely came and expos'd her ſelf to the utmoſt Extremity to deliver him out of it. Then the ſilver'd Warden with his Queen, reduc'd the golden King to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100385:67"/>
ſuch a ſtreſs, that to ſave himſelf, he was forc'd to loſe his Queen; but the golden King took him at laſt. However, the reſt of the golden Party were ſoon taken; and that King being left alone, the ſilver'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made him a low Bow; crying, <hi>Good morrow, Sir</hi>; which denoted that the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd King had got the Day.</p>
                     <p>This being heard, the Muſick of both Parties loudly proclaim'd the Victory. And thus the firſt Battel ended to the unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable Joy of all the Spectators.</p>
                     <p>After this the two Brigades took their former Stations, and began to tilt a ſecond time, much as they had done before; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Muſic plaid ſomewhat faſter than at the firſt Battel; and the motions were altogether different. I ſaw the golden Queen ſally out one of the firſt, with an Archer and a Knight, as it were angry at the former Defeat, and ſhe had like to have fallen upon the ſilver'd King in his Tent among his Officers; but having been baulk'd in her Attempt, ſhe skirmiſh'd briskly, and overthrew ſo many ſilver'd Nymphs and Officers, that it was a moſt amazing ſight. You would have ſworn ſhe had been another <hi>Penth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>But this havock did not laſt long; for, the ſilver'd Party, exaſperated by their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100385:67"/>
Loſs, reſolv'd to periſh, or ſtop her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and having poſted an Archer in Ambuſcado on a diſtant Angle, together with a Knight Errant, her Highneſs fell into their hands, and was carried out of the Field. The reſt were ſoon routed after the taking of their Queen; who without doubt, from that time reſolv'd to be more wary, and keep near her King, without venturing ſo far amidſt her Enemies, unleſs with more Forces to defend her. Thus the ſilver'd Brigade once more got the Victory.</p>
                     <p>This did not diſhearten or deject the golden Party; far from it, they ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd again in the Field to face their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and being poſted as before, both the Armies ſeem'd more reſolute and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than ever. Now the martial Conſort began, and the Muſic was above a <hi>Hemiole</hi> the quicker, according to the Warlike <hi>Phrygian Mode,</hi> ſuch as was invented by <hi>Marſias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then our <hi>Combatants</hi> began to wheel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and charge with ſuch a ſwiftneſs, that in an inſtant they made four moves, beſides the uſual Salutations. So that they were continually in Action, flying, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, jumping, vaulting, tumbling, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetting, with petauriſtical Turns and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and often intermingled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100385:68"/>Seeing them turn about on one Foot after they had made their Honours, we compar'd them to your Tops or Giggs, ſuch as Boys uſe to whip about; making them turn round ſo ſwiftly, that they ſleep, as they call it, and motion cannot be perceiv'd, but reſembles reſt its contrary: So that if you make a Point or Mark on ſome part of one of thoſe Gigs, 'twill be perceiv'd not as a Point, but as a continual Line, in a moſt divine manner, as <hi>Cuſanus</hi> has <hi>wiſely</hi> obſerv'd.</p>
                     <p>While they were thus warmly engag'd, we heard continually the Claps and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemaſies</hi> which thoſe of the two Bands rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated at the taking of their Enemies; and this, join'd to the variety of their Motions and Muſic, would have forc'd Smiles out of the moſt ſevere <hi>Cato,</hi> the never-laughing <hi>Craſſus,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Man-hater <hi>Timon</hi>; nay, even the whining <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclytus,</hi> tho he abhorr'd Laughing, the Action that's moſt peculiar to Man.

                     <p>Then <hi>Geber</hi>'s <hi>Michelots</hi> conducted us, and we were ſet down among her Abſtractors, as her Queenſhip had commanded.

                     <p>WE Sail'd before the Wind, between a pair of Courſes, and in two days made the Iſland of <hi>Odes</hi>; at which Place we ſaw a very ſtrange thing. The ways there are Animals; ſo true is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Saying, that all ſelf-moving things are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals. Now the Ways walk there; <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> They are then Animals: Some of them are ſtrange unknown ways, like thoſe of the Planets; others are High-ways, Croſs-ways, and By-ways. I perceiv'd that the Travellers and Inhabitants of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ask'd whither do's this way go? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do's that way go? Some anſwer'd, between <hi>Midy</hi> and <hi>Feurolles,</hi> to the Pariſh Church, to the City, to the River, and ſo forth. Being thus in their right way, they us'd to reach their Journeys end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further trouble, juſt like thoſe who go by water from <hi>Lyons</hi> to <hi>Avignon</hi> or <hi>Arles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, as you know that nothing is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here below, we heard there was a ſort of People whom they call'd <hi>High-way-men, Way-beaters,</hi> and makers of Inroads
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100385:69"/>
in Roads; and that the poor ways were ſadly afraid of them, and ſhun'd them as you do Robbers. For theſe us'd to way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay them, as people lay Trains for Wolves, and ſet Ginns for Woodcocks. I ſaw one who was taken up with a Lord-Chief-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice's Warrant, for having unjuſtly and in ſpight of <hi>Pallas</hi> taken the <hi>School-way,</hi> which is the longeſt. Another boaſted that he had fairly taken his ſhorteſt, and that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, he firſt compaſs'd his deſign. Thus <hi>Carpalin,</hi> meeting once <hi>Epiſtemon</hi> looking upon a Wall with his Fiddle-diddle, or live Urinal, in his hand, to make a little Maid's water, cry'd, that he did not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now how the other came to be ſtill the firſt at <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s <hi>Lever,</hi> ſince he held his ſhorteſt, and leaſt us'd.</p>
                     <p>I found <hi>Bourges</hi> Highway among theſe. It went with the deliberation of an Abbot, but was made to ſcamper at the approach of ſome Waggoners, who threatned to have it trampled under their Horſes feet, and make their Waggons run over it, as <hi>Tullia</hi>'s Chariot did over her Father's Body.</p>
                     <p>I alſo ſpy'd there the old <hi>Way</hi> between <hi>Peronne</hi> and St. <hi>Quentin,</hi> which ſeem'd to me a very good, honeſt, plain way, as ſmooth as a Carpet, and as good as ever was trod upon by ſhoe of Leather.</p>
                     <p>Among the Rocks I knew again the good old way to <hi>la Ferrare,</hi> mounted on a huge
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100385:70"/>
Bear. This at a diſtance would have put me in mind of St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Picture, had but the Bear been a Lyon; for the poor way was all mortified, and wore a long hoary Beard uncomb'd and entangled, which look'd like the Picture of Winter, or at leaſt like a white-froſted Buſh.</p>
                     <p>On that way were ſtore of Beads or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, courſely made of wild Pine-Tree; and it ſeem'd kneeling, not ſtanding, nor lying flat; but its ſides and middle were beaten with huge ſtones; inſomuch, that it prov'd to us at once an Object of Fear and Pity.</p>
                     <p>While we were examining it, a Runner <hi>Batchelour</hi> of the Place took us aſide, and ſhewing us a white ſmooth Way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fill'd with Straw, ſaid, Henceforth, Gentlemen, do not reject the Opinion of <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> who ſaid that water is the beginning of all things, nor that of <hi>Homer,</hi> who tells us, that all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Original from the Ocean: For, this ſame Way which you ſee here, had its beginning from water, and is to return whence ſhe came before two months come to an end; now Carts are driven here where Boats us'd to be row'd.</p>
                     <p>Truly, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> you tell us no news, we ſee five hundred ſuch changes and more every year in our World. Then reflecting on the different manner of going
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100385:70"/>
of thoſe moving Ways; he told us, he believ'd that <hi>Philolaus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> had Philoſophis'd in this Iſland, and that ſome indeed were of Opinion, the Earth turns round about its Poles, and not the Heavens, whatever we may think to the contrary; As when we are on the River <hi>Loire,</hi> we think the Trees and the Shoar moves, tho this is only an effect of our Boat's motion.</p>
                     <p>As we went back to our Ships, we ſaw three Way-Layers, who having been taken in Ambuſcado, were going to be be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the Wheel; and a huge Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was burn'd with a lingring Fire, for beating a way, and breaking one of its ſides: we were told it was the way of the Banks of the <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVII. How we came to the Iſland of <hi>Sandals;</hi> and of the Order of Semiquaver Fryars.</head>
                     <p>THence we went to the Iſland of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants live on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Ling Broth. However, we were very kindly receiv'd and entertain'd by <hi>Benius</hi> the Third, King of the Iſland; who, after he had made us drink, took
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100385:71"/>
us with him to ſhow us a ſpick-and-ſpan-new Monaſtery, which he had contriv'd for the Semiquaver Friars; ſo he call'd the Religious Men whom he had there. For he ſaid, that on t'other ſide the Water liv'd Friars, who ſtil'd themſelves her ſweet <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhips</hi> moſt humble Servants. <hi>Item,</hi> the goodly Friar-minors, who are <hi>Semibreves</hi> of Bulls; the ſmoak'd-herring Tribe of <hi>Minim</hi> Friars; then the <hi>Crotchet</hi> Friars. So that theſe diminitives could be no more than <hi>Semiquavers.</hi> By the Statutes, Bulls, and Patents of Queen-<hi>Whims,</hi> they were all dreſt like ſo many <hi>Houſe-Burners,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that as in <hi>Anjou,</hi> your Bricklayers uſe to quilt their Knees when they tile houſes, ſo theſe holy Friars had uſually quilted Bellies, and thick quilted Paunches were among them in much Repute: Their Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces were cut Slipper-faſhion, and every Monk of them wore two; one ſow'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and another behind, reporting that ſome certain dreadful Myſteries were due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by this duplicity of Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces.</p>
                     <p>They wore Shoes as round as Baſons, in Imitation of thoſe who inhabit the ſandy Sea. Their Chins were cloſe ſhav'd, and their Feet Iron-ſhod; and to ſhow they did not value Fortune, <hi>Benius</hi> made them ſhave and powl the hind part of their Poles, as bare as a Bird's Arſe, from the Crown
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100385:71"/>
to the Shoulder-blades: But they had leave to let their Hair grow before, from the two triangular Bones in the upper part of the Skull.</p>
                     <p>Thus they did not value Fortune a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and cared no more for the Goods of this World, than you or I do for hanging. And to ſhow how much they defi'd that blind Jilt, all of them wore, not in their Hands like her, but at their Waſte, inſtead of Beads, Sharp-razors, which they us'd to new grind twice a Day, and ſet thrice a Night.</p>
                     <p>Each of them had a round Ball on their Feet, becauſe Fortune is ſaid to have one under hers.</p>
                     <p>The Flap of their Cowles hang'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and not backwards, like thoſe of others; thus none could ſee their Noſes, and they laugh'd without fear both at For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the Fortunate, neither more nor leſs than our Ladies laugh at bare-fac'd Trulls, when they have thoſe Mufflers on, which they call Masks, and which were formerly much more properly call Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe they cover multitude of Sins</p>
                     <p>The hind part of their Faces were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was uncover'd, as are our Faces, which made them either go with their Belly, or the Arſe foremoſt, which they pleas'd. When their hind Face went forwards, you
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100385:72"/>
would have ſworn this had been their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural-gate; as well on account of their round Shooes, as of the double Codpiece, and their Face behind, which was as bare as the back of my Hand, and courſely dawb'd over with two Eyes, and a Mouth, ſuch as you ſee on ſome <hi>Indian</hi>-nuts. Now, if they offer'd to waddle along with their Bellies forwards, you would have thought they were then playing at Blind-man's Buff. May I never be hang'd, if 'twas not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ſight.</p>
                     <p>Their way of Living was thus; about Owl light they charitably began to Boot and Spur one another: This being done, the leaſt thing they did, was to Sleep and Snoar; and thus Sleeping, they had Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles on the Handles of their Faces, or Spectacles at moſt.</p>
                     <p>You may ſwear, we did not a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this odd fancy; but they ſatisfi'd us preſently, telling us, That the Day of Judgment is to take Mankind napping; therefore to ſhew they did not refuſe to make their Perſonal Appearance, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune's Darlings uſe to do, they were always thus Booted and Spur'd, ready to mount whenever the Trumpet ſhould ſound.</p>
                     <p>At Noon, as ſoon as the Clock ſtruck, they us'd to awake. You muſt know that their Clock-bell, Church-bells, and Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary-bells; were all made according to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100385:72"/>
the <hi>Pontial</hi> device, that is, quilted with the fineſt Down, and their Clappers of Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails.</p>
                     <p>Having then made ſhift to get up at Noon, they pull'd off their Boots, and thoſe that wanted to ſpeak with a Maid, <hi>alias</hi> piſs, piſs'd; thoſe that wanted to Scum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſcumber'd; and thoſe that wanted to Sneeze, ſneez'd. But all, whether they would or no (poor Gentlemen!) were oblig'd largely and plentifully to Yawn, and this was their firſt Breakfaſt (O rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Statute!) Methought 'twas very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical to obſerve their Tranſactions; for, having laid their Boots and Spurs on a Rack, they went into the Cloyſters: There they curiouſly waſh'd their Hands and Mouths, then ſat them down on a long Bench, and pick'd their Teeth till the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt gave the Signal, whiſtling through his Fingers; then every He ſtretch'd out his Jaws as much as he could, and they gap'd and yawn'd for about half an hour, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Prior judg'd the Breakfaſt to be ſuitable to the day.</p>
                     <p>After that, they went in Proceſſion; two Banners being carried before them, in one of which was the Picture of Virtue, and that of Fortune in the other. The laſt went before, carried by a Semiquavering-Friar, at whoſe Heels was another with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100385:73"/>
the Shadow or Image of Virtue in one hand, and an Holy-water-ſprinkle in the other; I mean of that Holy Mercurial-water, which <hi>Ovid</hi> deſcribes in his <hi>de faſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> And as the preceeding Semiquaver rang a Hand-bell, this ſhak'd the Sprinkle with his Firſt. With that, ſays <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> This Order contradicts the Rule which <hi>Tully</hi> and the <hi>Academics</hi> preſcrib'd, That Virtue ought to go before, and Fortune follow. But they told us, they did as they ought, ſeeing their Deſign was to breech, laſh, and bethwack Fortune.</p>
                     <p>During the Proceſſions they trill'd and quaver'd moſt melodiouſly betwixt their Teeth I don't know what Antiphones, or Chantings by turns: For my part, 'twas all <hi>Hebrew-Greek</hi> to me, the Devil a word I could pick out on't; at laſt prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my Ears, and intenſely liſtning, I perceiv'd they only ſang with the Tip of theirs. O, what a rare Harmony it was! How well 'twas tun'd to the ſound of their Bells! You'll never find theſe to jar, that you won't. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> made a <hi>notable</hi> Obſervation upon the Proceſſions; for, ſays he, have you ſeen and obſerv'd the policy of theſe Semiquavers? To make an end of their Proceſſion, they went out at one of the Church-doors, and came in at the other; they took a deal of care not to come in at the place whereat they went
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100385:73"/>
out. On my honour, theſe are a ſubtle ſort of people, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> they have as much wit as three folks, Two Fools and a mad man; they are as wiſe as the Calf that ran Nine miles to ſuck a Bull, and when he came there 'twas a Steer. This Subtilty and Wiſdom of theirs, cry'd Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from the <hi>Occult Philoſophy,</hi> may I be gutted like an Oyſter, if I can tell what to make on't. Then the more 'tis to be fear'd, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; for Subtilty ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, Subtilty foreſeen, Subtilty found out, loſes the Eſſence and very Name of Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and only gains that of Blockiſhneſs. They are not ſuch fools as you take them to be, they have more Tricks than are good, I doubt.</p>
                     <p>After the Proceſſion, they went ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly into the Fratry-Room by the way of walk and healthful Exerciſe, and there kneel'd under the Tables, leaning their Breaſts on Lanterns. While they were in that Poſture, in came a huge <hi>Sandal,</hi> with a Pitch fork in his hand, who us'd to baſte, rib-roaſt, ſwaddle, and ſwindge them well-favour'dly, as they ſaid, and in truth trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them after a faſhion. They began their Meal as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>You may deſcant on the Inſtitution of Lent as much as you pleaſe, cry'd <hi>Epiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>; So many Men, ſo many Minds: But certainly all the Phyſicians will be againſt its being ſuppreſt, tho I think that time is at hand, I know they will, and have heard 'em ſay, Were it not for Lent, their Art would ſoon fall into Contempt, and they'd get nothing, for hardly any Body would be ſick.</p>
                     <p>All Diſtempers are ſow'd in Lent; 'tis the true Seminary and native Bed of all Diſeaſes; nor do's it only weaken and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie Bodies, but it alſo makes Souls mad and

uneaſy. For then the Devils do their beſt, and drive a ſubtle Trade, and the Tribe of canting Diſſemblers come out of their holes. 'Tis then Term-time with your cucullated Pieces of Formality, that have one Face to God, and another to the Devil; and a wretched clutter they make with their Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Stations, Pardons, Syntereſes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Whipping, Anathematizations, and much Prayer, with as little Devotion. However, I'll not offer to infer from this, that the <hi>Arimaſpians</hi> are better than we are in that Point; yet I ſpeak to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Well, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> to the <hi>Semiquaver</hi> Fryar, who happen'd to be by, Dear bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſting, ſhaking, trilling, quavering Cod, what think'ſt thou of this Fellow, is he a rank Heretic?</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving pleas'd our ſelves with obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that new Order of Semiquaver Fryars, we ſet Sail, and in three days our Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permade the fineſt and moſt delightful Iſland that ever was ſeen; he call'd it the Iſland of <hi>Frize</hi>; for, all the ways were of Frize.</p>
                     <p>In that Iſland is the Land of <hi>Satin,</hi> ſo celebrated by our Court Pages. Its Trees and Shrubs never loſe their Leaves or Flowers, and are all Damask and flower'd Velvet: As for the Beaſts and Birds, they are all of Tapeſtry-work. There we ſaw many Beaſts, Birds and Trees of the ſame Colour, Bigneſs and Shape of thoſe in our Country, with this difference, however, that theſe did eat nothing, and never ſung, or bit like ours; and we alſo ſaw there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of Creatures which we had never ſeen before.</p>
                     <p>Among the reſt, ſeveral Elephants in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Poſtures; twelve of which were the ſix Males and ſix Females that were brought
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100385:84"/>
to <hi>Rome</hi> by their <hi>Governour</hi> in the Time of <hi>Germanicus, Tiberius</hi>'s Nephew; ſome of them were Learned Elephants, ſome Muſicians, others Philoſophers, Dancers, and Showers of Tricks, and all ſat down at Table in good Order, ſilently eating and drinking like ſo many Fathers in a Fratry-room.</p>
                     <p>With their Snouts or <hi>Proboſcis's</hi> ſome two Cubits long, they draw up water for their own drinking, and take hold of Palm Leaves, Plumbs, and all manner of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, uſing them offenſively or defenſively, as we do our Fiſts; with them toſſing men high into the Air in Fight, and making them burſt out with laughing when they come to the ground.</p>
                     <p>They have Joints, whatever ſome men, who doubtleſs never ſaw any but Painted, may have written to the contrary. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Teeth they have two huge Horns; thus <hi>Juba</hi> call'd 'em, and <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> tells us, they are no Teeth, but Horns: However, <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> will have 'em to be Teeth, and not Horns. 'Tis all one to me, provided you will be pleas'd to own them to be true Ivory. Theſe are ſome three or four Cubits long, and are fixt in the upper Jaw-bone, and conſequently not in the lowermoſt. If you hearken to thoſe who will tell you the contrary, you'll find your ſelves damnably miſtaken, for that's a Lye with a Latchet: Tho 'twere <hi>Aelia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:100385:84"/>
that Long-Bow-man that told you ſo, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe him, for he lyes as faſt as a Dog can trot. 'Twas in this very Iſland that <hi>Pliny,</hi> his Brother tell-truth, had ſeen ſome Elephants dance on the Rope with Bells, and whip over the Tables, <hi>Preſto, be gone,</hi> while people were at Feaſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as touching the Toping To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or the Topers toping.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw a <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> there, juſt ſuch a one as <hi>Harry Clerberg</hi> had formerly ſhew'd me; methought it was not much unlike a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Boar which I had formerly ſeen at <hi>Limoges,</hi> except the ſharp Horn on its Snout, that was about a Cubit long; by the means of which that Animal dares encounter with an Elephant, that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kill'd with its Point thruſt into its Belly, which is its moſt tender and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs part.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw there two and thirty Unicorns; they are a curſt ſort of Creatures, much reſembling a fine Horſe, unleſs it be that their Heads are like a Stags, their Feet like an Elephants, their Tails like a wild Boar's, and out of each of their Foreheads ſprouts out a ſharp black Horn, ſome ſix or ſeven Foot long; commonly it dangles down like a Turkey-Cock's Comb. When an Unicorn has a mind to fight, or put it to any other uſe, what does it do but make it ſtand, and then 'tis as ſtraight as an Arrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:100385:85"/>I ſaw one of them, which was attended with a Throng of other wild Beaſts, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify a Fountain with its Horn. With that <hi>Panurge</hi> told me, that his Prancer, <hi>alias</hi> his Nimble-Wimble, was like the Unicorn, not altogether in length indeed, but in Vertue and propriety: For as the Unicorn purify'd Pools and Fountains from Filth and Venom, ſo that other Animals came and drank ſecurely there afterwards; In the like manner, others might water their Nags, and dabble after him without fear of Shankers, Carnoſities, Gonorrhaea's, Buboes, Crinckams, and ſuch other Plagues caught by thoſe who venture to quench their Amorous Thirſt in a common Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; for with his Nervous Horn he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all the Infection that might be lurking in ſome blind Cranny of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pbitic</hi> ſweet-ſcented Hole.</p>
                     <p>Well, quoth Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> when you are Sped, that is, when you are Married, we'll make a Tryal of this on thy Spouſe, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Charity-ſake, ſince you are pleas'd to give us ſo beneficial an Inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Ay, ay, return'd <hi>Panurge,</hi> and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately I'll give you a pretty gentle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregative Pill of God made up of two and twenty kind Stabs with a Dagger, after the <hi>Ceſarian</hi> way.

                     <p>Some people ſay, that none e're ſaw an Airy or Neſt of Sakers; If you'll believe me, I ſaw no leſs than Eleven, and I'm ſure I reckon'd right.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw ſome left-handed Halberts, which were the firſt that I had ever ſeen.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw ſome <hi>Menticores,</hi> a moſt ſtrange ſort of Creatures, which have the Body of a Lyon, red Hair, a Face and Ears like a man's, three Rows of Teeth which cloſe

together, as if you join'd your hands with your fingers between each other; they have a Sting in their Tails like a Scorpions, and a very melodious Voice.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw ſome <hi>Catablepas</hi>'s, a ſort of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, whoſe Bodies are ſmall, but their Heads large without any Proportion, ſo that they've much ado to lift them up; and their Eyes are ſo infectious, that whoever ſees 'em, dies upon the ſpot, as if he had ſeen a Baſilisk.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw ſome Beaſts with two Backs, and thoſe ſeem'd to me the merrieſt Creatures in the World; they were moſt nimble at wriggling the Buttocks, and more diligent in Tail wagging than any Water-wagtails, perpetually jogging and ſhaking their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rumps.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw there ſome milch'd Craw-fiſh, Creatures that I never had heard of before in my Life; and theſe mov'd in very good order, and 'twould have done your heart good to have ſeen 'em.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There I found <hi>Triton</hi> winding his ſilver Shell inſtead of a Horn, and alſo <hi>Glaucus, Proteus, Nereus,</hi> and a thouſand other God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Sea-monſters.</p>

                     <p>In a blind Corner we ſaw <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lantern in the Poſture in which the Hermit uſes to be drawn near St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> watching, prying, thinking, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every thing down.</p>
                     <p>Behind him ſtood a Pack of other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, like ſo many Bums by a Head-Bailiff; as <hi>Appian, Heliodorus, Athenaeus, Porphyrius,

                     <p>I ſpy'd <hi>Peter Gilles</hi> among theſe, with an Urinal in his hand, narrowly watching the water of thoſe goodly Fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>When we had long beheld every thing in this Land of <hi>Satin, Pantagruel</hi> ſaid, I have ſufficiently fed my Eyes, but my Belly is empty all this while, and chimes to let me know 'tis time to go to dinner; Let's take care of the Body, left the Soul abdicate it; and to this effect, let's taſte ſome of theſe <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>One might be apt to think <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> had taken a Hint from thence, to feaſt thoſe whom he had caus'd to faſt a long time, promiſing them a ſumptuous, plentiful and imperial Feaſt after it: For all the Treat us'd to amount to no more than ſeveral ſorts of Meat in Wax, Marble, Earthen-Ware, painted and figur'd Table-Cloths.</p>
                     <p>While we were looking up and down to find ſome more ſubſtantial Food, we heard a loud various noiſe, like that of Paper-mills; ſo with all ſpeed we went to the place whence the noiſe came, where we found a diminitive, monſtrous, miſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, old Fellow, call'd <hi>Hear-ſay</hi>; his Mouth was ſlit up to his Ears, and in it were ſeven Tongues, each of 'em cleft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeven parts. However, he chatter'd, tattled and prated with all the ſeven at once, of different Matters, and in divers Languages.</p>
                     <p>He had as many Ears all-over his head and the reſt of his body, as <hi>Argus</hi> formerly had Eyes; and was as blind as a Beetle, and had the Palſie in his Legs.</p>
                     <p>About him ſtood an innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men and women, gaping, liſt'ning, and hearing very intenſely; among 'em I obſerv'd ſome who ſtrutted like Crows

                     <p>You may think what you will of it, but I can aſſure you, they gave ſome of us Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their Cakes, and we merrily help'd to empty their Hogſheads.

                     <p>HAving been but ſcurvily entertain'd in the Land of <hi>Satin,</hi> we went o' board, and having ſet Sail, in four days came near the Coaſt of <hi>Lantern-Land.</hi> We then ſaw certain little hovering Fires on the Sea.</p>
                     <p>For my part I did not take them to be Lanterns, but rather thought they were Fiſhes, which loll'd their flaming Tongues on the ſurface of the Sea, or Lampyris's, which ſome call <hi>Cicindela</hi>'s or <hi>Glow-worms,</hi> ſhining there as ripe Barley do's o' nights in my Country.</p>
                     <p>But the Skipper ſatisfy'd us that they were the Lanterns of the Watch, or more properly Light-houſes, ſet up in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces round the Precinct of the Place to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Land, and for the ſafe Piloting in of ſome outlandiſh Lanterns, which like good <hi>Franciſcan</hi> and <hi>Jacobin</hi> Fryars, were coming to make their perſonal Appearance at the Provincial Chapter.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Near the Port, there's a little Hamblet inhabited by the <hi>Lychnobii,</hi> that live by Lanterns, as the gulligutted Friars in our Country live by Nuns: They are ſtudious People, and as honeſt Men as ever ſhit in a Trumpet. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had formerly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis'd there.</p>

This Vine-yard was formerly planted by the good <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with ſo great a bleſſing, that it yields Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit all the Year round, like the Orange Trees at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rêne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100385:93"/>Our magnificent Lantern order'd every one of us to eat three Grapes, to put ſome Vine-leaves in his Shoes, and take a Vine-branch in his left hand.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the Cloſe, we went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Arch built after the manner of thoſe of the Ancients. The Trophies of a Toper were curiouſly carv'd on it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> On one ſide was to be ſeen a long Train of Flaggons, Leathern Bottles, Flasks, Cans, Glaſs-bottles, Barrels, Nipperkins, Pint-pots, Quart-pots, Pottles, Gallons, and old faſhion'd <hi>Semaiſes</hi> [ſwindging Wooden-pots, ſuch as thoſe out of which the <hi>Germans</hi> fill their Glaſſes] theſe hang'd on a ſhady Arbor.</p>
                     <p>On another ſide was ſtore of Garlick, Onions, Shallots, Hams, Botargos, Caviar, Biſcuits, Neat's Tongues, Old Cheeſe, and ſuch like <hi>Comfets,</hi> very artificially interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and pack'd together with Vine-ſtocks.</p>
                     <p>On another, were a hundred ſorts of drinking Glaſſes, Cups, Ciſterns, Ewers, Falſe-Cups, Tumblers, Bowls, Mazers, Mugs, Jugs, Goblets, Talboys, and ſuch other <hi>Bacchie</hi> Artillery.</p>
                     <p>On the Frontiſpiece of the Triumphal Arch, under the <hi>Zoophore,</hi> was the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Couplet.</p>

                        <l>You, who preſume to move this way,</l>

                     </q>

                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100385:93"/>We took ſpecial care of that, cry'd <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi> when he had read them; for there is not a better, or a more Divine Lantern than ours in all Lanternland.</p>
                     <p>This Arch ended at a fine large round Alley, cover'd over with the interlaid Branches of Vines, loaded and adorned with Cluſters of five hundred different Colours, and of as many various Shapes, not natural but due to the skill of <hi>Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſome were Golden, others Blewiſh, Tawny, Azure, White, Black, Green, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtreak'd with many Colours, Long, Round, Triangular, Cod-like, Hairy, Great-headed, and Graſſy. That pleaſant Alley ended at three old Ivy-trees verdant, and all loaden with Rings. Our inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Lantern directed us to make our ſelves Hats with ſome of their Leaves, and cover our Heads wholly with 'em, which was immediately done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Prieſteſs, ſaid <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer days, would not like us have walk'd under this Arbour. There was a Myſtical Reaſon, anſwer'd our moſt perſpicuous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, that would have hinder'd her. For had ſhe gone under it, the Wine, or the Grapes of which 'tis made, that's the ſame thing, had been over her head, and then ſhe would have ſeem'd overtopt and maſter'd by Wine. Which implies, that Prieſts, and all Perſons who devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100385:94"/>
to the Contemplation of Divine Things, ought to keep their minds ſedate and calm, and avoid whatever might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and diſcompoſe their Tranquility; which nothing is more apt to do than Drunkenneſs.</p>
                     <p>You alſo, continued our Lantern, could not come into the Holy Bottle's preſence, after you have gone through this Arch, did not the noble Prieſteſs <hi>Bacbuc</hi> firſt ſee your Shooes full of Vine-leaves; which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is diametrically oppoſite to the other, and ſignifies that you deſpiſe Wine, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maſter'd it, as it were, tread it under foot.</p>
                     <p>I am no Scholar, quoth Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> for which I'm heartily ſorry; yet I find by my Breviary, that in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> a Woman was ſeen with the Moon under her Feet, which was a moſt wonderful ſight. Now, as <hi>Bigot</hi> explain'd it to me, this was to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, That ſhe was not of the Nature of other Women, for they have all the Moon at their Heads, and conſequently their Brains are always troubled with a <hi>Lunacy</hi>: This makes me willing to believe what you ſaid, dear Madam <hi>Lantern.</hi>

                     <p>WE went under ground through a plaiſter'd Vault, on which was courſely painted a Dance of Women and Satyrs, waiting on old <hi>Silenus</hi> who was grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning o' Horſeback on his Aſs.

                     <p>While we were thus talking, there came to us the great Flask whom our Lantern call'd the Philoſopher, her Holineſs the Bottle's Governor.

                     <head>CHAP. XLI. How the Temple was Illuminated with a wonderful Lamp.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I proceed to the Deſcription of the Bottle, I'll give you that of an admirable Lamp, that diſpens'd ſo large a Light over all the Temple, that tho it lay under ground, we could diſtinguiſh every Object as clearly as above it at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the Roof was fix'd a Ring of maſſive Gold as thick as my clench'd Fiſt. Three Chains ſomewhat leſs moſt curiouſlly wrought, hang'd about two foot and a half below it, and in a Triangle ſupported a round plate of fine Gold, whoſe Diameter or Breadth did not exceed two Cubits and half a ſpan. There were four holes in it, in each of which an empty Ball was faſten'd, hollow within, and open o' top, like a little Lamp; its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference about two hands breadth, each Ball was of Precious Stone; One an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſt, another an <hi>African</hi> Carbuncle, the third an Opale, and the fourth an Anthra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites: They were full of burning Water, five times diſtill'd in a Serpentine Lymbeck, and inconſumptible like the Oyl formerly put into <hi>Pallas</hi>'s Lamp at <hi>Acropolis</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:100385:104"/>
by <hi>Callimachus,</hi> In each of them was a flaming Wick of <hi>Asbeſtine</hi> Flax, as of old in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> ſuch as thoſe which <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> a moſt ſtudious Philoſopher, and <hi>Pandelinus</hi> of <hi>Carpaſium</hi> had, which were rather renew'd than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by the Fire.</p>
                     <p>About two foot and a half below that gold Plate, the three Chains were faſten'd to three Handles that were fix'd to a large round Lamp of moſt pure Chriſtal, whoſe Diameter was a Cubit and a half, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd about two hands breadth o' top; by which open place a Veſſel of the ſame Chriſtal ſhap'd ſomewhat like the lower part of a Gourd-like Lymbeck, or an Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, was put at the bottom of the great Lamp, with ſuch a quantity of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd burning Water, that the flame of the <hi>Asbetine</hi> Wick reach'd the Centre of the great Lamp. This made all its ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical body ſeem to burn and be in a Flame, becauſe the Fire was juſt at the Centre and middle Point: ſo that it was not more eaſy to fix the Eye on it, than on the Diſque of the Sun; the matter being wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bright and ſhining, and the VVork moſt tranſparent and dazzling, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the various Colours of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, whereof the four ſmall Lamps above the main Lamp were made, and their Luſtre was ſtill variouſly glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all over the Temple. Then this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Light being darted on the poliſh'd Marble and Agath, with which all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Temple was pargetted, our Eyes were entertain'd with a ſight of all the admirable Colours which the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow can boaſt when the Sun darts his fiery Rays on ſome dropping Clouds.</p>
                     <p>The Deſign of the Lamp was admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf; but, in my opinion, what added much to the Beauty of the whole, was that round the body of the Chriſtal-Lamp; there was carv'd in Cataglyphick Work, a lively and pleaſant Battel of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Boys, mounted on little Hobby-horſes, with little whirligig-Lances and Shields, that ſeem'd made of Vine-branches with Grapes on them; their Poſtures generally were very different, and their childiſh Strife and Motions were ſo ingeniouſly expreſt, that Art equall'd Nature in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proportion and Action. Neither did this ſeem engrav'd, but rather hew'd out and imboſs'd; in <hi>Relief</hi>; or, at leaſt like <hi>Groteſque,</hi> which by the Artiſt's Skill has the appearance of the roundneſs of the Object it repreſents; this was partly the effect of the various and moſt charming Light, which flowing out of the Lamp, fill'd the carv'd Places with its glorious Rays.</p>

                     <p>That which we had a mind to meaſure going from one ſide to another, two Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars over, at the firſt third part of the diſtance between them, was met by their lowermoſt and fundamental Line, which in a <hi>Conſult Line</hi> drawn as far as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Centre, equally divided, gave in a juſt Partition the diſtance of the Seven op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Pillars in a right Line; beginning at

                     <p>The ſmall Arches between the Pillars were of the ſame precious Stone of which the Pillars next to them were. Thus that Arch was of Saphir which ended at the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100385:108"/>
Hiacynth Pillar; and that was of Hiacynth which went towards the Diamond, and ſo on.</p>
                     <p>Above the Arches and Chapters of the Pillars on the inward Front a <hi>Cúpola</hi> was raiſed to cover the Fountain; it was ſurrounded by the Planetary Statues, Heptagonal at the bottom, and Spherical o' top; and of Chriſtal ſo pure, tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, well poliſhed, whole, and uniform in all its parts, without Veins, Clouds, Flaws or Streaks, that <hi>Xenocrates</hi> never ſaw ſuch a one in his life.</p>
                     <p>Within it were ſeen the Twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> the Twelve Months of the Year, with their Proprieties, the Two Equinoxes, the Ecliptic Line, with ſome of the moſt Remarkable fixed Stars about the Antartic Pole and elſewhere, ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly engraven, that I fancied them to be the Workmanſhip of King <hi>Necepſus</hi> or <hi>Peto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris</hi> the Ancient Mathematician.</p>
                     <p>On the top of the <hi>Cúpola,</hi> juſt over the Centre of the Fountain, were three noble long Pearls all of one ſize, Pear-faſhion, perfectly imitating a Tear, and ſo joined together as to repreſent a <hi>Flower-de-luce</hi> or <hi>Lilly,</hi> each of the Flowers ſeeming above a Hand's-breath. A <hi>Carbuncle</hi> jetted out of its Calix or Cup, as big as an <hi>Oſtridge</hi>'s Egg, cut ſeven ſquare (that Number ſo belov'd of Nature) and ſo prodigiouſly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100385:108"/>
glorious, that the ſight of it had like to have made us blind; for the fiery Sun, or the pointed Lightning are not more dazling and unſufferably bright.</p>
                     <p>Now were ſome Judicious Appraiſers to judge of the Value of this incomparable Fountain, and the Lamp of which we ſpoke, they would undoubtedly affirm, it exceeds that of all the Treaſures and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities in <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For that Carbuncle alone would have darken'd the <hi>Pantharb</hi> of <hi>Joachas</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Magician, with as much eaſe as the Sun outſhines and dims the Stars with his Meridian Rays.</p>
                     <p>Now let <hi>Cleopatra</hi> that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Quean boaſt of her Pair of Pendants, thoſe two Pearls, one of which ſhe cauſed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in Vinegar in the preſence of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> the <hi>Triumvir,</hi> her Gallant.</p>
                     <p>Or let <hi>Pompeia Plautina</hi> be proud of her Dreſs cover'd all over with Emeralds and Pearls curiouſly intermix'd, that attracted the Eyes of all <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſaid to be the Pit and Magazine of the Conquering Robbers of the Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>The Fountain had three Tubes or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of right Pearl, ſeated in three Equila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Angles already mention'd, extended on the Margent; and thoſe Channels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in a Snail-like Line winding equally on both ſides.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bacbuc</hi> then ſaid, Your Philoſophers will not allow, that Motion is begot by the power of Figures; Look here, and ſee the contrary.

                     <p>She then order'd her Attendants to make us drink; And to tell you the truth of the matter as near as poſſible, we are not, Heav'n be prais'd! of the nature of a Drove of Calf-lollies, who (as your Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows can't feed unleſs you bob them on the Tail) muſt be Ribroaſted with tough Crabtree, and firk'd into a ſtomach, or at

leaſt into an humour to eat or drink; No, we know better things, and ſcorn to ſcorn any man's Civility who civilly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to a Drinking Bout. <hi>Bacbuc</hi> ask'd us then, how we liked our Tiff; We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that it ſeem'd to us good harmleſs ſober <hi>Adam</hi>'s Liquor, fit to keep a man in the right way, and in a word, meer Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; more cool and clear than <hi>Argyrontes</hi> in <hi>Aetolia, Peneus</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly, Axius</hi> in <hi>Migdonia,</hi> or <hi>Cydnus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> a tempting ſight of whoſe cool ſilver Stream caus'd <hi>Alexander</hi> to prefer the ſhort-liv'd Pleaſure of bathing himſelf in it, to the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which he could not but foreſee would attend ſo ill-tim'd an Action.</p>

                        <hi>Panurge</hi> gaping as wide as his Jaws would ſtretch, <hi>Bacbuc</hi> took the Silver Book, at leaſt we took it for a real Book, for it look'd juſt for the world like a Breviary; but, in truth, it was a Breviary or Flask of Right <hi>Phalernian</hi> Wine as it came from the Grape, which ſhe made him ſwallow every drop.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Bacchus,</hi> quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> this was a Notable Chapter, a moſt Authentic Gloſs o' my word! Is this all that the Triſmegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Bottle's Word means? i' troth I like it extreamly, it went down like Mother's Milk. Nothing more, return'd <hi>Bacbuc,</hi> for <hi>Trinc</hi> is a <hi>Panomphean</hi> Word, that is, a Word underſtood, us'd and celebrated by all Nations, and ſignifies <hi>Drink.</hi>

                     <p>Some ſay in your World that <hi>Sack</hi> is a Word us'd in all Tongues, and juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the ſame ſenſe among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for, as <hi>Eſop's Fable</hi> hath it, all men are born with a Sack at the Neck, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally needy, and begging of each other; neither can the moſt powerful King be without the help of other men, or can any one that's poor ſubſiſt without the rich, though he be never ſo proud and inſolent; as for example, <hi>Hippias</hi> the Philoſopher, who boaſted he could do every thing. Much leſs can any one make ſhift without Drink than without a Sack. Therefore here we hold not that Laughing, but that

Drinking is the diſtinguiſhing Character of man. I don't ſay Drinking, taking that word ſingly and abſolutely in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; No, Beaſts then might put in for a ſhare; I mean drinking cool delicious Wine. For you muſt know, my Beloved, that by Wine we become Divine; neither can there be a ſurer Argument, or a leſs deceitful Divination. Your <note n="*" place="bottom">Varro.</note> Academics aſſert the ſame when they make the Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of Wine, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call OINOΣ, to be from <hi>Vis,</hi> Strength, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Power; for 'tis in its power to fill the Soul with all Truth, Learning and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
                     <p>If you obſerve what is written in <hi>Ionian</hi> Letters on the Temple-gate, you may have underſtood that Truth is in Wine. The Goddeſs Bottle therefore directs you to that divine Liquor, be your ſelf the Expounder of your Undertaking.</p>

'Tis moſt certain you have loſt it; 'tis no more on your Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere; but here below we have it. And, without a Cauſe, you ſometimes wonder to ſee whole Towns burn'd and deſtroy'd by Lightning, and Ethereal Fire, and are at a loſs about knowing from whom, by whom, and to what end thoſe dreadful Miſchiefs were ſent. Now, they are familiar and uſeful to us; and your Philoſophers who complain that the Ancients have left them nothing to write of, or to invent, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much miſtaken. Thoſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which you ſee in the Sky, whatever the ſurface
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100385:118"/>
of the Earth affords you, and the Sea, and every River contain, is not to be compar'd with what is hid within the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon, the Subterranean Ruler has juſtly gain'd, in almoſt every Language, the Epithete of Rich. Now, when your Sages ſhall wholly apply their Minds to a diligent and ſtudious Search after Truth, humbly begging the Aſſiſtance of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign God, whom formerly the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in their Language, call'd, <hi>The Hidden and the Conceal'd,</hi> and invoking him by that Name, beſeech him to reveal, and make himſelf known to them, that Almighty Being will out of his infinite Goodneſs, not only make his Creatures, but even himſelf known to them.</p>
                     <p>Thus will they be guided by good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns. For all the Ancient Philoſophers and Sages have held two things neceſſary, ſafely and pleaſantly to arrive at the Knowledg of God and true Wiſdom; firſt, God's gracious Guidance, then Man's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>So among the Philoſophers, <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> took <hi>Ariamſpes</hi> for the Companion of his Travels; <hi>Eſculapius, Mercury; Orpheus, Muſaeus; Pythagoras, Aclophemus</hi>; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Princes and Warriors, <hi>Hercules</hi> in his moſt difficult Atchievements, had his ſingular Friend <hi>Theſeus; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes, Diomedes;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100385:119"/>
Aeneas, Achates</hi>; you follow'd their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and came under the Conduct of an Illuſtrious Lantern: Now, in God's Name depart, and may he go along with you.</p>

For of Him comes, in Him is, and by Him is made perfect every Being, and all Life and Motion, as ſays the Evangelical Trumpet, my Lord St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> the 11th.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Ruler of this Year, and of all others, according to our Authentick Solution, will be God Almighty.

                     <p>For this reaſon the Crabs will go ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and the Rope-makers backward; the little Stools will get up on the Benches, and the Spits on the Racks, and the Bands on the Hats; and many a ones Yard will hang down and dangle, for want of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Pouches; Fleas will be generally black; Bacon will run away from Peaſe in Lent; the Belly will waddle before; the A— will ſit down firſt; there won't be a Bean left in a Twelf-cake, nor an Ace in a Fluſh; the Dice won't run to your wiſh tho you cog them, and the chance that you deſire will ſeldom come; Brutes ſhall ſpeak

                     <p>I Writ to you at large all the News I could learn, the 28th of <hi>January</hi> laſt paſt, by a Gentleman, Servant to <hi>Monſieur de Montreuil,</hi> call'd <hi>Tremeliere,</hi> who return'd from <hi>Naples,</hi> where he had bought ſome Horſes of that Kingdom for his Lord, and was returning to him with all ſpeed. The ſame day I receiv'd the Pacquet that you were pleas'd to ſend me from <hi>Legugé,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 10th of the ſaid Month, in which you may ſee the method I have taken for the delivery of your Letters, by which they are ſafely and ſuddenly brought to me here. Your ſaid Letters and Pacquet,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100385:149"/>
were deliver'd at the Arms of <hi>Baſil,</hi> on the one and twentieth of the ſame Month, the eight and twentieth they were deliver'd to me here. And to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage at <hi>Lyons,</hi> (for that's the Point and principal Place) the Bookſeller at the Arms of <hi>Baſil</hi> to be diligent in this Affair, I repeat what I writ to you in my afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Pacquet, if you chance to write to me about any thing of Conſequence: That it is my advice, that on the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of writing to me, you write a word or two to him in a Letter, in which be pleas'd to incloſe ſome Gold-crowns, or ſome other piece of old Gold, as a Royal, an Angel or Salutation, in conſideration of the pains and care he takes of them, ſo ſmall a matter will more and more endear him to your Service.</p>
                     <p>Now, to Anſwer your Letters, I have diligently ſearch'd the Regiſters of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſince the time that you commanded me, that is, the year 1529, 1530, and 1531, to ſee if <hi>Dom. Phillippe</hi>'s Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to his Nephew were to be found, and have given the Clerks of the Regiſter two Gold-crowns, which is but a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the great and tedious Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it. In ſhort, they have found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, nor ever heard news of his Procurations; wherefore I doubt there is ſome foul play in his Caſe, or the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100385:149"/>
you writ to me were not ſufficient to find 'em. And that I may be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd in it, you ſhould tell me, <hi>cujus Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſis, of what Dioceſs</hi> the ſaid Friar <hi>Dom. Phillippe</hi> was, and if you have heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give more light in the matter, as if it was <hi>pure &amp; ſimpliciter,</hi> or <hi>causâ permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis.</hi>

                     <p>THe Grains which I ſent you, I can aſſure you, are the beſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> of the ſame which his Holineſs has caus'd to be ſow'd in his Privy-Garden of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veder.</hi> There are no other kinds of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads on this ſide but thoſe of <hi>Naſidord</hi> and <hi>Arrouſſa,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Legugé</hi> ſeem to me altogether as good, and ſomewhat more ſweet and grateful to the Stomach, and particularly better for you; for thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> in my opinion, are too hot and tough.</p>
                     <p>As for the Seaſon for ſowing 'em, you muſt caution your Gardeners not to ſow 'em altogether ſo early as they do on this ſide, for it is not warm Weather ſo ſoon with you as here. They may very well ſow your Sallads twice a year, that is to ſay, in <hi>Lent,</hi> and in <hi>November</hi>; and they may ſow the white Cardes or Thiſtles in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi>; the Melons, Pompions, and the others in <hi>March</hi>; fencing them for ſome days with Mats, and a thin Layer of Horſe-dung, not altogether rotten, when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100385:150"/>
they fear it will freeze. Many other Grains beſides are ſold here, as <hi>Alexandria</hi> Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, Matronal-Violets, and Shrubs, with which they refreſh their Chambers in the Summer, call'd <hi>Belvedere,</hi> and other Phyſical Herbs. But this would be more for my Lady <hi>d'Eſtiſſac</hi>'s turn. If you pleaſe to have of all ſorts, I will ſend them you without fail. But I am forc'd to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe again to your Alms; for the Thirty Crowns which you order'd to be paid me here, are almoſt gone, yet I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted none of them to any ill uſe, nor for eating, for I Eat and Drink at my Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>du Bellay</hi>'s, or at my Lord of <hi>Maſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you will be pleaſed to ſend me a Bill of Exchange, I hope I ſhall make uſe of it wholly to your Service, and not remain ungrateful.

                     <p>Thanks be to God I have made an end of my buſineſs, and it has coſt me no more than the taking out of the Bulls, his Holineſs having, of his own good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100385:151"/>
given me the Compoſition. And I believe you will find the Proceedings right enough, and that I have obtain'd nothing by them, but what is juſt and lawful. But I have been oblig'd to adviſe very much with able Counſel, that every thing might be according to due form; and I dare modeſtly tell you, that I have in a manner hardly made uſe of my Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>du Bellay,</hi> or my Lord Embaſſador, tho out of their kindneſs, they not only offer'd me their own good Word and Favour, but abſolutely to make uſe of the King's Name.</p>

                     <p>On the contrary, the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> was moſt honourably receiv'd by him at his arrival, the Emperor went out before him, and, <hi>Poſt manus oſcula,</hi> he order'd him to be attended to the Caſtle of <hi>Capua</hi> in the ſame Town, where his Natural Daughter has an Apartment; ſhe is affianc'd to the ſaid Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Salerne,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Marquiſs <hi>de Vaſt,</hi> the Duke <hi>D'Alva,</hi> and other Principal Lords of his Court.

                     <p>I Writ to you, that the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> is return'd from <hi>Naples,</hi> and retir'd to <hi>Ferrara.</hi> Her Highneſs, the Lady <hi>Renee,</hi> is brought to Bed of a Daughter; ſhe had another fine Daughter before, between Six and Seven years of Age, and a little Son of Three years old. He could not agree with the Pope, becauſe he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an exceſſive Sum of Money for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of his Lands. Notwithſtanding, he had abated fifty thouſand Crowns for the love of the ſaid Lady, and this by the Solicitations of my Lords the Cardinals <hi>du Bellay</hi> and <hi>Maſcon,</hi> ſtill to increaſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Affection of the ſaid Duke towards her. This was the occaſion of <hi>Lyon Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s coming to this Town, and they only differ'd for Fifteen thouſand Crowns; but they could not agree, becauſe the Pope would have him acknowledg, that he held and poſſeſs'd all his Lands intirely in ſee of the Apoſtolical See, which the other would not. For he would acknowledg no more than his deceas'd Father had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and what the Emperor had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> by a Decree in the time of the deceas'd Pope <hi>Clement.</hi>

                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100385:153"/>Thus he departed, <hi>re infectâ,</hi> [without doing any thing,] and went to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who promis'd him at his coming, that he would eaſily make the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and come to the Point contain'd in his ſaid Decree; and that he ſhould go home, leaving an Embaſſador with him, to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Affair when he came on this ſide, and that he ſhould not pay the Sum alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy agreed upon, before he heard further from him. The Craft lies here, that the Emperor wants Money, and ſeeks it on all hands, and Taxes all the world he can, and borrows it from all Parts. When he comes hither, he will demand ſome of the Pope, 'tis a plain caſe. For he will repreſent to him, <hi>That he has made all theſe Wars againſt the</hi> Turk <hi>and</hi> Barberoſſa, <hi>to ſecure</hi> Italy <hi>and the Pope, and that he muſt of neceſſity contribute to it.</hi> The Pope will anſwer, <hi>That he has no Money, and will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly prove his Poverty to him.</hi> Then the Emperor without disburſing any thing, <hi>will demand the Duke of</hi> Ferrara<hi>'s of him, which he knows he may command at a word, and this is the Myſtery of the Matter.</hi> Yet 'tis not certain whether things will be manag'd thus or no.</p>

                     <p>YOu ask whether the Lord <hi>Pietro Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico,</hi> is the Pope's Legitimate Son or Baſtard; be aſſur'd, the Pope was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver married, which is as much as to ſay, that the aforeſaid Gentleman is certainly a Baſtard; The Pope had a very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Siſter. There is to be ſeen to this day, at the Palace in that Apartment where the Summiſts reſide, built by Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> an Image of our Lady, which ('tis ſaid) was drawn after that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman: She was married to a Gentleman, Couſin to the Lord <hi>Rance,</hi> who being in the War, in the Expedition of <hi>Naples,</hi> the ſaid Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> * * *: Now the Lord <hi>Rance</hi> having certain knowledg of the thing, gave notice of it to his Couſin, <hi>Telling him, that be ought not to ſuffer ſuch a wrong done to their Family by a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Pope; and that if he would endure it, he himſelf would not.</hi> In ſhort, her Husband kill'd her; for which Fact the preſent Pope griev'd: And to aſſwage his Sorrow, <hi>Alexander</hi> made him a Cardinal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet but very young, and beſtow'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Marks of his favour upon him.</p>
                     <p>At that time the Pope kept a <hi>Roman</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>della Caſa Ruffina,</hi> and by her had a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100385:154"/>
Daughter who was married to the Lord <hi>Bauge,</hi> Count of <hi>Sancta Fiore,</hi> who died in this Town ſince I came hither. By her he has had one of the two little Cardinals (who is called the Cardinal of <hi>Sancta Fiore.)</hi> The Pope likewiſe had a Son, who is the ſaid <hi>Pietro Ludovico,</hi> concerning whom you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, who has married the Daughter of the Count <hi>de Cervelle,</hi> on whom he has got a whole Houſeful of Children, and among others the little Cardinalicule <hi>Farneſe,</hi> who was made Vice-chancellour by the death of the late Cardinal <hi>de Medicis.</hi> By what is ſaid you may judge, why the Pope did not very well love the Lord <hi>Rance,</hi> and <hi>vice versâ,</hi> [on the other ſide] the Lord <hi>Rance</hi> put no great confidence in him: Whence ariſes a great quarrel between my Lord <hi>John-Paul de Cere,</hi> Son to the ſaid Lord <hi>Rance,</hi> and the abovenamed <hi>Petro Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divico,</hi> for he is reſolved to revenge the death of his Aunt.</p>
                     <p>But he is quit of it on the part of the ſaid Lord <hi>Rance,</hi> for he di'd the Eleventh day of this Month, going a Hunting, in which he extremely delighted, old as he was.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Defer to my next to give you more at large the News concerning the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; for his Deſign is not yet perfectly diſcovered. He is ſtill at <hi>Naples,</hi> but is expected here by the end of this Month. Great preparations are made for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abundance of Triumphal Arches. His four Harbingers have been a good while here in Town; two of them <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> one <hi>Burgundian,</hi> and the fourth a <hi>Flemming.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis great pity to ſee the Ruins of the Churches, Palaces and Houſes which the Pope has cauſed to be demoliſhed and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down to make and level him a way. For the Charges of his Reception he has laid a Tax on the College of Cardinals, on thoſe who have Places at Court, and the Artificers of the Town as much as the very <hi>Aquarols.</hi> The Town is already full of Foreigners.</p>
                     <p>On the Fifth of this Month the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Trent (Tridentinus)</hi> arrived, being ſent here by the Emperor. His Train is very numerous, and more ſumptuous than the Pope's. He had with him above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Germans</hi> all dreſt alike; their Gowns
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100385:155"/>
were Red, with a Yellow Galloon; and on their right Sleeve was embroydered a Wheat-ſheave ti'd cloſe, and round it was written <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NITAS.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I hear he is much for Peace, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling all the Chriſtian Princes. He eagerly deſires a General Council, whatever is done in other matters. I was preſent when he ſaid to my Lord Cardinal <hi>du Bellay: His Holineſs, the Cardinals, Biſhops and Prelates of the Church are againſt a Council, and will by no means hear any thing of it, though they are preſſed by Secular Princes on that Subject; but I ſee the Time at hand when the Prelates of the Church ſhall be reduced to demand a Council, and the Laity will not hearken to it. This will be when the Latter have taken from the Church all the Wealth and Patrimony which they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while Eccleſiaſtics by the means of frequent Councils maintained Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among the Laity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> came to this Town on the Third of this Month in no very good Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. No manner of particular reſpect was ſhewn him at his Arrival, ſave only that the Lord <hi>Pietro Ludovico</hi> conducted him as far as the Palace of the Cardinal <hi>Camerlingo,</hi> who is a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Spinola.</hi> The next day he ſaluted the Pope, and the day after went away for <hi>Genoa,</hi> on the Emperor's behalf, to inform
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100385:156"/>
himſelf underhand concerning the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>French</hi> about the War.</p>
                     <p>We have had here a poſitive Account of the Old Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Death; and they add, That the Princeſs her Daughter lies very ill.</p>
                     <p>However, The Bull that was to be iſſued out againſt the King of <hi>England</hi> to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him, and to <hi>interdict</hi> and <hi>proſcribe</hi> his Kindom, did not paſs at the Conſiſtory, becauſe of the Articles, <hi>De commeatibus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternorian &amp; commerciis mutuis,</hi> Of the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Foreigners and Mutual Intercourſes, which my Lord Cardinal <hi>Du Bellay</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Maſcon</hi> oppoſed in the King's name, on account of the Intereſts which he pretends to have in it. It has been put off till the Emperor's Arrival.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I moſt humbly recommend my ſelf to your kind Favour, praying God that it may pleaſe him to keep you long in health and proſperity.</p>
