            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amen.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ECAVSE</hi> (ryght woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) at your earnest request and godly desire, I preached the 15. of Ianuarie last passed, a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Tower of London, in the presence of Doctour Watson, sometime bishop of Lyncolne, and Maister Fecknam, sometime also Abbot of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, wyth others: Sithens the which my Sermon, the sayd M. Fecknam hath seemed by writing, to condemne certaine articles contained in my Doctrine at that present, and there by me taught. That is to say: where I affirmed, that it was impossible to keepe the law of God, he hath taken vpon him to affirme the contrarie. vz. That it is possible, and that it lyeth in mans power, to obserue and keepe them. Secondly, where I taught, that we be iustified by faith onely: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the same, and therewyth teacheth iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by workes. Thirdly, where I denied the inuocation of Saintes: he affirmeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. And fourthly and lastly, where as I affirmed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all sinnes are deadly: he teacheth the contrary. Aduouching that there be some veniall sinnes, &amp; therefore concludeth that all are not deadly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19304:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>All which his assertions, he semeth very clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to ground and maintaine by the autoritie of the word of God, and consent of the Fathers. Which thing he hath in such maner, and wyth such goodly glosing wordes blased and set forth, that at the first shew he seemeth vtterly to beate me downe to the ground, and maketh that my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in the eyes of the simple, and of such whose consciences are not as yet setled in true religion, to appeare false and vnsound, and therefore of no credite, nor to be receaued. I therfore thought it my bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den dutie to stand in the defence of my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, being sound and perfect, and according to the sacred and holy Scriptures. And bringyng M. Fecknams obiections to the bright shinyng Sunne of God his most holy woord, hys gay cloked colours might be detected and made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the eyes of all men, and thereby the counterfeited mistes of his Assertions driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the true and wholesome doctrine of myne might be made the more manifest. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue taken vpon me at this present to answer the same, wherein I haue vsed this order.</p>
            <p>First, I haue aunswered euery article of the foure, particularly, and restored the Scriptures to their right sence, which M. Fecknam (for the maintenaunce of his errors) hath very corruptly wrested. That done, I proue my doctrine true, both by the Scriptures and Fathers, so suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, that I am perswaded that all colours of caueling is remoued or taken away, to all such as seeke the truth, and onely seeke the same, for the better setling of their consciences, rather then for vayneglory or estimacion of men.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore now finished this my aunswer and defence of my doctrine aforesayd: thought it good to dedicate the same to your worship, that
<pb facs="tcp:19304:3"/>
you with the rest of Gods Children, may be the better setled and grounded in this most wholsome and sound doctrine of God his glorious Gospell. And the other, whose eyes are not yet opened, God may in his great mercies hereby remoue the mistes of the false and corrupt doctrine of the Papistes, from the same. That they may yet now at length see how they haue bene seduced and deceiued, and receiue the truth now also offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, to their euerlasting comfort. Whych obtayned, I haue my desire, and shall in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect thinke my labours herein well bestowed, which I pray God for his sonne Iesus Christes sake may redounde to hys glory, and profit of hys Church. Amen.</p>
            <p>Which thing, as I haue well ment, so I hope your worship wyll take in good part. Whom I pray God so to behold w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his most fauorable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, that as he hath begonne in you (and that in hys free mercies) this his good worke, and opened your hart to beleue his truth, and your eyes to see the same, perfect it in you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end. That you may dayly grow from grace to grace, from fayth to fayth, and from vertue to vertue, vntyll you become a perfecte man in Iesus Christ, to hys glory and honour, and to your euerlasting comfort.</p>

               <p>Which I did affirme to be impossible. Your scriptures you alledge, are these that follow: whereof the first is Christ in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi> 11. where he saith: <hi>Tollite iugum meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> super vos. &amp;c.</hi> Take vp my yoke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:19304:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you should sée, that you are fowly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For in that Christ calleth it <hi>Iugum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> my yoke, he maketh a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene his doctrine and the law, and that in respect of the straightnes of the law, and of the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his doctrine, and of that he requireth of his Children and Scholers. But howe heauy a lumpe the law is, <hi>S. Peter</hi> describeth in the .15. of the Actes, thus: <hi>Nunc ergo quid tentatis Deum, vt imponatur iugum super ceruices discipulorum, ꝙ ne<expan>

And that thys yoke is eased in Christ, <hi>S.

By which wordes you sée, the impossibilitie in vs, and the ease by Christ. For what néede the perfection of our works by him, if possibilitie remayned in vs? But <hi>S.

Thus: <hi>Etenim si data fuisset lex, que possit viuificare, vere ex lege esset iustitia, sed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusit scriptura omnia sub peccatum. &amp;c. i.</hi> For if there had bene a law geuen, which could haue geuen life, then no doubt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes should haue come by the law: but the scripture concluded all vnder sinne. &amp;c.

               <p>Now to your third alledged scripture out of the <hi>Rom 2.</hi> 2. thus: <hi>Non enim qui audiunt
<pb facs="tcp:19304:6"/>
legem, iusti sunt apud Deum, sed qui legem factis exprimunt, iusti habebuntur.</hi> 1. For in the sight of God they are not righteous which heare the law, but the doers of the law shall be iustified. Whereupon you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus: If they do the law, then it may be done, then it is possible. &amp;c. So followeth your consequence, <hi>Ergo</hi> the law is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be kept. If you consider wel this text, with the circumstances, you shall wel perceiue, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> meaneth nothing les hereby, then that a man may absolutely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law, and thereby be iustified. For first the Apostle goeth about to refell the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which supposed that the hearing and vnderstanding of the law, was sufficient to the accomplishing of the same, although they in no part fulfilled it, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> here confuteth. As though he wold say vnto them: You brag that you are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the lawe, when in no part you do fulfill the law, but bragging of a litle su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall vnderstandyng of the law, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your selues strayght, that you do fulfill the law, as though the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law, consisted in knowledge and vnderstanding, and not in fulfilling: But herein you are deceiued, for not the hearers, but the doers of the law are iustified. And
<pb facs="tcp:19304:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
because none fully accomplisheth the law so absolutely as Gods iustice requireth, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our iustification commeth not by the law (whereof the <hi>Iewes</hi> bragged) <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And therefore in the same chapter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle concludeth thus: <hi>Nam perfectio legis Christus, ad iustificationem, omni credenti. i.</hi> For Christ is the fulfilling of the law, to iustifie all that beleue.</p>
               <p>And lastly for your example alledged out of <hi>Luke. i. Erant ambo iusti coram Deo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentes in omnibus mandatis &amp; iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus Domini irreprehensibiles. i.</hi> They were both righteous before God, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in all the lawes and ordinaunces of the Lord without reproofe: These wordes (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) are not to be vnderstanded, as though <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> absolutely fulfilled the law, for then they had no néede of Christ, and Christ had not said truly then in the .17. of <hi>S. Luke. Dicite, serui inutiles su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. &amp;c. i.</hi> Say ye, we are vnprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes. &amp;c. But therefore they are sayd to be iust, because God in Christ imputed not vnto them, their sinne, for they were not without their faultes. And <hi>Dauid</hi> is true, who sayth: <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. <hi>Omnes declinauerunt, &amp; simul inutiles facti sunt, non est qui faciat bonum, non est vs<expan>

And in thys number I am sure, are also comprehended both <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And the same Prophet in the .142. <hi>Psalme</hi> hath thus: <hi>Non intres in iudicium cum seruo tuo Domine, quia non iustificabitur in conspectu tuo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis viuens. i.</hi> Enter not into iudgement with thy seruaunt O Lord, for no man lyuing shall be iustified in thy sight. And it is to be supposed, that in these wordes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ment not onely such as lyued in hys time, but also in times, both past, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to come. But now let vs sée, what the Fathers say to this matter. And first <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> hath thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ambros. ad Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Et lex habuit iustitiam, sed ad presens, non quia iustificaret apud Deum. Remittere enim peccata non potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, vt de peccatoribus faceret iustos, sed ad hoc data est, vt terrori esset, prouoca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ad bonam vitam, irreuerentes puniens. Ideo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est data lex, que possit viuificare, sed condemnare.</hi> The same in English.</p>
               <p>And the law had righteousnes but for a tyme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not because it could iustifie before the Lord: For it could not so forgeue sinnes, that of Sinners it could make them iust. But to this end it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that it might be a terror, prouoking men vnto
<pb facs="tcp:19304:8"/>
good life, punishing the disobedient or vnreuerent persons. Therefore is not a law geuen which can geue lyfe, but condemne.</p>
               <p>Also <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Dominus iustam legem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>August. in prefat. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisto. ad Galat.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>iniustis hominibus dedit, ad demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranda peccata eorum, non auferanda. Non enim aufert peccatum. nisi gratia fidei. &amp;c. i.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord hath geuen a iust law, to vniust men, to make manifest their sinnes, and not to take them away. For it taketh not away sinnes, but by grace of fayth. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>S. August. de spiritu &amp; lit. ca.</hi> 19. saith: <hi>Lex ergo data est, vt gratia quereretur, gratia data est, vt lex impleretur.</hi> That is.</p>
               <p>The law therefore was geuen, that grace might be sought. Grace was geuen, that the law might be fulfilled. And who is this <hi>Gratia,</hi> grace, M. <hi>Eecknam,</hi> but Christ?</p>
               <p>Againe the said <hi>Augustine,</hi> writing vpon the .118. <hi>Psalme,</hi> saith: <hi>Noli ergo superbire, noli de tuo, que nulla est virtute presumere, &amp; intelliges, quare sit a bono Deo, bona lex data, que tamen viuificare non possit. Ad hoc enim data est, vt te de magno paruulum faceret, vt te ad faciendam legem, vires de tuo non habere monstraret, ac sic inops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignus, &amp; egenus, ad gratiam confugeres &amp; clamares: Miserere mei Domine, quoniam infirmus sum.</hi> That is.</p>
               <p>Be not therefore proude, do not presume of thine own power, which in deede is none, and thou
<pb facs="tcp:19304:8"/>
shalt vnderstand wherefore a good lawe was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by a good God, which neuerthelesse cannot geue life. For to this purpose was it geuen, that of great it might make thee little, that it myght shew vnto thee that thou haste no strength of thy selfe to do the law. And so being needy, vnworthy and poore, mightest flee vnto grace and cry: Haue mercy on me O God, for I am weake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Bernard</hi> also <hi>in Epist. omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sanct. ser. j.</hi> saith: <hi>Beati qui esuriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; sitiunt iustitiam, quoniam ipsi saturabuntur. Sed quid potest esse omnis iustitia nostra coram Deo? No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne iuxta prophetam, velut pannus menstruate reputabitur, &amp; si districte iudicetur, iniusta inuenietur, omnis iustitia nostra, &amp; minus habens? Quid ergo de peccatis erit, quando ne ipsa quidem pro se poterit respondere iustitia? propterea obnixe, cum Propheta clamantes: Non intres in iudicium. &amp;c. Tota humilitate, ad misericordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recurramus, que sola potest saluare animas nostras.</hi> That is.</p>
               <p>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, for they shall be satisfied. But what can all our righteousnes be before God? Shall it not, according to the saying of the Prophet, be counted as a most filthie and defiled cloth? And if all our righteousnes be straightly iudged, it shall be found vniust, and hauing lesse force. What ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall become of our sinnes, where as not euen our righteousnes it selfe, shall be able to aunswer for it selfe? Therefore, with all our might, crying out with the Prophet as lowd as we can: Enter not into iudgement. &amp;c. with all humblenes let vs
<pb facs="tcp:19304:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
runne to the throne of mercy, whych onely is able to saue our soules.</p>
               <p>I wyll therefore conclude with <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> thus: <hi>Quoniam ab ipso, &amp; per ipsum, &amp; in ipso, sunt omnia, Ergo non ei aliquid dedimus, &amp; tenemus debitorem. Vnde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitorem? Quia promissor est. Non dicimus Deo: Domine, redde ꝙ accepisti, sed redde quod promisisti.</hi> That is.</p>
               <p>Because from him, and by him, and in hym, are althinges: Therefore wee haue not geuen any thing vnto him, &amp; hold him as a debtor. Whence is he our debtor? Euen because he hath promised. We say not vnto God: Lord, geue agayne that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hast receiued; but geue vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast promised.</p>
               <p>The law therefore can not absolutely of vs be obserued, because God doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require of vs an outward obseruing of the same, but also an inward. For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is giltie of whoredome that committeth the act, but he also that lusteth after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans wife. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. He is not onely a murtherer that killeth a man: but he also that hateth his brother in his hart. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. But who can say he lusteth not. &amp;c? Finde him, and I will graunt, the law is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be kept of vs.</p>

2 That the Angels &amp; Sain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of heauen may heare our prayers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be praied vnto.</head>
               <p>For the confirmation hereof you alledge these Scriptures. <hi>vz. Luke.</hi> 15. <hi>Ita dico vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, gaudium erit coram Angelis Dei super vno peccatore resipiscente. &amp;c. i.</hi> I say vnto you, that likewyse there shall be ioye in the presence of the Angels of God ouer one syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that repenteth. For the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doe know that synners repent here in earth, and therefore doe reioyce: For they reioyce not, but because they knowe, and therefore we ought to pray to them. But though Christ saith, that they know, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do repent, yet he sayth not: therefore let sinners pray to Angels. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> telleth vs an other lesson, <hi>Reuela.</hi> 22. when hee was about to woorship the Angell, the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell saith: <hi>Vide ne feceris, conseruus enim tuus sum. &amp;c. i.</hi> Se thou doe it not, for I am thy fellowe seruaunt. &amp;c. and so concludeth, <hi>Deum adora,</hi> worship God.</p>
               <p>And your second scripture, which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:19304:10"/>
out of <hi>Toby.</hi> 12. where the Angel saith: <hi>Quando orabas cum lachrimis. &amp;c.</hi> When thou didst pray with teares. &amp;c. <hi>Ego obtuli o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem tuam domino,</hi> I offered thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto the Lord: He saith not, when thou praiedst to me, I did this and that. Neither can you proue, that either <hi>Tobias,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before Christ, praied vnto any of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Prophetes that died before them. But all their praiers were alwaies, and at all times directed onely vnto God. And as for the new Testament, ye are vtterly voyd either of scripture, or example. And therfore your place alledged, serueth to no purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to proue the inuocation of Saintes.</p>
               <p>Your places also alledged out of the 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. of <hi>Elias,</hi> and of <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Actes.</hi> 5. they then liuing in this world, maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, to proue that we should pray to them being dead. Truly I muche maruayle of thys your waywarde blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes herein.</p>
               <p>And as concerning my interpretation of <hi>Esays</hi> wordes in his .63. <hi>Chap.</hi> I sée no more iust cause, why I should more beleue <hi>Ierom</hi> herein, then you: as though <hi>Ierome</hi> neuer erred. But if you looke vnto the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the text, it will tel you, that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation goeth more nere the mynde of
<pb facs="tcp:19304:10"/>
the Prophet, then <hi>Ieroms.</hi> As though the Prophet would say thus or the like: When I consider my vnworthynes, it driueth me into an abashment, so that I dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to thy Maiestie, and yet on the other side, if I shoulde praye to anye other, I should praye in vayne, because they heare me not. For euen <hi>Abraham</hi> him selfe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs not, nor <hi>Israel</hi> is not acquaynted with vs: It is therefore thou O Lord that must onely heare and helpe vs, for thou art onely our father and redemer.</p>
               <p>And trow you, that though <hi>Origen</hi> called vpon <hi>Iob, S. Ciprian</hi> vpon the Martyrs, S. <hi>Ierom</hi> vpon <hi>Paul.</hi> &amp;c. (as you alledge) that we thinke it well done of them, and also of vs to be followed? Nay (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) we must follow them, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> willeth vs to follow him, when he sayd. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Imitatores mei estote, sicut &amp; ego Christi.</hi> Follow me, as I do Christ. And so farre as the Fathers, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in doctrine, religion, or conuersation fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ, that is to say, so long as their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges and doctrine do agrée with the sacred scriptures, we will &amp; do, both receiue them, beleue them, follow them, and thanke God for them. But if they stray from the sincere rules thereof, we will leaue them: vnlesse you can shewe vs a better warrant for the

               <p>
                  <hi>S.

And why we ought so to do, our Mayster Christ rendreth a reason before. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. <hi>Si quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid petieritis nomine meo, hoc facia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificetur pater per filium. i.</hi> If ye shall aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in my name, I wil do it, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be glorified by the sonne.</p>
               <p>Here you see (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) that <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> sayth, that Christ is onelye our Mediatour. And Christ him selfe telleth vs, that he onely is the waye to God, and that we haue no accesse to God, but onely hy him.
<pb facs="tcp:19304:11"/>
And also you sée, hee promiseth helpe, if our prayers be made to God the Father in hys name, and also that thereby God is glorified. And therefore of necessitie it must followe, that as God is glorified, when we praye to Christ, as to our Mediatour: so it must also of necessitie followe, that hee is dishonored, when wee of our owne heades appoynt to our selues of Creatures, sundry and seuerall Mediatours. And therefore we may not in any wyse impart his honor to any creature: for if we do, we shall heare God crye out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst vs, by the Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> 42. <hi>Ego do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, hoc est nomen meum, &amp; gloria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am alteri non dabo.</hi> &amp;c. i. I am the Lord, and that is my name, and I wil not geue my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to an other. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By these scriptures therefore I am mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly taught, that onely Iesus Christ is our Mediatour, and therefore no creature ought to be inuocated, or prayed to. &amp;c. Now let vs see what the Fathers say to this matter.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:19304:14"/>And for this Article which you thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, you expound the place alledged by me out of <hi>S. Paul Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Arbitremur iustificari hominem sine operibus legis.</hi> We suppose a man to be iustified without the woorkes of the law, after this sort: You say that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred hereupon, that workes do in no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wise iustifie vs, which is vtterly false. For my woordes were, that hereby <hi>S. Paul</hi> did teach vs, that wee were not iustified by workes: Your addition (in no maner of wise) I spake not. For I know M. <hi>Fecknam,</hi> that there is two maner of iustifications vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the scriptures, the one before God, the other before men. Of iustification before God, it is truly said by <hi>S. Paul Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit autem Abraham Deo, &amp; imputatum est ei ad iustitiam.</hi> Abraham beleued God, &amp; it was imputed vnto him vnto righteousnes And of sustification before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>S. Iames</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the. 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> of his Epistle thus: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham pater noster, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ex factis iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catus est, cum obtulisset filium suum super-altare? &amp;c. i.</hi> Was not our father Abraham iustified through workes, when he had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his sonne vpon the aulter? &amp;c. And that he so ment, appeareth by his very woordes which follow within few lines after, thus: <hi>Credidit autem Abraham Deo, et imputatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19304:14"/>

               <p>Thus we sée <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Iames</hi> reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and both teach iustification by faith, in the sight of God. For it is necessarye, that because faith is an inuisible thing, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not rightly be iudged of men, for that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may brag before men, and say, that he hath faith, when he is vtterly voide therof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessitie workes be required, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the iustifieng faith, as the shadow the body, that the faith which is onely knowen vnto God, may by the godly conuersation of the iustified man appeare, and be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to men also. And therfore <hi>S. Paul,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath proued our iustification by faith, without the workes of the law (from the .3. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the Epistle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> vnto the .8. of the same) then he there concludeth thus: <hi>Nulla igitur nunc condemnatio his, qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siti sunt in Christo Iesu, qui non iuxta carne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> versantur, sed iuxta spiritum. i.</hi> There is nowe therefore no condemnation to them which are graffed in Christ Iesu, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit. And when the same Apostle hath in most plaine wordes thus proued our iustification
<pb facs="tcp:19304:15"/>
by faith without workes. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>Gratia e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim seruati estis ꝑ fidem, id<expan>

               <p>And where as you (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) make great wonder at our subteltie, or rather sensible absurditie of thys our opinion, of iustifieng by fayth onely: you fall into these questions, whether we meane faith without penaunce (as you terme it) I suppose you meane repentance, or faith w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out Baptisme, or faith without hope, or faith w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out feare, or faith without charitie. As though, when we teach that we be iustified by faith onely, that we speake of an opinion of fayth onely, or of a dead or imagined fayth. No, no M. <hi>Feck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> you wilfully wrest our meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And (to say the truth) I may much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter herein wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at your peuish ouerthwart vnderstandyng of vs, then you maruell at
<pb facs="tcp:19304:15"/>
our subtile opinion, or sensible absurdity. For when we speake of iustification by faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we vnderstand not as you fondly imagine a dead or imagined faith, but such a fayth as can no more be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out repentance, hope, filial feare, charitie. &amp;c. the the sunne can be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out his brightnes, or the fire without his heate.</p>
               <p>Neither do we speake herein of works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, but euen of woorkes after fayth. For we know <hi>S. Paules</hi> Maxime <hi>Roma.</hi> 14. <hi>Quicquid non est ex fide, peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est,</hi> what soeuer is not of fayth, is sinne. And <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. <hi>Atqui sine fide fieri non potest, vt quis illi placeat.</hi> 1. But without faith, it is impossible that any man can please him. Our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is not so grosse, as to mean of works before faith, though you lust so to cauel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with vs. For after a true faith is concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holy Ghost, in the hart of a good Christian, he worketh not of hope of merite, but of loue, not to be iustified thereby, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is so commaunded by his Sauiour. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. <hi>Si diligitis me, precepta mea seruate</hi> If ye loue me, kéepe my commaundements.

               <p>That euery sinne is mortall (M. <hi>Feckna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>) in that it is sinne, is euident by the words of God himselfe (who can best iudge of thys matter) in the .18. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> saying thus: <hi>Anima, que peccauerit, ipsa morietur.</hi> The soule that sinneth, shal die. Here is no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or difference made of sin, but any sin, in that it is sinne, is deadly. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. For the rewarde of sinne is death. Here also you sée, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> maketh no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of sinne, but that <hi>Mors,</hi> death, is the reward of sinne generally, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out exception. And <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. Euery one that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth sinne, the same also committeth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and sinne is iniquitie. Here also you sée, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith (making no difference of sin) but that syn, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is syn, it is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without exception. But peraduenture, he was not so well learned as you M. <hi>Feck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> he was not acquainted with your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish schoole Doctrine, for they be so déepe in their diuinitie, that they dare corred the holy Ghost, and say, that <hi>S. Paul,</hi> in defining of faith, in the .11, to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> hath not don
<pb facs="tcp:19304:19"/>
it <hi>Satis Magistraliter,</hi> not Doctorlike inough or not Clarkly. And so I thinke you wil not sticke to say, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> here, speaking of sin generally, hath not done the same <hi>Satis Magistraliter.</hi> Well, we will hold our selues, M. <hi>Eecknam,</hi> contented with <hi>S.

               <p>And because you make it so light a matter and so small a syn of our thoughtes, as of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prety synnes, and as it were not worthy the speaking of: yet our Maister Christ in the .15. of <hi>Mathew</hi> telleth vs otherwise, when he sayth: <hi>Nam ex corde exeunt cogitationes male, cedes, adulteria. &amp;c. i.</hi> For out of the hart procede euil thoughtes, murthers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteries. &amp;c. And then hee concludeth, <hi>Haec sunt que impurant hominem,</hi> These things defile a man. And you are not ignorant, that our Maister teacheth vs also, in the .5. of the same Euangelist, that whosoeuer beholdeth another mans wife, to lust after her, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready committed adulterye with her in hys hart. And <hi>S. Iohn</hi> following his Master like a good scoller, teacheth no lesse, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. thus: <hi>Omnis qui odit fratrem su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, homicida est,</hi> Whosoeuer hateth hys brother, is a murtherer. So is it euident by the sacred scriptures, that all sinnes, wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:19304:19"/>
exception, according to my doctrine, are mortall or deadly.</p>
               <p>Now M. <hi>Fecknam,</hi> let vs a litle while sée, what the Fathers also say to this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ciprian Serm. De Ieium.</hi> saith thus: <hi>Fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt et ante Christum, viri insignes &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There wer also before Christ worthy men, both Prophetes and Priestes, but yet conceiued and borne in syn. Neither wer they free from original nor from actuall syn. And there was found in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, either ignoraunce, or insufficiencie, in which they going astray haue sinned, and haue neded the mercy of God. By the which being taught and in structed, haue geuen thankes to God, and haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed them selues to haue lacked mutch of the full measure of righteousnes, &amp; trusting in God, haue not presumed to ascribe vnto them selues any soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie or righteousnes of their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lactantius</hi> also <hi>De vero cultu. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Ca.</hi> 13. saith: <hi>Nemo esse sine delicto potest. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man can be without syn, so long as he is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with the garment of the flesh. The weakenes whereof is three maner of waies brought in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and subiection of syn, to wyt: by deedes, by thoughtes, and by wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> likewise <hi>Episto. ad Algasiam</hi> saith thus: <hi>Affectus, et perturbationes. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may (so long as we dwell in the tabernacle, of this body, and are compassed about with frayle flesh) measurably rule our affections and passions but cut them of quite we cannot by any meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustin De ꝑfect. iust. lib.</hi> .saith: <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum est, si natura hominis bona est. et</hi>

               <p>It is to bee demaunded if the nature of man be
<pb facs="tcp:19304:20"/>
good, which none dare be so bold to deny, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicheus and Marcion. How then is it good, if it be not possible for it to be without euill? For that all syn is euyll, who doubteth? We aunswer, both that the nature of man is good. &amp;c. Sée the place.</p>
               <p>I wyl therefore conclude with <hi>Barnard</hi> &amp; <hi>Gregory</hi> thus, <hi>Bernard</hi> writing <hi>De donis spirit. sancti ca.</hi> 2. sayth: <hi>Vnde beatus Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius ait, Qui virtutes, sine humilitate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregat, est quasi, qui in ventu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puluerem por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Sicut enim puluis venti validi flatu, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergitur: Sic omne bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sine humilitate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis vento glorie rapitur. Multo etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> melius est peccatorem esse humilem, quam iustu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantem: Quod a domino euidenter osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, vt Publicanus &amp; Phariseus in exemplu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adducuntur. Sicut quidem sapiens ait: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior est in malis factis humilis confessio, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in bonis factis superba gloriatio.</hi> That is.</p>
               <p>Wherupon S. Gregory saith: He that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vertues together without humilitie, is as one that beareth dust into the wynde. For like as dust with a mighty blast of winde is scattered abroade: so euery good thing without humilitie is with the winde of vaine glory disperced a sunder. And also it is much better to be an humble sinner, then to be a righteous man and arrogant. Whych thyng is plainly set forth by the Lord, as the Publican and the Pharisey are brought in for example. As a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain wiseman saith: better is in wicked deedes an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble confession, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in good dedes a proud bosting</p>
               <p>But M. <hi>Fecknam,</hi> I meane not yet to let
<pb facs="tcp:19304:20"/>
this matter so passe, but let vs return again: You say that there is veniall syn, and deadly syn. And we say that all syn, in that it is sin, it is deadly, and yet we say againe, that there is not any one syn, but that the same is both deadly and veniall. Deadlye, if the offender repent not: veniall, if the same be vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented, and by mercy craued at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of God, in the blood of Christ. For the same God that said in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>Anima que pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerit, ipsa morietur,</hi> The soule that sinneth, shall dye, saith also in the same chap. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked man turneth away from his wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kednes that he hath done, and doth the thing which is equall and ryght, he shall saue hys soule alyue. Here you sée M. <hi>Fecknam,</hi> lyke as all syn, in that it is syn is deadly: so again all syn, in that it is vnfaynedlye repented. &amp;c. is also veniall. For although Christ sayth, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. Whosoeuer therefore shalbe asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of me &amp; my wordes, in this adulterous and sinfull generation, of hym also shall the sonne of man be ashamed: Yet our Maister Christ forgaue <hi>Peter</hi> that fact afterward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Exiuit et fleuit amare,</hi> he went out, and wept bitterly. Again on the other side, we ar not so blockish M. <hi>Fecknam,</hi> to teach y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery thought is syn, but euery euill thought that ryseth in the hart of man, and is not resisted,
<pb facs="tcp:19304:21"/>
but with delight followed, although it be not accomplished in act, the same is deadly, and damnable, if it be not repented, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. and 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. And hereto agréeeth also these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hieron. ad Demetriadem de virginit.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus: <hi>Distinguendum est autem, inter istas cogitationes, quibus voluntas fauet, &amp;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there must a difference be put betwene these thoughtes, which our will fauoreth, and with loue embraceth: And those cogitacions, which after the maner of a dark shadow are wont to passe ouer the mynde, and but euen onely in passing ouer to shew them selues, which the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is of bare or naked forme or shadowyng of anye thing, or at the least betwene those which come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mynde with a certaine detestation, strongly striueth and resisteth. For the losse of the which, as it sorroweth, so it doth reioyce that they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out. In those truly which shewe them selues softly to the mynde, and do declare them as it were fleing away, there is neither syn at all, nor yet bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. But in these with the whych for a space the soule striueth, against the which our wyl resisteth, there is an equal fight. For either we consent, and are ouercome, or els we withstand, and doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and in battell get the victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> also, <hi>Contra Pelag. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. saith: <hi>Quidam ergo filij huius seculi sunt. &amp;c</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some therefore are the children of this world, and yet are not the children of the deuil. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the deuill is the author and chiefe worker of all syns, yet all syns do not make men the children of the deuill. For the children of God do syn also, for
<pb facs="tcp:19304:21"/>
if they say they haue no synne, they deceyue them selues, and there is no truth in them. But by that meanes they syn, by the which they are as yet the children of this world. But in that respect that they are the children of God, they synne not at all. For euery one that is borne of God, synneth not. But vnbeliefe maketh the child of the deuil, which syn is called their own. As though it were alone, if it be not expressed what maner of syn it is.</p>
               <p>Thus you sée (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) our doctrine to agrée with the sacred scriptures, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Although it hath pleased you in thys your aunswer to lyken vs to certaine of the old hereticks, as to the <hi>Iouinians, Maniches, Valentinians,</hi> and to <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> and sutch other. But this is your common practise, to cry out Heretickes, heresies. &amp;c. whilest in the meane season you your selues, being the very Heretickes, and mayntainers of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, may the better escape. Much lyke vnto a false and subtile théefe, who being pursued for his theft, and running away, himself cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Stop théefe, that whilest the pursuers are looking for the théefe, (hymselfe being the very théefe) might thereby the rather escape awaye.</p>
               <p>So haue I now (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) aunswered your Obiections, and dout not, but hereby to haue sufficiently satisfied those, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght is not in contention, and whose stryfe is rather for the truth, then for vayne glory.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And know ye also, that in that ye cannot away wyth the name of the lyuing God, but accompt those wordes to be the token of an heretick, whosoeuer accustomably pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them, that hereby the plage which God threatned to the stifnecked and Idolatrous Iewes, is also come vpon you Papists, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by <hi>Ieremy.</hi> in the .44. cha. thus: <hi>Ecce ego iuraui in nomine meo magno ait domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. quia nequaquam vltra vocabitur nomen meum ex ore omnis viri Iudei, dicentis, viuit dominus deus. &amp;c. i.</hi> Behold I haue sworne by my great name, sayth the Lord, that my name shall not bée rehearsed through anye ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouth of Iuda, saying the Lord liueth.</p>

were infected with the heresie of frée wyll with you, if I should hold my peace and kepe silence, and which to deny you call heresie, in the first article of your aunswers, in theese wordes: <hi>So taught long before hym</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me) <hi>the Maniches, and the Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, denieng freewill, which is the original of that heresy.</hi> Thus you call wholesome and true doctrine heresie, &amp; heresie true doctrine: And therefore iustly fallen into the cursse of God by the Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> 5.

Wherfore hast thou hardened our harts, that we should not feare thée? <hi>Ieremy</hi> in his .10. chap. also sayth thus: I know O Lord, that it is not in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power to order his own waies, or to rule his own steps or goings. And Christ in <hi>Math.</hi> 16. to <hi>Peter</hi> saith thus: <hi>Caro et sanguis non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelauit tibi, sed pater meus qui in coelis est. i.</hi> Flesh and blood hath not reuealed thys vnto thée, but my father which is in heauen. Also <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. <hi>Nemo potest ad me venire, nisi pater qui misit me, traxerit eum. i.</hi> No man canne come vnto me, vnles my father which sent me, do draw him. And <hi>S. Paul. Ro.</hi> 7. <hi>Quod enim ago, non probo, non enim ꝙ volo, hoc facio, sed quod odi, hoc ago. i.</hi> I alow not that which I do, for what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I.

in you, both to wil and to do euen of good wil. The Scriptures (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) are full of these. But let vs sée what the Fathers saye hereto. And first <hi>Chrisostome.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Before sinne wee had free will to woorke well, but not after. For not by our owne power can we escape out of the handes of the Deuyl. But like as a shippe when the Sterne or Rother is broken, is brought euen whether soeuer the tempest dryueth her: So by the Deuill we are led, from one sinne to another. Neither all that whyle can we do any thing, but euen what the deuil will haue vs to do. And except that God with the mighty power of his mercy do delyuer vs, we shall remayne euen vnto death, in the chaynes of sinnes fast bound.</p>

                  <hi>Hieron. Cont. Pelag. lib. j. No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberi arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trij potestate, sed dei clementia co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seruamur</hi>

               <p>Not by the power of freewill but by the mercye of God are wee saued.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We alwayes pray in vayne, if it be in our owne freewill to do what we will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Idem super verbi Christi: Quos dedisti mihi. &amp;c. Non dixit, dedi eis liberi arbitrij potestate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vt ipsi se suo labore saluarent, sed ego custodiui eos, ego seruaui. &amp;c. Iohn.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>He sayth not, I haue geuen them power of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyll, that they by their owne laboure should saue them selues: But I haue kept them, I haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them. &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>August. sem. de verb. Aposto. Verum est magnas arbitrij liberi vires, homo accepit. &amp;c</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truth it is, man when he was created, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great power of freewill: But by sinnyng hee hath lost it agayne. He is fallen into death, hee is made weak, he was left among theeues halfe dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernard. de Natu. et gratia. cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Vt in peccatum iret, sufficit ei liberum arbitriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. etc</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he fell into sinne, freewill is sufficient for hym, wherwith he hath defyled himselfe. But that he may returne vnto ryghteousnes, he hath neede of a Phisition, because hee is not sound. Hee hath neede of a reuyuer vnto lyfe, because he is dead.</p>
               <p>I will ende with <hi>S. Augustine</hi> writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Pelagius lib.</hi> 3. who sayth: <hi>Per se ergo homo, lapsum facere potuit, quia voluit. Sed non sicut ꝑ se lapsus est, continuo lapsu ꝑ se, id est ꝑ propriam voluntatem consurgere va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit, nisi manu domini misericordissima qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do eius placuit pietati, fuisset erectus. i.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man therfore of hymselfe, could make his fall, because he would. But yet as he fell of hymselfe, so was he not able straight wayes of himselfe, that is, by hys proper will to ryse from fallyng, except by the most mercifull hande of the Lorde, when it pleased his heauenly goodnes he had raysed vp.</p>
               <p>Thus you sée your heresie of fréewill (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) most manifestlye ouerthrowne, and in déede you your selues found the very heretickes. And it is euident that this our doctrine is not reuiued from the old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the <hi>Maniches, Eunomius, Vigilantius,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19304:24"/>
and <hi>Iouinian,</hi> but grounded vpon the sacred word of God, according to the saying of <hi>Paul Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>Iam igitur non estis hospites. etc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore your are not straungers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryners, but Citizens wyth the Sayntes, and of the housholde of God, &amp; are buylt vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apostels and Prophetes, Iesus Christ hymselfe beyng the head corner stone, in whom what soeuer buyldyng is coupled together, it groweth vnto an holy Temple in the Lord.</p>
               <p>I haue also in this mine Apologie and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, confirmed my doctrine by the fathers, not that we build our faith on them, but so far credit them, as they shall agrée with the sacred scriptures. For experience teacheth vs, that in many pointes, &amp; many times we shal find <hi>Hierom</hi> against <hi>Hierom, Ambrose</hi> against <hi>Ambrose, Augustine</hi> against <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> &amp;c. and therefore no farther to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, then they with <hi>Paul</hi> follow Christ.</p>
               <p>Now M. <hi>Fecknam,</hi> let vs consider, who herein is to be beleued, you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sayth, the lawe is possible to be kept, or <hi>S. Peter</hi> that sayth, that neither the forefathers nor we, could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kepe it: You that say, that Saints are to be prayed to, or the Saintes or Angels that vtterly refuse the same: You that say, that faith doth not onely iustifie, or <hi>S. Paul</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> saith, that fayth without the woorkes of the law doth iustifie: You that say, that euery synne (which is equiuolent) is not mortall, or God
<pb facs="tcp:19304:25"/>
that saith, the soule that sinneth, shall die.</p>
               <p>You are fowlye disceiued (M. <hi>Fecknam</hi>) if you think that euery word that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from you is an Oracle. Nay not so, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, to try the spirites, whether they be of God or no. We haue brought your doctrin to the toutch stone of Gods sacred word, and it is found copper, and not gold. And as it is commonly sayd, all is not gold that shineth: no more is all doctrine true that commeth from men, but that onely, which being tout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, with the toutchstone of Gods woord, is sound and perfect. Cease therfore to bleare the eyes of the simple and vnlearned, wyth your gylted glistering copper, and geue place to the truth. Seeke rather Iesus Christ, and the profit of his church, then your owne esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Prefer the kyngdome of heauen, before your vayne glorie and prayse of foolish men. Sell not your birthright for a messe of pottage.</p>
               <p>God in his mercies geue you hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble harts, not disdayning to learne, and open your eyes to sée his truth, and to yeld to the same: That you may vnfaynedly séeke Iesus Christ, hys onely glory, and the profit of his Church.</p>
