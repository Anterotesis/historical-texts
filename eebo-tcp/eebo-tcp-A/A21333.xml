         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſuch a Church of ſo many Soules,

Paule, at Rome, at Corinth &amp;c. Then
coſtly buyldings be they neuer ſo ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
done amongſt the Papiſtes and
Iewes, which prefer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Stony Temple
of God before the liuing Temple of god
which be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies of men. And the ſame
being vndecked both within &amp; without,
yet ceaſe not with great coſt and charge
with the Iewes, dayly to buylde theyr
ſtony Temples with Stone, Tymber,
Belles, Veſtments, Muſicke, with a
huge nomber of Torches and Candels,
burnt in the day light, when the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and light is neither profitable to
God nor man. Alſo ſettinge vp deade
Images, &amp; puttinge on them Gownes
and coates, which neither do féele colde
nor heate: Alſo furniſhing them with
many coſtly Iewels: And the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of God, and liuing Images of God,
which are the bodies of men vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
of thinges to ſerue neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8624:5"/>
Theſe be the ſignes and Images which
<hi>D. Oſorius</hi> of Portingale, in his booke
entituled the <hi>Pearle for a Prince,</hi> the
leafe .43. doth affirme nothinge to be
more better to quicken our memorie,
to thinke one God, and to remember
his benefites. But the holy Ghoſt in
the fourth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi>
affirmith, them to mar and corrupt vs.
And the actions of the Papiſtes in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the dead and counterfait Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to Candels and Coates, and to the
higher place: And the true and liuing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of God which are the bodies of
men being vnfurniſhed of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
&amp; apopinted to the lower place,
proueth the holy Ghoſt to ſpeake trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
And <hi>Oſorius</hi> of portingale with all
his learning and eloquence, to affirme
an vntrueth. Alſo their Stony Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is furniſhed with a nomber of Idle
perſons, which do pray after the maner
of the heathen, which thinke to be hard
for their many words &amp; much babeling,
the which thing Chriſt our Sauioure
forbiddeth in the .vj. Chapiter of the
Goſpell of S. Mathew that Chriſtians
<pb facs="tcp:8624:5"/>
ſhould belike vnto them, for that our
heauenly Father knoweth what things
we haue néede of before we aſke of him.</p>
            <p>Which perſons alſo prefer Sodome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye
and Whordome before honorable
Mariage. For honorable Mariage is
vtterly expelled out of their Cloyſters.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſte by S. Paule ſaithe,
<hi>It is better to marry then to burne:</hi> But the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Papiſtes do ſhewe them to
be of an other minde, for their actions
affirme it to be better to burne then to
be maried. And the actions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſts,
Friers, Monkes, &amp; Nunnes, &amp;c. Do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
not onely burning in luſt, but alſo
fornication better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mariage, for none
may remaine in their cloyſters that be
maried: But they may remaine ſtill in
their cloiſters that haue committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,

hauing had the popes abſolution, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <hi>Si non caſtè tamen cautè.</hi> Thus you do
ſée, though <hi>Oſorius</hi> hath holyneſſe in his

and Hipocriſie in the Papiſtes actions,
But be not deceaued with their wordes
but loke to their actions. <hi>Oſorius</hi> ſaieth
<pb facs="tcp:8624:6"/>
in his accuſations .41. leafe. <hi>For we
will ruſhe into thoſe houſes in which holie virgins
being encloſed day and night, do ſinge Himmes
to the glorie of God and praye to Chriſte for the
good eſtate of Kinges and Princes and for ſauegard
of the whole Communaltie. &amp;c.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe
is: Faire woorkes make fooles
faine or glad. But be not deceaued with
wordes, but conſider and marke their
actions, and you ſhall ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King Henrie
of Fraunce, vpon whom the mightye
God ſhewed a wonderfull Iudgement,
after he had threatned y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his eies ſhould

of his nobilitye, burned, whiche
denyed Antichriſte the Pope: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he coulde ſe it, his owne eies in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
when he thought himſelfe moſte
ſafe were firſte thruſte out. And the
ſame King Henry of Fraunce bearing
aſmuch good wil to Abbeys &amp; Cloyſters
as <hi>Oſorius</hi> of Portingale: yet he found
ſome ſo filthie and vnſufferable, that
for rauiſhing of women and after mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of them, the Cloyſter with the
Freeres were bothe burned together.
And if the eies of men were as cleare
<pb facs="tcp:8624:6"/>
to beholde all thinges, as the eyes of
the mighty god, many ſuch Cloyſters,
Nunneries and Sels, might be founde
amonge the Papiſtes of like goodnes.
wherfore be not deceaued with <hi>Oſorius</hi>
wordes, but looke to their Actions.</p>
            <p>S. Paule ſpeaking by the holy Ghoſie,
forbad none, yonge nor olde, to liue in
ſingle and chaſte life, but praiſed &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the ſame to all eſtates and all
ages, one and other, without exception:
But he expreſly commaundeth that the
Churche ſhould receaue no widowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
three ſcore yeares: But <hi>Oſorius</hi>
with the Papiſtes would be wiſer then
the holy ghoſte ſpeaking in S. Paule:
but theire actions on the contrarye ſhall
proue them fooles. Againe how muche
thoſe Cloiſters &amp; Sels are to be feared
to liue one with another as the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
the eaſineſſe and idlenes of their

of Almighty God. Euen as the
Iewes did, which toke them ſelues to be
the Churche of God and were ſo taken
in the time of Eſay the Prophet. For in
his .29. Chapiter, after he had threatned
that their Aulter ſhould be brought into

theſe words <hi>Therfore the Lord ſaid becauſe this
<pb facs="tcp:8624:7"/>
people come nere vnto me with their mouth, and
honour me with their lippes, but haue remoued
their hartes far from me, &amp; their feare toward me
was taught by the precept of men: Therfore behold

            </p>
            <p>The ſame churche of God, ſo taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Iewes in the time of chriſte
our Sauiour, fell away alſo by the ſame
meanes, as appeareth in the .15. chapter
of S. Mathews Goſpell. Euen as the
Papiſtes alſo this day be fallen away, in
vayne ſeruinge God, and teachinge for
Doctrines, mens precepts. And as the
Scribes and Phariſies demaunded of
Chriſte our ſauiour, <hi>Why doo thy Diſciples
tranſgreſſe the traditions of the elders?</hi> Euen in
like maner doo the Papiſts with <hi>Oſorius</hi>
demaunde of the Proteſtants, <hi>Why do ye
trangreſſe the traditions of the elders?</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as Chriſt our ſauiour anſwered the
Scribes and Pharaſies, with this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<hi>Why doo ye breake the commaundements
of God for your traditions?</hi> Euen in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
doo the Proteſtants anſwere the
Papiſtes, with <hi>Oſorius</hi> with the very
<pb facs="tcp:8624:8"/>
ſame queſtion, Why doo ye breake the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God for your owne
traditions, erecting Cloyſters, Nunries
Friers, &amp; Mounkes, with ſuche a huge
monſtrous nomber of traditions, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and other mens inuentions, &amp;
obſeruations, that if they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,

of all, to breake one of thoſe, you
make greater conſcience then to breake
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of almightie God.
And theſe be the churches, Nunries, &amp;
Cloyſters, &amp; Cels, for the whiche <hi>Oſorius</hi>
of Portingale, hath publiſhed many fair
names, Elegantly and Rhetorically, as
one whiche by the arte of wordes, can
make a Flie, ſéeme to be greater then
an Elephante, and copper to be better
then Golde or God. And after he hath
made greate boaſt of them, he requireth
with all to know what is ſet vp in place
of them:<note place="margin">The ſtonie Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple with the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the highe Preiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſies, put downe by Chriſt Ieſus our ſauiour at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> As if he might ſay now with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Temple at Ieruſalem, and put away
the traditions of the churche of God:
<pb facs="tcp:8624:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what hath he ſet vp now in the place
thereof. For it is not reaſon ſayeth
<hi>Oſorius</hi> that he ſhould bewayle that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the place of that is pulled downe: Reade
the Goſpel of Chriſte Ieſus (<hi>Oſorius</hi>) and

<pb facs="tcp:8624:10"/>
but a marke to know Heretikes whiche
will not receiue the Popes ceremonies.
Agayne, the worde of God in the .20. cha.
of Eſay the prophet, <hi>Threatneth Plagues vpon
them that come neare vnto God with their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
and honour him with their lippes, when their
hartes are farre from God:</hi> Now compare the
Proteſtantes with their Churches, and
the Papiſtes with their Nunneries and
Cloyſters together. The Proteſtants
pray in theyr mother tongue, or in ſuch
a tongue as they vnderſtande, but the
moſt parte of the Papiſtes, pray in ſuch
a tongue as they vnderſtand not: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
therefore vpon which of theſe two
the plague is moſt like to fall, whether
vpon the Proteſtantes or Papiſtes.</p>
            <p>Yea further conſider vpon whom the
plague is fallen. For the Papiſts affirm
that ſayinge ouer the Lordes praier in
Latin fiue times ouer, although the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
vnderſtand not a worde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet he pleaſeth God. But the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſte
Ieſus, affirme that ſaying ouer the ſame
Lordes prayer once, or els many times
ouer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out vnderſtanding profiteth not.
<pb facs="tcp:8624:11"/>
yea to ſay it once either els many times
ouer without obedience profiteth not.
The huge nomber of Papiſts ſay, <hi>Et de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
nobis debita noſtra ſicut &amp; nos &amp;c.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe
they vnderſtand it not, they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot obey it: and therfore deſier y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Plagues of God to fal vpon their ſinnes
which is come to paſſe, for you ſhall ſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Papiſts, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is againſt
nature. The father preſent the ſonne to
death,<note place="margin">Beholde how the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſts Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do teach and inſtruct them.</note> and the ſonne the father, as one
Stowe preſented his owne Father in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
time of Quéene Mary to be burned. Alſo
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother put the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to death, as <hi>Herene</hi>
the Empreſſe who with the Images,
called lay mens bookes was enſtructed
to put downe her owne ſonne Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
the ſixt being Emperour and thruſt
out his eyes of the which he died: For
that he caſt downe men made of wood,
which ſhe eſtemed more then her owne
ſonne, yea her owne fleſh and bloud, and
the liuing Image of God. She toke vp
alſo the bones of her huſband Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
the fift, and burned them. And at
the ſame time ſhe thruſt out her ſonnes
eyes, as <hi>Etropias</hi> writeth. The Sunne
did not geue light in .17. dayes, ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:8624:11"/>
Mariners with their ſhippes loſte theyr
wayes in the Seas. The want of which
light, the people affirmed to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the'mperours eyes were put out.
Alſo the brother ſtaying the brother, as
<hi>Alphonſus Diazius</hi> a Spaniard, whiche
cam from Rome into Germanie to ſlea
his owne brother, &amp; there ſlue him, not
for that he diſobeyed the worde of God,
but for that he denied &amp; diſobeyed mens
Traditions, the Popes ceremonies.</p>
            <p>And thus the papyſtes obtayne their
prayer euen as the children of Iſrael lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in the wylderneſſe obtayned theyr
prayer, bothe water out of the Rocke,
Manna from Heauen, and Fleſh and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
fowles as the ſande of the ſea.</p>
            <p>But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meate was yet in their mouthes
when the wrath of God came vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The Deuels obtayned their prayers to
go into the Heard of Swine. The deuel
obtayned his praier to trie Iob. And
thus the prayer of Papiſtes ſpeakynge
the worde of God, the ſame worde doth
not returne voyde, for their praier is
tourned into ſinne. But this (ſay the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes)
is but the ſayinge of Heretikes,
<pb facs="tcp:8624:12"/>
which will not receaue the Popes cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Traditions. Here agayne
in the ſame chapter &amp; in the ſame place,
Eſay the prophet threateneth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Churche of God amongſt the
Iewes, taught the feare of God with the
precepts of men, Almightie God would
take away the wiſdome of their wyſe
men, &amp; the vnderſtanding of their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
men ſhould be hid. Conſider what
a numbre of ceremonies the churche of
Rome hath put forth to teache the feare
of God, whiche <hi>Oſorius</hi> mainteineth in
the booke called <hi>A Pearle for a Prince.</hi>
and ſe notwithſtandinge, the learning &amp;
eloquence of <hi>Oſorius</hi> and the Papiſtes,
whether this plague is not threatned to
be fulfilled on the Papiſtes, as it was
threatned to be fulfilled on the Iewes.
And ſe, and conſider againe, whether the
ſame was not fulfilled vpon the churche
of God at Ieruſalem, and whether the
ſame be not alſo fulfilling daily on the
Papiſtes, by the great fal the Church of
Rome hath had in this laſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres
and more. Conſider further whether
their wiſdome be not taken from them
<pb facs="tcp:8624:12"/>
that would geue Gownes and Coates,<note place="margin">How the Papiſts be taught and inſtructed With their Images</note>

further, whether their wiſdome be not
taken from them, that amongſt them do
light ſo many thouſand of Torches, and
Candels in the broade day light, when
neither God nor man hath any néede of
them. And conſider agayne, what S.

of <hi>Oſorius</hi> and the papiſts, who haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the glory of the incorruptible God,
to the ſimilitude of the Image of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
man, making him like an olde
man, with a graye bearde, and a body
with three heads. The holy ghoſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
in S. Paule, affyrmeth that they
that did thus, wrought many thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>And here ſomwhat more to ſpeake of

            <p>If the Pope, Cardinalles, Biſhops,

for feare the gayne and Glorie they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
of the Princes and people, by
their newe Religion, and newe and

to the Pope, Cardinals &amp;c. this place
of Scripture written in the .12. Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Goſpel of S. Iohn. 43. vearſe
<pb facs="tcp:8624:13"/>
               <hi>For they loue the praiſe of men more,

Cardinalles, Prieſtes. &amp;c. woulde ſuffer
ſuche Churches to be builte amongeſt
them, they would alſo ceaſe to geue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to thoſe theyr papiſtes, whiche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the Proteſtantes and breake
it. Which ſweare to the proteſtantes,
and forſweare themſelues. Yea they
would ceaſe to geue pardon to thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes,
which poyſon the proteſtantes,

Popes newe Religion and newe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
wherfore I may ſay vnto the
Pope, Cardinalles &amp;c. out of the olde
religion the worde of God, and the
wordes be written in the firſt Chapiter
of the Prophet Eſay. 21. vearſe. <hi>Howe is

what they receaue from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes
deare children to further this wicked
Rebellion againſt their moſte gracious
Prince, who neuer toke the bloode of
any one of their fingers. This marke
ſpectacle, or glaſſe, being well marked,
loked in, and conſidered, may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
matter to put away all the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
doctrin of papiſtry. That Rome
was a faithful Citie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the wordes
of S. Paule written in the firſt Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Romaines, the which Epiſtle

            <p>And will you Papiſtes ſay they did not

before the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
which is right, for the

to their own naturall Prince.
The which doctrine hath cauſed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
to plucke their owne naturall

Fraunce &amp;c. The like wherof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſene to be don amongſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

the ſame is manifeſt and apparent.</p>
            <p>That he is reueyled to many mightie

which is to promiſſe, to breake promiſſe
To ſwearyng and to forſwearyng: To
