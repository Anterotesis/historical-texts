            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GEORGE, Laſt ſecond day was a week, I being required by the LORD to be at <hi>Devonſhire-houſe,</hi> I acquainted the Mens-Meeting that I had ſomething to lay before them, which was, That about a year and a half ago the LORD required mee to deliver a Meſſage to them, which then <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>George</hi> being then preſent.</note> you owned to be the WORD of the LORD, which I was now to repeat again, <hi>Viz.</hi> THAT I WAS TO PROCLAIM THE DAY OF THE LORD, WHICH IS COME TO GATHER THE OUT-CASTS, AND TO CLENSE THE CAMP OF EVIL-DOERS. Which WORD I did and do believe muſt be fulfilled: In order unto which I told them, I had ſomething to lay before them, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome years ago I heard of a Difference betwixt my Father <hi>Bond,</hi> and (one of your Miniſters) <hi>John Rous,</hi> and his Father, who before he went laſt to <hi>Barbadoes (Thomas Yoakly</hi> being preſent) deſired mee that I would have a hearing of the Buſineſs, not without great reflections there given againſt my Father <hi>Bond;</hi> which if true, I being ſo related to him, having lately mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Daughter, I looked upon it not convenient for mee to appear againſt him: and if on the contrary he was clear, and the other blame-worthy, if I ſhould ſo judge, I did believe it might be thought by ſome, that it was through partialneſs I ſo judged; ſo that I forbore to have a hearing of both Parties together, till about two weeks ago <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>J.O. S.N. T.Y.</hi> and <hi>T. P.</hi> had had ſeveral meetings to hear the ſaid Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but never made a final Agreement, neither indeed is it poſſible they ſhould ever make a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one, ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> firſt they cauſe him that ſtole (at leaſt) to reſtore, for I am ſure that Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs requires no leſs.</note>
               <hi>John Oſgood</hi> (and the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> my Father <hi>Bond, Samuel Newton, John Rous, Thomas Yoakly,</hi> and I think <hi>Thomas Padle</hi>) being upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> told mee they were going about that buſineſs. I told him, that ſeeing <hi>Thomas Rous</hi> had deſired mee to have a hearing of that Buſineſs, a willingneſs was in mee to be there; where accordingly I was, but did not in the leaſt meddle in it; only I obſerved by what I heard diſcourſed, that my Father <hi>Bond</hi> was clear of thoſe Calumnies which both <hi>John</hi> and his Father <hi>Thomas Rous</hi> had caſt upon him; and that on the contrary, the ſaid <hi>John Rous</hi> was not only guilty of Calumnious Reproaches againſt my Father <hi>Bond,</hi> but alſo had ſtolen a <note n="*" place="margin">VVhich Paper was an Obligation to my Father <hi>Bond</hi> from the ſaid <hi>John Rous,</hi> to make good a ſum of money which his Father <hi>Tho. Rous,</hi> who had given him (as he then ſaid) power and authority to make an end, and to ſatisfie what was due to my Father <hi>Bond</hi> upon account, which ſaid Account <hi>J. Rous</hi> (after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months time had few peruſal) owned &amp; ſubſcribed with his hand, though at this meeting when my Father produced it, and asked him if he would deny his own hand? He ſaid, he would not ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would owne it or no.</note> Paper of Concern from <hi>Thomas Hart,</hi> which was left in his cuſtody by my Father <hi>Bond,</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which <hi>John Oſgood</hi> did move at that Meeting, that the buſineſs of his ſtealing that Paper might be ſpoken to; but <hi>Thomas Yoakly</hi> being in haſte, the Meeting broke up) ſo that it was with mee to acquaint them with the ſaid Difference, and to deſire they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome of their Number to have a hearing on't: but it was a long time before I could get any Anſwer from them, they telling mee <hi>that I was out of Truth, and that they were not concerned to give me any Anſwer;</hi> and very much to this purpoſe they ſpoke. I told them, it was the weighty matters of the Law that I came about, <hi>viz.</hi> JUDGEMENT and JUSTICE; and whatever they reputed mee, it concerned them to do Juſtice. But ſeeing they would give mee no Anſwer (I think it was in ſome hours after I had been there) but much reflected upon mee, <hi>and that I ſhould buſie my ſelf with that I was not concerned.</hi> I told them I was deeply concern'd; firſt, for the clearing of my Father <hi>Bond</hi> from thoſe Aſperſions caſt upon him by (one of their Miniſters) viz. <hi>John Rous,</hi> whom I did there before them accuſe of Theft, and therefore I ſaid it concerned them to appoint a Meeting about it: But inſtead of giving mee any Anſwer, ſeveral of them bid mee go out of the Room: And as I ſtood up to ſpeak, one of them took my Seat, who I think would have given it mee again, had not one (I think 'twas <note n="†" place="margin">One of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note>
               <hi>Gilbert Laty)</hi> bid him he ſhould not; Others of them puſh'd mee with their hands, bidding mee <hi>Go out:</hi> I told them, if they uſed violence I ſhould not reſiſt; all that I deſired was but an Anſwer, which if they would give mee, I told them I would willingly depart, (having alſo laid before them a buſineſs concerning the Widow <hi>Evans</hi> (her Husband being lately dead) whom I looked upon was <note n="*" place="margin">Yea I ſaid, both in Law and Equity, which I would be bound (and ſtill am willing) to make it good.</note> wronged) But ſeeing in all this while I could get no Anſwer whether they would hear it or no, I directed my ſpeech particularly to <hi>John Bolton,</hi> to whom I ſaid, That if theſe their doings were ſpoken of to people abroad, they could hardly be credited. Then he replyed, <hi>That if my Father</hi> Bond <hi>was agrieved, and made his complaint to them, and deſired them to have a hearing of it, they would appoint ſome accordingly.</hi> I told him I ſhould reſt ſatisfied with that Anſwer at preſent. Now what Anſwer ſhall I have to the Widow<note n="†" place="margin">She lives at the Barbadoes.</note>
               <hi>Evans</hi> buſineſs? As to that they ſaid, <hi>That unleſs ſhee writ to mee to appear in it for her, they would not meddle in it.</hi> Theſe being their Anſwers, I departed.</p>
            <p>Now, underſtanding that thy ſelf, <note n="*" place="margin">He Married one of <hi>George</hi> his wives daughters, formerly called <hi>Margaret Fell</hi>

               <hi>John Rous,</hi> with ſeveral others, are intended ſhortly to take Ship for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture probably may be before my Father <hi>Bond</hi> can (if hee would) make any ſuch Complaint to the ſaid Meeting, or to have any juſt end put to the ſaid Difference, it being a Buſineſs that will require ſome time; It is with mee alſo to acquaint thee with it, to ſee if it be in any of your hearts to do what is juſt and right in this matter, without reſpect of perſons: For the LORD, whom I ſerve, owns none to be his People but they that ſhall ſo do. Thy Anſwer hereunto I expect, it being with mee firſt to lay it before you, that that which is juſt and right may be done; which if ſo, I am ſatisfied: but if you refuſe ſo, as not to do the thing that is juſt and right, I know not but it will be required of mee to make this Buſineſs much more publick.</p>

               <p>The next day, after I had been at the aboveſaid Meeting, it was with mee to look into the Bible, where I read theſe following words, (which being ſutable to the preſent occaſion, I am willing ſhould be inſerted)</p>

                  <q>

But they refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears, that they ſhould not hear. Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the Law, and the Words which the LORD of Hoſts had ſent by his Spirit in the former Prophets: therefore came a great Wrath from the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts.</hi>

               <p>And having received no Anſwer from the aboveſaid <hi>George Fox,</hi> it was with mee to go again to <hi>Devonſhire-houſe</hi> (this being their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Day <note n="†" place="margin">The 7th inſtant.</note>) with intention to have ſpoke about the ſaid Buſineſs: But they refuſed to let mee in (for it ſeems <hi>George</hi>

So that not having admittance, it is with mee thus to publiſh it; the day being come, that as they have laid open the Deceit, Wickedneſs, and Hypocriſie of other Profeſſors that went before them, ſo muſt their Deceit, Wickedneſs, and Hypocriſie be alſo laid open: for the LORD whom I ſerve is no reſpecter of perſons.</p>
