         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
Sir JOHN SHORTER, Lord Mayor.</head>
            <p>I Present to your Lordship the second Sermon, and the Bookseller is accountable
for the late Publication of it.</p>
            <p>By the first Sermon, I endeavoured a real Subjection of Hearts to Christ as King:
In this I call Men to the utmost serviceableness to him, as the governing Aim of their
Lives. No Service to Christ is possible, but with respect to his Interests; and
by our devotedness to these, he determineth our Regards to himself.</p>
            <p>If we consider that part of the World called Christian, we shall find that nothing is
more pretended than the advancement of these Interests of Christ, even when they are
most disserved. These are made to patronize the great Weaknesses of some, and the
grossest Villanies of others. This induced me to explain and state the Interests of
Christ, as far as one Discourse would admit.</p>
            <p>Natural Religion is not so opposed, as the additional and more peculiar Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Christ as Mediatour: The innate Enmity of Mens Hearts and Satans At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
are more directly level'd against these; the former, because they are less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
by those Remains of Light preserved by God in our Apostate Nature; the
latter, because the Devil well knows, that natural Religion will not be improved to
any saving Purpose, if these additional Interests of Christ prevail not. This Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
led me to insist on these Mediatoral Concernments of our Lord Jesus, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
to a more special regard to such Points, which Christ is gradually advancing
in the World in our Day; and the rather, because the Testimony of Christ and the
mighty Influences of the Spirit in any day, are much confined to those Points, which
at that time he designs the Advancement of.</p>
            <p>I am express and large, in proving that the Dedication of our Lives to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Interests of Christ, is an essential Duty of all Christians; because it is the
great Security to our holy Profession; it's the Spring of all Endeavours whereby God
is glorified, and a common Good promoted; and without it, Truth will be betrayed
by Men that make the greatest Noise.</p>
            <p>The Hints I am confined to, may be subject to various Inferences; to direct which,
I do declare, that in general I do intend the persuading Christians to do all that is
<hi>lawful</hi> in their Places, to promote true Religion and Godliness, and their cautious
Forbearance of whatever is a certain detriment or hazard thereto.</p>
            <p>In particular, I would have none in this Crisis (if duly called) scruple Offices
from uncertain Events; much less employ them to lower Ends than the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Truth, and that with all Prudence and Meekness.</p>
            <p>I would persuade all Nonconforming Ministers not to neglect the present Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of exercising their Ministry; their Obligation and License to it, is from Christs
prior Commission, and not the present removal of a Physical Obstacle; and woe to
us if the undoubted Interests of Christ gain not by this Liberty. I think I have more
comfort than seeming Caution <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Idleness would afford, when I reflect that from the
<hi>20th</hi> Year of my Age, I remember not three Lords Days wherein I have not
preached in one place or other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99052:3"/>
A Subsistence to these Ministers I also aim at. How sad is that narrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Spirit in Men of Estates, which restrains the Gospel for want of Maintainance?
I am sure none that know me will suspect a Selfish Design by this.</p>
            <p>The only thing I can foresee the need of an Apology for, is my plainness with some
Persecutors that are Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and lately monopolized
the Name even from all others of their own Communion. These I call to Repentance
for their great Opposition to the Interests of Christ. Some part of the two Days allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to prepare this Sermon, was spent in debating with my self the expediency hereof;
and I judged at last, it was my Duty, and conducive to the publick Good, on such
Grounds as these.</p>
            <p>The Crime is too notorious to be palliated, when they have Silenced 2000 Ministers,
because they durst not lye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with such rage persecuted their quiet Neighbors for
worshiping God according to all the instituted Rules of the Gospel, their Enemies being
Iudges.</p>
            <p>The Effects of their Severities are visible in the Danger, that not only the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but the very probable Form of Religion is reduced to.</p>
            <p>The Repentance of these very Men, is necessary to divert the Judgments which
hang over our heads. That Temper continued, makes all healing Methods for accord
impossible. If they repent not, it's of little moment if they be irritated by a Call to
it; being disowned by all serious Men of their own Party, who indeed were hated
and wounded by them as well as the Dissenters.</p>
            <p>Yea, God by his present Providence seemeth to design these Mens Repentance, while
he is blowing on them from that very Point, where their Faces and Regards were
directed in all their mischievous Attempts.</p>
            <p>I hope no pious Men of that Party, who approved not these Mens Practices, will think
themselves concerned in this Reproof; their Credit and Serviceableness I am tender of. Yea,
I would persuade a Forgiving of the most Guilty, tho I call them to Repentance: And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
directs the Sufferers not to exert their Resentments, by the Damage it will expose to.</p>
            <p>I find it convenient to explain somewhat in my first Sermon.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Conditions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 18.</note> I mean the things which the Gospel injoyneth indispensably on all Men,
that shall partake of the saving Blessings of the New Covenant, which are owing to Christ only
as the meritorious Cause.<note place="margin">p. 22.</note> By <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> I intend that inherent vital Principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all Graces are comprehended.<note place="margin">p. 8.</note> By <hi>Remedial Law,</hi> I mean the Law of Faith, published
for the recovery of Apostate Sinners; and by which God will judge the Secrets of Men.</p>
            <p>But yet the Objectors are very weak or uncharitable, and little consider what fatal Influence
their Distempers have on the Interests of Christ, whilst they sacrifice the Serviceableness
of others to their own little Aims and Fancies.</p>
            <p>It may be added, that I managed my first Text without much reference to the <hi>extraordinary</hi>
Power of Apostolical Administrations; as not so suitable to our Day, nor yet principally intended.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship is concerned, or I would not Preface your Name to th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

it's your aim to serve Christ in the World. Many of your Actings may convince the Envious,

SERMON
Preached before the
RIGHT HONOURABLE
Sir JOHN SHORTER, Kt. &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PHILIPPIANS Chap. I. ver. 21.</bibl>
               <q>For to me to live is Christ.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apostle was in a happy Strait, from
his Fitness to live, and Readiness to dye.
He knew not well how to fix his Choice,
because both Life and Death had a desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Tendency. There was Service to Christ by his
Life, and great Happiness to himself by Death.</p>
            <p>Affection to Christ swayed his Inclinations both
ways; he loved Christ, and therefore must desire death,
that he might fully enjoy him; he loved Christ, and
so might incline to a longer life, that he might more
advance his Interest. Rational Self-love would move
to the Former, yet Regard to Jesus and his Members
overswayes him to the Latter. He is content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99052:4"/>
the Crown, rather than quit his Work: And
tho Heaven was the better State in it self, and happier
for him; he prefers his stay on Earth, as better for
the Church, which could not bear his Absence. A
wonderful Instance of a Publick Spirit! how enlarged
is this Soul, that was assured of Glory in Heaven,
and of very sore Tryals on Earth, and would yet tug
longer at the Oar for Publick Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather than be
at Rest!</p>
            <p>The great Purposes he resolved to live to, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
from his Contentment with the Delays of Glory.
Had sensual Enjoyments, and trivial Employs been
the Advantage proposed by a longer Life, how impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
must he have endured a Moments Absence
from Heaven? He that knew Death could not lay his
Soul asleep, but that it immediately passed into a State
of the highest Activity, and Receptiveness; yea, and
would be admitted to a near Converse with Christ, and
other glorious Objects, which must fully employ these
active Powers of the Soul, and fill it with Good to
the utmost of its Capacity to receive: Could he (I
say) desire an Abode on Earth, to relish carnal or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Delights,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note> which with him is <hi>a being dead while one
liveth?</hi> By no means.</p>
            <p>But my Text represents to us the Design and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Life. <hi>To me to live is
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there are many things to be inferred from
the Words, besides what I think is their principal Scope.
As, 1. Christ is a Believers Happiness, while he liveth.
<hi>q. d.</hi> Life were worse than Death, were not Christ
known,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> and enjoyed by me in this Life. 2. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's
Life is a meer dependance on, and a manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Power and Grace of Christ. Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99052:4"/>
of his Power supports it, and his Grace is display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our Lives, when useful to any valuable purposes,
or employed in any momentous Actions. But I pass
by these to the Chief Design of the Text, which may
be expressed under two Heads.</p>
            <p>1. An entire dedication of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Life to Christ,
exclusively of any Carnal Designs of his own.</p>
            <p>As if he should have said, I devote my Life to the
Glory of Christ, I propose the Advancement of his
Interests; my Design is to be Instrumental in his
Work, and the propagation of his Concernments:
There is no base selfish Turn of my own intended, nor
shall my life waste in idle Uselesness. I will be active,
and that for him, to the last Moment, and the utmost
of my Abilities. This my Judgment dictates as my
Duty, to this I am devoted, and on this only I am
intent.</p>
            <p>II. A perswasion that Christ had been, and still
would be advanced by his Life and Labours. This he
expresseth in <hi>v. 20. As my expectation and hope, that
Christ shall be magnified in my Body, whether by Life, or
by Death. q. d.</hi> I have by his Grace promoted his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
I fear not but the same Aids and Blessing will
still concur to the like serviceableness; and so the
Issue of my living will be his Gain. This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in <hi>v.</hi> 22. It's no secular Interest of my own is
like to be advanced: The building of my House, or
erecting Trophies to my Name I expect not. Nay, I
am sure, Poverty, Contempt, and Hardships in those
respects will attend me; but Christ in his Gospel-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
will be contributed to, and he will over-rule

The Text may also include an Hint at the Reason
of this Confidence, as to this decribed Success; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
introduced under such a respect: <hi>For to me to live
is Christ.</hi> Sincere devotedness to Christ, is ordinarily
successful; and upright Designs duly managed, prove
not Abortive. When the best Endowments of a man
indisposed to the service of Christ, produce not equal
Fruits to the lower Gifts of a Soul engaged for his
concerns.</p>
            <p>The first of these will be the Subject of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
<hi>viz.</hi> The Dedication of the Life to Christ.
This was no Duty peculiar to the Apostolical Office;
and tho it's predicated of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his own Person;
yet he affords us an Example which binds our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yea it is the fundamental Duty resulting from
our Baptismal Vow, included in all our Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and supposed in all acceptable Service. So that
the Obligation is universal; it's the Duty of all here,
even of such who least regard it, yea live in greatest
repugnancy to it.</p>
            <p>By living to Christ must be meant, living to the
promoting, and defence of the Interests of Christ in
this World. This his designed Endeavour had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to, and to this he devoteth his <hi>Life:</hi> That is,
all the opportunities for acting which Life includes,
all the Abilities which Life imports, and all the good
things he possessed, which are comprehended in the
word <hi>Life,</hi> as being less valuable than life is: Even
all these he designed to lay out for the Interests of the
Blessed Jesus. He valued living for no meaner uses,
and determined to live to no lower purpose.</p>
            <p>When the advancement of Christ's Interests govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Time and Abilities, then to live is Christ.
For herein is our living to him within our reach; by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99052:5"/>
this it is expressed, and the evidencing thereof in this
instance, is what he hath appointed, and still expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
from all his Members and Servants.</p>
            <p>I need say no more to introduce the Doctrine I
purpose to insist on: which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> It is the duty of all Christians to dedicate and
employ their lives to the advancement of the Interests of
Christ in the World.</p>
            <p>It's not sufficient to be religious in Contemplation,
or mental Acts; our Lord expecteth, and real Piety en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
to a vigorous activity in our holy Profession.
He will be served by his Members, as they expect to
be saved by him. They must imitate him in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative
Goodness, and express their resentments of
his Grace to them, by these powerful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They must not grudg his Service; tho he
redeem them freely, they shall sacrifice all to him;
and while he is managing our Interest in Heaven as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor,
he will have us employed in his Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on Earth, as Instruments dedicated to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of his Name, and enlargement of his
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To do thus is agreeable to the inclination of every
holy Christian; love to Jesus fills with zeal in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
Therein they are employed; nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
them more than any visible success; yea,
they bemoan their uselesness when their industry
seems greatest. A Hermite's Cell for rest is not estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by them as an opportunity for service; tho diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and dangerous.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I Shall manage this Subject in this method.</item>
               <item>I. I will lay down some preliminary Propositions.</item>
               <item>II. Acquaint you more fully with the nature of this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99052:6"/>
Duty, of dedicating our Lives to the Interests of
Christ.</item>
               <item>III. Offer plain Reasons, to put it out of doubt,
that to dedicate our Lives to Christ is the indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
duty of all of us. And then apply these things
more particularly.</item>

            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> I. Satan, the World, and the Flesh have an
interest among men; in the overthrowing whereof,
much of the Interests of Christ consisteth.</p>
            <p>The Interests of the former are one, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
stated, and managed by the Devil. He set up
the World as an Idol, and the Flesh as a Ruler, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Sin into the World: so that the whole may
be called his Interest; the inclinations of the Flesh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
him advantages, and the World yielding him
means to advance that Interest by.</p>
            <p>This Interest of Satan is fixed 1. In opposition to the
original Dominion of God among Men. 2. To the
Attempts and Successes of Christ in restoring of
God's Dominion, and advancing some additional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of his own, with respect to fallen Man.</p>
            <p>1. The Interest of Satan is fixed in opposition to
the original Dominion of God among men.</p>
            <p>Man was made upright, loyal to God, glorious in
the image of God on the Soul,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29. Gen 1. 27.</note> and expressing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God in light, love, justice and purity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Satan hastily engageth in a Design of overthrowing
the Authority of God, defacing his Image, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
his own Temper and Power in the hearts
and practices of Men. He soon effected this, by the
Compliance of our first Parents with his Snares; and
pursueth it from one Age to another;<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>still working in
the Children of disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99052:6"/>
Hence you may easily conclude, that his Interest
lieth in Man's rebellion against his Maker, darkness of
mind as to Divine Matters, Injustice, Cruelty, Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Blasphemy, Uncleanness, Intemperance, Wrath,
Earthliness, and all things which render Men devilish
or bruitish. His great Concern was to dethrone God,
whom he hated; and to destroy Man, whose happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he envied; tho he concealeth the latter, that he
may the better effect it.</p>
            <p>2. Satan's Interest is in opposition to the Attempts
of Christ for restoring of God's Dominion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
some additional Interests of his own with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to fallen Man.</p>
            <p>Satan hoped from the sanction of the Law, and
God's dealing with himself, that his Design so far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
by the Fall, would never miscarry; but
that such Rebellion and Misery begun so to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
could never be retrieved. He enjoyeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of a quiet Throne but a small moment; then a
Curse (which affects him, tho spoken to the Serpent)
seizeth him as a Tempter, and Christ sets up as his
Antagonist, to recover the Elect, revive the trampled
Interests of God among rebellious Sinners, and erect
to himself a glorious Name and Body, as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral
Head.</p>
            <p>Satan endeavoureth the blasting of these Attempts
of Christ, and the support of his own Interests thus
threatned: and hereby we see, there is an Interest of
Satan's, which tho to the same ends, is yet managed
more directly in opposition to Christ, as Redeemer.</p>
            <p>This lieth in obstructing the Gospel, hardning the
heart to impenitency,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>blinding mens minds lest they
should believe;</hi> advancing Idolatry and Superstition,
in opposition to the Worship of Christ; perverting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99052:7"/>
the mind with Errors, contrary to the Truths reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
persecuting the Members of Christ, silencing a
faithful Ministry, dividing the Church, destroying
godly Discipline, causing Backslidings and Apostacy;
with whatever else may hinder the Attempts of Christ,
or blast the Successes of our Redeemer in any place,
person, or matter: that by all he may obviate the
gracious Purposes of Jesus towards men, and make
his Enterprize abortive.</p>
            <p>How vigilant, subtil, and unwearied is Satan in
managing this Interest? he engageth all instruments,
he takes advantages of all Tempers and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
oft influenceth good men to serve his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;<note place="margin">Mar. 8. 33. 2 Cor. 11. 14. Rev. 12. 3, 15.</note>
transformeth himself sometimes <hi>into an Angel
of light,</hi> at other times as a Dragon poureth out a
flood of persecution. Innocent things he oft abuseth;
by things seemingly indifferent he propagates his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
as well as by grosser matters. He waits every
Age to obstruct the Points Christ seems designed to
gain,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 12.</note> (called by the Spirit <hi>the truth of the present
time</hi>) as if he were content to endure past instances of
Christ's Conquest, which he could not hinder. He
refineth his Interests according to the light that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that they may be the more likely to be complied
with: tho every step he gaineth be but a degree,
which he would improve to the utmost villany, by a
gradual process.</p>
            <p>The more eminently any thing, Constitution, or
Party, expresseth his prevalency, or serveth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
purpose; the more his Interest is staked therein,
and his Power exerted thereby.<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 3, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> Thus after <hi>Rome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
failed his Design, he begins an Idolatrous Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Christian Church; and giveth the Head of
that Apostacy (under the emblem of <hi>a Lamb with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99052:7"/>
two horns</hi>) wonderful skill, and power: by him he
corrupts the Church, and encounters the growing
Kingdom of our Lord, as the great Antichrist. By
him Satan's Interests are kept up for many Ages over
many Nations, wearing a Christian name: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of his infection disturb the Interests of Christ
in Churches relieved from grosser Pollutions; which
is effected by Customs, and Officers uninstituted by
Christ; by Errors eclipsing the Authority, Operations,
Merits, and free Grace of our Blessed Lord, wherein
many departed from <hi>Babylon</hi> are too deeply engaged.
In every one of these, Satan's Interest consisteth, either
as a means which Satan makes use of, or as it stands
in opposition to any Truth and Institution of Christ.</p>
            <p>Much of the Interests of Christ consists in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
each of these, and blasting those Counter-designs
of Satan. Wonderful will be the Scheme of Christ's
Counter-acting, and baffling these various Efforts,
when the methods and seasonableness of all shall be
at once made known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. II.</hi> All men by nature are devoted to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Satan, the World and Flesh.</p>
            <p>Satan executeth his Purposes by Men as Slaves in
Chains. It's true, this is generally by uniting his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
with theirs, and so serving himself by them,
while they are acting their own Lusts, and consulting
a fleshly Interest. They are bribed by advantage, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by grandure, or politick reasons; whereby they
seem to justify the Devil's drudgery. They favour
some Errors, as the lusts of the Mind; others, as
leading to licentiousness, or countenancing them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Their corrupt hearts are under the government of
lust; and the World being their Idol, the Devil may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99052:8"/>
thereby gild over any Pill, and employ them in
most undertakings.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The God of this World</hi> wants not
means to hire, affright, or allure them by; and these
seldom are unsuccessful, unless when God overacts
their Inclinations; or in his Providence prevents the
gainfull offer; or when he chaineth some loss, shame, or
such sensible evils, with their serving Satan's turn at
present.</p>
            <p>But with most Sinners, in most of his Concerns, the
Devil gains concurrence, and that by means grateful
to the Flesh. Ecclesiastical grandure supporteth unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Officers in the Church; vast incomes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
power tempt to Idolatry, to an universal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and a world of vile Appendants. Ignorance must
be countenanced, lest these emoluments be exposed to
hazard. Superstition will be contended for, as its
pomp is pleasing to a vain mind: dead Forms are abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as lulling Conscience asleep; which is needful to
the quiet of an unregenerate heart, where the Gospel-light
is by Christ forced on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahumatism</hi> and Pagan Idolatry were introduced
by methods adapted to mens lusts; and are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by reasons from worldly Interests</p>
            <p>This way usually Satan attains his ends by misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men: but sometimes he doth by strong delusions
hurry them without apparent motives; yea by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
expose them to hardships ungrateful to Nature, tho
vicious.<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 8, 11.</note> A strange <hi>impetus</hi> reconcileth them to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yea and death in the Devil's work: God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
him to impress their Imaginations, and act
their Souls in an amazing manner. Thus many errors
are suggested and propagated.</p>
            <p>One way or another, all ungodly men willingly serve
the Devill's Interest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99052:8"/>
How are most of Mankind employed in this sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
by Satan? yea, their Lusts oft carry them to
intemperance, impiety, violence, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

are opposite to their own carnal Inclinations, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.</p>
            <p>Christ is sure of an Enemy, where a carnal mind

void of pomp, and to purposes more spiritual than a
carnal mind could relish. The best Natures become
cruel from a blind zeal,<note place="margin">Acts 3. 50.</note> and the very <hi>devout</hi> turn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
of Religion, as abominable to their unrenewed
minds.<note place="margin">Acts 24. 5.</note> Satan paints the Servants of Christ as factious,
turbulent, and dangerous; and so engageth the Powers
of the Earth to the highest vigor in their extirpation.
The Rules of his House are oft opposed as inconsistent
with some Maxims of Policy.<note place="margin">Amos 7. 10.</note> Ignorance and strong
Delusions cause many to sacrifice the real Interests of
Christ, even from seeming regards to him, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath forced some reverence to his Name, tho
enmity against his Laws and Nature do still abide.</p>
            <p>It's true, that ungodly men may bear with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
profession of Religion, when education hath fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarized
it, and they find it can consist with the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a carnal heart; nay, they greatly like a dead
form of Christianity, because it suits all men to be of
some Religion; and no other can quiet their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99052:9"/>
in its awakened foresight of Eternity, when
enlightned at all by the Gospel; but still their Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
vents its dislike against the Inwards, and power
of Religion; tho the Form thereof is become thus
necessary.</p>
            <p>They despise <hi>worshipping God in the Spirit</hi> as unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
because unfelt.<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 3.</note> A lively Ministry is hated,
as disquieting their feared Consciences: They loathe
the strictly Pious, as a Reproach to themselves. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in Reformation in the Church, is obstructed from
inward antipathy to any further Advance to Christ,
and hazard to secular Interests thereby: Or it looks
too trivial to be contended for by them, to whom all
Religion is indifferent, further than as rivited by long
Custom. Yea, they oppose it from a proud Conceit
that it would reproach their former usage, as erroneous
and imperfect.</p>
            <p>Indeed sometimes the Prophane grow <hi>zealous</hi> for
some Cause of Christ, but never for the Sake of Christ.
Applause, security to their own Interest, or long Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
awaken their Concern. God by his Providence
supports his own Cause by Evil Men: their Estates,
Honour, Emulation, Quarrels, and the like, influence
their Endeavours in that which proves a Service to
the Truth. They are often zealous for a lower De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Reformation, in opposition to a greater; not
seeing that that lesser Degree ceaseth to be the Interest
of Christ, when it becomes an Impediment to, or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
with Reformation in greater Instances.</p>
            <p>But however the Ungodly may be thus over-ruled
to comply with any thing which belongs to Christ,
their prevailing Inclination is to betray all of Christ
which they profess, when damage to their fleshly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
attends it. Yea in a quiet Season their Religion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99052:9"/>
dwindles into an empty From; the Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
are supplanted by encroaching Errors, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
so clogg'd and eclipsed in evil mens manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it hardly retains what deserves that Name.
To this opposition in the nature of Man to the Inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of Christ, must be ascribed the wonderful Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of Christian Churches: And as far as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of Corruption influence the Best Men, Christ
shall suffer by them in his Concernments: His Name
shall endure reproach, and his Ministers damage;
his Church is divided, Love destroyed, the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sinners hindred, Advances in Godliness obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and many such ways our sinful Natures disserve,
yea oppose the Interests of our Blessed Lord. This
should make the Pious watchful, as not ignorant they
have Lusts which the Devil may improve to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Christ. And it should make the Ungodly
suspicious, when they contend with many good men,
that it is not the Interest of Christ they are engaged
for, which they are so far likelier to mistake and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
than those more Holy persons are.</p>

doing or suffering; none may neglect the greatest
service which their Callings and Gifts give opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for. Magistrates, Ministers, Parents, are by

should they be employed.</p>
            <p>No Station is so high, as to plead exemption by its
dignity; nor any Gifts so eminent, as to allow remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
To forbear the utmost service of Christ in the
Ministry, when dedicated to him in that Office, is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious:

            <p>No man may refuse any Office or Work, to which

what supplies Christ will afford. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is called

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 7.</note> There
is an hidden energy and disposition of circumstances
which do effect what we otherwise vainly attempt.
No concernment of Christ would prosper in the World,
if left to the sole management of them, who are most
fitted or devoted to it; their power being so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to the opposition which every design of Christ
meets with. The interest which a subtil and mighty
Devil hath in men, the abject state and vile inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of mankind, the suitableness and power of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
things, the enmity of the heart against Christ, the
incapacity of a dead blind World to relish, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the nature, glory and advantage of all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Christ: are all such obstacles, as might cause
us to despair, if a Divine Power were not at hand to
execute this purpose.</p>
            <p>To set up God's Throne, cast down Satan's Kingdom,
and convert Sinners, was an enterprize becoming only
an Almighty Saviour to undertake, and possible only
for him to effect. Therefore we should in all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
rely on his help, and in every success humbly
acknowledge him. He is pleased to secure this honour
to himself, by blasting often the most probable means,
and giving the greatest lifts to his Interest, by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
too contemptible to conceal his Arm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99052:11"/>
It's enough for us, that our <hi>work is with the Lord</hi> for
reward,<note place="margin">Is. 49. 4.</note> when our upright labours are in vain as to the
event. Yea, he may hereafter prosper our attempts
beyond what their present influence can promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> VI. I hope I need not add, that the Doctrine
of Merits receiveth no support from our greatest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>Our Forfeitures are too many, our Performances too
imperfect, our Engagements too strong, Divine Aids
too arbitrary, and the Rule of Righteousness too strict,
to allow us to plead our Service in Bar to <hi>eternal life
as a gift;</hi> or to the atonement of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> as the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Cause of all the good we hope for. Whatever
evidence our faithfulness gives to the sincerity of that
faith, whereby Christ is made ours; whatever encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
the promises may yield to the diligent Soul,
no upright heart can be puffed above subscribing his
hearty Amen to that Caution of our Lord's, <hi>When ye
have done all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note> 
               <hi>say, we are unprofitable Servants: we
have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> No, not that
Lord, so as not to need forgiveness for many faults
cleaving thereto.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to explain the nature of this
duty of dedicating our lives to the Interests of Christ.
This will be done under these two enquiries: 1. What
are the Interests of Christ? 2. What is it to dedicate
our lives to the serving these Interests.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. What are the Interests of Christ, to serve
which our lives should be dedicated?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> All the declared Designs of Christ in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatoral
Office, in opposition to the Devil, the World,
and the Flesh.</p>
            <p>To this must be referred all the ends which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99052:11"/>
and to effect which, his heart is intent on; and
injoineth our concurrence in. They may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Interests, considering, they are things under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by him; all his Institutions, Laws and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
refer to them; he died, sent his Spirit, and still
intercedeth, as means of their accomplishment. His
Glory and Truth, as Mediator, is concerned in them.
These things may be referred to these three Heads.</p>
            <p>1. The restauration of God's original Dominion and
Image among men, against the usurpations and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Satan, and vile apostacy and rebellion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>His Design is <hi>to destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> and
advance that purity and order,<note place="margin">1 John 3. 8.</note> which the entrance of
Sin expelled. His Interests under this Head consists
in the conversion of Sinners, obedience of men to all
the Laws of God; their resemblance of his imitable
Perfections, and utter renouncing of all that is devilish,
or bruitish. His concern is to enlighten the ignorant
mind, subdue disorderly appetites to the dominion of
Grace, and Reason. Sound knowledg, fear of God,
love to God and one another, justice, temperance,
chastity, discharge of relative duties, Divine Worship
in opposition to Idolatry, and all godliness, truth, and
goodness, are parts of his Interest, which men should
studiously promote, that God may be the portion and
supreme end of men.</p>
            <p>2. Such things wherein the peculiar glory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Christ, as Mediator, consists.</p>
            <p>Under this are included every Doctrine, Institution
and matter which relate to Christ, and are superadded
to what concerned Mankind before the Fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He died to be Lord both of dead and living.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 9.</note> And
his Interest which we must serve; is in these things:<note place="margin">John 10. 15.</note>
gathering to himself a body of all that belong to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99052:12"/>
election of Grace; the improvement of every Believer
to the <hi>measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note>
That he prevail and be acknowledged as Prophet,
Priest and King; all pardon and favour with God
ascribed to his Merits, all grace derived from his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and all duty performed in his name. That his
People, who be his Members and Heritage, be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured,
his Churches have their due privileges, all
worship managed by Gospel-rule, a Gospel-ministry
encouraged; no Officers imposed, but whom he hath
appointed in his House; and none of them neglected:
love and peace maintained among his Followers, and
they admitted to the privileges of his Sanctuary, on
his terms.</p>
            <p>It belongs to him that there be a godly Magistracy,
a Gospel Discipline, and whatever else he hath either
appointed as Means, or declared as Instances of his
Triumphs as Mediator; and also that the Gospel terms
of Life be truly stated, and complied with.</p>
            <p>3. The Interests of Christ may be considered as they
stand in an opposition to such errors, parties, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
wherein the Attempts of Satan against the
glory and influence of the Mediator consist.</p>
            <p>The Devil sets up his Standard at every point, which
Christ gaineth; no Truth escapeth his Assault; and he
never wants men of wit and power to abet his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
yea, generally the Croud hath been of his side,
when the Witnesses of Jesus have been few and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
Satan hath his stated Sects and Parties, and
tho many Truths of Christ be owned by some Sects,
yet in whatever respect they are denominated from
their Contests against Christ, the Interest of Jesus lieth
in opposition to them. Under this Head I shall be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
because I fear no Party hath all the Interest of
Christ, and nothing else. And I hope God is about some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99052:12"/>
great things, which will be attended with such a light
and spirit, as may end in a name comprehensive of all
that is Christ's, and exclusive of all else. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
his Church,<note place="margin">Is 62. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt be called by a new name,
which the mouth of the Lord shall name.</hi> Christian is the
best we yet know, but how much opposite to Jesus is
pretended to under that name? However I must not
fear to say, the Interests of Christ consist in Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
in opposition to Popery in all things wherein it
is Antichristian. (Which are too many.) The Interest
of Christ is in Non-conformity, in opposition to the
imposing sinful and doubtful terms of Communion of
Saints, or exercise of the Ministry; and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the great things of God to a Constitution unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by Christ, and incapable of promoting real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to that degree, as I hope many of its abettors
desire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. What is it to dedicate our lives to the service
of the Interests of Christ?</p>
            <p>I must suggest to you, that under the word <hi>life.</hi> (by
a Synechdoche and Metonymie) are included our time,
talents, opportunities, all enjoyments, yea life it self, as an
offering, whenever the service, or testimony of Christ
require it. Having premised this, I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It implieth a solemn offering of our selves
and all in our power, to Christ.</p>
            <p>This is injoined;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Present your Bodies a living sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
&amp;c. This ought to be expresly done in our first
Conversion, and oft repeated, especially at the Lord's
Table. Engrave the stamp of Christ on all you possess,
and acknowledg his propriety. Lord, my self, and all that
is mine, I offer to thee, and will serve thee with. This
Vow in thy constant observation will keep thee from
a supine neglect, when opportunity of service is given;
and silence all repinings, when his service is hard or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99052:13"/>
He that neglects this, will soon find matter of
excuse in his holy profession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The Service of Christ and his Interests must
be the governing end in all deliberate Acts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances.</p>
            <p>Men are devoted to what they chiefly intend. <hi>Paul</hi>
expresseth that his life was indeed dedicated thus, when
amidst all disswasives from a dangerous duty, he asserts,
<hi>I count not my life dear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 24.</note> 
               <hi>so I may finish my course, and
the Ministry which I have received.</hi> Wo to them whose
Consults still terminate in some selfish matter, and are
concerned for Christ only by the by. Providence may
serve it self by their Sins, as well as by their chance Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which they hardly intend. Christ accounts
none faithful to his Concerns, who provide for them
last, but chiefly contrive for things that are none of
his. Which prevail when in competition? for what are
we most industrious? about what are we most sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous?
that our lives are dedicated to, whether they
be the Interest of Christ, or other things.</p>
            <p>3. There is an actual and stated employing our lives
and all our abilities for Christ.</p>
            <p>This dedication consists not in faint acts of the mind,
but extends to, and expresseth it self in the doing all
we can to promote Christ's Interests.</p>
            <p>Thy heart cannot concur in this dedication, when
thy performances do not conduce to exalt him.<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 11.</note> You
must be <hi>fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.</hi> To live is
Christ; when our parts are engaged to plead for Truth,
our power subserveth his Claims, our time and Estates
are employed to uphold his Gospel, advance Piety, and
abet the testimony of Jesus:<note place="margin">Phil 1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>striving together for the
faith of the Gospel.</hi> He dedicates his life and talents to
Christ, who useth them for Christ in all opportunities
of doing, and willingly parts with them, rather than
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99052:13"/>
renounce his Interests. <hi>Moses</hi> yields an instance, when
<hi>he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
treasures of Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25, 26.</note> renouncing all temporal hopes, to
give a specimen of future service.</p>
            <p>This living to Christ imports also a <hi>stated Course</hi> of
life. It's not enough to serve Christ by starts, or occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
acts. It must be our ordinary employ, and the scope
of our lives. Our abilities must be still on the altar, and
our ears ever open to the Voice of God by all occasions,
however frequently they return. Happy they, who early
engage in this, and the longest life gives no period to it.
Yea, all we do, and every moment we spend, should me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
or immediately serve the Interest of Christ.</p>
            <p>4. We live for Christ, when we value our lives and
talents, as they be serviceable to the Interests of the
Lord Jesus. Men live to themselves, and their time is
dedicated to their Lusts; when they esteem their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
as they afford fuel to carnal Inclinations; and
are fond of long life, as an opportunity of pleasing their
Senses and Appetites. To such all is despicable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
which yield not Flesh-pleasing-contentments. Thus
bruitishly they express their sentiments,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we shall die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he that dedicates his life to Christ, is glad of an
Estate, that he may be useful by charity in employing
it; and express lively hopes of Heaven, when called for
Christ's sake to relinquish it. What is esteem with men
farther than as it may add to his influence? or parts,
or power, than as they qualify him for greater services?
a good Soul (assured of Heaven) would gladly resign
his Spirit, when he ceaseth to be useful.</p>
            <p>What is more awful to such a man, than to be cast
by <hi>as an useless Vessel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 22. 28.</note> whom God disdaineth to employ?
and nothing yields them greater delight, than capacity
for the Service of Christ, and success therein. Every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99052:14"/>
Convert by their ministry,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 2. 19.</note> is their <hi>joy, and their Crown.</hi>
How chearfully do they own Divine Goodness, when
their hearts are enlarged to any useful act, and they
enabled for it?<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Who am I, and what is my People, that
we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?</hi> are
the words of <hi>David,</hi> when his People had joined with
him, in so liberal an offering for Temple-work.</p>
            <p>It's a Curse in a holy man's thoughts, to have talents
without a heart to use them for God; and much more
to be abused in spending them on his Lusts. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
in their eyes be the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Earth,
whose greatness is meerly for oppression, foolish gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
and the Devils Service? they would prefer the
condition of a Beast, to the greatest Monarchs thus bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly
satisfied, and employed. The Saints would not
change their persecuted State, for that of the greatest
Princes,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 26.</note> unless <hi>they bring the honour glory and of their
Nations to the new Jerusalem:</hi> that is, to the Church
of Christ fully reformed, and enlarged.</p>
            <p>Herein you have an account of the Dedication of our
lives to Christ; thus do all they to whom to live is Christ.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you may say, these are meer Contemplations,
but to do thus is not the Duty of all, nor the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any, whatever they pretend.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore undertake next to prove, that it is the
Duty of all of you thus to dedicate your lives to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lord Jesus, and his Interests. I shall offer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to convince you, which refer to us as Men, and
Christians.</p>
            <p>That supreme Love and Regard to God,<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> which is the
Duty of all men, must dispose them to this Dedication.</p>
            <p>Can you doubt,<note place="margin">Mar. 23. 37.</note> whether you ought <hi>to love the Lord
your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind?</hi> Must not God be loved above self by
every rational Creature? Is it not the appointment of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99052:14"/>
God to every man?<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Thus shalt fear the Lord thy God,
him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave.</hi> These
are Duties resulting from our relation to God as our
Maker, and due to him on the account of the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
excellency of his Being: yea the very Order of the
Universe directs to it; the first cause of all should have
the supreme Regard and Interest among all Beings.</p>
            <p>Now know, that it is impossible to love and regard
God in this supreme manner, if you dedicate not all to
his Interest. Can any man regard God above himself,
and yet serve himself above God? Or can any man
serve God above all, and neglect the Interests of God?
These are the Occasions he gives men to express their
regard to him by:<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 2.</note> His Essence is above what our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can be extended to: but his Saints, his Honour, his
Truth, his Image, and Cause, are his Concerns on Earth:
and as these are regarded or neglected, he esteems him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
valued or despised by us. To each of these the saying
of Christ is applicable,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 40, 45.</note> 
               <hi>Verily I say unto you, In as much
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
me; and in as much as ye did it to one of the least of
these, ye did it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Relation God hath to, and Concern he hath in
these Interests, transfer the respect of all to himself.</p>
            <p>So that it is a Duty to dedicate all to his service, and
as far as he calls us to it, to employ all to that end; or it
is no Duty to love and regard God above all: yea it
must then be a Duty to despise God, and prefer Self,
Satan, and other Rivals to the infinitely blessed God;
which a reasonable Soul must tremble at.</p>
            <p>Gods absolute propriety in men,<note place="margin">R. 2.</note> and in all which they
possess, makes the sacrifice of all to his Interests a Duty,
by all the rules of Justice. Notions of <hi>just</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> are
preserved by God in the Conscience, above most others.
Principles of Justice are the strongest in that natural
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99052:15"/>
habit, which we call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and these require that
every one receive his own. Now what hath any man,
which he hath not received at the hands of God? Is it
not he that made us by his Power, endued us with
gifts intellectual? hath any man an Estate or Honour,
but he to whom God hath given them?<note place="margin">Eccl. 6. 2.</note> and is not all
at his disposal?</p>
            <p>God did not release his own right, when he entrusted
us with the use of any talents: and as to him we are <hi>ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
not proprietors,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 2.</note> and therefore accountable for all.</p>
            <p>God had a respect to his own glory and service, in his
creating of all things: <hi>he made all things for himself.</hi>
Yea he hath dispenced all under this rule,<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 4.</note> that they
be employed for him. This Law every brute creature,
and inanimate Being observe: yea the glorious Angels
do not deny,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> or disdain this homage. They <hi>are ministring
spirits,</hi> whose utmost abilities are consecrated to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Gods will, tho it be often us poor sinners
in whose behalf they serve.</p>
            <p>And must not the same Justice be observed by Men?
can any thing be denied God equally, when all is his,
and he asketh service by nothing but what's his own?
<hi>Paul</hi> is but righteous, when his labours and sufferings
for Christ were most abundant; this he suggests, as well
as his privilege by it,<note place="margin">Act. 27. 2.</note> when he saith, <hi>The Angel of God
whose I am, and whom I serve, stood by me. David</hi> in his
large offerings acquits God from being a debtor; and
himself of being more than just. <hi>All things come from
thee, and of thine own we have given thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 14, 16.</note> God chargeth
the man who improved not the one Talent, not with
unkindness, but unjustice: and so will he reprove all
that deny him any thing which his Interest requires:
<hi>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my Money to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 27.</note>
               <hi>and then I should have rereived my own with
Vsury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:99052:15"/>
You may as well accuse God of Injury, when by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
he brings you to Death, Poverty or decay of Parts; as
deny him the utmost Service in his Concerns. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he asserts his own Right without your leave; in the
other, he yields you opportunity for Consent, to your own
Benefit. He offers you an Occasion to trade for your selves
with his Stock. If the Testimony of God requires any thing
to be laid out for it, which is not his, you have some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to plead; but that can never be, unless when Men do
<hi>wickedly for God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 13. 7.</note> which he abhors.</p>
            <p>3. The Lord Jesus hath an additional right to all of us,
and our utmost Services by purchase.</p>
            <p>The Interests of God and his Claim, as Creator are in the
hands of Christ. But as Redeemer his Title is added too,
and our Service more strongly demanded:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> For <hi>ye are bought
with a Price; therefore glorify God in your Body, and in your
Spirit, which are his.</hi> He may justly serve himself of us,
and by us, as his redeemed Captives. We cost him dearer,
than our utmost Service can amount to. All our Graces
and Gifts are from him by a new Dispensation,<note place="margin">Ex. 13. 15. &amp; ch. 13. 15.</note> and held
by a new Tenure. You have an Emblem of it in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the First Born, and in the Ransom of all Souls.</p>
            <p>How much more may Christ use the words to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
which <hi>Paul</hi> uttered only as an Instrument of his Conversion?
<hi>Albeit, I do not say to thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 19.</note> 
               <hi>how thou owest me even thine own
self besides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth he wrong us, if he calls for our Gifts, our Estates,
yea, our Lives; when he continues them to us after our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
Forfeitures, and gave them to us, if Believers, as he is
Head over all things to the Church?</p>
            <p>So that if it be a Duty to be just to God as Creator, or just
to Christ as Redeemer, all our Lives and Abilities must be
devoted to his Interests.</p>
            <p>4. No man is a Christian indeed, that dedicateth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
Life and all to Christ: And so if it be a Duty to be a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99052:16"/>
Christian, this devotedness is a Duty as it is essential to our
Christian State.</p>
            <p>It's true, you may bear the Name; but you cannot be the
thing designed by that Name, if you devote not all to the
Honour of the Lord Jesus; and design it as the chiefest purpose
of your Life, to propagate his Interests. Can any Man be
his Subject, who contributes not to his Affairs what in him
lieth? Consent to be his, is the greatest Fundamental of
Religion; and this includes a solemn Surrender of all to him.
Union betwixt Christ and his Members, makes their Interests
common; his Interest is their Interest; and they are to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his Conduct as their Head, in what their usefulness
must consist.<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 4. Joh. 12. 26. Col. 4. 23.</note> Their Character is, <hi>They follow the Lamb
wheresoever he goeth.</hi> Their Motto is, <hi>I serve the Lord Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion is not a State of Freedom, to live to our selves
under the Covert of Gospel pardon, but an Obligation
and Inclination to live to our Blessed Lord;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 21.</note> 
               <hi>being not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Law to God, but under the Law to Christ.</hi> Therefore
you must account Christianity a Crime, or you must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the true Faith, and plead Christs Cause to the utmost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 5. It is as much Mens Duties that profess to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to dedicate their Lives and all to the interest of Christ,
as it is to avoid Perjury, Sacriledge and Hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>These Crimes are too horrid to necessitate Arguments,
to prove that forbearance of them is a Duty. Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
that to neglect this Dedication is thus Criminal, I
hope will suffice. To this End let me reason with you: Is
it not Perjury to violate your Baptismal Vow? Yea, sure
the greatest: And did not you then vow to fight under
Christs Banner, renounce the World, the Flesh and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and that you would never be ashamed of Christs Cross?
Is not your neglect of Dedication of all to Christ, an express
violation of this Vow? When you fear, or grudge perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Christians Work, dare not profess the true Faith and
Worship of Christ, nor engage in the supports of his Gospel
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99052:16"/>
and Truths; are not your Estates and Abilities dedicated to
the Devil, and your Lusts? Is not Christ deserted? Is not
his Cross refused, when you prostitute the Concernments of
your Saviour? None can do more for Christ, than the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Vow includes. What Perjury then lies at your Doors,
who are no way concerned for him? Is it no Sacriledge
to alien duly dedicated things to common use, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Allowance? Were not your Souls, Bodies, Gifts, and
all you have, dedicated to the Lord Jesus, when you were
Baptized in, or into the N<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me of the Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> Son, and Spirit?
This Surrender was professed, and Gods Propriety and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
acknowledged:<note place="margin">Ez. 20. 37.</note> 
               <hi>All past under the Rod;</hi> and Gods
Name was enstamped on all thus devoted to his use.</p>
            <p>Now when you neglect to honour Christ, and serve his
Interest with your Substance, Time and Gifts; do not you
with-hold what was Consecrated, and apply it to your own
carnal Ends and Use? Every idle cowardly Christian, keeps
back what is Gods, and not his own. Every Apostate doth
the same more grosly: Every Enemy to any Concern of
Christ, employs the Consecrated Things of Christ against
him.</p>
            <p>So that here is Sacriledg at your Door, if you improve
not all for Christs Interest in your Places. And this Perjury
and Sacriledg is double in any Ministers or Magistrates, who
are under Vows and Dedications, additional to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all Christians. Is it not Hypocrisy solemnly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to intend, do, and be what we neither do, nor are? Now
can you deny that you profess to intend Christs Service, to
advance his Name and Interests, and be for his Praise, as
Witnesses to him in the World? You appear and would be
thought such, in professing to be his Followers: For on these
Terms he admits Men to wear his Name;<note place="margin">Luke 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>If any Man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and follow me.</hi> There he injoins, that Self have not
the disposal of us, or ours; That we follow him in his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99052:17"/>
and Designs which he is carrying on in the World,
and abett these still tho the Cross be our daily Associate.
All this thou pretendest.</p>
            <p>And now when thou refusest to dedicate thy Life to
Christ; dost not thou betray Christ with a Kiss, affront God,
and abuse Men by delusive Mockery, and wearest that Title
of <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> which thou brandest the upright with? Oh!
think of this, you who spend your Time and Estates as fuel
to your Lusts; not once laying to heart any Engagement
on you, to employ them to higher Ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 6. All living Christians are chosen Ones, appointed
by Christ to advance his Interests in their Day.</p>
            <p>Great are the Purposes our Lord is accomplishing. And
tho his immediate Power, or the Ministry of Angels, would
be effective of them; yet he honours Mortals as Instruments
therein. He overturns Satans Throne, erects and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
his own Kingdom, leads Men into Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by the Ministration of Men like our selves; tho the
effective Virtue be from him.</p>
            <p>All are obliged to concur; but living Saints are under a
more peculiar anointing for it, and more especially entrusted
with it in their respective Stations. He saith of every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Magistrate,<note place="margin">Ps. 80. 17.</note> 
               <hi>This is the Son of Man, whom I have made
strong for my self.</hi> Of every holy Parent as of <hi>Abraham,
For I know him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>that he will command his Children and his
Houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi>
It's true of every upright Minister,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 17.</note> That <hi>he is set for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Gospel:</hi> Yea, every private Christian is among
them,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> who <hi>are an holy Nation, a peculiar People; that they
should shew forth the Praises of him, who called them into his
marvellous Light.</hi> The weakest Christian hath some Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and is furnished suitably to what Christ intends by
him.</p>
            <p>Is it not a great Duty to discarge this glorious Trust, and
observe these Precepts which connote our Excellency as well
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99052:17"/>
as Duty? In this respect, we are they of whom he says, <hi>These
are the People I have formed for my self,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 43. 21.</note> 
               <hi>they shall shew forth
my Praise.</hi> If you are Believers, you have a greater aptitude
to serve Christ; and devotedness to his Designs is directed
to you, above the rest of the World.</p>
            <p>This is but keeping up our holy <hi>Profession,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 23, 25.</note> which Christ
is so intent on. And what Engagements had other Saints to
transmit to us Christs Truth and Worship, which we are not
under to imitate in our Day, for the good of following Ages?</p>
            <p>What Good do we enjoy? What advantage doth the
Cause of Christ now reap, by the Expence and Labours of
Christians in former Days; yea, by the Blood of many
faithful Martyrs?</p>
            <p>Shall then any thing dear to Christ be so trivial with us,
as not command the utmost Service or Suffering? We owe
Christ as much as others ever did; we cost him as dear; he
hath forgiven us as much, if not more; we hope to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the same Glory; and his Interests in our Day, are
likely to be attended with more glorious Success.</p>
            <p>If your Hearts be not obstinate against what God injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
you must engage in this Duty, which is so apparent by
these Reasons, to which many more might be added. Can
you after all I have said, let any gasping Concern of Christ
want the utmost Aid, which you are able to afford it duly,
and in your Places? Or, dare you do any thing fatal to it,
whatever be your Temptations? I am led to the Application
of this Truth, which I shall attend under these following
Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Exhort.</hi> I would call such of you to deep Repentance,
who have employed your Lives and Abilities in opposing the
Interests of Christ.</p>
            <p>What I shall say under this Head, is not designed to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
or reproach any Man; much less to hinder peace with,
and love to the most guilty, when you become sensible of
the provocation God layeth to your charge: And least of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99052:18"/>
all would I be interpreted to impeach the Innocent, to
whom the things perpetrated by Men under any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Character with them, must needs be afflictive.</p>
            <p>My aim is only to bring you to Repentance, if so be, your
Hearts are not so desperately hardned, as to bind on your
selves those Woes, which so unchristian a Behaviour hath
exposed you to. I am induced to this unpleasing Work, by
the opportunity which this mixed Congregation affords me
of speaking to such, whom I expect not to meet elsewhere;
and I fear, this Admonition to you, is too much neglected by
such, from whom it might be better resented.</p>
            <p>Repentance is the great design of the present Providences
we are under, and the best expedient to prevent the Evils
we are threatned with. God will embitter that profane
and persecuting Spirit, which hath raged in the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> and tho forgiveness be our Duty, yet Providence
levels its Arrow against the guilty, in a manner too extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
to be disregarded; but how few consider the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God, even when Cloathed with the greatest Light
and Wonder?</p>
            <p>I know the Guilty have Ignorance enough to impute to
their Zeal for truth, what they have done from their innate
Enmity to Christ; but mistakes do not acquit in a Matter so
important: And Persecutors never ruin the Godly under a
good Character;<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 2.</note> but <hi>think they do God good Service,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
whom ever they can call Factious, or Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
The concern of Christ is too hid, not to be oft mistaken
by Sinners;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 7. 8.</note> 
               <hi>For had they known it, they would not have Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
the Lord of Glory.</hi> And profane Persecutors do as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wound Christ in his Doctrins, Worship and Members,
as if they laid violent Hands on his very Person.</p>
            <p>Oh profane Ones! Who else could it be but Christ, whom
you opposed in his Members, whiles you persecuted the
most serious imitaters of him, and Men of all their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
most devoted to him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99052:18"/>
Was it not Christ in his Gospel you despised, when you
ridicul'd the most essential Doctrins of his Gospel?</p>
            <p>Have you not acted against Christ in his Ministers, whiles
you stopped the Mouths of such, who were as likely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Interests by their Ministry as any others; yea,
and to this added a heap of malicious Lies and Slanders, lest
Christ might be served by them?</p>
            <p>Have you not hated and laden with Contempt the most
probable Evidences of real Holiness; as a strict Life, serious
Discourse, and holy Tenderness?</p>
            <p>Is it not the special Testimony of Christ in your Day,
which you have resisted, when you disabled from Service,
and exposed to extream Hardships; all that considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
who stand and suffer for this? <hi>viz.</hi> that the Ministry of
the Gospel and the Communion of Saints, ought not to be
clog'd with sinful, needless, or uninstituted Terms and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises;
to the wounding of Conscience, dividing the Church,
hazarding the reformed Interest, and destruction of Christian
Love and Serious Piety.</p>
            <p>What hath all your Pretence been, but a Zeal for what
your selves call indifferent? And for these you have hated,
opposed, and almost at last quite ruined the undoubted Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of the Blessed Jesus. How much have you done to
give a fatal VVound to the very Form of your Religion, not
to be recovered by a little unseasonable Noise?</p>
            <p>Surely, it's high time that your personal Irreligion and
Profaneness should force you to suspect; that you are not
so likely to know or serve the Cause of Christ, as others, so
much more pious and concerned than your selves.</p>
            <p>Ought you not at last fear, you have been acted by the
Devil against Christ, especially when you reflect on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
you have used? Would Christ have put you to serve
him by Lying, Perjury, profane Scoffing, and cruel Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the utmost of your Power? Were Sabbaths spent
by you in disturbing Meetings, as if you were the Men that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99052:19"/>
designed to serve Christ thereby? If nothing else will cause
you to suspect, that Enmity against Christ did govern you;
consider how you treated any of your own Church, who
were Pious and Serious: How much more were they valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you, than us whom you pretended some Difference
with, as Cause of Dislike?</p>
            <p>God calls you by me to deep Humblings for these things:
Be convinced and ashamed of your Opposition to him; and
be assured,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 3.</note> 
               <hi>if you repent not you shall all perish.</hi> Can <hi>you</hi>
pretend so much as to say, <hi>To me to live is Christ?</hi> Who
would have Christ and Holiness, have as little Interest in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as they have in your selves. Was it not too much that
your selves did not live to Christ, but that you must grudg
and ruin any that did live to him?</p>
            <p>How will you answer the Lord Jesus, when he shall ask
you,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 4. Jud. v. 15. 1 Thess. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Why persecutest thou me?</hi> What account can you give
of all your <hi>hard Speeches uttered against him,</hi> his Truths
and People? Must not you fear you have filled up your
Sins; and the wrath of God is come upon you to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
by forbidding the Ministers of Christ to preach his
Gospel? How must you wail, when he shall at his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
convince you, that you have pierced him in your evil
Treatment of those Men and Things, which he will then
own to be his Interests?</p>
            <p>In pity to your Souls, consider, Is this you have done suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to your Baptismal Vow? Doth your Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
oblige you to do nothing for Christ and his Cause,
except venting your Scoff and Rage against things wherein
his Interest seemeth most concerned? The Lord fasten these
things on your Hearts, and force you to a Repentance as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
as your Scandal.</p>
            <p>I speak not these things as if Repentance were confined to
you; we have all need of it: And if God intend good for us,
he will encline all sorts to it, according to our respective
Guilt: But yours is most notorious; and God seems by
his present Dealings, to point more directly at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99052:19"/>
Having said what I think my self engaged to suggest to profane
and persecuting Ones, I must solemnly warn you against all censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Thoughts and evil Speeches, against any godly Ministers or
People of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> their Differences with us will not
justify uncharitable Surmises, nor reproachful Language against
them. All good Men aim at one thing, even to serve Christ; tho
they do not agree always in the Means, God serves himself by the
different Sentiments of his People, and hath his own Methods to
convince and cement them; greater Union is reserved for that
<hi>new Jerusalem that will descend out of Heaven from God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 10. 16.</note> that beareth
the Form of a Cube; i'ts <hi>of one measure,</hi> and there carnal Interests
will not divide.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Exh.</hi> Let all real Christians live more entirely to the Service
of Christ and his Interests.</p>
            <p>You may be humbled that you have done no more for him, and
that your unusefulness to his Concerns, is imputable to your remiss
Temper, more than want of Talents. How many of your Gifts
were never employed to advance Truth? His Members have been
in straits, and his Gospel languishing, when your Riches were
hoarded up. Many neglected opportunities of Se<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vice, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you, when the Frame of your Hearts bespeak them tender.
Many have been your industrious Contrivances, wherein Christ
hath had the least, if any share.</p>
            <p>Oh! Be awakened this Day to strong Resolves, that hereafter <hi>to
you to live</hi> shall be <hi>Christ;</hi> yea, only Christ, and all other Interests
subordinated to his. Let all you have be laid anew on his Altar.
Get your Hearts lifted up in the ways of the Lord;<note place="margin">2 Cron. 17. 6.</note> and be wholly
for him, whatever Choice shall be made by others. Satans Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are industrious, unwearied, and prodigal in his Service:
Christ hath but few engaged in his behalf; and shall the declinings
of his Interests lye at your door?</p>
            <p>I shall annex some Directions and Motives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 1. Exercise your selves in the advancement of the Interests
of Christ in your own Souls.</p>
            <p>If Christ Reign wholly in us, he will Reign greatly by us.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 15. &amp; ch. 3. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Grow
up into Christ in all things,</hi> till <hi>you are filled with all the fulness of God;</hi>
and your capacity and readiness for his advancement will be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Be more acquainted with him, and you will judge him worth
your Service, and highly value all that's his. Flaming Grace will
contrive much: What can I serve Christ in? and freely consecrate
all to him. Whereas, our backwardness is an infallible sign that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99052:20"/>
his Life is feeble in us. In a word, He that neglects Christ in himself,
will be little fit for, or concerned in the advancement of Christ
in the World; nor indeed be blessed with much Success in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
for it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Dir.</hi> See that your Aims be sincere in all which you seem to
serve Christ by.</p>
            <p>Low or bad Purposes spoil good Works. God trieth the Heart
(in our best Services,) <hi>and loveth Uprightness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cron. 29. 17. Phil. 1. 15. Mat. 6. 2.</note> Good Sermons were
spoiled by Envy, and charitable Deeds by Ostentation. It's unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
when our Hearts have not higher Aims for Christ, than our
Hands at best can accomplish; but it's wicked when what we seem
to offer to Christ, is a Sacrifice to our Idols.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Dir. Chearfully</hi> dedicate <hi>all</hi> you have to the Concernments of
Christ.</p>
            <p>It's a cursed Wedg which is reserved from this Dedication, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be Estate,<note place="margin">Act. 5. 3.</note> Relation, Gifts or Life. What <hi>Ananias</hi> spared, spoiled
the acceptance of the Part he offered; tho it be not always necessary
all should be parted with, yet it is necessary that nothing be unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
when Fidelity to Christ calls for it; and it ceaseth to be
yours, when it cannot be kept without treachery to his Interests. As
all must be dedicated, so it must be chearfully laid out, as what is fit
and best. None but free-will Offerings and a <hi>chearful Giver,</hi> are lovely
in Gods account.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7. Heb. 10. 34.</note> It's left on Record as the Praise of some, <hi>They took
joyfully the spoiling of their Goods.</hi> Indeed, the hardest thought in our
greatest Toils and Expence for Christ, should be, blessed be God, that
I have any thing to express my Love and Zeal for Christ by.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Dir.</hi> Be always solicitous to know what the Interests of Christ
be, which you should at present serve; especially if there be
Doubts concerning them.</p>
            <p>The Gospel is an infallible Rule in general; Providence and the
Series of Prophesies may contribute to your direction, under the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of that higher Rule. Undoubted Duties must always be done
in their season; undoubted Truths must never be denied; yea, must
always be professed, if some damage to the Interests of Christ do not
attend it, beyond what our Profession of that Truth at that time,
will countervail; doubtful Sins must never be committed, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sins must be discouraged in our place. Present Good which is less,
may not be bought by the certain loss of a greater Good at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
nor at the expence of a greater Evil in sure Prospect. The
more material Interests of Christ must not be sacrificed to them less
considerable, nor undoubted to doubtful: I can but glance at these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99052:20"/>
You ought to be assured in every thing you engage in as for Christ, that it be
his Concern and your Work; yea, your present Duty, which a greater is not
excluded by. Assurance in this will command your Engaging for it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
under all Difficulties in it.</p>
            <p>Mistakes herein cause great Disorders, kindle a fiery Zeal,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> which is oft fatal to
the Concerns of Christ: And whatever we do to advance these mistaken Interests,
are Offerings to a Lust, and unprofitable to our selves. It would amaze one to see
the heat of some in supporting Errors, opposing Truth, destroying Peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
a weak Notion, to the hazard of the most considerable <hi>Interests</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>But yet our indifferency is Carnal, when Christ seemeth by his Providence,
by Satans violent Assault, or by the great Influence of a Truth at that time,
to call us to engage strongly in it; tho it appears at other times less momentous.
To say no more, search well what will be most for Christs Glory.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Dir.</hi> Mortify those Lusts which most hinder, and improve in those
Graces which most forward your living entirely to Christ.</p>
            <p>Mens Lusts are their greatest obstacles to Service; and it's impossible to advance
Christ considerably, if improved Graces afford not willingness and strength:
Therefore trample on your Pride which will disdain low Service, and fret at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Contempt which attends your Labours: But be more Humble, and you'll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to be any thing, so Christ may be all: Be more free from Covetousness,
which grudgeth all expence and loss for Christ, selleth Truth to get or save a
little Dross: But get more heavenly Mindedness, which disdains Earth so it may
but get more Treasure in Heaven. Cast away that slavish Fear, which betrays
Conscience to a mortals Threatning. But be more endued with holy Courage,
which will dare to be zealous for Christ in the very Face of Danger.<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 13.</note> Silence Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
that still suggests Difficulties, but hides from you both supplies of Strength
and the promised Rewards.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> Whereas, more Faith will still enlarge your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in the view of sufficient Aids and an eternal Crown. Above all trample
on Selfishness, which most devoureth our Talents: Whereas,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 18.</note> a publick Spirit
and superlative Love to Christ, would constrain your Consecration of all to
him,<note place="margin">3 Cor. 5. 13. 14.</note> as one well deserving of it.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Dir.</hi> I might add, that you ought to manage all your designed Service as
may be most conducive to the advancement of these Interests of Christ.</p>
            <p>Great Prudence is necessary to give an advantage to all our Undertakings,
that the Success we aim at be not prevented.</p>
            <p>But I have no more time than to conclude all with a few <hi>Motives</hi> to this Duty.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mot.</hi> It's the Interest of <hi>Christ</hi> I am persuading you to dedicate your <hi>Lives</hi> to.</p>
            <p>It's that Christ who hath so amazingly denied himself for you, to whom you
owe so much, from whom you have received and still expect such great things.
Can you behold any thing as <hi>his</hi> Concernment, and not be enflamed with Zeal?
Oh! What Honour is it to serve him! Being his Interests they must needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our Regard, and command our Industry: This glorious One would not
stake his Glory, and set his Heart on Trifles. And who but the unbelieving and
ungrateful can grudge him any thing? Methinks a Reflection on any thing as
his Concern, would inspire with all that can envigorate our Attempts.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Mot.</hi> It's but our Lives at most, which are to be dedicated to him.</p>
            <p>They are short, and so it's but a little while and the Hardship is over. They

are but poor and mean things, to be an Offering so acceptable to him. Alas! How
inconsiderable is all we can do or suffer, that they should reflect any Glory on
him who fills the Heavens, and is now (by us) raising a Monument which will
be admired for ever? Who would not strive to contribute most to his blessed
Designs? How can our little Matters be laid out to so great Purposes?</p>

            <p>What we do for him, he doth not need; but if we refuse it, we are undone.
We must shortly reckon for all Talents: And how uncomfortable will the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
be, when little can be reckoned as placed to <hi>Christs</hi> Account?</p>
            <p>But there is Gain by the most costly Service, and Profit by the worst of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 29.</note>
The Advantage is more than <hi>an hundred fold;</hi> if you live to him you shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
live with him; a share in his Glory will be yours, if you partake in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.<note place="margin">Joha 12. 25. 26.</note>
               <hi>If any Man serve me, him will my Father honour:</hi> How wisely is our All laid
out, when it will yield such great Returns? Look upward, and see what Mansions
<hi>Christ</hi> is preparing for you, whiles you are labouring and laying out your selves
for him: And he is like to receive the most illustrious Crown, who yields the
greatest Service. Surely, you are injurious to your selves in sparing any Seed
now,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> when you have <hi>Christs</hi> word for so vast an Increase. <hi>He that soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
shall reap sparingly; but he that soweth bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.</hi>
Oh! into what a State will you soon pass from an useful Life? <hi>To die will be
Gain, if to you to live be Christ.</hi> In Eternity you will find all your Endeavors
carefully Recorded, and abundantly Rewarded.</p>
            <p>Must not you say from this moment, Whatever I can do, and all that I Possess
shall be devoted to Him and his Interests. Engage then in his Service; you have
Angels and all Saints sharers with you in the undertaking,<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

of this Royal Company. They are Interests will stand, tho you refuse to assist; they
do still advance, tho invisibly to us. If you dedicate not your Lives to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of <hi>Christ,</hi> you must lay them out for the Devil; one of them is served
at all times, and by all Persons. Faithful Service will give a great <hi>Testimony</hi> to the
Lord Jesus, and yield wonderful advantage to such under your Influence, whose
Good you are enclined to endeavour. You will prejudice no <hi>Interest</hi> by this, but
the <hi>Interests</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> which commenced and grow still on the manifest Ruins
of Mankind: And ought you not to oppose him, to whose Usurpation are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Disorders and Calamities in the World, which Evils are redressed to
the Degree of the Advancement of the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and no further.</p>
            <p>Can you after all this refuse to bemoan the World, where so many opposite
<hi>Interests</hi> are set up <hi>against Christ;</hi> and pity <hi>Sinnes,</hi> who so blindly resist and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
bear the merciful and just Attempts of the Lord Jesus? Must not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Soul Eccho to the Apostle in my Text, <hi>Now to me to live is Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Discourse is so applicable to your Lordship and Brethren, that I
need no more than intreat, yea, charge you to Act in your Places, as Men <hi>to
whom to live is Christ.</hi> Let not any opportunity for Service to him, bring your
Souls under the Guilt of Negligence, nor yield <hi>Christ</hi> matter to upbraid you with.
A Trust is in your Hands; see that the Ends of God be faithfully answered. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

               <hi>Thou hast given a Banner to them that fear thee, that it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
because of the Truth.</hi> Resolve then in your Station, that if Christ gain not by
our Power, our Consciences shall not reproach us with refusing to dedicate all
our Abilities to him, whose Glory we chiefly aimed at, and to whose Interest
we are fully devoted.</p>
