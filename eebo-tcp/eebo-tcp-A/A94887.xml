         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE
ACCOUNT
OF THE
Tryal and Conviction
OF THAT
Notorious High-way-man Captain <hi>JAMES WHITNEY,</hi> at
the <hi>Old-Baily, Wedneſday</hi> the 18th of this inſtant January, 1692,
for the great and famous Robbery at <hi>Mims-waſh.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHen any famous Malefactor, eſpecially a Brother of the Pad, comes to the Bar of
Juſtice, he generally divides the Affections of the People; one Party are for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>He is a very fine Gentleman, a bold brave Fellow, and tis pitty but he ſhould be
ſaved.</hi> The other Party in the other extream, are bellowing out on him for a great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
<hi>How many honeſt Men has he undone? A meer Peſt to the Nation, and 'tis
the beſt thing the Government can do to make a clear riddance of ſuch Vermine, and
fairly hang 'em all out of the way.</hi> Much ſuch a divided ſhare of Popular Favour on
one ſide, and Odium on the other has been our Captain's Portion ſince his Commitment to
<hi>Newgate:</hi> And on <hi>Tueſday</hi> being brought upon his first Tryal for a Burglary commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the Houſe of a Miller, the Evidence against him not riſing high enough to the
poſitive Proof required, though his Perſon was exactly deſcribed as a main Actor in the
Fact, yat his face being muffled with a kind of half Vizor, the Tenderneſs both of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and the Conſciences of the Jury could not fix the Fact ſufficieutly upon him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he was acquitted of that Indictment. Hereupon his favourite Party grew loud
upon the matter; 'twas a publick Outcry in the Town, That he had ſtood at least half a
dozen Indictments, and with flying Colours got clear from 'em all: that no body either
could or would appear against him: that before the morrow night he would certainly be bayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and as free as an Alderman. This Cant run ſo currant, that his Life and Death,
like a Siege of <hi>Mons</hi> or <hi>Namure,</hi> grew the ſubject of very griat Wagers, and Odds offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the ſaving ſide; nay, ſome were ſo poſitive of his Safety, that a ſmall matter would
make 'em ſhare hit Deſtiny, and hang with him if he died this bout.</p>
            <p>But to turn ihe currant of all this Noiſe, yeſterday being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> after Dinner,
himſelf, <hi>Ben. Callow,</hi> and <hi>Stafford</hi> were all three ſet up to the Bar together, and all indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for that great and famous Robbery committed at <hi>Mims-waſh,</hi> which has already rung
ſo loud in all ears, where the Country Lace-men were rob'd of ſeveral hundred Pounds, and
all other Paſſengers either rob'd or ſtopt, most of their Horſes being barbarouſly killed by
the High-way-men to prevent the danger of a Purſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The chief Evidence againſt them were four honeſt Country-men who all ſwore
home; more eſpecially one of them, as to Capt. </hi>Whitney,<hi> the Teſtimony being very
poſitive, (though not affecting </hi>Callow<hi> nor </hi>Stafford,<hi> who were acquitted:) The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
were a Lace-mans Boy of </hi>Newport-Pagnel,<hi> a Haberdaſher, and a Pedler, </hi>&amp;c.<hi>the Fact in fine appeared ſo plain, that the Jury with little matter of conſult upon
the Verdict, brought him in Guilty. At which he very boldly told the Court,</hi>They had done all they could do.<hi> From thence he was uſhered on foot to Major </hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon<hi>
