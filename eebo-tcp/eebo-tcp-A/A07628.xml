            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:15340:3"/>
the accidents most remarkable, which occurred in <hi>Germany,</hi> during those seven yeares warres, though a rude, and ignorant Souldier, I was bold to set pen to paper, to discharge a long seven yeares troublesome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, in short Duties and Observations of service, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining a true &amp; simple narration of the principall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences which happened in the course of this warre, without omitting one dayes March, in three yeares under the Magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in foure yeares March with the Royall Army, under the fortunate conduct of his Maiesty of <hi>Sweden</hi> of never dying memory.</p>
            <p>Being induced thereto, chiefely, to testifie my humble respects unto your Highnesse, to whom I have ever vowed my best endeavours of service: next, to expresse my love, and thankfulnesse to my country, and to my deere Camerades, <hi>Britaines, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Swedens,</hi> (companions, not of wants, but of valour) eternizing their memory, who after death, like <hi>Phoebean</hi> Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ride triumphing in spite of envy, being praised by their enemies, for having valorously resisted their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, till they died standing, serving the publique, through their great love to your Highnesse Royall Mother, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> your Highnesse selfe, and the remnant of the Royall Issue. Hoping therefore (for their sakes departed of worthy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) my paines may be acceptable unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for their sakes alive (that long for a new Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I have beene bold, to send unto your Highnesse at this time, worthy Counsellours, whose counsell your Highnesse may be bold to follow, and their vertues, being most Heroicke and examplary, may be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your Highnesse, in going before us, as our

            <p>That great Monarch <hi>Alexander</hi> the great shewed his humanitie (in the wants of old age) to a poore and decrepite Souldier, being weary with great travell in the way, &amp; lent him his own chaire, for to warme him by the fire: and being upon his death-bed (for all the pangs and paines of Death) he disdained not to shake hands with the meanest and poorest of all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. So Mighty and Illustrious Prince, I, though a poore Souldier, doe Dedicate unto your Highnesse, these my dutifull Observations and Expeditions. Your Highnesse being eminent, as your dignity high, hath made me presume on your Highnesse goodnesse, which, I know, is full of pardons for those, that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence your Highnesse person, as I doe. That I have prefixed your Highnesse name, was my duty, as to my Patron &amp; Superiour, to whom I am ever most bound, especially in discharging of this my duty. Neither doe I pay this tribute unto your Highnesse, as to adde any thing unto your Highnesse knowledge, being already inriched with notable vertues, but rather to expresse my love and dearest respect, in all humility to him, whom I have vowed to follow (if my breath may last so long) till your Highnesse enemies be overcome.</p>
            <p>Daigne therefore, Noble and Illustrious Sir, to let passe this my tedious expedition, and shallow obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, under the name of your Highnesse Patronage, to whom I wish the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for a possession,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble, worthy, courteous, and loving <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> if I could perswade thee to beleeve what profit the diligent and serious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier doth reape by reading, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he gaineth above him, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to become a perfect Souldier by a few yeares practise, without reading: Truely, thou wouldest use thy earnest diligence as well in the one as in the other; for I dare be bold to affirme, that reading and discourse doth as much or rather more, to the furtherance of a perfect Souldier, than a few yeares practise without reading.</p>
            <p>For out of my owne experience, in my profession, having seene as many rare occurrences, and accidents of warre by practise (as hath not been seene the like in many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which shall appeare evidently by the subsequent Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of one Regiments service: Neverthelesse, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that reading and discourse of warres, inable the minde more with perfect knowledge, than the bare practise of a few yeares. Therefore, what these yeares past I have collected, by the one and the other, following the laudable profession of Armes, under the mightie and potent King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> the space of three yeares, and since under his Majestie of worthy memory the Invincible King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> his Crowne,
<pb facs="tcp:15340:5"/>
and Confederats, in foure yeares; gathered together for the good, profit, and furtherance of thee and my Country: whereby I hope the noble and worthy minded <hi>Reader,</hi> shall be allured and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to follow the Traces of those worthy <hi>Cavaliers</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my Observations, of most worthy memories: Whereof some, from meane condition, have risen to supreme honour, wealth, and dignitie; though others perished in the way of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for whose sakes, my Sword shall be ever ready against the common Enemy, that ruined the old and worthy Regiment; the memory whereof shall never be forgotten, but shall live in spite of time; and its vertues and fame be made knowne to all those interessed in the quarrell. The example of those brave spirits (noble and worthy <hi>Reader</hi>) I hope, will allure you to follow their vertues, that you may be partaker of their honour, for the further credit of our Nation. Therefore, worthy <hi>Reader,</hi> what you find here, if you please, like; but howsoever, remember alwayes to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sparingly the writings of the shallow-brained <hi>Souldier,</hi> not adorned with eloquent phrase; but with truth and simplicitie. <hi>Plinius</hi> saith, there was no book so little worth, but might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in some things. <hi>Caesar</hi> from his youth had his Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and the <hi>Bee</hi> out of the most poysonable herbs suckes the honey. Please to reade, and thou shalt finde something to delight thee; at least thou shalt see my thankfulnesse to my <hi>Camerades</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and examples of frequent mortality, to make thy use of. And as the starres take light from the Sunne; even so from <hi>Histories,</hi> men draw knowledge and wisdome. Let me intreate thee therefore, when thou wouldest avoide care, to looke on those observations, and by our examples amend thy life, and I shall be glad of thy profit, and not envy thy estate. If you ask; why I wrote these Observations? It was because I loved my <hi>Camerades.</hi> If why I published them, know it was for my friends, and not for the world, for which I care not, nor for any that is ungrate; but those which accept well of this, will encourage me betime, to take grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines for their sakes, if they view them. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

This Soyle hath also abundance of fresh and salt-water fishes; their Gentry live like Noble men, and their Communaltie live like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

Shortly after our going over, the Lievtenant Colonell departed this life, being a Gentleman of much true worth, and a valourous Commander, much regrated by the whole Regiment. Immediatly after his death, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Sanders Seaton</hi> was by his Majesties Patent made Lievtenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell to the Regiment, who did bring a strong Company of well exercised Souldiers, which were joyned to strengthen the Regiment.

Who then would disdaine to follow warres, might be thought unwise. The Baron of <hi>Fowles</hi> comming over a voluntier, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a free Table to entertaine an Earle, being ordinarily above sixteene persons at Table; his Visitors, horses and servants entertained accordingly.</p>

               <p>The liberality of a Colonell and his care in fore-seeing, for his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, returnes to him oftimes with triple profit, being with moderation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with his Officers, making them, as humble friends, not as servant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der command, and he ought by all meanes eschewe to come in question, or publique hearing with his Officers: the onely meanes to make himselfe famous, and his Regiment of long continuance.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> A Commander having the charge of a Regiment, or partie, on a march, ought in all respects to be as carefull and diligent as a Generall, that leads an Army, being subject to the like inconvenience of fortune. Wherefore he ought to be well provided of all things fitting for his march, that, in time of Rancounter with the enemy, he might the better discharge his duty, especially being provided with good store of Ammunition, both for the mouth and service, with sufficient fix Armes.</p>
               <p>He ought also, for his march ever to have good intelligence, left his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie should circumvent him. He ought also to order his march, according to the countries scituation he marches thorough, appointing his Randez-vouz nightly, short, or long, as his Quarters may fall in best security.</p>
               <p>He ought also to keepe his Officers and Souldiers in continuall good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of discipline, without suffering the one, or the other to fall off from their Stations, without great and urgent occasions; and if any of them chance to fall off, he is obliged to foresee to their timely returnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:15340:13"/>Likewise he ought not in any manner of way suffer violence to be used to <hi>Boores,</hi> or strangers in his march, and if such doth happen, he is obliged to do justice to all, and to see examplarie punishment done, to terrifie others from the like. He ought also, to be carefull to give none under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand just occasion of complaint, for want of their dues, either in quarters, or in distributing of their victualls, according to their strengths. He ought also on his march to be provident, in causing to bring their Proviant timely to their Randevouz, or Hawlts; seeing it to be rightly distributed, for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of contentions happening most commonly at such times.</p>
               <p>Also he must foresee before he makes a hawlt, that the ground be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient where he drawes up, whether he be in feare of an enemie, or not; and at such times, he must be carefull, that centries be duly placed, at all parts needefull, and that no man be suffered to wander, or go astray, from the haulting part, for feare he be to seeke, when occasion should present either to breake up, to march, or otherwise, in case of Alarum, to have his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or souldiers wandering, while as the enemie should charge, were a grosse error.</p>
               <p>Likewise, he ought to be of strict command, and authority to punish those that on a march leave their Armes behind them, or that are carelesse in keeping their Armes both fix, and cleane. In quartering either in village, field or Citie, he must give orders for his posts to keepe Guards upon, and he ought himselfe to recognize all avenues, and inquire of the knowne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, the passes, whereby his enemies may come unto him, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance he is from his enemy; he must also direct parties on all quarters of Horsemen to get intelligence, and Conschaift of his enemie, lest unawares he should be surprised.</p>
               <p>Likewise at his upbreaking from quarters, he should take notice of all complaints, and do justice accordingly: And he should have a speciall care of the sicke, either to transport them, or to foresee for their good usage, in case necessitie, or weakenesse force him to leave them behind. He ought also, to foresee before he march for his Guides and to give charge to keepe them from running away; and he ought to learne of the guide the inconveniences on the way that may be hindersome unto his march, that timely he might provide a remedie. His Guide should also know how far to go, that when he comes his length, he may timely provide for another. He ought also to learne the best way for his Baggage, and Ammunition to march on, and in case of suspected danger, he ought to ordaine a guard of Musketiers with a sufficient Officer to command for their convoy, and if it be such way, as that on occasion his Ammunition cannot be steadable unto him, in such a case he must not part from his Ammunition waggons; but rather to keepe one way, though it should be far about.</p>
               <p>He ought never for pastime, or pleasure, on a suspected march neere an enemy, to go from the sight of his Troopes; for feare he should be absent in greatest neede, or that some misfortune might happen betweene those he commands himselfe, or against others incurring in their wayes. If occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of service offer, he must never be dejected, but to encourage ever his owne most in the greatest extreamity, shewing testimonies of his inward valour and setlednesse of minde, by his by-past experience, testifying he is no Novice, not taking counsell of others, when he is with resolution to rancounter a brave enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:15340:14"/>He must be of judgment to consider on the sudden his enemies designe, and timely he ought to oppose his enemy, either with few, or with many, as he finds his best advantage, And if his enemy be too far stronger than he, he must timely resolve how to make a safe retreat, being forced thereto; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his souldiers, to a fitter opportunitie: for once far ingaged, the retreat will be the more difficult to make without great losse; He ought alwayes to keepe a good reserve of fresh, brave, resolute fellowes to keepe faces on their enemies, while as others should be forced to turne backe on them: at such times, and in such occasions the resolution, the courage, and the judgment of a valourous Commander is best knowne; for many can advance rashly, that have never the wit, or judgment to retire bravely, as is ordinarily seene in many such Commanders, more stout, than wise. But lest I should enter too far to this purpose in this observation, for feare to be blamed my selfe for not retiring in time, it being a large field I entred in, let this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this march of the Leaders duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Now to retire, being quartered a mile from <hi>Lovenburgh</hi> in a Dorpe, where the Boore for feare quit his lodging, so that for want of provision we were forced to send our Suttler called <hi>Iohn Matheson,</hi> towards <hi>Loven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>: in his absence our Boyes made use of his rugge to cover their faces; in drowning of Bee-hives, the rugge being rough did lodge a number of the Bees, which, when the Boyes had drowned the Bee-hives, they threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: The Suttler comming late home we being a bed, went to rest; and putting off his cloathes, drew his rugge to cover him, but as soone as the Bees found the warmenesse of his skinne, they began to punish him for his long stay, That he was forced roaring like a mad man, to rise, and throw off his rugge, not knowing (though well he felt) the smart of his sudden enemies; we called to him, asking, if he was mad: he made no answer, but still cried the Divell had bewitch'd him, in piercing him in a thousand parts, still rubbing and scratching, crying with paine, not knowing the reason, till a candle was lighted, and seeing the Bees, threw his rugge in a draw-well; The gentle reader may judge whether, or not, he was punished, for his long stay.

serves a master, must obey. The first night our Camerades accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to our quarters. The next morning our march continuing, newes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes us, the enemy is set downe before <hi>Beysenburgh</hi> Skonce. In the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the service I must be succinct, being loath, having not seene the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to set any thing in Record, but what I know to be truth, neither can I be particular in the declaration of this service done by our countrimen, though it be generally well spoken of, over all Germany, yet I must say somewhat, and if my Report diminish from their credit, I protest it is not for lacke of love, but for want of information.</p>
               <p>The enemy hearing we were marched, and having gotten true intelligence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> how strong they lay in the Skonce, he marched ten thousand strong, and lay downe within a cannon shot of the Skonce, and having begun his lines of approach, The first night, the Major made an out-fall, where having brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly showen their courage, and resolution, returned againe without great losse.</p>
               <p>The enemy longing to be repared of this their bravade, resolved to storme the Skonce at all quarters, but finding resolution joyned with valour against him, after long fighting in vaine, he is beate off from the walles, and forced to retire at that time, with the losse of five hundred men at least. But having redoubled his forces the next time, sets on with greater fury than before, but is beate off the second time also, with losse; the third time he adventured, and, as was reported, the <hi>Scots</hi> defenders, as is well knowne, behaved themselves so well, that the enemy storming the walles, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for want of powder threw sand in their enemies eyes, knocking them downe with the Butts of muskets, having beene divers times Pell, mel through others; at last the enemy is forced to retire without effectuating any thing.</p>
               <p>Yet, gentle Reader, thinke that at such play, the losse was not onely of one side, but of both, for in defence of this Skonce being so oft stormed; that ever praise-worthy Captaine <hi>Learmond,</hi> Brother to my Lord <hi>Balcomy,</hi> being twice shot with a musket, received deaths wound, and after died at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> in perfect memory, discharging his duety Christianly to God, as he did during his life time both to God and man.</p>
               <p>For his sake, and in remembrance of his worth and valour, the whole Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Regiment did weare a black mourning Ribben: in this conflict also was killed his Lievtenant, called <hi>David Martin,</hi> an old, stout and expert Officer: many other valourous fellows, that were there, carried the true markes of their valour imprinted in their bodies, for their Countries credit. There was also, a <hi>Scottish</hi> Gentleman under the enemy, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to scale the walls, said aloud, Have with you Gentlemen, thinke not now you are on the streets of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> bravading: One of his owne Country-men thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting him through the body with a Pike, he ended there. This Skonce so well maintained by our Country-men, is to their prayse recorded at length in the <hi>Dutch Story</hi> of the <hi>Danes</hi> warres, where the curious Reader may learne more of it.

               <p>IN this observation, though the dutie be suddenly discharged, wee have much to amplifie the observation; first, by reason of the dispute that did arise betwixt his Majestie and the <hi>Colonell,</hi> for offering to Cashiere some of his Officers for alleaged insufficiency, by the information of some malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirits amongst our selves, whose names I will suppresse, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons also, letting some other tongue, not mine, divulge their shame.

He hates nor, but with cause, that is unwilling to hate at all. And it is the end that shewes the difference betwixt vertue and vice.

And as the discharge of my last dutie was Tragicall, the reasons of it I will set downe obscurely, pointing at some, that every man may examine his own conscience, that had any hand in plotting, or hatching, (by villanous policie, bred of envie,) the ruine of their <hi>Camerades,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whereof doth still awaite them with shame in a killing ambush, <hi>when the Lord of Hosts will bring to light the hidden plots of the malicious man.</hi> Here I could make some to blush, that I know plotted the fall of their <hi>Camerades.</hi> But I will be dumbe, doing by them, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> thought to have done by <hi>Mary,</hi> in seeking to cover blemishes with secrecie, lest I should wound some so with my penne, as to make them by their <hi>Camerades,</hi> to be push't out of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But I will rather shew my charitie to the delinquent, by concealing of his fault, and tell him of it in secret, than openly to divulge his mischiefe, seeing I wish his amendment before the world should know his amisse: I will not therefore be too harsh, or virulent, hoping for his penitency, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God may enlighten his conscience, that while he hath time, he may crave pardon for his hatched evill. Being sorry for the losse of these two worthy <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> of famous memory, <hi>Learmond</hi> and <hi>Dumbarre,</hi> for whose sakes, with griefe I have pointed thus obscurely at the forger of these <hi>Cavaliers</hi> fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose name I will suppresse, though my heart knows him well; and hoping time may change him to another man, I will let him be his own <hi>Beadle,</hi> and for his punishment, I would not care, though he were made to sing an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective</hi> against himselfe. But I pray God, we may be freed of the like our selves, and not to looke upon another, with a <hi>Beam'd</hi> eye, but rather to be our owne <hi>Antidot's,</hi> against all the poyson that another is able to spit upon us. Let us then have our eyes fixed upon vertue, and we shall finde a beautie, that will every day take us with some grace or other: For the world hath nothing so glorious in it as vertue, when shee rides <hi>Triumphing,</hi> as both these <hi>Cavaliers</hi> doe after death, in despight of their enemies, like <hi>Phoebean Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> praysed by their enemies, for resisting their strongest assaults, are now renowned in despight of envie, and the abusive world. And the worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Souldiers, their <hi>Associats</hi> in this memorable conflict, and hot storme, are not to be forgotten, but to be praysed for their valour. For though, as I said, by appearance to looke but on their outsides, they were the meanest in shew of our whole Regiment: yet <hi>God that gives hearts, and courage unto men,</hi> made them the instruments of our Regiments first credit in the warres of <hi>Germany.</hi> They were, I confesse, led by brave Officers, which were seconded and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by resolute and stout Souldiers, that gained victory, and credit, over their enemies in extremitie, by casting sand in their eyes. This victory puts me in mind of a prettie Story, shewing that some times the meanest things, doe helpe us much against our enemies, especially, when the LORD will blesse our fighting, with meane Instruments, fighting for us for his owne glory.</p>

                  <hi>Iovianios Pontanus</hi> reports of <hi>Alphons</hi> being resolved by assault to take in <hi>Vicaro,</hi> his Souldiers having at the first past the countersharpe and fossie, scaling the walles, the Inhabitants not able to repulse them with stones, and the enemy unawares having surprised them, that they got not leasure to arme themselves, they threw Bee hives amongst the enemy, which being disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, sticking under their Armes, and in their faces, forced the enemy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, uneffectuating his designe.

                  <hi>Ierome Osorius</hi> reports the like Story, of one Captaine <hi>Baregue,</hi> a <hi>Portugall,</hi> in his eighth Booke of <hi>Portugall,</hi> who by throwing Bee-hives on his enemies, made them to retire. The like was done of late in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> on a Fort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Bishop of <hi>Agria,</hi> neere the <hi>Turkes,</hi> which with the like helpe was relieved of a sudden assault, the Souldiers not having time to goe to their Armes, used this meane, and were saved thereby. We see then, that an immortall good name is attained unto by vertue, and not by villany.</p>
               <p>Here also in this conflict we see, notwithstanding of the enemies eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit with fury, that resolution at last prevailes; for the defenders having at first resisted their fury, the enemy with losse being forced to retire, the assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were discouraged, and the defenders incouraged. Therefore it is the dutie of a brave Captaine, that is to be assailed, to resist the beginnings well, and then the end must needs be glorious.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> In such occasions, happie is that Commander, that, in extremitie of danger, is accompanied with a few trustie friends and Souldiers: He may be assured not to be forsaken, as I have beene some times by strangers. The valiant Souldier is ever best knowne in the greatest extremitie of danger, and a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten enemy, once or twice repulsed, will be loath to continue his pursute: But he that would gaine honour, must resolve to contemne death, though ever before his eyes. Wherefore I would wish the brave Souldier to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well prepared to die, who should glory in nothing earthly more than in the tokens of his valour, being knowne they were got with credit, and not by infamie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as many unworthy Souldiers oft-times get wounds, but not with credit, while for their cowardise they are running away, yet they will vaunt amongst the unknowne, as if their wounds were credibly gotten. Here also we may see the resolution and courage of our Country-man to be prayse-worthy, though killed serving the Emperour; for though I loved him not, being mine enemy, yet I honour his memory, in serving them truely, whom he did serve, for his owne credit.</p>
               <p>Of all professions men of our profession ought to looke neerest to their credits, being attained unto by much toyle, and travell; and is lost with little. Therefore it is said, that a valourous man his credit hangs, as it were, at one haire, and one little errour or oversight in command, can obnubilate all his former glory. Circumspect then had we need to be, to preserve this credit, so dearely bought, and easily lost.</p>
               <p>We must not then looke to the outside of a man, but unto his vertues; for he that judgeth men of our profession by <hi>Physiognomie,</hi> shall oft-times be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for he that is not stout by nature in our profession, having served out a seaven yeares prentiship under such a Leader, as the magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> such a one, though not stout by nature, by frequencie of danger is made stout, as a sword, fearing nothing, not death it selfe. And Souldiers thus used with danger, for the love of their Leaders, to gaine their

favours and good opinion, will undertake the hazard of the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for their Commanders sake.

               <head>The fift Observation.</head>
               <p>HEre we have represented unto us, the mutability, of humane estates, and especially of warres, the wheele turning, we that looked to go forwards, were forced to retire, humane affaires being opposed as a marke to all the shots of discontentment; so that we ought not to rejoyce too much in a calme, or prove faint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hearted in a storme. We reade of a Roman Captaine, who did tremble being victorious, as being uncertaine how long his good fortune might continue. And the Romans (as <hi>Scipio</hi> tould the Ambassadors of <hi>Antiochus</hi>) were not puft up by victory, nor cast downe by losse. And <hi>Augustine</hi> said, this life of ours, was doubtfull, blind, miserable, made of a floud of humors, ebbing, and flowing.</p>
               <p>Notwitstanding whereof, it is the duety of a wise Commander to make use of the time, by diligent fore-sight, and wise deliberation, to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and others so long as he may, and not to be dejected, at every buffet unconstant fortune doth give him.</p>
               <p>As this old Generall his resolution at this time, having an enemy before him, was good, the enemy coming also behinde him, tooke his march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, and did come fortunately to his wished forecast, putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his Army in assurance. This old Generall was of good experience, but not fortunate, neither were they fortunate whom he served, though of invincible courage, and of great understanding in warres: for, to give his Majesty of <hi>Denmarke</hi> his due, no man breathing, I thinke, carries a stouter heart then he doth: Yet I have seene his Majestie far dejected in spirit, through great losse, and no wonder, as you shall heare more particularly set downe in the seventh observation.</p>
               <p>In this Retreat we were not voide of feare, but suspecting the worst, every man bethinking himselfe of his best safety, to eschew an appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t overthrow, a thing at all times most dangerous in an Army. Our Horsemen, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of a retreat by water, and consequently the losse of their Horses, for want of shipping, and which was more, they feared the losse of their goods, and their owne imprisonment: but it was in vaine they should torment themselves before hand, for things without their powers to eschew. But they ought rather to have made use of the present, and to have foreseene the future so far as lay in them, resolving patiently against all crosses and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the event to God.</p>
               <p>Here also I did observe the inconvenience that comes to souldiers, through eating much flesh without salt, or bread, which did bring diseases in the Leager, so that many died of pestilence and flux: but of our Nation fewest, for to speake truth, I never did see more durable men against all Toyle, travell and tediousnesse, than they were.</p>
               <p>Likewise I did observe first here, that the Townes of Germanie are best <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> friends ever to the masters of the field, in flattering the victorious, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of the loser,<note place="margin">H.

               <p>When we are happie in the spring-tide of abundance, and in the rising floud of plenty, then the world would be our servants: but when these plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant waters fall to ebbing, then men looke upon us, at a distance.

               <p>HAving remained five weekes in this Leager, during which time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was making, for the transportation of the Army unto <hi>Holsten</hi>; seeing the Emperors forces come from <hi>Silesia,</hi> and <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> Army were joyned very strong, which barr'd our passage from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Holsten</hi> by land, which made us ship our Army for going unto <hi>Heligenhoven</hi>; and from thence to the passe of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> in <hi>Holsten,</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ly secured there, till the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rest of his Majesties forces might joyne with us.

               <p>Having all safely landed, at <hi>Heligenhoven</hi>: we matched towards the passe of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> where arrived before night, our Leager was drawne out into the most convenient part, for maintaining of the passe, where the first night we begin to worke in the Trenches, and continue working the whole night, and the next day, till noone, that the enemy was seene marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the passe, in full Battalions of Horse, and foote, which before three of the clocke had planted Batteries, to play with Cannon on our Leager and to force a passage over the passe, which our Generall perceiving, gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to double the Guards both of Horse, and foote; As also strongly to <hi>Barricade</hi> the passe, and to cast up in the night a redout before the passe: the night drawing on being darke, silence was over all, on both sides of the passe.</p>
               <p>But the day cleering, the Guardes on both sides begin the skirmish, the Cannons on both sides begin to discharge, the Horse Guards charge one another, till ours were forced to give ground; the foote Guards beginning to fight, the reliefes were commanded on both sides to second their owne, the service growing hot; and the passe in danger of losing.</p>

               <p>THe wise Ancients said, it was the principall thing in all things to looke unto the end: but it is the propertie of our Nation to be over wise behinde the hand; as we were after the service, having lost thereat a great many of our friends, we ought to have beene the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect againe. But our condition is so, that no experience can make us wise, till we be soare beaten by others, and then we will grow kinde one to another.</p>
               <p>Amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> none was admitted to the dignity of a Commander, till first he had past a prentiship under a brave Generall, where he was taught the use of Armes, and Novices durst not be so bould, as to intrude themselves in this honourable profession, in any degree, to take command on them, without long practise, and experience, as was requisite to undergo a charge in so high a calling, and of such importance, as to leade others: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, the ground worke or foundation of Military discipline once well laid, then they were suffered to advance by degrees unto high charges, proposing recompence, and reward unto those, that did merite, and to that effect, they invented severall sorts of Crownes, for the reward of their travells, and wisdome: Amongst others, the Crowne called <hi>Obsidionall</hi> was ordained, for those that entred first the besieged places, being of the most esteeme of all crownes, which was made of the Roote of the Herbes, or graine, that had taken Roote within the place besieged; also those that first scaled the walls, were wont to get a crowne of the Herbe Woodbinde, or <hi>Parietaria,</hi> Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory growing on the walls, and those that first èntred the enemies Ports by

force, had also a crowne given unto them; And the crowne <hi>Castean</hi> was ordained, for him that first entred the enemies Trenches, and brake the <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sades,</hi> making way to enter unto the enemies Leager: Also a crowne was given unto those of the <hi>Navall</hi> Armie, that first entred the Enemies Gallies, or ships on Sea; this Crowne was made of gold, representing the Combat, and the Generall a foote, being victorious, had given him a crowne made of Hats, and Miters, and triumphing in a chariot, he carried a Hat made of Lawrell. At last, these crownes were made of Gold, laid over with preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones. They had also given them, for recompence of their travels, Chaines, and Bracelets, all to the end they might accustome themselves to vertue, and to the discipline and toyle of warres. Who then would not desire to be of this society, to get a crowne for well doing? On the contrary, Cowards, Poultrons, and Effeminate persons, were disdained, degraded and put off charge, while the valiant were honoured, advanced, and recompenced, as the Turke doth practise to this day; to the disgrace of Christians negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting discipline, till they are overthrowne. It should then be the duety of brave Generalls to make choice of brave and vertuous Commanders, not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of whom they come, but where, and how long, have they practised to be vertuous. Then we see here, what was the custome of the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in choosing the vertuous, that had past their prentiship, and not Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be Commanders: for we see, that the love of the Publique brings honour, pleasure and profit to the vertuous, who thinke on it sincerely; But those, that would raise their fortunes by the ruine of others, shall never prosper.</p>
               <p>The reason of our coming to this passe of <hi>Owldenburgh</hi> was, to have stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in safety from our enemies, till we might joyne with our friends; but the Enemy prevented us, in coming betwixt us and our friends: then there was no remedy, but to hold him up at the passe, till our Army might joyne with us, and of this intention we resolved for best, to maintaine the passe, as we did, till Ammunition grew scant, and then we were forced to retire to our ships.</p>
               <p>This King is powerfull by Sea, and is mightily well furnished of all things necessary for war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, of Armes, Artillery, Ammunition, victualls, money, and what else is requisit to set forwards a warre; and, which is more, a noble, and a liberall Master, as ever I did serve.</p>
               <p>Here also I observe the slownesse of our <hi>Generall,</hi> that did not patronize the passe some few dayes before the Enemies coming, that it might have beene fortified: for it was no time for us to fortifie the passe in the night, when the enemie came before us, and the next day, we were not suffered to worke, being otherwise imployed. Another oversight was, that our <hi>Generall</hi> did not know certainly, how we were provided of Ammunition, for though we had Lead in abundance, we wanted Bullets in the time of need. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Generall</hi> was accused, after our comming into <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and the blame was found in the Commissary, that had the charge of the Artillery, <hi>Et jure,</hi> for they were all Rogues, and deceived his Majestie, that trusted them too much. Neverthelesse, I cannot excuse the <hi>Generall</hi> of being ignorant of the provisions ordained for the Armie; seeing he was certaine of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies comming: for it is most sure, if we had been provided of Ball, we were sufficiently bastant to have kept the passe against our Enemy, since it came not in the Enemies power, till we had left it voluntarily in the night. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15340:19"/>
enemy also retiring from us, hearing the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> forces were coming behinde him, of intention to joyne with us. I observed also, that the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> was too slow, in the encouragement of his Officers and Souldiers, having delayed his exhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But never men went on service with more chearfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, than this Regiment did, going as it were, to welcome death, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the passage unto life, especially fighting in a good Cause, against the enemies of the Daughter of our King, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for whose sake, our Magnificke and Royall Master did undertake the warres, and for her sake, we resolved to have followed such a couragious Leader, as the Earth this day affords none stouter, as mine eyes did witnesse divers times: And for her sake, I perswade my selfe, our noble <hi>Colonell</hi> did ingage his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and adventured his person, to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; for a man well resolved perceives no danger neither doth any thing seeme difficult unto him, that may import his credit. And the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, in my opinion, as they are in measure remisse, not seeming prodigall of their lives, though resolutely adventurous; and for me, I love a man that is modestly valiant, that stirres not till he must needs: for he that is conscious of his inward courage, is confident to shew it to the world, when he will; but a man prodigall of life, oft-times indangers himselfe and others; for though he have courage to lead them on, he lacks wit and discretion to bring them off, in case of eminent danger. And at such times, as I condemne him that runnes away first, I cannot allow of him, that, out of ostentation, will stay after all his <hi>Camerades</hi> are gone, till he yeeld himselfe prisoner, or die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily there, where he might have preserved himselfe with honour for a better occasion. I have also observed, that a base fellow hath been killed running away, when a valiant Souldier stood to it, and came off with credit.</p>
               <p>I did also remarke the invincible courage and resolution of that worthy Gentleman Lievtenant <hi>Rosse,</hi> who having lost his legge, wished for a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or Treen legge, lying on the ground, as the example of pittie, that he, who was indued with such courage, and Christian resolution, had not time in the warfare, to have given the world greater proofe of his valour.</p>
               <p>Here also I must condemne those arrogant Spirits, who contemne <hi>God</hi> and Fate, that while as being on service, and being hurt, may retire with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and on the contrary will be so foolishly valiant, as to stay on a second hurt, worse than the first; as became that day of a young Gentleman of my name, and kindred, who being shot in the Arme with a musket bullet, would not at my desire retire, but slighting his wound stayed on service, till he was shot dead in the head. <hi>David Monro</hi> Ensigne, being shot through the body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> above the left pappe, went a little aside, till he was drest, and returned againe to his Station, keeping his Colours in his hand, till night, before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, never fainting with his wound, an example of rare courage, and of great strength of bodie, neither did he ever thereafter keepe bed or lodging one houre, more than ordinary, for all this hurt.</p>

We see oft-times, that those that are feeblest themselves, are most ready to speake <hi>Derogatively</hi> of others. Here I might inferre divers instances, yet I will inferre, and onely point, for the present a little at those unluckie dispositions, that cannot endure any but themselves to be well thought of, for if one be justly praised, or advanced in recompence of his vertue, they will presently dismount his vertues, and stabbe him to the heart, <hi>obnubilating</hi> his brightest glory, with a <hi>Butt</hi> of <hi>Detraction</hi> bred of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, nastie indeficient minds devising spots, where they find them not, a base office to make his tongue whip a worthy man.

And he should be holden as such a one himselfe, till he brought his evidence; as the custome was of old: and for my selfe, I never found better remedie against them, than to disdaine them, as coming about the eares of a deafe man, that did not heare them, and this I found to be the best bridle, to curbe their tongues, for in the end he would hold his peace, and turne his tongue another way: but I must confesse, the tongue of a <hi>Calumniatour</hi> hath sometimes offended me, and grieved me much, but they profited me, in making me the more circumspect and diligent, in thinking on all circumstances, that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve my credit and reputation, to be avenged on them. And with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe,</hi> which I know to be true, I will conclude this point, things that grieve us, should lead us to repentance, seeing that which destroyes, instructs; and <hi>God</hi> oft-times, cleanses the inward man, by the outward, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course, leading us to our wished for Harbour: for there is no such great discommoditie, but brings commoditie with it; for those that are stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Scorpions,</hi> though at first it be very dangerous, yet at last, the hurt being cured by convenient remedies, it brings fruit with advantage, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught, neither Flie, Bee, nor Wasp can harme those thus cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> To conclude then this point of Detraction, men should be circumspect, what to determine of other mens actions, being on service: for I am of the opinion, that in time of hot service, no man doth remember the halfe of his owne actions, much lesse to remarke the actions of others, except some
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15340:20"/>
circumstances, which he may remember. Therefore we should be loath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily to bring our selves in question, in speaking evill of others: for commonly, at such times, cowards, or feeble men, that are not in action themselves, see more than others that are better employed: yet the feeble man is ever readiest to detract, for to prevent his owne insufficiency, too well knowne to others. But after this dayes service, our detractions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions also, were almost taken away, being companions of the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, against our enemies: And I inferred this discourse of detraction, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that at such service commonly men doe speake, as they doe favour, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as their envie carries them; which fault as being too much in use in all estates, especially amongst Souldiers, I would wish from my heart that it might be eschewed.</p>
               <p>Here also I observed, that want of circumspection in command, especially over young Souldiers, as we had to command, doe many times cause great inconveniences to follow, as was seen in the blowing up of our powder, whereby our <hi>Colonell</hi> was burnt in the face, and many more. Here I might speake somewhat of the hurt and inconveniency, that doth happen many times by Cannon, and powder, but I will referre it to a fitter place, to be spoken of.</p>
               <p>Likewise I cannot here omit to speake somewhat of the resolution of some particular Souldiers, that were hurt on this service. <hi>Hector Monro</hi> of <hi>Cool,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> being shot through one of his feet, was desired to goe off, who answered, it was not time, till first he had emptied his Bandeliers against his enemies, before which time he was shot through the other foot also, and then was not able to come off alone, without helpe of others, and some of his <hi>Camerades,</hi> which helpt him off, going farther with him than he thought needfull for his safetie, or their credit, he wished them to retire, and discharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties against the enemy, as they had sufficiently done towards him. <hi>Hugh Murrey</hi> being desired in time of hot service, to goe and take off his brother being killed; he lacking powder said, going towards his dead brother, I will first emptie my brothers Bande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iers, as I have done mine owne, to be revenged on his enemies, before I take him off: in the meane time, he was shot in the eye himselfe, and that wondrous favourably, the Bullet some few dayes after having come forth at his nose, which is most true, though seeming incredible. This day also I observed an ill custome too common to all Generals, that they make most use, in time of desperate service, of those that doe best serve them, and when once they have experience of their valour, they never omit to employ them on the most dangerous exploits; and for reward, they onely doe commend their valour, when others are scarce remembred at all.</p>
               <p>Here also I did see, that on hot service, nothing can be more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> than the getting of a timely reliefe, as we did get of the rest of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, for having long smarted under the mercy of Cannon and Musket, in hot service, so that a Souldier was not able to handle his Musket for feare of burning, having shot so oft, till his shoulder did ake; who can thinke, but to such a one a reliefe was welcome: truely I thinke no man that hath his foot in the fire, but would gladly take it out: yet I perswade my selfe, there were some here, who would suffer to burne before they retired with disgrace, or discredit, their honour being so deare unto them. The best proofes a Souldier can inferre of his vali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t courage, are his wounds got
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15340:21"/>
with credit, not running away, and the best exhortation a Leader can give common Souldiers is, to shew himselfe couragious, and then, without words, with a signe, some will follow him, in imitating his example.</p>
               <p>Here also I did observe, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> are not the best Souldiers in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of danger, though I confesse for the discharge of all dutie, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very obedient, till it come to extremitie, and then commonly they make a Cloake of discontentment, and call for money, as they did this day. Likewise I cannot say, but Horse-men are usefull many times, as they were here; yet in my opinion, in their service, they are not to be paralleld to foot: For at the in-taking of Townes, and in hilly and mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that are straight by nature, they are not usefull, neither can they doe but little service, yet for their great charges, they are much harder to be entertained: Therefore my choice shall be ever, as most credible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on foote, and if I were worthy to advise a King, or a Generall follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warres, I would wish him to esteeme more of his foot Officers, than of his horse: then fewer should serve on horsebacke, and more on foote, and as his Charges should be lesse, his profit should be the more, his Armie the stronger, his Countrey lesse spoyl'd, his contribution to maintaine his Armie, the better payd, his treasure richer, his Victories more frequent, and more durable, his Conquest the better maintained.</p>
               <p>This I dare presume to affirme to be all true, out of my little experience, and which is more, all the time I have served, where I have heard one fault imputed to a body of foote, I could instance ten defects in our Horsemens service: for the worst sort of them being too much given to plowndring, makes them neglect their duties, which fault also is too Common amongst many of their Leaders; though I have knowne some honest men amongst them free from this imputation: and for a King, or Prince, that must defend his Countrie, by sea, (as our noble Mr: the King of <hi>Dennarke</hi> was) I would advise him, as unprofitable for his service and country, not to encertaine strangers in this kinde, so being their charges would far surmount the benefit that could redound by their service, yet I cannot say, but the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> his Regiment was the only Regiment under the King at this time, that did best service, which was ever praise worthy.</p>
               <p>Likewise, I have found by experience that those who fight best in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> have ever the best of it, though they chance to suffer losse, if it come to a retreat, commonly they are most respected and come first off, as we did at this time, and it is ever better to fight well, and to retire timely, then for a man to suffer himselfe to be taken prisoner, as many were that morning after our retreat: and in occasions, I rather choose to die honourably, then to live and to be prisoner to a churlish fellow, that perhaps would keepe me in perpetuall bondage, as many brave men are kept; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, at my taking, to be scurvely used, being stript naked by a Villaine, and then, if I lacked monies about me, to be cut and carved, and at last, poorely put to death, being naked without Armes to defend my selfe. My advise then is to him that cannot resolve to fight well, that he resolve accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his station, and charge, to be well furnished of money, not onely about him, but also, to have money to the best in a sure place, and in sure hands to maintaine him, being prisoner, and to pay his ransome; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, let him resolve to remaine in perpetuall bondage, except some noble friend or other have compassion on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:15340:21"/>Likewise I would advise all worthy Souldiers, and Officers going on service, if they can, never to want some monies about them, that, if they chance to come as prisoners in undiscreete hands, they may cast a bone in the doggs teeth, to curry favour of the cruell curre.</p>
               <p>I did also observe here, that continency is a vertue very necessary for a Souldier, for abstaining from many inordinate appetites, that followe his profession, that he may the better suffer hunger, cold, thirst, nakednesse, travell, toyle, heate, and what else patiently, never mutining for any defect: for it is the greatest victory we can attaine unto, to overcome our selves, and our appetites. Likewise I did observe, that Kings, and Generalls are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteous to Cavaliers, while as they stand in neede of their service, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> making their use of them, but the occasion once past, oft times they do looke on Cavaliers at a distance, as if they had not imployment for them; which should teach Cavaliers, to take their time with reason of their Masters also; and then they might care the lesse for them (being strangers or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Kings) while as, they would disdaine them, having still a sure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate to their owne King, and Master. Here also I found that a friend in neede was better then gold, for had not the Duke of <hi>Wymar</hi> beene our friend we had bin left behinde at the passe, and beene prisoners the next day with the rest of the Army. It is therefore ever best to do well, come after what may; for vertue in despight of envy, will not want a reward: And a stout Marriner that hath ridden out the storme with losse, as we did this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in the calme, when it comes; and he is said to merit the Crowne, that hath fought valiantly.</p>
               <p>It is also very necessary, that at such service, as this was, if we have time, that we be carefull, to bring off our Camerades bodies killed on service, that died honourably before their enemies, to be laid in the bed of honour, in burying their bodies, as becomes Christians. We are also tied in duety to our Camerades, that were with us in danger, if either they be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or mutilated, to care for their safeties, so far as lieth in our power: And we must not preferre the safety of our owne bodies, to the publique weale of our Camerades, and countrimen dead or living, but we ought, with the hazard of our owne lives, to bring off the dead and hurt.</p>
               <p>An example of this duety, we have in the person of the President of <hi>Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sangue</hi> treating of the <hi>Iewes</hi> law, that did command, that the bodies of their dead enemies should not lie unburied. <hi>Caesar</hi> caused to be buried the head of his enemy <hi>Pompey,</hi> and wept at his death, as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in his fift booke, and sixt Chapter. <hi>Hercules</hi> is thought to have bin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> the first that ordained to bury the bodies of those killed on service, and <hi>David</hi> calls them blessed, that were so thankefull, as to have buried <hi>Saul. Indas Macchabie</hi> did cause to bury the bodies of the enemy killed in battaile, and <hi>Alexander</hi> restored unto the mother of <hi>Darius</hi> the dead bodie of her sonne, <hi>Hanniball</hi> did burie, the body of his enemy <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as <hi>Valerius</hi> affirmes. It is also expedient, for the common-weale, that the bodies of the dead be buried: and <hi>Leonard Darez</hi> reports that <hi>Cyrus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> did recommend their funeralls to their friends, as Lievetenant <hi>Rosse</hi> did his to his Captaine and me, which we performed in the best manner we could, for the time. If <hi>Pagans</hi> had such regard to their burialls, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should be more carefull, whose bodies sometimes were the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the holy Spirit, and of the immortall soule created to Gods owne Image.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:15340:22"/>Here also I would report the commandement that we reade in the second chapter verse 23. of the fourth booke of <hi>Esdras. Where thou findest the dead, put them in the grave</hi> (with a certaine marke) <hi>and I will give thee the first seate in my resurrection:</hi> and the wise Ancients said, men should looke unto the end. My exhortation then is to all my worthy countrimen, and women, that were interessed in our losses in this dayes service, to consider, that when these gentlemen, and Cavaliers were borne, that they were marked and ordained to die honourably, fighting in the good cause; and for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Kings daughter, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her distressed Royall Issue, under the magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> our Master, who for her Majesties libertie, did hazard not onely his life, but his crowne; let them then that are interessed, as said is, in this our losse consider againe, that they died with great honour, and reputation, seeing they live eternally in their fame, having laid downe their lives, as servants of the publique, if not for their country, yet at least, as cannot be denied, for the liberty of their Kings Royall Issue: It then became them well, to have died standing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> Therefore those mothers, friends, or Sisters, are to be condemned, that mourne for them that live (after their death) in their fame, and though their griefe be great, let them shed no teares, for feare it become of them, as became of that Ancient woman called <hi>Vicia,</hi> mother to <hi>Futius Geminus,</hi> who was killed at <hi>Rome,</hi> for having wept at the death of her sonne, that had lost his life in the publique service, as reporteth <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his 6 booke of his <hi>Annals,</hi> and our Saviour in the Evangelist Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth forbid the widdow to weepe for her sonne that was dead, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> saith, <hi>Brethren I would not have you ignorant of the estate of those that are asleepe,</hi> to the end you do not over-mourne, as those do, that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope. Therefore, let us forbeare all teares for those departed, and if we should mourne, let us mourne with teares, even those most pretious teares for sinne, these are the Christian teares, that should be shed from our hearts, to reconcile us unto God, those teares are as the bloud of the soule, hurt and wounded with the sense, and feeling of our sinnes, before God these are the teares, that drawe Gods mercy upon us, as <hi>David</hi> cried unto God in the 36 <hi>Psalme. Thou hast counted my wanderings, and put my teares in thy bottle, are they not in thy Register?</hi> Therefore though we be grieved at the losse of our friends, and at the losse of the day; Yet ô God, make us thankfull unto thee, for our deliverance, that we may rejoyce at our owne safety.</p>

               <p>HAving thus past the day at <hi>Owldenburg,</hi> the night (the friend of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) coming on, what we durst not have done by day, being favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the mooneshine, when all were wearied with hot service and toyle in the day, begun to take rest, and refreshment by their fires, in the Leager all Guards relieved, and centries set out, being all of us, after a great storme in a quiet calme, we begin to take our retreat to the water:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15340:22"/>
our Generall being full of feare and suspition goes before, and our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell also; we follow, having the <hi>avant-Guard</hi> according to our Orders for going a ship-board, which orders were willingly obeyed, perceiving the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was to follow, and in consideration that long before the Lievetenant Colonell Sr. <hi>Patrick Mac-Gey</hi> and Captaine <hi>Forbesse</hi> being hurt had retired for their safeties towards the Isle of <hi>Feamor,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Denmark</hi> to be cured. I supplying the place of the <hi>Major,</hi> our Regiment orderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from the enemy, Captaine <hi>Mac-Kenyee</hi> and my brother <hi>Obstell,</hi> who before were companions in the day of danger, in the night did march toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leading off the Regiment to be secured, and I bringing up the Reare, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with some other Officers; we had no doubt of our safe retreate: the whole army being behind us made us halte the oftner, taking paines to bring up our hurt and sicke men; we marched but softly, <hi>Py a Pyano</hi>: at last by ten a clocke of the night we arrived on the shore, and drew up in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell attending the Colonells command for shipping, who had gone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto the Roade amongst the ships, to provide shipping, but could get no obedience, the feare was so great amongst the marriners; having heard the roaring and thundring of cannon and muskets in the day, feare so possest them all, that they lacked hands to worke and hearts to obey: and the Colonell coming a shore without bringing of ships to receive us, we made use of the time, our Camerades the horsemen having come before us, who ever begin confusion, were without orders, forcing ships to take in their horses, and had already possessed the whole Bulworke and shipping with their horse, I asking my Colonells leave, drew our whole Colours in front, and our Pikes charged after them; our musketiers drawne up in our reare by divisions, fortifying our reare in case the Enemy should assault us in our Reare, and then I advanced with our Colours alongst the peere, our Pikes charged we cleered the Peere of the Horsemen, suffring them to save themselves from drowning, where they found the Channell most shallow, and advancing thus to the end of the Peere, we seazed upon one ship with some horses in it, where we set our Colours, and making that ship launch off a little from the shore for feare of being aground, having mann'd the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat with an Officer, and some musketiers, we sent to force other ships out of the Roade to launch in and serve us, untill such time as the most part of our Regiment were shipped except some Villaines, who were gone a plundering in the Towne; but not knowing the danger they were in, they stayed all night from us and were taken by the enemy the next morning. Thus having shipped our men we were forced to quit our Horses and baggage: the Officers that were most diligent, as Captaine <hi>Monro</hi> and my brother <hi>Obstell,</hi> were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied the whole night ferrying souldiers from the shoare, especially the sicke and wounded, who were not able to helpe themselves: In the morning I shipped three boatefulls of wounded and sicke men, till at the last I was beaten from the shoare by the enemies horsemen. And my Colonells ship being under saile layd up to the winde, attending my comming with the last fraught, and then we followed the Route of the fleete, seeing the enemies Army drawne up in battell, horse, foote and Cannon, and our Army of Foote and horse opposite unto them; where I did see six and thirty Cornets of horse, being full troupes without loosing of one Pistoll give themselves prisoners in the enemies mercy, whereof the most part tooke service: As also I did see above five Regiments of foote, being forty Colours, follow
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15340:23"/>
their examples, rendring themselves and their colours without loosing of one musket. Iudge then, judicious reader, though we were sorrie for the losse of our Army, if we were glad of our owne safeties: I thinke we were, and praised be God with no discredit to us, or our Nation; for none can be blamed that doth what he is commanded: thus following our course the third morning we arrived before <hi>Flinesborrie,</hi> where our Randezvouz was appointed, and having sent a shoare for some victualls, whereof we stood in great neede, no man was blamed to provide for himselfe at such time, when the whole Country was to be left to our enemies mercy.</p>
               <p>His Majesty being there, after hearing the certainty of his great losse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to secure <hi>Denmark</hi>; having lost <hi>Holsten</hi> &amp; <hi>Yewtland</hi> we got orders with expedition all of us to ship, and to hold forth our course unto <hi>Assens</hi> in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> where his Majesty promised to meete us to dispose further of us, for his Majesties service, and we making saile follow our course and orders. At our parting the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> with his Regiment did come thither the enemy at his heeles, and he at spurres following the King, till he had gotten the passe made good betwixt <hi>Holsten,</hi> and <hi>Yewtland,</hi> and his Majestie once safely arrived in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> quitting <hi>Yewtland</hi> unto the enemy follows the King unto <hi>Denmark</hi>: We landed at <hi>Assens</hi> of our Regiment eight hundred Souldiers besides one hundred and fifty wounded and sicke men, and being put in good quarters, we rest us, leaving the enemy to rest in the fat land of <hi>Holsten</hi> and <hi>Yewtland,</hi> having a good broad and deepe fossey betwixt us, we were by Gods mercy secured.</p>

               <head>The seventh Observation.</head>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> HEre we see that the losse of a day, is the losse of a great part of his Majesties Kingdome: for the losse of his Armie was the losse of <hi>Holsten</hi> and <hi>Yewtland,</hi> so that here below we have no assured estate, from the King to the Clowne, whereof we have frequent examples in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, which should make none of all estates to glory too much, either in their peace, or prosperitie, as the <hi>Holsteners</hi> did: for though now thou be in peace and securitie, as they were before this day, thou oughtst to looke unto thy selfe, and to prevent the worst better than they did.</p>
               <p>Therefore to discharge a part of my dutie to my Country-men and friends, I minde here somewhat to touch the misery of man through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy of humane affaires. <hi>Isidore</hi> writes, that it was the custome at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> in the dayes of the Emperours Coronation, while as he sate in his Throne, a <hi>Mason</hi> came to him, presenting stones, that he might choose which he would to make his Tombe of, thereby putting him in minde of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy of humane fragilitie. We reade also of a simple Citizen in <hi>Italy,</hi> that became one of the most powerfull men in <hi>Italy,</hi> and coming to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of a Prince, being thirtie yeares, without interruption, in great prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, tranquillitie and peace, yea ever in the most dangerous time of warre, and his Children raised to high honours and dignities; this man thinking himselfe to be above the winde, a whirle-winde of warres, unlooked for, came on him and his from <hi>Florence,</hi> that he with his wife and children were taken prisoners, and sent to <hi>Millane,</hi> his goods confiscated, he was shut up in close prison, and died miserably: the <hi>Venetians</hi> appropriating unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all his money he had in Bancke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:15340:23"/>We reade also of one <hi>Francis Force,</hi> that through his heaping up of wealth came to be made Duke of <hi>Millane,</hi> and after that intitled himselfe to be the Sonne of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the Oracle of the Princes of <hi>Italie,</hi> being many yeares in prosperitie, was afterwards chased from his goods, as the <hi>Holsteners</hi> were then, but having recovered his lands and goods againe, he grew so insolent and proud of his prosperitie, that at last he was taken prisoner, and was kept till death in prison; mockt of the whole world, for his pride and greedinesse. The same Author <hi>Guicchardine</hi> in his seventh Booke in the 157, doth record of the <hi>Bentioles</hi> chased out of <hi>Bullon,</hi> where they long were in peace, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Millane</hi> being forbidden to receive them, the chiefest of them died of griefe, having never before tasted the Cup of adversitie: And so became of sundry in <hi>Denmark,</hi> that for feare did send away their goods by shipping unto the <hi>Craggs</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> to be kept there, whereof some were lost by Sea, and the owners afterward died of griefe, not having the courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe patiently their Crosse. <hi>The Lord of his mercie preserve my Countrey and Friends from the like Visitation.</hi> Let no man therefore flatter himselfe with prosperitie, riches, or honour, as <hi>Agapetus</hi> adviseth us in his <hi>Politique Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes.</hi> All are borne alike, come of dust, our glory then should be of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not in riches, prosperitie, or honours; for we should esteeme of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much, as of <hi>Gods</hi> judgements, praying his Majestie continually to divert them from us, esteeming more of our soules, than of deceivable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof the possession is uncertaine, as was seene at this time, both in <hi>Holsten</hi> and <hi>Yewtland,</hi> their riches went faster away than they came, and though they could have enjoyed them, yet at last they were forced to leave them to others. Since therefore we can carry nothing with us, but our good name, let us be ever carefull of that, discharging, so farre as we may, with a good Conscience our dutie to God and man, and this Heritage we cannot be robbed of, though the world should turne to nothing.</p>
               <p>Here we see this <hi>magnanimous</hi> King his estate falling for his love to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Niece, the distressed Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Children, seeing her bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from her Kingdome by the sword of her enemies, he hazards the losse of his Crowne and person, to get her restored, bringing the sword of his enemies within his owne Countrey, fortune having crossed him abroad: yet for all this, this <hi>Magnanimous</hi> King was not dejected, but with a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious resolution makes use of the time, retiring to one corner of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to prevent the losse of the whole, being naturally fortified with a broad graffe, as the Isle of <hi>Britaine,</hi> being strong of shipping, having his Majestie of <hi>Britaine</hi> to friend, and the Estates of the united Provinces, he was carelesse of the Emperours forces by Sea or Land, not being able to harme his Majestie more than they did.</p>
               <p>By this example we may see, what advantage our Soveraigne, the Kings Majestie of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> hath over all forraigne Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> through the scituation of his Dominions, being mightie in power of men, shipping, and money, is able to make warre abroad, where he pleaseth, and to make a safe Retreat, when he pleaseth, being Master at Sea, as he can easily be, terrifying his enemies with one Armie abroad, and a strong Armie at Sea, he can offend whom he will, and retire when he list, forcing all <hi>Europe</hi> to be in feare of him, and his Majestie in feare of none, but of the King of Kings. The Lord therefore preserve his Majestie, his Children and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, from the power of forraigne enemies; and I wish a great part of my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15340:24"/>
friends and Country-men were so farre addicted, to seeke the restitution of her Majestie of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Royall Issue, as I am; the warres then should never end, till they were restored, and I avenged of my friends bloud, and mine owne, shed in the quarrell.</p>
               <p>Here also I did observe his Majesties circumspection, in preventing the <hi>Emperialists,</hi> in coming by water unto his Kingdome, having beset all <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with strong <hi>Garrisons</hi> of Horse and Foote, which kept strong guards, and good watch by night and by day, at such places on the Coast, as was most in danger of the enemies over-setting, till in the end, the enemy was forced to retire his Armie, leaving but a few men in Garrison in the Townes, which lay on the Coast, which Garrisons his Majestie with shipping did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten visite, to their great hurt, with strong parties, retiring againe, having done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his exployt, at his pleasure in safetie. This <hi>Magnanimous</hi> King, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deserved to have been worthily thought of, and well spoken of, for his noble enterprizing of the warre, being Leader and Generall in so good a cause. And though the successe was not answerable, I dare be bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, it was none of his Majesties fault, for his Majestie not onely bestowed much in advancing of it, but also did hazard himselfe and his Crowne in maintaining of it. Neverthelesse, there are alwayes some Cynicks, that doe barke at his Majesties proceedings, without reason; where we may see, that no man, no nor Kings themselves can escape the lash of censure, and none can eschew to be traduced by the ignominious aspersions of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent tongue. Therefore it is good to doe well, and then we need not care what is said; except the sayer put his name to his assertion, and then he may be made to foote his Boule, in maintaining of it, or unworthily to refuse it. Here also I did observe, that no Armour nor passe could remove the Generalls feare; for having once imagined the enemies over-coming, he was never fully setled, till he was safe a ship-board. And therefore I did see at this time that verified, that when man distrusteth God, it is then just with God to leave man to himselfe: for after our Retreat, being on the Roade, the Generall, being thronged in his owne Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not command a Ship to transport his servants, till I forced a Ship for his Excellencies service; which should teach all men in Authoritie, while they have command, to command with discretion, lest the wheele should turne, and then they should be beholding to those, whom before they commanded.</p>
               <p>Here also I did see mutinous Souldiers well rewarded, and it may be sooner than they thought, for the day before those that call'd for money when they were commanded to goe on service, the next day I being a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board did see them turne slaves unto their enemies being taken prisoners, robbed both of Cloaths and money, and kept long in bondage, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to serve against their Conscience, such was their folly in calling for money when it was no time to tell it. Having at this time left our horses and baggage to our enemies, I observed somewhat on the love of men to those beasts, and the love of beasts to their Masters, as worth the noting, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the kindnesse that should be entertained amongst Christians, and men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of one profession; my brother <hi>Obstell,</hi> of worthy memory, had a Horse of our owne Country-breed, that was so familiarly acquainted with his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and with the noise and touch of Drumme, that the whole day on our march, when his Master went a foote, he unled followed the Drumme a little aside from the Company, halting when they halted, and moving when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15340:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they moved fast or slow. Another Horse I left, that being in <hi>Wismer Leager,</hi> having rode out one day to a wood, halfe a mile from the Leager, to cause to cut timber, leaving my Horse standing alone, and my Cloake on my Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, a Rutter coming by, unknowne to me and my fellowes, steales my Horse away, who finding himselfe in strangers hands, skips loose, and runs to our Leager, being chas't and hunted at by more than a hundred Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, out-runs them all unto the trenches, and running through the Leager, stands before my Tent, my Camerades wondering what became of mee, thinking I had been killed by the Horsemen, come and make search for me, and finding me, tell me of my Horse.</p>
               <p>These beasts I have remembred for their love, for which I will set downe some particulars concerning the addresse, fidelitie, and bountie of some Horses whereof I have formerly read. <hi>Plinie</hi> protests their prayses cannot be expressed. We reade of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> that were so much redoubted of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that in their warres, they would at spurres, runne their Horses in middest of their enemies, without a bridle to governe them. In the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Cannes, Hanniball</hi> returning the next day on the place of Battaile, to looke more narrowly to the place, a <hi>Romane</hi> Knight halfe dead, hearing the noise of people, lifted up his head, of purpose to have spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but his voice failing, died: with the last gaspe, by <hi>Hanniball</hi> there roade a <hi>Numidian</hi> on that dead Knights Horse, who knowing his Master, begun to move his eares, to bray, and to leape, and rebound with such fury, till he casts the <hi>Numidian</hi> to ground, runnes through the dead bodies, and stands before his dead Master, and leaning downe his necke and shoulders, sheweth the desire he had that his Master should leape on him, to the great astonishment of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and his followers. We reade also in the warres of <hi>Germanie,</hi> in the yeare 1176 the Dukes of <hi>Saxon</hi> forced by Armes to submit themselves to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, giving the Emperour for pledges of their fidelitie, two yong Princes, Sonnes to a Marquesse, which were carefully kept in a Castle, that was very strong, the Captaine whereof moved by Compassion, and wonne by some presents, suffered them sometimes to goe abroad to take the ayre, and to ride their Horses thereabout: The Captaine going a hunting, takes these young youths with him, the prey found and hunted, shee is followed by all, not thinking of any other thing: The youths spurring hard out of sight, follow their course till they come to the River of the <hi>Maine,</hi> where they request a Fisherman to transport them in his little Cane or Boate to <hi>Mentz,</hi> offering him their little scarlet Cloakes for pay: The Fisherman helpes them from their Horses, and takes them in his Boate, and rowes downe the River, their Horses swimming after them to <hi>Mentz,</hi> where they and their Horses were graciously welcomed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> writes, that Horses wept at their Masters deaths, and it is recorded, that the Horse of <hi>Caesar</hi> wept: foretelling his Masters death, and I perswade my selfe, the gentle Reader could adde somewhat to this purpose, if he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, but thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arre to animate Christians to love, respect, and cherish their <hi>Camerades,</hi> and not to kill and backbite them, as too many are too ready to detract from others, to adde to themselves: a wrong way; for honour is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> compared well to a chaste Maide, that will never love them who would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish her, but being courted shee may be moved.</p>
               <p>Here I must not forget that dutie I owe to the remembrance of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy young Gentleman, <hi>Arthur Forbesse,</hi> Sonne to a worthy, <hi>Cavalier,</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15340:25"/>
memory, Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Arthur Forbesse,</hi> being a worthy valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous sonne, descended of a valiant Father. This young Gentleman being deadly wounded on service, and with hazard brought unto our Ship, within two dayes dyed. Likewise a Gentleman borne in the Isles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alexander Mac-Worche,</hi> being wounded in the head, and shot in the arme, the enemies Horsemen shooting at him with Pistols, he leapes from the shoare, with his cloathes on, notwithstanding those wounds, and swimmes to my Cosen Captaine <hi>Monro</hi> his Boate, and being brought in died the next day, and was much lamented for of his <hi>Camerades,</hi> as a Gentleman of great hope.</p>
               <p>I did also observe here, the inconvenience that happens to many brave Officers and Souldiers given to plundering, gathering together a little boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for spending, which brings them commonly into their enemies hands, their punishment being farre more grievous, than their purchase was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yet I thinke, the Guilt is worse than the punishment. To which purpose I will onely here inferre one Story. A <hi>Pythagorian</hi> bought a paire of shooes upon trust, the shooe-maker dyes, the Philosopher is glad, and thinks them gaine, but a while after his Conscience touches him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a perpetuall chider, he repaires to the house of the dead, casts in his money with these words; <hi>There take thy due, thou livest to me, though dead to all besides.</hi> Certainly, in my opinion, ill gotten gaines are farre worse than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> losses with preserved honestie. These grieve but once, the others are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually grating upon our quiet, and he diminishes his owne contentment, that would adde unto it by unlawfulnesse; for looking onely to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he thinkes not of the end. But in my opinion, if plundering, or making of bootie, at any time be excusable for a Souldier, it is onely in respect of the circumstances. Our friends being forced to quit their Countrey and their goods to their enemies, before it should inrich the enemy, it were not amisse to take it, or destroy it either with fire or water, before it were profitable to our enemies; and in this point onely I doe allow of this bootie making, providing it doe not hinder men from the discharge of their duties, in time and place: otherwise, our best goods, being impediments to the discharge of our honest dutie in our calling, are to be throwne away. And for mine owne part, a few bookes left by my friends, which mine enemy might have burnt, was all the bootie that ever I made: neither doe I repent me of my neglect in this point; having seene many make bootie, who had never the happinesse to enjoy it long. His Majesties care, in fore-seeing the safetie of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> merits praise: for by the preservation of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> his Majestie, like a skilfull Gamester, recovered againe all that he lost. Therefore we ought never to grieve for any thing past, but for sinne, and for that alwayes. And he spake well, that said, <hi>He that hath himselfe hath lost nothing.</hi>

the Regiment marched off, by companies unto their severall quarters as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; The Colonell conveyed by his Officers unto his quarters, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were appointed the next day, to meete at the Colonells quarter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive money, and to understand further of the Colonells resolution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the standing of the Regiment. At their returne the next day, they received two monthes pay for the Officers, and one moneths pay for the <hi>Soldateska,</hi> with promise of winter clothes. But the Souldiers coming into a good fat soyle, clad themselves honestly, which made them want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse clothes; Yet none of us could say, but we served a liberall, and a bountifull Master: the money first payed by the Commissaries, they give orders in his Majesties name for keeping of good discipline over the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the <hi>Boores</hi> should not complaine on the Souldiers Isolencie, which they needed not to use, getting willingly from the <hi>Boores</hi> both meate, and mony, with some clothes: Neverthelesse, there were alwayes amongst the one and the other, some churlish Rascalls, that caused complaints to be heard which made our proforce or Gavileger get company and money, for dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his duety: for neither Officer, nor Souldier escaped due punishment, that was once complained on, untill such time, as his Majestie was satisfied with justice, and the party offended. Thus continuing in our duety, the Colonell anew doth Capitulate with his Majesty, for bringing over from <hi>Scotland</hi> a thousand men to recreute the Regiment. Officers were appointed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of every company to go for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for the most part the Captaines went themselves, leaving their Lievetenants in their absence to command their companies.

To prevent this disorder, the Generall Major with some other associats came to <hi>Assens</hi> and held a Councell of warre, the businesse considered, the Major of Horse is removed to another Garrison, and Rut-master <hi>Cratsten</hi> is put with his Troupes in <hi>Assens,</hi> and the command of the Garrison was given unto me.

               <head>The eighth Observation.</head>
               <p>FIrst here we may see the wisdome and magnanimity of this King not cast downe with the losse of his Army, nor with the losse of the halfe of his country, but preventing his further losse for the safety of his country, and good of his Subjects, he with expedition, drawes himselfe and the remnant escaped of his Army within <hi>Denmark,</hi> to preserve them for a second fitter opportunity; As also to encourage his Subjects, that through feare, were on the flight by water unto other Nations, carrying their substance with them, feare comming unawares, having heard of their Kings losse and overthrow abroade, fame dispersing the rumours of the losse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> much worse then it was, the people were so afraid, and so fearefull, that they enjoyed nothing without a frighted minde, no not their sleepe: they trembled at the present miseries that might but come, they were anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a more horrid habit, then any enemy could put them unto, meeting with evill before it came, making things but probable as certaine, as when one may sit even in a boate, he is in no danger, yet through feare stirring, he may drowne himselfe, and others, as we see often in battell that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man constantly keeping his ranke, doth live, when as the feeble cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard by stooping thinking to save his life, he loses it; when the brave soule knowes no trembling. <hi>Caesar</hi> spake like <hi>Caesar,</hi> when he bad the Marriners feare nothing. And this invincible and Magnanimous King, though ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled by <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet he encourages his subjects, by exhorting them to feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, going at all times himselfe betwixt them and all dangers, he being the first many times ingaged, and the last coming off, casting as it were, through his valour, a kinde of honour upon God; believing in his goodnesse, casting himselfe in danger, trusting and confiding in his care onely. Not like an unworthy coward that ecliples his sufficiency, unworthily doubting that God will bring him off, unjustly accusing God, his power or his will, making himselfe his owne Saviour, he becomes his owne confounder.</p>
               <p>But this magnanimous King setting his care upon God, and using the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, for his country, and kingdomes preservation, winning the love of God, and of his subjects, establisheth himselfe, and his Throne in despight of his enemies. Here also I have observed that good service done to a noble and liberall Master, as this King was, cannot be without reward: Therefore let the servant deserve, and the Master will recompence, if he be such a just Master as we served, where both loved each others, for their generous worthinesse. Who ever then is a servant, if he suppose his lot hard, let him thinke on the other part, that service is nothing els but a free mans calling, and comfort himselfe with the example of Kings, that are but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (though more splendid) for the common-weale; and as this King our royall Master served for his country, let us that are servants serving strangers serve truely where we serve, for our countries credit, our owne weale, and our eternall fame which must live after us. This magnanimous King through the experience he had of our former true service, is desirous to have more of our countrimen to serve him, as we may see by the new employment laid on our Colonell and his Officers; Also on divers other Noblemen of our country, to bring unto him three other Regiments as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15340:27"/>
                  <hi>Nidesdale, Spynie</hi> and <hi>Murckles</hi> Regiments, we being the first that shewed them the way to be employed by his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Here I will exhort all brave Cavaliers, of minde to follow the laudable profession of Armes, not to grudge, though their advancement or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come not at first, but with patience to awaite on Gods blessing, since preferment comes neither from the East, nor from the west. But it is the blessing of the Lord, given by man as the reward of vertue.</p>
               <p>Who ever then would be famous by preferment, let him first study to be diligent and vertuous in his calling, and then doubtlesse God will dispose of him as he thinketh best for his owne Glory.</p>
               <p>Here we see that the Barron of <hi>Fowles,</hi> of worthy memory, thought it no disparagement at first to follow my Lord of <hi>Rhey</hi> and his Regiment, as a voluntier, till he had seene some service, and attained unto some experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then beginning with a company, coming at last with credit to be Colonell over horse and foote, and that to animate others of his name, and kindred to follow his example, rather to live honourably abroade, and with credit, then to encroach (as many do) on their friends at home, as we say in <hi>Scotland,</hi> leaping at the halfe loafe, while as others through ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue live nobly abroade, served with silver plate, and attendance.</p>
               <p>Officers of one Regiment ought to live as brethren together, not envying one anothers advancement, entertaining no other emulation, then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of vertue, every one serving truely in their Stations, till such time occasion may be offered, for their advancement by degrees: for though their patience may be the longer, their credits will be the more, and their contentments at last will make them forgo and forget their former toyle, and disturbances having come to their proposed marke, though not altogether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to their wished end. Here also we see that good discipline is requisite for keeping good order, that as vertue is rewarded; so vice may be punished: as we may see by the institution of the Emperiall lawes, whereof one we reade constitute by the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the second in the code of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the labourers of the ground might live peaceably with assurance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, staying in their villages, labouring the ground, so that no man should be so bold, as to presume to take any such men prisoners, or to offer them any violence in destroying their Beastyall, or in takeing their goods from them, condemning them to death that did contemne, or violate his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cyrus</hi> going to warre, commanded no man should trouble the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. <hi>Xerxes</hi> commanded the like, saying, the warres were against those that caried Armes, not against Shepheards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellisarius</hi> that brave Commander under the Emperour <hi>Iustinian,</hi> was so strict against souldiers that troubled the <hi>Boores,</hi> that the souldiers going by the fruityards durst not throw downe one Apple, and for his good order kept, victualls were cheaper in the Campe then in Townes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Procopius</hi> in his third booke of the <hi>Gothes</hi> warres in <hi>Italy</hi> reports, that <hi>Totilas</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> observed the same strict discipline in <hi>Italy,</hi> suffring the <hi>Boores</hi> untroubled, for paying the contribution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephor Gregorius</hi> affirmed, that while as in the front of an Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched insolency and violence, orderly came in the reare defeate and ruine. And now a dayes the <hi>Turkes</hi> do observe stricter discipline in their Armies then Christians do; in so much that their Captaines must not suffer their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15340:27"/>
Souldiers to goe into Orchards or Vineyards, as they march by. And as order is necessary in an Army, so it is in a Regiment requisit to be kept, and punishment also to be used, for banishing all villany from a Regiment, as Gluttony, Drunkenesse, Whoredome, Opression, Playing, Diceing, Roaring, Swaggering: for it is not seemely that those, who should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come others, should suffer themselves to be overcome with any such notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vices; neither ought a brave fellow to vaunt of his valour, since it is not tolerable to kill men with words, without coming unto blowes; But he that comports himselfe modestly is to be commended.</p>
               <p>Here also we see that the Emulation and stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e begunne amongst Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and Officers of quality, brings at last the same amongst their inferiours and followers; as was seene in the disorders and quarrelling betwixt our Souldiers and the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> horsemen, which was wisely prevented and taken away by the wisdome of their Commanders, that carried mutuall love and respect to each others: for the mutuall good deserving of both Officers, which was the chiefe instrument of their reconcilement, and taking away of their jarres, and idle quarrelling, arising of oftentation, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy fruit growing out of Dunghills, withering faster then it groweth, their jarres thus once removed, thereafter our love waxed so great, that where we chanced both to be on one service, as at <hi>Wolgast,</hi> where we stood in neede of helpe, the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> Regiment, especially Rutmaster <hi>Hoomes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God made our Retreate safe, as you shall heare in its owne place.</p>
               <p>Here also I cannot passe over with silence the love that ordinarily is seene betwixt Officers, and their followers: being once put under good discipline they will undergo any thing for love of their Commanders and Leaders, who have taken paines and diligence in excercising them in the perfect use of their Armes, and in leading them bravely on occasions before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in making with exercise their bodies strong, and their hearts valiant, then I say, what will they not undertake for the love of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Truely, I must confesse, they will stand a thousand times more in awe to incurre their Officers wrath, whom once they loved through love, than in any wise, thorough feare of any punishment, that may be enjoyned unto them by Lawes: and if they love and respect their Officers, for feare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, even in their Marches, for their Officers credits they will march so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with Armes in their Rancks and Files, that you would thinke a whole Regiment well disciplined, as this was, were all but one body, and of one motion, their eares obeying the command all as one, their eyes turning all alike, at the first signe given, their hands going to execution as one hand, giving one stroake, yea many stroakes all alike, ever readie to strike, or hold up, as their Commander pleaseth; and thus exercised they were, that their enemies in all Rancounters could not but duely praise them, calling them the <hi>Invincible old Regiment:</hi> which alwayes rancountred with them on all occasions, so that <hi>Mac-Keyes</hi> name, was very frequent, through the glorious fame of this never-dying Regiment, never wrong'd by Fortune in their fame, though divers times, by their enemies valour, they sustained both losse and hurt: but would to God, we had alwayes met man to man, or that our Army had consisted all of such men, and such Officers, whereof, I was the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest! If so had beene, our conquest had extended so farre, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> old did extend the limits and borders of their Empire, which for my wish I would bestow on the Prince <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> borne by the <hi>Iewel of Europe,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:15340:28"/>
the Queene of <hi>Bohemia</hi> his Royall Mother; and if it were at my distribution, he should have all from the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> at the East, to the Ocean Sea at the West, the fertillest part of <hi>Africke</hi> at the South, and the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Danube</hi> at the North; and yet I durst affirme, that his Grand-father King IAMES of blessed and never-dying memory, might merit a farre greater possession for his Grand-childe, the Illustrious <hi>Prince Elector Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi>; and to have an Armie of such men, under his command, to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on his enemies. I would wish their cloathes nor mine owne, came ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver off, till his enemies were made his footstoole to tread on, or to shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, at his Highnesse pleasure: And for my wish, his Armie should be all of <hi>Britaines, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> such as <hi>Vegetius</hi> describeth the <hi>Romane</hi> Souldiers of old: and I, as one though unworthiest of a thousand <hi>Britaine</hi> Officers, would undertake to make such brave lads to dwell Summer and Winter in Tents, ever in readinesse to fight with our enemies, and to endure all incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, for the credit of such a Master, banishing far from him with vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant hands well armed, all the craft, power, and subtiltie that his enemies were able to devise against him: And we should, for his sake, be contented with such allowance as the <hi>Emperiall</hi> Lawes allow a Souldier, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much as might maintaine life, or so much as Beasts get that are put to dyet, and we should be content to march with such expedition, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, without quarter or Garrison, as neede requireth, never staying behinde, but alwayes advancing, consenting willingly to undergoe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if we did to the contrary: but to march ever orderly in Rancks, as the way lay rough or even, foule or faire, as our Colours and Leaders went before us; Never quitting our Rancks, but with licence, till the cause were wonne, or that our Masters Throne were established. And if otherwise we went astray, we should be content to quit our allowance: and if this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline were not strict enough, we should be content to have his Highnesse and <hi>Royall Mother</hi> restored, to doe as our Fathers did coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> marching alongst the spacious and wide Desert, that our Randezvouz might be appointed and set, till we arrived in <hi>Cades,</hi> that is to say, in the holy Land, where being victorious, we should bid our Master farewell, and rest with our Fathers.</p>

               <p>THis noble Cavalier, of famous and worthy memory, having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table good service at <hi>Beysenburg</hi> Skonce on the River of the <hi>Elve,</hi> as was formerly set downe, at his retiring to <hi>Lugstad,</hi> he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with foure Companies of <hi>Scots,</hi> and certaine <hi>Dutch,</hi> the enemy having falne into <hi>Holsten,</hi> his order was to beset the Castle of <hi>Bredenberg,</hi> being a passe, but not strong, nor fortified <hi>in Forma.</hi> As I was informed by a valourous little Captaine, Captaine <hi>William Lumsdell,</hi> who then was <hi>Ensigne</hi> to the <hi>Major,</hi> who onely at that time escaped with his life, from the fury of the enemy, being within the house, while as the rest, in the fury, were put to the sword: This Gentleman who informed me, was with the Major wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king abroad neare to the house at the enemies first approaching, so that the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15340:28"/>
enemy unawares did come so neare, that they retiring to the Castle, had scarce time to draw up the draw-bridge, when the enemy with his forces, being, as was thought, ten thousand strong, led by <hi>Tilley,</hi> had the house en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed on all quarters. The enemy sends a Trumpeter, summoning to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place, which was refused. Whereupon they entred to approach, and the Defender resists. The service thus begun, <hi>Comoedian</hi>-like, ends very Tragically, the whole Court and lodgings running with bloud, with which the walles and pavement are sprinkled with our <hi>Scottish</hi> bloud, to be viewed and seene to this day. To be particular in the discharge of this dutie at large, not having seene the service, I will not, lest I should erre in giving notice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, of things I did not know; but by report, which ordinarily holds not so true, as things we have both knowne and seene. In this house of <hi>Bredenberg</hi> there was a great number of men, women and children, besides the Souldiers, that had taken their flight thither, as to a place of refuge, at the enemies first coming into the land. There was also in this house great store of riches, belonging to the Lord of the house, and to the Fugitives, that was brought from the Country. The Major valourously defended the place for six dayes, untill the time they had approached unto the moate, and shot two severall breaches in the wall, and being so neare, the enemy directed a <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> unto the <hi>Major,</hi> to see if he would <hi>Parle</hi>; But the <hi>Drummer</hi> returned with an answer, that so long as there was bloud in <hi>Dumbarres</hi> head, that house should never be given over: which answer so incensed the enemy against them, that they sware, if they got the upper hand over them, they should all die without quarters. Shortly after the answer was returned, the <hi>Major</hi> was shot dead in the head with a fire-lock; The rest of the Officers were ashamed to <hi>Capitulate</hi> for an Accord, the <hi>Major</hi> having refused: immediately after, Captaine <hi>Duncan Forbesse</hi> was killed, and after him, Lievetenant <hi>Barbour,</hi> and then Captaine <hi>Carmichell,</hi> who had no charge there, but came by accident to visit his <hi>Camerad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Enemy before this house was taken, as I was informed, lost above a thousand men, which made the Enemies crueltie the greater; and of our Regiment were killed above three hundred. And it is reported, that after the fury was past, they made inquisition for the <hi>Majors</hi> body, and having found it, they ript up his breast, tooke out his heart, sundered his gummes, and stucke his heart into his mouth; they also killed the Preacher, who being on his knees, begging life, was denied mercy.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Out of our enemies crueltie used here, we ought to learne to forbeare the like, lest one day we might be used as they used our friends and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: for we may be revenged on our enemies crueltie, repaying them in a Christian manner, without making Beasts of ourselves; in not shewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being sought of us, which is to be more cruell than Lyons, who will not stirre those who stoope unto them. And there is no greater token of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, than to doe that unto another, that we would not have done unto our selves. And would'st thou have mercy that refusest to shew mercy, being sought of thee?

We reade in the <hi>Turkish Story</hi> of a childe, that strucke an intending murtherer into a swound with offering to embrace him.

In a word, he was a resolute Christian, and a man truely honest; and therefore I perswade my selfe, his death was but the beginning of his joy, and the end of his misery: having therefore written nothing amisse of him, I neede desire no pardon. But I know some men will object, as a blame in him, that he refused a <hi>Parlé,</hi> while as there was no appearance, either of reliefe, or holding out: to which, I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise answer, than he answered himselfe to some of the Officers that were most inward with him, which was, that he was sorry the charge of the bloud of so many soules did lie on his shoulders. But if he should give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that house, he was perswaded, the King his Master would cause to hang him, seeing he had enemies about his Majestie, who would make him die, though innocent. Therefore he resolved to die honourablie, rather than his name should be brought in question, and then to suffer at last. Here also we see a poore Minister in his last Act giving good example, not terrified with the horror of death, nor crueltie of his enemies, but on his knees being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of mercy from man, begs mercy of <hi>God,</hi> dying as a Martyr, persecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death.</p>
               <p>A happie death to him, being resolved with God and his Conscience, to die innocently, like a valiant Souldier of Christ, incouraging others, even in the last Act of his Calling! A happie man, dying in sinceritie, time shall not out-live his worth; he lives truely after death, whose pious Actions are his pillars of remembrance; for though his flesh moulder to drosse in the grave, yet his happinesse is in a perpetuall growth, no day but addes some graines to his heape of glory.</p>

The Gentry of this land are much given to policy and oeconomy, following the example of their King, having great stalles and stables, containing above foure hundred Oxen, and their stables some threescore horses, being well fed and made lusty, they are sold to the <hi>Germaines,</hi> which yeerely brings unto the gentility great store of money: this Iland abounds in Deere and wilde soule.</p>
               <p>This country is also plentifull of wood for building of ships, where his Majesty every yeare hath some builded by his owne master builder, a worthy gentleman begotten of <hi>Scots</hi> Ancesters, called Mr. <hi>Sinclaire,</hi> who speakes the <hi>Scottish</hi> tongue, and is very courteous to all his countrimen which come thither. The Citizens also of this Iland, being very rich, build ships for their owne use, and some they sell unto strangers.</p>
               <p>My hoste the <hi>Burgomaster</hi> of <hi>Marbo,</hi> sometime furnish'd his Majesty for building of his ships, to a reckoning of one hundred thousand <hi>Rex Dolors,</hi> so that in a word, in this little Ile of <hi>Lowland</hi> I did observe vertue to be habituall in it, and so was the peoples goodnesse distributive unto us and our soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, so that during our residence there, we were so welcome, that all things smil'd upon us, where it was my fortune one night to have gotten his Majesty to be my Ghuest, having then my quarter in the <hi>Burgomasters</hi> house, and though he was a King, I perswade my selfe he was contented with his entertainment, being both good and rare, whereof truely I had a good deale, but my Ghuest departed by three of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without bidding me farewell; yet being his Majesties will, I was well pleased, having sate up all night I was not for attendance in the morning, which his Majesty at his departure gratiously did excuse.</p>

               <p>Here also in this Kingdome I did observe, that there is nothing mooves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> subjects more to obedience, then the opinion they conceive of their Princes care and diligence, in the conservation of his Kingdome and subjects; and experience teacheth us, that the obedience due to Kings by their subjects is weake, if it be not grounded on feare and respective rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that all greatnesse destitute of vertue doth vanish in an instant; and therefore the Poets did say, that honour and reverence were the children begotten of Majestie and authority: the example wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we have in the person of <hi>Charles</hi> called the wise, who having seene <hi>France</hi> ruin'd by the former warres, under his predecessors <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Normandie</hi> and <hi>Piccardie</hi> possessed by the <hi>English,</hi> and having <hi>Edward</hi> the third to deale with, the best and happiest King ever <hi>England</hi> had, who defeated the <hi>French</hi> in two Battells. This Prince resolved to keepe the rest, finding it to be as good to governe by counsell as by force of Armes, he did nothing rashly nor unfore-seene, but his designs were all well premeditated and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, making choice of men wise, valiant, and knowing how to command in warres. <hi>Edward</hi> seeing his sword thus blunted, and the course of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories by the wisdome of <hi>Charles</hi> interrupted, said, who did ever see one out of his chamber to give a man so much adoe without Armes? Thus <hi>Charles</hi> was so wise, that his enemies did make no difficulty to praise him, for he not onely freed his people from misery, but also gathered afterward a great treasure for his sonne, being called rich, as he was wise, and being

The fourth remedy is to keepe both women and maides in a convenient modesty of a chast behaviour, without which there is a doore opened to all villany and filthinesse, which is able of vertue to make vice. The other remedies are, to live soberly and vertuously in our callings, eschewing evill company and filthy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, loving rather to take paines in our callings, remembring our duty we owe to God, in not delighting in any uncleannesse, that we may eschew the mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>SCipio</hi> said, we were most in danger when we wanted businesse, for while we want businesse, and have no foe to awe us, we are readie to drowne in the mudde of vice and sloathfulnesse. So our Regiment having laine six moneths in idlenesse and sloath, eating and drinking, and sometimes doing worse, for lacke of employment in our Callings, falling out amongst our selves unnecessarily, and without reason abusing both Burgers and Boores, so that when we lacked employment, then was the <hi>Gavilliger</hi> and his Irons best employed, insolency domineering, so that when we came
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15340:32"/>
to endure hunger, thirst, and cold on our shippes, we were growne so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, that we could not sleepe without a good bed, our stomackes could not digest a Gammon of Bacon, or cold Beefe without mustard, so farre we were out of use, till this <hi>Magnanimous</hi> King came to lead us, who in a short time, without the helpe of Physicke, cured our cloyd stomackes, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our effeminate sides, in stead of a warme Chamber, made us contented with a hole digged in the ground, to let the winde and Bullets flee over us, making hunger our best sauce, giving us employment, and to our <hi>Gavilliger</hi> rest and ease at home.</p>
               <p>O how bright then doth the soule of man grow with use and Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Now could our Souldiers having made a little bootie on this Island, speake like <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> when he had laboured and gotten some Coyne, he shewes it his Companions, that he then could nourish another <hi>Cleanthes:</hi> even so our Souldiers shewing and telling their <hi>Camerades</hi> of their bootie, they rejoyced the hearts of their Leaders, whom before they had offended by their exorbitancy in their idlenesse, bringing joy with profit, when they were exercised in their Callings, banishing mischiefe from themselves by their diligence: for it is one of our greatest happinesse in our Calling, to have a minde and love to vertuous exercises, raising us daily to blessednesse and contentation; for every one shall smell of that he is busied in, and every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Action addes sinewes to the vertuous minde: where on the contrary, surely he must be miserable, that loves not to be diligent in his Calling, when he ought to employ himselfe; for if he growes no better, yet sure it keeps him from doing worse, not having time by his idlenesse to entertaine the Devill. When our enemies least looked for us, then came we with <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> summoning him to the Combate, but he obeyes not, and for his cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize we degrade him of his Armes, and banish him to some other corner to lurke in, seeing he lacked the courage to have made us sport at our landing, or to have given us an <hi>Alarum</hi> in our Quarters; to have once tryed what for Souldiers we were, or what resolution or conduct we had: for he ought to have busied us at our landing, as well with the spade and the shovell, as with the Pike and the Musket, and so we could have said, we had an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as we had not, but a flying dastard or coward.</p>
               <p>This Fort was scurvily given over, which any resolute Commander could well have kept for three dayes, during which time, he had added to his owne reputation, and substracted doubtlesse from ours, by diminishing of our number, which at last would have made him get better Conditions of Quarters, and a more honourable Accord: for in such a case, I would choose before I came in my enemies Reverence without Armes, rather to fight to the last man, and if I chanced to be the last, I had rather die, being resolved, with resolution having Armes in my hands, than unawares, being unprepared, to be knockt downe miserably, when I looked not for Death.</p>
               <p>Here I did see the <hi>Ingenier</hi> that built this Fort (who in time of working did oftentimes beate the Boores to make them worke) for his crueltie he was most cruelly beaten againe, and he running to his Majesties feete for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge (thinking thereby to escape) was on his knees crying for mercy, so hard pursued by the multitude, that before his Majestie he was cruelly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dead, as the reward of his former tyranny, and so would God.</p>
               <p>Here also we see, that oftentimes the Innocent doth suffer with the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> as hapned to that worthy <hi>Cavalier</hi> the Count of <hi>Mongomrie,</hi> being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15340:33"/>
beaten by the rascall multitude: which should teach all Cavaliers bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring charge at such times, to looke unto themselves in attending their Master or Generall on horse backe, when an overcome enemy is marching out of strength or Towne, or otherwise they ought to be on the head of their charge attending their duety; or if for pleasure they would looke on, they ought to be on their Guard, lest being taken for private men, they might be disgraced receiving a Disaster, as this Cavalier did.</p>
               <p>Happy therefore are those who can eschew evill by the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Here also we see, that the best meanes to suppresse the insolency of the tumultuous multitude, is a band of well commanded souldiers with Armes, who are ever good servants, but more often cruell Masters. It is then the duety of a Generall in such cases, peremptorily to see that his accord be kept, which otherwise being broken causeth much evill and mischiefe to follow. His Majesty as he was diligent in the intaking of this Iland, so we see him carefull of the keeping of it, as his conquest, by leaving a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with a Garrison in it, to be his retreate, in case of neede, out of <hi>Holsten.</hi> We reade that <hi>Guishcardin</hi> in his history of the warres of <hi>Italy</hi> in his first booke, accuses under hand the <hi>French,</hi> that did enlarge their territories by Armes, and did not maintaine and keepe their conquests, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did ruine themselves in the end.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> having read the great conquest of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the East, he did wonder that <hi>Alexander</hi> did not take care to keepe them, as he travelled to winne them. It is said of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Albany,</hi> that where he once set his foote, he was conquerour there. But was ever unfortunate in keeping his conquest, and therefore the King <hi>Antigonus</hi> compared him to a gamester at dice, that lost his owne in hope of gaine. Examples we have of this at home without warres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonard Darrez</hi> in his 3. booke of the warrs of <hi>Italy</hi> against the <hi>Gothes, Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> being made Conqueror of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Harrangue made to his army concluded, that it was harder to keepe a country conquer'd, then to winne it: for in conquering oftimes (as here) the cowardize of the enemies helpes more then our owne valor, &amp; to maintaine our conquest we had neede of valour and justice. That custome of the <hi>Turkes</hi> is commendable, that when he enters into his Chappell, the bed man of the Temple going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, cries out aloud, that he remember, that the Empire attained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> unto by Armes and justice, is to be maintained with the like: so mutiny is and should be holden detestable amongst Souldiers, and in all well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned estates. For the use therefore of my fellow Camarades, and for the benefit of my country, I will speake somewhat at large of the fury, cruelty and barbarity of the multitude, mutinous and superstitious, that we may avoid the evill incident thereto, I will set downe here my collections on this point, which occurred in my observation. The Philosopher <hi>Plato</hi> called the wisest and most honourable amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> sayes, the people are ungratefull, cruell, barbarous, envious, impudent, being composed of a Masse of fooles, naughty, deboist, and desperate: for all that is spoken by the wise, displeases the people that are incensed. And <hi>Baleus</hi> writing the lives of the Popes, writes of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the twenty third being asked what thing was farthest from truth, he answered, it was the vulgar opinion, for all things they praise merite blame, what they thinke is but vanity; what they say is but lies; they condemne the good, and approve the evill, and

                     </gap>ap</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in his booke of the unconstancy of the people, hath a whole chapter apart to this purpose, and <hi>Arrianus</hi> in his first booke praiseth much the wisdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, in taking away from the people of <hi>Ephesus</hi> the meanes to mutine against the chiefe men of the Towne: for some of the mutiners being executed <hi>Alexander</hi> forbids to search, or punish the rest, knowing that if once the popular could loose the raine, there was nothing to follow but mischiefe, where the innocent might suffer as well as the guilty, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse here the Count of <hi>Mongomry,</hi> that ranne the hazard of death, being long bedred after his beating, without sense or feeling. And <hi>Thucydide</hi> did in his third booke, speaking of those of the Isle of <hi>Corsu,</hi> did feele the evill of a sturdy popular having licence to doe evill, how much it was to be doubted, in so much that the Massacre being so cruell, that there was no villany left unpractised, and such strange things he writes of, that the Fathers did suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their owne children, and those that were runne to the Churches for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, were cruelly put to death; who pleases may reade the story, where it is set downe more at large. As also to reade the late Massacres in <hi>France,</hi> from the yeare 1560 to this present time, especially the Massacre of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth of August 1572 in the chiefest Cities of the Kingdome, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without respect of age or of sex, as well against the dead as the quicke, as saith <hi>Lactance</hi> in his sixt booke and second chapter: humanity was so farre gone from men, that to take away the life of their neighbours was but sport, being become beasts drunke with custome of bloud, not sparing the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but doing to all, what the hangman doth to malefactors. Therefore <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> saith properly, that the deepe Sea in a tempest hath not more waves, then the tumultuous multitude hath changes; especially getting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> by a new government: And <hi>Titus Livius</hi> in his fourth booke of the third Decad saith, so is the nature of the people to serve as slaves, or strike like Tyrants. Reade also <hi>Thomas Fasell</hi> in his tenth booke of the second Decad of the history of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> a memorable example of sedition, moved in <hi>Palerne</hi> of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> where <hi>Iohn Squarelazop</hi> was cheife leader, amply described in brave termes, he having seene the Tragedy himselfe, where he complaines of the ruine of the City, Iustice and Lawes being abolished, avarice rife, and pride did reigne and dominier (a pleasant story to reade and make use of) in the day robbing unpunished, spoyling the Church in all confusion. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> sayes well, that such changes come by them that have eaten up their owne, and have no more.</p>
               <p>There was also sedition moved at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> in the yeare 166 by the fantasies of the multitude, that was a flood that tooke away almost all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that were turned Christians, whereof there were killed above a thousand, and the Massacre continuing three dayes was never appeased, till at night the third day <hi>Arius Silvius</hi> and <hi>Alvare</hi> of <hi>Caster</hi> gentlemen, and chiefe of the Iustices, came with men of warre in Armes to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and appeased the tumult. The Kings Majesty hearing the newes of this horrible sedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much grieved did presently send unto <hi>Lisbone</hi> two of the chiefest of the Court, to wit; <hi>Iackes Allmod</hi> and <hi>Iackes Lopes,</hi> with full power to punish the Malefactors of such cruelty, where publiquely there was executed a great number of the seditious popular, and the Priests, that moved them to the sedition, were first put off their charge, then hanged, then burnt, the Iudges and Magistrates that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and fury, were some deprived of their estates, and condemned to great pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the Towne it selfe was deprived of their priviledges and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: I pray God to keepe my country from the like. Who pleaseth to reade the story, it is much worth, and of great observance for any good Christian.</p>
               <p>Another notable story of the like we have in the beginning of the Reigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift successor to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Sicil,</hi> in whom did faile the race of the Kings of <hi>Aragon</hi>; the people being moved by a Monke continued long in seditions one after another, till God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it at last, and since they lived peaceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> To conclude then this point, it is a vaine thing to be a follower of the popular sort: for none is the better for their praise, nor the worse for their blame. And therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> said well, that one man could not be master and servant of the people, otherwise, perforce it behooveth him to fall into inconveniencie; as we reade in the fable written of the serpent, the taile whereof came one day to quarrell the head, saying, he would goe his day about foremost, and not goe alwayes behinde, which being granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the head, he found it worst himselfe, not knowing how or where to goe, and became the cause that the head was all spoyl'd and rent, being compelled against nature to follow a part without sight or hearing to leade it. The same we have seene happen unto those who in the Government of the publique would do all things to please the multitude, and being once tied to that yoake of slavery, in all things to will and agree with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and lower sort, that oftimes are rashly moved and without reason, howsoever they cannot thereafter come off and retire, hinder or stay the fury and rashnesse of the people. And therefore the great servant of God <hi>Moses</hi> did properly comprehend in the blessings promised unto the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> their obedience to Gods lawes, that the Lord might establish them in the first ranke a head; in briefe that they should be as Masters, and should not be subject.

Thus done, I gave charge to my musketiers that no man should give fire till I commanded, but to follow their Leaders still in good order. The ground we were to advance on to the Skonce, was plaine as pavement; the Skonce not being high, our resolution was to storme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving fire, and as we advanced those of the Skonce did give three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall salvees of musket thundring amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Our hap here and good successe in making of bootie was soone restrained: no man, no beast, no creature, but hath some thing to ballast their lightnesse. One scale is not alwayes in depression, nor the other lifted ever high, but by the Beame is ever kept in motion; nothing but hath some thing to awe it: man with man is awed and defended, the world is but a perpetuall warre, and a wedding. When the <hi>Assyrian</hi> fell, the <hi>Persian</hi> rose, when the <hi>Persian</hi> fell, the <hi>Grecian</hi> rose; the losse of one man is the gaine of another. It is <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> that maintaines the world. Here (I say) our Souldiers made boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by oppression, which brought a sudden consumption with it, <hi>Hodie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi, cras tibi.</hi> The dying Flie lectures out the worlds mortalitie, and though frequent, miserable man never thinkes of his end, till it be too late, ever epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our selves with this worlds joy, till at last we are seazed on una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
               <p>Here I must not forget the memory of our Preacher Master <hi>William For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse,</hi> a Preacher for Souldiers, yea and a Captaine in neede, to lead Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on a good occasion, being full of courage, with discretion and good Conduct, beyond some Captaines I have knowne, that were not so capable as he: at this time he not onely prayed for us, but went on with us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, as I thinke, mens carriage, and having found a Sergeant neglecting his dutie, and his honour at such a time (whose name I will not expresse) having chidden him, did promise to reveale him unto me, as he did after their service, the Sergeant being called before me, and accused, did deny his accusation, alleaging if he were no Pastour that had alleaged it, he would not lie under the injury; the Preacher offered to fight with him, that it was truth he had spoken of him; whereupon I cashier'd the Sergeant, and gave his place to a worthier, called <hi>Mongo Gray,</hi> a Gentleman of good worth, and of much courage. The Sergeant being cashier'd, never call'd Master <hi>William</hi> to account, for which he was evill thought of, so that he retired home and quit the warres.</p>
               <p>Some men perhaps will blame our Conduct here, for pursuing men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a Church, being a place of refuge. First, I answer, our orders we had of our Master, were to beate our enemies, in taking them Prisoners, or by killing them, which we could not effect, neither the one nor the other, without entring the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly; They having banished the Gospell, and the Preachers of it out of the Church, we had good reason to banish them, who had made of the house of <hi>God</hi> a <hi>Denne</hi> of theeves and murtherers, as they were at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg,</hi> having killed our <hi>Camerades,</hi> and <hi>massacred</hi> our <hi>Preacher,</hi> being on his knees begging mercy, and could finde none.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; They treacherously retired themselves to a Loft apart in the Church, for their owne safeties, and left traines of Powder to blow us up
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15340:35"/>
at our entry, which made our Compassion towards them the colder; for when the subject of our hatred is sinne, it cannot be too deepe; and for my owne part, I refused not to shew compassion on those, who did beg it of me, and what others did in their fury, I did tolerate, not being powerfull to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: yet truly my compassion was so much, that when I saw the house ordained for <hi>Gods</hi> service defiled with their bloud and ours, and the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church covered over with the dead bodies of men, truely my heart was moved unto the milde streames of pittie, and wept, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Caesar,</hi> when he heard how <hi>Pompey</hi> died. For in my opinion, pittie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> though she be a downy vertue, yet she never shines more brightly, than when she is clad in steele, and it is thought that a martiall mans compassion shall conquer, both in peace and warre, and by a two-fold way get victory with honour. And generally we have found and observed, that the most famous men of the world, have had in them both courage and compassion, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wet eyes as well as wounding hands. <hi>Fabius</hi> did conquer, as well by delaying, as <hi>Caesar</hi> by expedition. To end this observation, reason teacheth us to cast the bloud of the slaine upon the unjust Authors of it. That which gives the minde securitie, is a just cause, and a just deputation; let me have these, and of all others, I shall thinke this one of the noblest and most man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wayes of dying.</p>

               <p>IN time of this hot service, no man could perceive any alteration in the majestie of this King his Royall face, but rather seemed notwithstanding of his losse, as it were, triumphing over his enemies, and comforting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> most graciously said.

                  </gap> unto us beyond our expectation: and that which was more esteemed as a <hi>God</hi> amongst the <hi>Pagans,</hi> was extraordinarily changeable, sometimes taking part with one, and sometimes with another. In a word, this <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous King</hi> did abate nothing of his former courage, or of his gravitie: So that his very enemies, if they had seene him at so neere a distance as I did, they could not but have humbly reverenced his <hi>Majestie</hi> for his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke stature, higher than any ordinary man by the head: yet ashamed he was, to stoope for a Cannon Bullet, when they flew thickest.</p>
               <p>And for the accomplishment of his vertues, Nature hath given him an extraordinary rich Presence, to wit, a face as manly as possible may be seene, worthy of a great King, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15340:36"/>
                  <hi>A Royall King, full of assurance,</hi> without any feare at all, in respect of man: yet full of Majestie, amiable to his friends, and terrible to his enemies.</p>
               <p>Here then we may see, that it is the LORD that Guards and keepes <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> from imminent dangers that environ them, whereof Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both ancient and moderne, are full of examples of the miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of great personages from dangers.</p>
               <p>One notable Story I will bring to confirme this divine protection, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Titus</hi> sonne to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> appointed for the ruining of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and punish the <hi>Iewes. Flavius Ioseph</hi> in his sixt booke and second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Warres of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> records of him, that before the siege was layd to the Towne, of minde to recognize, he fell unawares amongst an <hi>Ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade</hi> of his enemies, where then it was knowne, as much as ever, that it is the LORD who disposeth of the moments of warre, and of the life of <hi>Kings:</hi> for though <hi>Titus</hi> had no head-piece nor Corslet on his backe (having not gone to fight, but to recognize) of an infinite number of shot, shot at him, none touched him, though many were shot behind him, those darts shot aside at him, he rebated them with his sword, and those shot low, he made his horse skip to eschew them. The <hi>Iewes</hi> perceiving his resolution, made great noise, exhorting one another to runne at him, and to follow him where ever he went. A rare example of a rare deliverance, where we see that he is well guarded, whom the <hi>Lord</hi> keepes. Here also we may see, what difference there is betwixt Commanders, he in <hi>Feamer</hi> shewed himselfe no Souldier; neither yet the Captaine in <hi>Aickleford:</hi> but this brave fellow that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Keele,</hi> preserved himselfe and others, and that with credit; where we see, that where wisedome and valour doe meet, oft-times the successe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable; and a mans discretion is seene when he abides a fit occasion, as this brave fellow did: where I finde alwayes, that those are the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that are resolute and remisse, not hunting before he sees his prey, and then with advantage, if he would catch.</p>
               <p>Here also, experience deare bought did teach us, that it is better in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B,"/> men on exployts, to command them proportionally out of divers Regiments, than to command them all out of one, which were to undoe a Regiment: and we see often, that the examples of the noble carriage of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, doe much animate and encourage their followers to well-doing; and it is a comely thing for the servant of the publique, to teach by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which makes his fame live after death, as this worthy <hi>English Cavalier</hi> did, especially being in the publique view of the King his Master, hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and his enemies, carrying their Characters from service, as the marks of his valour, without fainting, though wounded to death.</p>
               <p>Here also our <hi>Scottish</hi> High-land-men are prayse-worthy, who for lacke of Boats, made use of their vertue and courage in swimming the Seas, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of their wounds, with their cloathes, shewing their Masters, they were not the first came off, but with the last; following the example of their Leader, they would not stay to be Prisoners, as many doe at such times, and never returne.</p>
               <p>I did also observe after this dayes service, an alteration in the common Souldiers behaviour, while as before we were to send out a partie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men, we were troubled with the Souldiers, striving who should goe out on the partie, every one desiring it should be he, but after this dayes smart once felt by their Camerades, they learned to be more wise, and to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15340:37"/>
stay till they were commanded, and then they obeyed, though not so freely as before.</p>
               <p>Here also I will entreat thee, Iudicious Reader, to give me leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse somewhat, to discourse a little of Sea-fights, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet in this retreat-making, as we were in danger of killing, so were we in danger of drowning, by the enemies Cannon piercing our shippes, repaying us for the hurt done by our Shippes and Cannon to their Towne and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, having in one houre discharged amongst them an infinite number of shot.</p>
               <p>To give then notice to the Reader of his Majesties power by Sea, I will relate a Story of a Sea-fight, that happened betwixt the <hi>Swedens</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> which was in the yeare 1564. the thirtieth of <hi>May</hi>: the Story is written by <hi>Gasperence</hi> in his Commentaries of the <hi>Swedens</hi> warres, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>Amongst other shippes, saith he, there was one which in greatnesse and excellent equipage, went beyond all humane apprehension, so that many affirmed, that since the memory of man, the like of her was not seene on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the North Ocean, which by the <hi>Swedens,</hi> in their language, was called <hi>Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Matchlesse,</hi> carrying two hundred pieces o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THis Magnanimous King, yet still preferring the good of his country before his owne rest and quiet, with the hazard of his person, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe in <hi>Holsten,</hi> his forces not exceeding three thousand foote without horsemen: of intention, there to bring his Army together, he drew out himselfe a Royall Leager with a strong Forte in the middest of it, having the Isle of <hi>Feamer</hi> sufficiently provided of victualls and of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to furnish his Army during that Summer, and leaving the most part of his strength a shipboard, he advanced himselfe with a thousand men, to a Dorpe called <hi>Grottenbrode,</hi> a mile from the shore, naturally well situated, which might be put in defence with little paines, to hold up an Army. His Majesty having drawne the draught of the Retrenchment, the <hi>Boores</hi> set to worke, I with the <hi>English</hi> and two <hi>Dutch</hi> companies, were made choise of, to Guard his Majestie and the workemen; the enemie lying strong with horse and foote, within two miles of us. The first nights watch was laid on me and my souldiers: by breake of day, a Corporall and twelve horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the enemies were sent to try our watch, or rather, to betray us, which were holden up by our outer centry, who calling to the Guard, the Guard taking Armes: I directed a Sergeant, and a Corporall with twelve musketiers to advance, and to speake with those horsemen: The enemies Corporall finding himselfe wrong, pretended an excuse, alleaging he was come to offer his service to his Majestie, and then retired: whereof incontinent I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his Majesty, who presently considered he was a spie sent from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: before midday he returned with fifteene hundred horse, and some Dragoniers; our intrenchment not ready, we draw to Armes, his Majesty directing the two <hi>Dutch</hi> companies to beset the passes, and finding his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in danger retired, with a few musketiers, and leaving me and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> being of equall strength to defend the Dorpe, promising to provide me of amunition, and to send us reliefe: his Majesty thus retired, I caused a barricade of waggons to be made a hundred paces without the Dorpe, where I placed a Lievetenant and thirty musketieres, giving him charge,

if the enemy should advance to discover, or recognize, then to give fire on them, and not otherwise; This done, the rest of our Souldiers were placed for maintaining the entry of the Dorpe, and the <hi>English</hi> were appointed, as our reserve, to lye at Armes, to be in readinesse to second us; the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my finding us provided, and their foote not being come up, they stand in Battell, and direct two Troupes of horse to try the passes, meaning to come betwixt us and our ships, to cut off our retreat, but finding we had the passe beset with musketiers, they were forced to retire backe, with the losse of three horsemen.</p>
               <p>By this time, his Majesty did send Colonell <hi>Holck</hi> unto me (being come loose from the enemy on <hi>Parole</hi> to solicite his Ransome) to desire me, if the enemy forced entrance unto the Dorpe, that I should retire to the Church-yard, which was but cold comfort, so being his Majesty had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to relieve us, and consequently, at last we should be the enemies priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, after losing of our Colours, which grieved us most. But I desired the Colonell to shew his Majesty, that seeing I knew of no reliefe, if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my pursued us hard, I would choose rather to set the Dorpe on fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde us, and then commit my selfe, and the rest to the hazard of fortune in making our retreate, rather then to become prisoners to the enemy.

               <p>IT is much to be lamented, when Kings, or great men preferre their owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ease and rest to the publique weale, suffering it to be overthrowne: on the contrary part, it is worth much commendation, when a King, or a Prince undertakes toyle and travell of his body, for the safety of his people, to keepe them in quiet from imminent ruine, with the hazard of his owne life preserving his subjects. Therefore men ought to call to minde often, the wise counsell of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who said that when the publique state was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, he that lived well at his ease, for his owne particular, should not escape
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15340:39"/>
unruin'd, where on the contrary, the publique state being well, the poore feele the lesse discommodity and is comforted in some manner. <hi>Caesar</hi> was of this opinion, when he said unto his Captaines and Lievetenants, no man could so well establish his condition, as that it could not perish, if the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique state were hurt: But if the publique state did florish, he might helpe and mitigate all the misery of all particular persons. And the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> called the <hi>Debonnaire,</hi> was of that minde, when he tooke away the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of some pensioners of the publique, that did no service, saying, there was no people more cruell, or more villanous, then those that did eate up the publique. Would to God this magnanimous King had done so with a number of his Commissaries, that had misguided his rich Treasure, and were the undoing of his Army, where they should rather have died then wrong d their King and country, and should rather have left by will and testament to their children, an example of their fidelity and honesty, then a rich Patrimony.</p>

               <p>Here also we see that the enemies forces being drawne towards <hi>Traile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,</hi> minding that way to come unto <hi>Denmark,</hi> his Majesty was diverted from his resolution, and was forced to joyne with <hi>Trailesound</hi> to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive warre, for the safety of his Country and people, for if the enemy had gotten <hi>Trailesound,</hi> he had an easie way to come into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were no great strengths, and getting shipping, Artillary and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, (whhereof his Majesty was well provided) he had then the passe open unto <hi>Britaine,</hi> when he pleased. But he was wisely prevented by his Majesty and his Councell, God bringing things to passe according to his secret decree, and not according to the will of man.</p>
               <p>Here also we see, that it is the duty of a Generall lying neere an enemy, to know all avenues well, and betimes to beset them well with diligence, and good watches; for if this passe at <hi>Gottenbrode</hi> had not beene timely well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, his Majesty might have fallen into the enemies hands, the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off betwixt his Majesty and the ships.</p>
               <p>Also in all extremities, it is the duty of Commanders to encourage their inferiours, otherwise the passengers may be affraid, if the Skipper or steers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gives over: as Commanders do looke to their owne credits, so they ought to be carefull of their followers safeties.</p>

               <head>The fifteenth Observation.</head>
               <p>THis Towne of <hi>Trailesound</hi> being hard beleager'd by the <hi>Emperialists,</hi> they desired humbly the protection and assistance of his Majestie of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> which was willingly granted unto them: having accorded on their Conditions, his Majestie made choice of our Regiment to be sent thither, having had sufficient proofe of our former service, in his Majesties presence, and under command of others his Majesties Generalls; So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others we were trusted on this occasion, where we did come with a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliefe to those Burgers, that were wearied and toyled with watching, and also hurt by their enemies, whom they had beaten from their walles twice before our coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> In this accident, which hapned in <hi>Zeland</hi> betwixt the Boores and our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, we may see the Antipathy that is betwixt Souldiers and Boores, where the one cannot with patience indure the sight of the other, without some present jarre, so that it were impossible to make them agree together, if <hi>Military Discipline</hi> were not strictly observed, and the transgressours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily punished.</p>
               <p>Here also I cannot omit the over-sight committed by those Belly-gods the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missaries, that serve the publique State worst, yet are oft-times best recompenced; whose neglect on this March, was the cause of shedding the innocent bloud of the poore Labourers, and of the Souldiers also: and it was pittie, such a King should entertaine so many of this sort of belly-gods, that studied nothing so much, as to fill their own Coffers, and to raise their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, without any care had of the Publique Weale.</p>
               <p>Here also I cannot allow of that vaine custome amongst the Officers, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15340:40"/>
will make a bad choice for a little ostentive credit, having the good in their election, to make choice of the worst; for in occasions against our enemies, we should rather take all advantages, as of strength, of ground, of Sunne and winde: and shall he not be thought yet unwiser, who may be the Instrument to save his people on service, that willingly will make choice of a place to lose them.</p>
               <p>No menagrie in my opinion comparable to that which spares the lives of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> men from losing, and I perswade my selfe, I need not insist in this reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, seeing the actor, though out of time, was sorrowfull enough for his evill choice.</p>
               <p>Here also I did observe, that frequent danger doth encourage the feeblest Souldier, who by daily dangers, and the familiaritie made with death, in stepping every day over the bodies of dead men, who perhaps never before had seene one die naturally, much lesse to see daily and hourely examples of violent death, learning wit, by by-past losses, and experience had in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of our Calling, being hardned with toyle and travell. Therefore, in my judgement, no man is more worthy of the name of a Souldier, than he that indures best wearisome toyle and travell in this honourable Calling, not withdrawing the shoulder, but by pushing it forwards couragiously, having once begun: for though in all affaires of this kinde, the beginnings seeme hard and difficult, yet soone after we finde it lighter, according to the measure of our advancement, and reward in the end, we enjoy still the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentment, as became of me the first time my friends led me up a steepe hill, when my breath begun to faile me, looking behinde, and seeing what way I had put by, the rest to the top of the hill seemed nothing unto me, being so neare the end of my travell, but was pleasant rather than te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. And therefore we use to say, He that beginneth well hath halfe ended.</p>
               <p>At our entry in this Towne, our travell and toyle once begun, continued night and day for six weekes, till we grew hard with travell, yet not hard, as many of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that are hard against the Musket Bullet, this proofe we lacked. He that shews himselfe honest in his calling and Travells, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell passeth, the honestie remaineth: But on the contrary, when we have taken delight in evill, the delight passeth, and the evill remaineth. Happie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are those who travell in well-doing; for when the paines are gone, then doe they enjoy the pleasure.</p>
               <p>We reade of <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> brought from the plough to the <hi>Senate,</hi> to be made <hi>Consull</hi> for his Travell: the like we reade of <hi>Quintus</hi> taken from his plough to be <hi>Consull</hi> also; a great change.

by one Cannon bullet at once: who doubts of this, he may go and see the reliques of their braines to this day, sticking on the walles, under the Port of <hi>Franckendore</hi> in <hi>Trailesound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is said, that valour is then best temper'd, when it can turne out of sterne fortitude, unto the mild streames of pitty: who could behold these acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and not be moved with pitty and compassion? and who will not weepe at the casuall miseries our calling is subject unto, in following oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the leading of an ambitious Generall, yea and of an ambitious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yea the following of an ambitious Souldier, delighting sometimes to treade over his enemies, as happened many times unto us during this siege?</p>
               <p>Who then is more compassionate, in peace or warre, then the martiall man? Observe generally, and you shall finde, that the most famous men have both courage and compassion; of which in this City we had neede; of courage against our enemies, and of compassion to our friends, Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, and sometimes to our enemies.</p>
               <p>You see here we were made to keepe double watch, as wise men ought to do: for when we kept steddy watches, the enemy could not harme us much, being wary of our selves, and he that can do this, he surely merits the name of a good Souldier, but oftimes, we are our owne worst enemies, and killing our selves we neede no other enemy against us. Therefore at such a Siege as this was, sobriety and temperance were requisite to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, as well as valour to defend him from his enemies.</p>
               <p>Here our enemies were our pedagogues teaching us vertue, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment minding us of our duety to God and man: yea minding us both of Death, and of Iudgement: here we needed no dead mans pawe before us, to minde us of Death, when Death it selfe never went night or day with his horror from our eyes, sparing none, making no difference of persons, or quality, but <hi>aquo pede,</hi> treading alike on all came in his way, whose houre was come.</p>
               <p>Here I wish not the gentle reader to mistake this insurrection of <hi>Monro</hi> his company for a mutiny. It was not; neither against their Officers, nor yet in prejudice of their Masters service. Therefore I would rather terme it, a rude ignorance in seeking their due, though unformally, whereof their Officers had no part, and therefore were made free by a Councell of warres, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> but the unthankefulnesse of the Citizens (in sparing their meanes from fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of those that kept them, their wives and children, from the furious rage of their enemies, at such time as they themselves did looke for no safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till they came for to relieve them) cannot be well excused, but their unthankefulnesse was so much the greater, that they err'd against the very lawes of hospitality, being in their unthankefulnesse farre inferiour to Beasts. For we reade, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did bring those guilty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnesse before the Iustice, to be punished, and that justly; because he that forgets a benefit received, without making any satisfaction, doth take away humane society, without which the world could not subsist: and therefore such Citizens, as would not acknowledge the good received, ought to be banished the City, as unthankefull, for a man evill in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, cannot be a good member of the publique, as many villanous traitors were in this Towne of <hi>Trailesound</hi> during the Siege, that for their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars would have sold the Towne, and the common good to their enemies;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15340:42"/>
such fellowes some of them were made slaves, being not worthy the name of free Citizens: and the Canon lawe makes the ungratefull the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable of all men; And therefore they were cruelly punished.</p>
               <p>To make then the ingratitude of the Citizens of <hi>Trailesound</hi> towards Souldiers the more odious, I will inferre the Stories of Beasts here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them; <hi>Elian</hi> writes of a <hi>Dragon</hi> mindfull of the good done to him (as these Rogues were not) in these termes, in his thirteenth booke. In <hi>Achaia</hi> there was a Towne called <hi>Petra,</hi> where a young boy did buy a <hi>Dragon</hi> very little, feeding it diligently, making of it, playing with it, and making it ly in his Bed, till it became great, and a <hi>Dragon</hi> in effect: tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A memorable acknowledgment to convince those of <hi>Trailesound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may joyne to this story, the memory of the <hi>Lion</hi> healed by <hi>Androt</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> slave, whose life afterwards the <hi>Lyon</hi> saved. The story is written by <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Elian,</hi> and also now set out in verse by <hi>Dubartas,</hi> in the sixt day of the first weeke.</p>
               <p>Here also we may see the profit and benifit good order doth bring uno the observers of it: though we thought hard, not to be suffered to come off our Postes for our ordinary recreation, nor yet to sleepe from our Postes, we found at last the benefit redounded unto our selves: for while as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my pursued us hard, we were at hand to defend our selves, and to maintaine our credits; otherwise, it had become of us, as it became in the <hi>Swedens</hi> wars in <hi>Germany</hi> of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> on the <hi>Elve,</hi> and of <hi>Franckeford</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> being both lost through negligence and carelesse watch, which made much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud to have bin shed in both. And therefore I cannot but praise the worth of my Lievetenant Colonell, for his good order and strict discipline kept in <hi>Holke</hi> his absence, being in <hi>Denmark</hi> at his wedding, we being then in greatest danger of our enemies.</p>

               <p>Then I did visit the <hi>Dutch</hi> quarters, being betwixt me and the Ravelin, which I thought to be in least danger.

               <head>The seventeenth Observation.</head>
               <p>THE Emperour <hi>Alexander Severe</hi> had reason to say, that Military Discipline did conserve and maintaine the Estate: And so might the magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> say of this service, and the Towne of <hi>Trailsound,</hi> the Citizens of it, before this time being sluggish, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, cowards, spend-thrifts and voluptuous, are now by this Discipline made active, menagers, valiant, sparing and honest: the thankes whereof they owe unto our Nation, whose bones lie in their ground, and to our Country-man, who since hath beene their Governour, for the reward of his vertue, was appointed by his Majestie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> of worthy memory, and set to Command over them and their Citie. And it is most sure, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> of good discipline is the maintaining of Kingdomes, Cities, and Common-wealths, making them to flourish; where discipline is well kept, as it was here during our beleagering, for then we had no thought of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of money, but of gaining of credit; here were no Novices, but expert Souldiers to resist both the craft and valour of their enemies, who did feele the smart of their valourous resistance, in heaping their dead bodies one upon another in the graffe.</p>
               <p>During the time of this hot conflict, none that was whole went off at the coming of the reliefe, but continued in the fight assisting their Camerades, so long as their strength served, ever esteeming more of their credit than of their safetie, through the desire they had to be revenged of the losses sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their Camerades. On the other part, it was reported of <hi>Walestine,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:15340:44"/>
that he was so eager to get in the Towne, that his Officers retiring off servce being hurt, he caused to shoot them dead, calling them Cowards for retiring with so small hurt. Here also I purpose to speake somewhat of the <hi>Emperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> custome, entring on service, shouting like <hi>Turkes,</hi> as if crying would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie resolute Souldiers: No truely; we were more encouraged, having long expected for their coming, being all of us well resolved for the Combat, we were greedie of honour, and therefore we longed to try our enemies valour: Seeing we were more overjoyed of their coming, than any wise terrified; and we received them with Volees of Cannon and Musket in their teeth, which faire and well come was hard of digestion unto some of them: and it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> might be well said of them, as the <hi>Proverbe</hi> is amongst the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> that the dogges did barke more than they did bite, especially the Fleete Curres; for true courage consists not in words, neither ought we to looke for much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, where we heare many boysterous words. But on the contrary, true valour doth consist in the greatnesse of courage, and in the strength of the valiant Arme, and not in the Tongue: and the first people, that did practise this lowde crying of martiall resolution, and of rejoycing in battell, were the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who in the most part of their fighting used those cryes, as testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their faith, and of their earnest calling for the helpe of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And a Lord of <hi>Africke</hi> being to fight against the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> his Troopes ready to fight, he said unto them, they should not cry but strike hard, for saith he, those men whom you see, are not accustomed to be afraide with words nor voyce; for it is not in cryes, but in valour, that men should esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the hope of Victory. Neverthelesse, we reade in Histories, that the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and other warlike Nations, were wont in Battells, as to this day in approaches, even as in fields, to cry alowd: and therefore we say among our selves at home, that he is to be pittied, that is surprized with the cry of his Enemies. We reade also of the <hi>Savages,</hi> whom the <hi>French</hi> doe call <hi>Tokniam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous,</hi> that before they come within halfe a mile, they cry like Devills at the first sight of their enemies, redoubling their cryes coming neare hand, soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their hornes, lifting their Armes here and there in a boasting manner, fighting so long as they are able to move hand or foote, never giving ground or turning backe till they die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports, that the <hi>Germanes</hi> of old, did sing going to fight: and wee reade of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Censor,</hi> that he taught young men to fight standing in one place, and he used to say often, that words were more powerfull to terrifie, and to chase an enemy, than the stroaks of the hand. And the same <hi>Cato</hi> said, he loved not the Souldier that did shake his hands marching, that staggred with his feet in fighting, &amp; snorted lowder in sleeping, than he did cry coming to fight. And <hi>Caesar</hi> said, that in every man was seene a certaine moving and naturall readinesse and promptitude, that kindled them with a desire to fight: which Generalls and Commanders of Armies ought diligently to intertaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> and not extinguish. Wherefore it was, that the Ancients before they fought, caused to sound their Trumpets, beate their Drummes, and made their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cry hard, esteeming that did encourage their Troopes, and affright their enemies. The <hi>Macedons</hi> also began their fighting with crying and shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and <hi>Curtius</hi> reports, that as soone as the Armies saw one another within shot of Musket, the <hi>Persians</hi> began to cry furiously, and the <hi>Macedons,</hi> though fewer in number, did so answer them, that the tops of the Mountaines and Woods resounded againe to the Echo of their Cryes. The like we reade in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15340:44"/>
our owne Story, where the Author in his ninth Booke makes mention of <hi>Henry Piercie</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Regent of <hi>England</hi> at the East, being come unawares into <hi>Scotland</hi> with seven thousand men, was driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Boores and Herds, by the helpe of Stone-Bagges, as they are called to this day in our High Lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being used by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to fright Wolves, and to chase Deere and other Beasts from their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: the Instrument is made of dry skinnes made round like a Globe, with small stones in it that make a noise, as they did neere the <hi>English</hi> Campe, that their Horses brake loose through the fields, where after long flying they were taken by the Boores of the Country. If then we should cry at all, let it be such a noise as may terrifie our enemies, being strong, couragious, and brave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that the cry of Souldiers made a Raven flying in the ayre to fall downe being astonished: and <hi>Titus Livius</hi> saith, that when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people did imbarke, that few or none were left in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Sicile,</hi> coming together, and crying, the Birds astonished fell out of the ayre: and <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> reports the like, that when the <hi>Christians</hi> besieged <hi>Tyre,</hi> a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon was seene in the Ayre, which made the <hi>Christians</hi> raise such a noise, that the Pigeon fell downe, as if it had beene stricken with thunder, and that they found a Letter about the necke of the Pigeon, that the <hi>Sarazens</hi> had sent to the besieged, shewing they should be soone relieved, if they would take good courage, and maintaine the Towne for certaine dayes: and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> having men with them, who understood the same language, did write another Letter, which they tyed to the necke of the said Pigeon, and let him goe; which Letter carried, that the besieged had neede to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they had given good proofe of their valour and fidelitie, and that their Fortune was, not to give them hope of reliefe; the passages being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up by their enemies, and the <hi>Tyrians</hi> thus deceived, give over the Towne unto the <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we reade practized at the siege of <hi>Harlam,</hi> which made the Towne hold out long: and it is certaine, such Poasts are made fall downe with the noise of crying, and of Cannon and Musket, so that their packetts are taken from them. Here also was wonderfull, the losse and dammage done by Cannon, especially the Morters of the enemy, carrying Bullets of Stone within the Towne of three hundreth pound weight, and some that carried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> Bullets of one hundreth and sixtie pound, and in one day there were shot on the Port of <hi>Franckendore,</hi> where we went out to our watch, above seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and sixtie shot of Cannon, the noise whereof was heard above thirtie <hi>English</hi> miles. Also we reade, that at the Battell of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> in the yeare 1572. where the <hi>Turkes</hi> were defeated with great losse, that the noise of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was heard from the place, above sixtie <hi>Scottish</hi> miles. But on the Sea they are heard a great deale farther, as having neither hill nor wood to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sound in the Ayre.</p>
               <p>Here also I did observe, how happie it is when Officers and Souldiers love one another, refusing to undertake no danger to supply their <hi>Camerades,</hi> their lives being dearer unto them than their owne: which was evident by the timely reliefe, which discouraged the Enemy, and made them at last per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their owne losse to be great, having effectuated little, in the end to settle. To speake in particular of any mans valour, at this time, seeing to my knowledge, I perceived no defect neither in Officer nor Souldier; but so

farre as to my griefe, I did speake of the <hi>Dutch</hi> that left their Captaine, which since I confesse to be a warlike Nation, being now long hardned by the custome of warres, but on desperate service, as this was, I would wish, if I had libertie to choose, other seconds: neither can I commend those <hi>Dutch</hi> that would not send us reliefe in our great danger; for though we ought to looke to our owne houses, when our neighbours are on fire, yet Christian compassion ought to move us to supply the defects of our brethren; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> but when Souldiers and Officers preferre their case, with whole skinnes, to the safetie of their <hi>Camerades</hi> in danger, then such may be justly called sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without moderation, abandoning their <hi>Camerades,</hi> they lose their good name, and bring their reputation and valour in question.

Him then I esteeme as a valiant Souldier, that fights against the enemy, embracing wounds for his Mistresse, and that is contented to lie on the ground, being weary, and that makes no difference of food to serve his appetite, without sawce; being contented with a nod for a sleepe; to such a Souldier nothing is impossible or hard to attempt; and such Souldiers to command were my choice, that cared not for gold nor money, but for credit: and Souldiers have most feare when they are best fed, best clad, best armed, and when their purses are best furnished; but when the Souldier glorieth in his povertie, then doth the Armie flourish, then doe they overthrow their enemies. And therefore it was the saying of <hi>Demetrius</hi> to <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> going to make warre in <hi>Greece,</hi> that <hi>Greece</hi> did ever entertaine povertie, and lodged vertue brought in by wisedome and severe discipline: by which meanes their dominion remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unconquered, so long as they were enemies to vice, and were glad in their povertie, as may be well spoken of our owne Nation at home, that hath suffered and done so much and more for our freedomes, than any Kingdome in <hi>Europe,</hi> which this day makes our Soveraigne to say, <hi>Nobis haec invicta mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serunt centum &amp; septem proavi,</hi> being left unconquered in his succession of one hundred and seven Kings: for what have we to doe with gold or great riches, so long as we can command our owne appetites and desires?

               <p>To conclude then this observation, happie are those Cavaliers that ended their lives in the defence of their Countries credit, a brave interchange, where worthy Cavaliers, in undergoing a temporall death for eternall fame and glory, gaine life after death. Miserable is the brevite, and more miserable the uncertaintie of life. Since then, we are sure we cannot live long, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine if we live at all, being like leaves on trees, we are the sport of every puffe that bloweth, and with the least guste, may be shaken from our life and nutriment: we travell, we study, we fight, that labour may pay us the losse of our ill expended time, while death whiskes about us with a <hi>Pegasean</hi> speede, flies unawares upon us, and with the kicke of his heele, or the dash of his foot, we are driven downe to dust, and lie there.

time, as the Recreuts should come from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then every man should be suffered to serve againe under their owne companies, as before, and this order being followed, they would be well commanded having sufficient Officers to leade them, giving them orders how to behave themselves, in case the enemy should storme their workes, seeing they were not able to defend them long, being weake of forces, and the workes almost ruin'd the night before.</p>
               <p>This determined, the watch being drawne up, they march to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poast, getting orders from the Lievetenant Colonell, if the enemy should presse them hard, they should retire themselves orderly to the Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and quit the outer workes, seeing that from the Towne wall, and Ravelin, they were able with Cannon and musket to cleanse out the enemy againe.</p>
               <p>So entring on their watch, and the night being come on, the enemy furiously did invade them, and they defended the workes a long time, till in the end being prest hard, they retired according to their orders, to the Ravelin, whereupon the enemy followed them with a shout and a cry, as if the Towne had beene wonne, which did put the Burgars, and the rest of the Souldiers that were on other Poasts, in great feare, thinking all was past recovery.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of this sudden feare, our Souldiers valiantly and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended the Ravelin with Pikes and fire-workes, the enemy having advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bravely to the cutting of the <hi>Pallessades,</hi> pressing also to undermine the Ravelin by working under it, which our folkes did hinder, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineing.</p>
               <p>The enemy also, had another fortell, or advantage by reason of a new worke, which was uncomplete, betwixt the Ravelin and the outward workes, where he did lodge himselfe, having the new workes as a Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, to defend him from our shot.</p>
               <p>The night thus past furiously on both sides, not without great losse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fought, both of the pursuer and defender, in the morning our Souldiers some of them being Armed with Corslets, head-peeces, with halfe pikes, Morgan sternes and swords, being led with resolute Officers they fall out, Pell mell amongst the enemies, and chase them quite out of the workes againe, and retiring with credit, maintained still the Triangle or Ravelin; The enemy considering his losse, and how little he had gained, the Towne also being not void of feare, thinking the third night, the enemy might enter the walles, being thus doubtfull on both sides, the enemy sends a Trumpeter, to know if they will treate for conditions, our Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell having the command, for the time (in Colonell <hi>Holke</hi> his absence) I thinke was glad of the offer, to prolong time, till his Majesty of <hi>Denmark</hi> might send a fresh supply. Pledges delivered <hi>hinc inde,</hi> a still-stand or cessation of Armes was concluded on by both parties, for a fortnights time, then Articles were drawne up, to be advised on, which continued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> in advising certaine dayes, in the end the treaty being almost agreed on, to the subscription, orders come to our Lievetenant Colonell to dissolve the treaty, seeing his Majesty of <hi>Denmark</hi> had folke in readinesse to come in all haste with Colonell <hi>Holke,</hi> for their reliefe.

               <p>He whom before I was wont to obey and visite, came now, and visited me, I not being able to stirre, my Lievetenant Colonell came to comfort me, having neede to be comforted himselfe by good advise, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the workes the second night, a generall feare having possessed the hearts both of Burgers and Souldiers, and I, to encourage him, did tell him a story of <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour, who being neere death commanded, that after his decease, all his friends should clap their hands, and laugh unfainedly, as the custome was when a Comedy was well acted: even so said I, though I was sorry at our losse; yet I was glad for being hurt, when I looked to be kill'd, and having acted my part of the play, for that time, and retired off the Stage, all I could doe was but to minde my Camerads of their duties. In the meane time, the Enemies cannon having shot foure great bullets of a hundred and sixty pound weight, out of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, through the top of my lodging even to the bottome, where I did lie, affrighting me still, when my feete were not able to shift away my body; yet recommending my soule to God, I resolved, he was well guarded, whom the Lord had a care of, and having delivered me from many dangers, I still confided he would not suffer me to be smother'd under walles: For which and all his blessings I doe infinitly thanke his Majesty, in giveing me time to doe any thing, that may please his Majesty, for my deliverance.</p>
               <p>To make my Lievetenant Colonell laugh, I did tell him a story of a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> that was seene by a Souldier of the Colonells company, that morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enemy did storme, being a predictive dreame, and a true.

courage, being sleeping on his watch, awakened by the breake of day, and jogges two of his Camerades lying by him, who did finde much fault with him for sturring of them, he replied, before long you shall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sturred, a Souldier called <hi>Allen Tough</hi> a <hi>Loghaber-man,</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his soule to God, asked him what he had seene, who answered him, you shall never see your country againe, the other replyed, the losse was but small if the rest of the company were well, he answered no, for there was great hurt and death of many very neere, the other asked againe, whom had he seene more, that would dye besides him, sundry of his Camerades he tould by name, that should be killed: the other asked what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of himselfe, he answered, he would be killed with the rest: in effect, he describeth the whole Officers by their cloathes that should be hurt: a pretty quicke boy neere by asked him, what would become of the Major, meaning me, he answered, he would be shot, but not deadly, and that the boy should be next unto me, when I were hurt, as he was.</p>
               <p>This discourse ended, I wished my Lievetenant Colonell to set all care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side and to looke to himselfe, and to the credit of his Nation, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the place, till the reliefe should come, and so we parted.</p>
               <p>Here I did observe, that no city, be it never so strong, or so well beset, nor no Armour, be it of what proofe it will, is able to encourage a fearefull heart, as in this City, and at this time, were many of the Burgars, Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, strangers, Officers, of women and children, who were tormented by the feare of death, and of their meanes, whose feare was generally so great, that they were bereft both of wisdome, and courage, as people given over, so that their feare in some sort did frustrate their lawfull defences: the like I did never see, neither wish to see againe, for the enemy could not, though victorious, put them in a worse habit, nor make them seeme more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> than I did see them at this time, making themselves unfit to resist their enemies, and they were all of them in mine eyes, like to the sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish, having weapons, but they wanted hearts; they had quaking hands without use: and in a word, if the enemy had seene them, as I did, he would rather pitty them as cowards, then kill them like gallants.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of this feare, which possessed the burgars, and those Souldiers that had not beene on occasion, yet our Nation, that are ever most couragious in greatest extremity, failed nothing of their wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but having once retired to the Ravelin, maintained it couragiously, repelling the enemies valour, with resolution built on vertue, and love of credit, so that they made their enemie with great losse, to be frustrate of his hoped for victory, finding the valour of the <hi>Scots</hi> tempered with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant resolution and vigorous spirits, his fury was made to setle by little and little, till at last, resolution, the strong Armour of the descreete Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier prevailed against all the shuffles and cries of the enemy, and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seeing the storme past, and the tempest cease, he laughes and smiles, with as much honour, quiet and safety, as before he suffered toyle, griefe, or injury.</p>
               <p>Here we see the use of treaty, and still-stand (or truce) ordained of Policy, that every man may presse to winne his owne aymes. The Souldiers that in six weekes before, were wounding, and killing one another, are now coming and discoursing together as friends, where I did remarke and observe, that it is much easier to be reconciled with an enemy, then to conquer him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:15340:47"/>Now in time of these still-stands, by discourse they presse to finde out one anothers actions, and to observe one anothers faults and excursions, treasuring up against the day of advantage, for the confounding of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at their first out-falling, and like the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> they slime one at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way, to make one another fall, coming in occasions againe: and therefore it was the answere that <hi>Seneca</hi> gave unto himselfe, when he asked <hi>Quid est homini inimicissimum?</hi> he answered, <hi>Alter homo.</hi> Our enemies stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the plots of our ruine, leaving nothing unattempted, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our dammage, and the danger is ever most, when we see it not. Yet I thinke, he that can be a worthy enemy, can, reconciled, be a worthy friend; and he that, in a just cause, can fight against us, can likewise in the like cause, being reconciled, fight with us,, and if he be unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him too, if it were but to be freed of his scandalous tongue, and that also will be worth thy labour, and he that upon good termes refuseth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, may be stubborne, but not valiant nor wise: for he that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continues an enemy, teacheth his enemy to do him a mischiefe if he can: and that endeavour is well spent, that unmaskes an enemy, or makes a friend: for as the one begets a treasure; the other, it may be, raiseth a siege; and that man is wise, that is kinde to his friends and sharpe to his enemies: but he is wiser, that can entertaine his friends in love, and make his enemies like them, as our Nation did here at <hi>Trailesound,</hi> in keeping their Masters love to the best, for their loyalty, and in making their enemies thinke well of them, and love them for their brave carriage and valour.</p>
               <p>Likewise I did observe here the benefit that ariseth to a Kingdome, City or State through a good Government; and what a blessing it was to a Towne perplexed, as this was, to get a good, wise, vertuous and valiant Governour, in time of their greatest trouble, which shewes that we are govern'd by a power above us: for oftimes, that, which we desire or feare, doth seldome happen. This City having feared the Emperours tyranny to come over them, desired the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> as their protector, yet God, by his providence, gave them another, to wit, the invincible King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who provided them an able Governour in their greatest neede, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sr. <hi>Alexander Lesly,</hi> who immediatly after his entry tooke the command upon him, keeping both the <hi>Dane,</hi> their Souldiers, and the Burgars under his command, and direction, as worthy of his authority, flowing from the King his Master of most famous and of never dying memory, it faring then with <hi>Trailesound,</hi> as with <hi>Sara</hi>; she became fruitfull when she could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not believe it, and they became flourishing having gotten a <hi>Scots</hi> Governour to protect them, whom they looked not for, which was a good <hi>Omen</hi> unto them, to get a Governour of the Nation, that was never conquered, which made them the onely Towne in <hi>Germany</hi> free, as yet, from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall yoake, by the valour of our Nation, that defended their City in their greatest danger.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, for the love I beare to the Crowne, that doth protect them, knowing their dispositions by experience to be froward, factious, and proud, having as yet some Wolves amongst them, that the folde may be quiet, let the factious heads be made higher by a pole than their bodies, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the tumultuous; whereby their Governour, by a majesticke awe, may keepe the rest in a strict subjection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest slacknesse and connivence may undermine an unsetled Government; for it is no crueltie to denie false men

libertie, that are so infected, though there be some honest men amongst them; let them serve their Governour, and let him beare the sway, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the dignitie of the place, that having once wonne the field, he may be sure to keepe it: for though I hate the evill people, for their former unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to our Souldiers and Nation, yet the love I beare to their Protector and Governour, makes me thus plaine; whose happinesse I wish to endure while there remaineth a stone in the Citie, and his fame eternally.</p>

               <p>HEre we see, that when his Majestie of <hi>Denmarke</hi> did quit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Trailesound</hi> unto his Majestie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> being made Governour, following the example of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, to put his authoritie in practize, He commanded out a partie, and was obeyed by those he commanded: which should incourage all brave Cavaliers to serve well and faithfully, where they serve, without spot or blemish, that in the end they may expect so great a reward, from so great a Master, as we see here bestowed for valour and fidelitie upon our Country-man, being trusted with such a charge on a frontier Garrison, though a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, before his Majesties owne Country-men; where he againe following the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who caused a Combat to be fought with one of <hi>Darius</hi> Captaines, before the Armie should fight, and his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine returning victorious, he (I say) tooke that as a good presage of his future fortune, in beating of <hi>Darius</hi> his Armie. <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith also, that the <hi>Germanes</hi> were wont to fight, and try their valour, first after this manner, by parties, for presages of greater service to follow. And we finde, that the valourous Generall <hi>Scanderbegge,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> did fight many Combats himselfe, for to give good presages of future victories, whose fortune was till his death to be ever victorious. The like fortune I heartily wish to this noble and worthy Cavalier, happie alreadie and blest in bringing honour to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being in all his time, beyond apprehension, happily excellent.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this observation, here we may see the benefit of good order, where those that were in great danger, are happily preserved by the goodnesse of good order and discipline, and by the timely succours of their valourous Camerades, taking the enemies blowes and shots in their owne bosomes, to rescue their friends from danger, to the great prayse of that noble Sparke, Captaine <hi>Mac-Kenyee,</hi> being full of worth, as the purest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

The enemy having falne strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majestie, he did plant fourteen pieces of Ordnance, and playd on the Kings battell, till his Majestie perceiving the danger, not being bastant to resist the enemy, retired confusedly in great haste to <hi>Wolgast</hi>; and having lost without fighting the greatest part of his Armie, our Regiment and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> remnant of <hi>Spynies</hi> Regiment had beene cut off, had not Rutmaster <hi>Hoome</hi> and some of his Camerades, of the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> Regiment of horse charged the Enemy thrice, keeping them up till the most part of his Country-men were retired in safetie, and then were made by their enemies to retire at the spurres themselves, having endangered their owne safeties for the good of their Camerades. His Majestie finding the enemy pressing hard, fearing much to be surprized or taken, he did give Captaine <hi>Mac-Kenyee</hi> charge to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the whole <hi>Scots</hi> that were there, and divers others; and to skirmish with the enemy before the Ports, till his Majestie were retired, and then to make his retreate over the Bridge, and to set it on fire, which the Captaine did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly obey, doing his Majestie the best service was done him in the whole time of his warres, not without great danger of the Captaine and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where the Bridge once burning, he was then the happiest man that could first be shipped; Ensigne <hi>Lindesey</hi> brother to <hi>Bainsho</hi> was shot with a Cannon-Bullet in his shoulder, and notwithstanding was brought off, and miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured.</p>

               <p>IN defence of this Towne of <hi>Trailesound,</hi> our Regiment did lose neare five hundred men, and of the remnant escaped, both of Officers and Souldiers, I doe not thinke one hundred were free of wounds received honourably, in defence of the good cause. Who will then say, but that bloud was better lost than kept, when it returnes with advantage, having brought credit to themselves and Countrey? Let none then mourne for the losse gotten so honourablie. Let none then, I say, bedew their eyes for them we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15340:49"/>
left behinde us, seeing the gaine is equall to the losse, if not more; for them we had, we knew were not alwayes to stay; yet what we have gained, is permanent and eternall; those we lost, I confesse, we loved, yet that love ought not to be so violent as to undoe our selves with wanting of it. Neither can we so slenderly forget their memory, being our noble friends, and who were ornaments to our Regiment and Country, and helpers of our credits. Shall we not then be sorrowfull for their losses, that lost themselves to make us renowned in their deaths, and, while they lived, were our most faithfull and loving Camerades, even unto their last breath? But since they are gone before us, to take in quarters in heaven, following their great Captaine, who hath made the way open for them, being stricken, as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, by the hand of the Lord, and yet placed at his right hand, shall we be sorry for them? No; we will rather rejoyce, and thinke we must follow them, when we have fought that good fight against our enemies, we shall be crowned with them in glory, and rejoyce following the <hi>Lambe</hi> where ever he goeth, and till then his right hand will sustaine us, as before; for he is our helper, and hath sworne by his right hand, and the Arme of his strength, that he will not forsake us, till we rest with him in glory.</p>
               <p>Here also we see, that his Majestie having trusted our Nation more than his owne, or the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he doth leave them ingaged with the enemy, till his Majesties retreate were made sure, both first and last. Where we see, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> friendship and true service is best tryed in extremitie; for no greater testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can be given of true service, than when the servant doth endanger his own life and honour for the reliefe of his Master; as that young Cavalier, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Mac-Kenyee</hi> did here, being a generous act, for the safetie of a King, which ought to be recorded; to vindicate his honour from oblivion, whose memory merits to be rewarded, that others might imitate his noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>Here also we see, that sufferance in a noble manner causeth love, for that young Cavalier <hi>Henry Lindesey,</hi> then an Ensigne, not able to helpe himselfe, his Camerades loving him dearely, and the more for his noble sufferance, they helpt him off from the crueltie of his enemies, to preserve his life for a better occasion, who by Gods providence was miraculously healed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost a great part of his shoulder, a wonder in an age, such wounds to be cured.</p>

               <head>The twenty-one Observation.</head>
               <p>IN the Firmament we see all things are preserved by a glorious order; the Sunne hath his appointed circuite, the Moone her constant change, and every planet and Starre their proper course and place, the Earth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath her unstirred stations, the Sea is confined in limits, and in his ebbing and flowing dances, as it were, after the influence and aspect of the Moone, whereby it is kept from putrefaction, and by strugling with it selfe, from over flowing the land. So that in this world, order is the life of Kingdoms, Honours, Artes: for by the excellency of it, all things florish and thrive; and therefore we see, that this order is requisite to be observed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than in military discipline, being the life of it. Regiments then maintained in good order, the Army can be but well ordered, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my well ordered, the King and country cannot but stand, both in peace and warre, for seldome we see any goodnesse in the refusing to obey good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And we heare ordinarily, that one bad voice puts twenty out of tune, and that it is the chiefe property of a good Souldier, first to learne to obey well, in keeping of good order, and then doubtlesse, in time being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he cannot but command well, so that here in ordering of this, as in all things, we see vicissitudes and alterations, some Regiments made up and continue in florishing order, other Regiments reduced taking an end, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion and accidents of warre doe happen, <hi>Spynies</hi> Regiment was reduced, and my Lord of <hi>Rhees</hi> Regiment is made up againe. Where we see, that as vicissitude maintaines the world; even so concord is a great meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, as discord is too often of discontinuance, and ruine. Likewise we see, that no estate is free from mutability, and change, which is the great Lord of the World, who will be adored and followed as soone as order doth faile: but where order is kept, and concord (as in this Regiment)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> change hath no place to ruine, though well to alter; for order was so kept by this Regiment, like to brave Souldiers, who in a running skirmish come up, discharge, fall off, flie, and yet reinforce themselves againe, having kept order in their proceedings, which though now she admits of some change, being reinforced againe and joyned together with the chaine of love and respect, she admits of no confusion or ruine; but is ready againe with her brave Souldiers being reinforced in a strong body to make head unto their enemies, one day to be revenged of their former losses, as, God willing, shall be cleered in the sequell of my discharge of dueties and observations, of this new reformed body of the old Regiment.</p>
               <p>My cozen Lievetenant <hi>Andrew Monro</hi> being killed in combat, I have more then reason to condemne and disallow of that miserable sort of fight, where oftimes the victorious puts himselfe in a worse case, both of soule and body, than he that is killed. Yet this kinde of fighting hand to hand, called <hi>Monomachia,</hi> hath bin much practised, both amongst <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> even amongst all Nations, as it is yet. Of old it did serve for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15340:51"/>
proofe of things hidden, being in one rancke with the burning iron, and scalding water, to the end men might discerne the innocent from the guilty: this kinde of violence of proofe was so common, that <hi>Fronton</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> made a law, as reports the <hi>Saxon</hi> history, that all differences whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever should be decided by the combat, and <hi>Leoden</hi> reports, that yet to this day they observe the same in <hi>Muscove.</hi> But wise men finding this custome deceivable, in deciding the truth, and so uncertaine, that many times the innocent doth succumbe; and therefore it was forbidden by the civill, and canon law, as is evident by severall ancient constitutions, inserted in the Decretalls.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding whereof, amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> it became so common, as to be thought but a sport; which made the name of fighters esteemed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> as we reade in the <hi>Cod. Titulo de gladiatoribus,</hi> and therefore this custome being displeasing unto the Emperour <hi>Instinian,</hi> he commanded all should be subject unto the Iudge, and said, that valour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out justice, was not to be allowed of. This combat betwixt those two was well fought of both, in presence of many witnesses; where it was thought, that the <hi>Dutch-man</hi> was hard, so that a sword could neither pierce him, nor cut him. This fashion of fighting is so common, that we neede not illustrate it by examples of Histories, either ancient or moderne; but who so would satisfie their curiosity in this point, let them but reade <hi>Preasack</hi> his <hi>Cleander,</hi> 2 story well worth the reading. And truely dayly experience teacheth us (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in this accident) that the end of combats doth shew often that he, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, often times doth receive the reward of his temerite, which might be cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus much of combats, which for my part, though I cannot allow of, neverthelesse I should be loath to refuse to fight in a just quarrell, but would rather referre the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to God, to determine of, then to let that be called in question, which is dearest unto me.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:15340:52"/>Captaine <hi>Andrew Stewart</hi> (brother to the noble and worthy Earle of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> being soliciting businesse at <hi>Copmanhagen</hi> contracted a feaver and died there, being in his Camerades absence honourably buried by the Stathoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders direction; whose death, as untimely, was much regrated by all his Camerades, he being a valorous and expert Commander.</p>
               <p>Likewise <hi>Iohn Hampeseede,</hi> an old true servant to my cozen the Barron of <hi>Fowles,</hi> he dying of a feaver at <hi>Angle</hi> leager, was honourably buried there.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Danes</hi> warre thus ended, was the beginning of a greater warre, as is said: for the Emperour (in Summer 1629. The <hi>Danes</hi> peace being made in August 1629) did send assistance of men unto the <hi>Pole,</hi> against his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> under the command of the Felt-marshall <hi>Arnhem,</hi> which the next summer did bring the sword of the <hi>Sweden</hi> against himselfe. So that we see there is nothing here on earth to be expected by us, more then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall warfare. Lord therefore make us dayly to warre in that spirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, serving truely the King of Kings and Lord of hosts, fighting that good fight against our spirituall enemies, where he that overcomes, receives for a reward (instead of worldly glory) an immortall Crowne of Glory in the Heavens.</p>

               <head>The Colonells Observation of the Kingdome of Denmarke.</head>
               <p>HAving had the honour to have dined with his Majesty at his Table, then in the gorgeous, &amp; pleasant Palace of <hi>Freddesborree,</hi> taking leave of his Majesty, having kissed his hand, I retired to <hi>Alzenheur</hi>; where I began to thinke, that this King could have said of his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as <hi>Scipio</hi> said, you see not a man amongst all those, but if I command him, he will from a Turret throw himselfe into the Sea: even so this Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous King, to my knowledge, was of absolute authority in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as all Christian Kings ought to be in theirs ever obeyed in the Lord, without asking the head a reason; Why doe you command us thus? For we reade that the favour of the Lord was in <hi>Iuda,</hi> in giving them one heart in doing, and obeying the commandements of the King, and of their Magistrates and Principalls, as I did cleerely observe in this Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke</hi> the goodnesse of government, for the florishing of the Kingdome; where <hi>Totus orbis componebatur ad exemplum Regis.</hi> He commanding, they obeyed; both lived in prosperity, the Ruler or King Heroick, wise, noble, magnanimous and worthy.</p>
               <p>The Gentry, Citizens and Communalty obedient, which made their joy and felicity to continue, in despite of their mighty foes, and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Majesties Government in military discipline, who doth entertaine a great number of Officers yeerely, having good allowance for comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Souldiers trained up in peace, against warre, such as Colonells, Lievetenant-Colonells, Majors, Captaines and other inferiour Officers, which are still entertained at the countries charge, in exercising of Souldiers for his Majesties emploiment, being alike ever ready in all Provinces for peace or warre. Would to God we were so well provided in our owne country at home, and then we needed not to feare any forraine enemy, that are enemies to God, to our King, and to our Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:15340:52"/>And for the better maintaining of warre, no Kingdome or King I know, is better provided of a <hi>Magazin,</hi> then this magnanimous King, for Armes, brasse ordnance (whereof every yeere his Majesty doth cast above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred peeces) being sufficiently provided of Amunition and of all sorts of fiery <hi>Engines,</hi> to be used by Sea or Land, together with Armour sufficient for to arme a great Armie of Horse. His Majestie is also sufficiently well provided of shipping, and yearely doth adde to the number, which ships are built by two worthy Scottish-men, called Mr. <hi>Balsoure,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sinclaire,</hi> being both well accounted off by his Majestie, who in like manner hath a Reprobane at <hi>Copmanhagen,</hi> for making of Cords and Cables for his ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Kingdome, where I was informed, that in twenty foure houres time, they were able to furnish the greatest ship the King had, of Cables and of all other tackling and cordage, necessary to set out the Ship.</p>
               <p>Likewise by his Majesties Artizens within the Kingdome, all sort of stuffes and silkes are woven, sufficient to serve the Kingdome, and his neighbours that please to buy.</p>
               <p>Moreover this Kingdome is worthy commendation, for the order of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Lawes, having their Law-books deciding all controversies amongst them, and if it come to any great difference, the Kings Majestie, as being above the Law, sits in judgement as the Interpreter and Director of Iustice, and according to his Princely dignity, mitigates as pleaseth his Majestie the law, and decides the controversie.</p>
               <p>This Kingdome also is praise-worthy, for the purity of their Gentry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ancient and noble, as any other Kingdome, and can bragge of a purer and cleerer bloud of Gentility, then many Nations can: for they never ally or enter into marriage with any inferiour to themselves, be they never so rich, if they be Burgars or Plebeians, they never marry with them; and if one of their daughters will, through love, miscarry in her affection, to marry a Citizen, they will not thereafter doe so much as to honour her with their company, but on the contrary, shee loseth both her portion and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not suffering her to carry the armes of her familie.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this Nation is praise-worthy for their entertaining of learning, and of the liberall Sciences professed in their owne Vniversities, where their children are well taught and trained up, after a noble and heroick manner, within their owne Kingdome, not onely in their Studies of the liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but also in their exercise of body, as fencing, dancing, singing, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Instruments, and riding of horses, and what else are noble Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as learning of forraine languages, <hi>Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch,</hi> and such like, and afterwards their youth being well travell'd, returning from their Travells, they attend on the Chancellarie, as under-Secretaries to States-men, to enable them to be profitable members in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. And being <hi>foris familiat,</hi> according to their gifts and qualities, they are preferred to Government and charges under his Majestie, in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke, Yewtland, Holsten,</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majestie also is praise-worthy, for his <hi>Occonomie</hi> in keeping of Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses to feed Oxen, and stalles for keeping of milch Cowes, whereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yearely great income of moneys, for Butter and Cheese made in great quantitie by <hi>Hollanders</hi> in <hi>Denmarke, Holsten,</hi> and <hi>Yewtland</hi>: which parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound also with all sorts of Fish, which inricheth his Majesties tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bringing great commoditie to the Subjects, in serving themselves, as also in bringing of money into the Kingdome, by furnishing of others. Also this Land abounds in Corne, which makes great cheapnesse in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where I have lived nobly entertained with two servants for twelve shillings sterling a weeke, being a whole winter in Garrison at <hi>Malemce</hi> in <hi>Skoneland.</hi> Where I did see and observe the custome used by the <hi>Danes</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in their house-keeping, wherein they are not prodigall, but yet very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here I did observe, that the Subjects doe follow the example of their King, in their apparrell, in their vertues, and Oeconomie, where I did see vertue to have beene alike habituall in King, Gentry, Citizens, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being all in their degrees extraordinary rich, not onely in money, but also in Iewells and plate; nothing inferiour, in my judgement, to any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Country. It was observed in the Court of the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, a good Prince and a vertuous, that many Lords and great Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Emperour and the Empresse not disdaining to carry and weare them, the rest followed: the pearles and precious stones did rise to the great price, that they are now at by the rich, that made the price so high, that the poore could not attaine unto them. To shew this by example, we reade of <hi>Sabina Poppaea,</hi> to whom nothing was wanting, but shame and honestie, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beloved of <hi>Nero,</hi> had the colour of her haire yellow, like Amber, which <hi>Nero</hi> esteemed much of, in singing Verses made on her on the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern: and from this came that the whole Damsels of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> did like best to have that colour of haire in their Buskins, Bracelers and cloathing, and the Amber, which before was in no esteeme, became very deare, seeing <hi>Nero</hi> esteemed of it; which makes <hi>Plinie</hi> report, speaking of the Comoedians apparell, that they carried so much Amber, that it was admirable to behold; which shewes, that the examples of great personages have great power, in matters of moment and consequence, as it hath in things of lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>For as <hi>Villeius Paterculus</hi> spake of the Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> a good Prince teacheth his Subjects to doe well, and as he is the greatest in estate, even so he is the greatest in example, the people casting their eyes on their Prince, sitting high, in sight of all, they delight narrowly to consider all he doth and saith, and they looke unto the most hidden things of his actions, as through little holes: and therefore before all places, the Kings Court ought to be holiest, and cleerest of all vices, and endued with most honestie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will make the whole Kingdome conforme. To confirme this, we reade in our owne story a memorable example; how the King <hi>Iosina</hi> tooke

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> THe fore-sight of a wise Commander availes much, in preventing the intentions of our Enemies; First, in besetting the passages, through which he might come upon us, which doth hinder his march in giving us the longer time to bee prepared for his comming: Next, the farther our wings are spred without us, our Body is the better guarded by good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: Thirdly, by this meanes, wee can the better provide our Army with thinges necessary: Fourthly, the passages without being kept, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next the Enemy, wee can have the more timely advertisement of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies designes, so soone as they are hatched.</p>
               <p>This Cavaliere <hi>Kniphowsen,</hi> though hee was unfortunate, he had both the Theorie and Practick befitting a Commander; whom once I did heare say, that one Ounce of good Fortune was to be preferred before a Pound weight of Wit; which hee knew well by his owne experience; and to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though hee was unfortunate himselfe, yet <hi>Cavalieres</hi> under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, could learne by him much good order and discipline.</p>
               <p>And though in his life-time, hee loved not our Country-men; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, for the love I carried to his vertues, I would not omit to make mention of his worth. No feare of danger, or death can be an excuse to a man, to serve the Publique in his calling.</p>
               <p>Before I was commanded to enter this Towne, the Infection was great; yet none of us did forbeare to converse with the Sicke, though daily exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mortality were frequent amongst us; for on our Watches, wee knew not the cleane from the foule; Neverthelesse, it behoved us all to passe on our duties, as wee were commanded; and though I know no reason for it, fewer Souldiers dyed of the infection than Burgers.</p>

               <p>It is the duty of a Commander, to whom a Frontier Garrison is put in trust, timely to fore-see all wants, and defects about the place hee is trusted with, as to repaire the workes, to provide it with victuals, with powder, with Ball, Match and Armes; for it were not good hee had his materials to seeke, when hee is resolved to begin his worke.</p>
               <p>Likewise his workmen, if they bee not sufficiently furnished before-hand, he will be forced to dismisse them, before his worke be credibly ended: his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-seers must be also good and diligent, otherwise, there may bee too many crevises in their building, and he himselfe must give good example in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing all, and in fore-seeing of all inconveniences, not trusting unto others, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15340:70"/>
discharge those duties, hee is bound to discharge himselfe; and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hee must also be very modest, and secret, in not revealing the dangers hee fore-sees, but be amending of them, for feare to discourage others.</p>
               <p>Likewise wee see here, that it is alike with a Commander keeping a strength sometimes, as it is with a body, whereof some members are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a Canker, that to preserve the body they must resolve to lose a member, as it was with us at this time, being forced to burne a part of the Towne, to preserve the rest and our selves; otherwise, all must have beene lost.</p>
               <p>But God favouring us by the winde, that obeyeth when hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the Element of the Fire also, supplying the defect wee had of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in our Graffe (being but dry on that side) wee were guarded with fire in stead of water, and that bravely.</p>
               <p>The Enemy being gone, wee preserved the rest of the Towne in quensh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire.</p>
               <p>Here also, wee may see the benefit we reape, when Frontier Garrisons are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> well beset, if the Enemy fall into our Land, as wee are able to affront him in his comming, so in his going, taking alwayes Prisoners of him; and this is the right use of Strengths; that when wee suffer losses in the Fields, wee have time to draw breath againe, our Garrisons being well beset, as was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Likewise by example, here wee see inferiours must yeeld to their betters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> in some things, though without reason, giving way to Princes that are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. Yet it is the duty of the inferiour to maintaine his Right, lest he should be thought too simple, in over-passing it; For though perhaps at first wee bee not heard; yet it may happen, that afterwards we be not incroached upon, more in that kinde; For as a Generall commands his Armie; so should a Colonell command his Regiment, that hee may advance the vertuous accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to merit, and good deserving, more then by favour; If hee would be well esteemed of, hee ought to have the understanding to preferre (for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) the respective and the obedient, and to hold backe onely those, who doe not well understand either themselves or others.</p>

               <p>Sundry <hi>Cavalieres,</hi> that carried charge under this Regiment in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> wee see in the beginning of this new Warre; for having attained to a little experience under this Regiment, they are now like the Eagles birds, that how soone they can but flee, they take Command on themselves, and that most worthily, knowing, that it is ambition grounded upon vertue, makes the meanest Souldier mount from the lowest centrie, to the top of honour to bee a Generall; as some of our worthy Countrimen have done under the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to their eternall glory.</p>

               <p>His Majesty having a greater enterprise in hand, hee commanded out a Thousand choise Musketiers towards <hi>Trepto,</hi> two miles from <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and the enemy being acquainted with their comming, hee did retyre to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meine,</hi> the Leader of the party leaving two Companies in <hi>Trepto,</hi> marched forwards with the partie to take in a Castle on a passe lying in his way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Trepto,</hi> and <hi>Dameine</hi>; whereon were fifty commanded musketiers; who after a little defence made for their credit, did capitulate for quarters, being afraid of the Armies comming, they gave over both Castle and passe. His Majesty (leaving a few number of commanded men in <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> with a Commissary, for ingathering of Contribution, and Proviant for the Armie) he did breake up, and marched towards a little Towne, lying on the passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Dameine,</hi> called <hi>Letts:</hi> where in the Castle there lay above sixe hundred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> men of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> that might have foughten for good quarters; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carelesse of their Watch, our commanded Musketiers, having past the Bridge, were suffered to enter within the Castle, before the <hi>Garrison</hi> could get to their Armes, and being thus surprized, they got worse quarters, then if they had fought.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers and Officers that first entred, made good booty; and having got gold chaines and mony in aboundance, by reason the <hi>Emperialists</hi> had lyen long there, who though they gathered the whole money of the Country, yet they had not the wit to transport it away, being silly simple <hi>Italians,</hi> and without courage, the poorest Officers that ever I looked on, and unworthy the name of Souldiers; for though they knew of our march, they suffered themselves pittifully to be surprized.</p>

               <p>Here at this time, a young Cavaliere desirous of honour, and greedy of good instruction, could have learned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this King the way to command well; as likewise with order to direct all things fitting, how to pursue any place or strength he came before, as his Majestie did there, being the first part, wherein I did observe his Majesties dexteritie in Command, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Such a Generall would I gladly serve; but such a Generall I shall hardly see: whose custome was; to bee the first and last in danger him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, gayning his Officers love, in being the companion both of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and dangers; for hee knew well how his souldiers should bee taught to behave themselves, according to the circumstances both of time and place, before they were led to fight, and being carefull of their credits, hee would not suffer their weakenesse, or defects to be discerned, being ready to foresee all things, which did belong to the health of his souldiers, and his owne credit. Hee knew also, the devices and Engines of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, their Counsell, their Armies, their art, their discipline: As also the nature and situation of the places they commanded; so that he could not bee neglective in any thing belonging to his charge; and he understood well, that an Army being brickle like glasse, that sometimes a vaine and idle brute was enough to ruine them; and to breake them, like the bricklest glasse that is.</p>

               <p>The next morning every Regiment of foote, according to custome, was commanded to have a competent number of Cannon baskets ready made, to be transported the next day on Waggons before <hi>Dameine,</hi> which we were to beleaguer; Therefore this preparation was made before hand for the Batteries, the wood being scarce and farre from thence.</p>

               <p>The Captaine being a bold spoken gentleman, well bred, and of good language, begun very familiarly to finde fault with his Majesty, for his forwardnesse in hazarding his Majesties person in such unnecessary dangers; on whom, at that time, the eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> were fixed, expecting their freedome and reliefes (from the tyranny of their enemies) to come from his Majesty, and in case any misfortune or sinister accident (as God forbid) should happen unto his Majesty, what then would become of his Majesties confederates, and which was worst, what would become of many brave Cavaliers of fortune, who had no further hopes then to live, and to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under his Majesty their Leader?</p>

and mutuall loyalty. Who likes to reade a pleasant story to this purpose, let him read <hi>Nauclerus</hi> treaty of the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> the third, in his warres against <hi>Guelly</hi> Duke of <hi>Baviere,</hi> who was forced for his safety, to retire within <hi>Rhinesberg,</hi> where the Towne being taken by accord, by the perswasion of Ladies, he would grant no other condition, but that the women should transport themselves out of the Towne in safety, with so much as they could carry, and no more, where one taking the Duke on her backe, the rest of the wives their husbands, the accord thus kept, and the Emperour <hi>Conrade</hi> moved to compassion, beholding their love and vertue, pardoned the Duke, and restored the Towne to their former liberties. And <hi>Bodin</hi> in the preface of his history reports that <hi>Laurence de Medices</hi> was healed of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous disease, by reading of this story without any other helpe; I wish it may worke the same effect upon all those that made it, especially the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male sex, in making them follow the vertuous examples of these noble Ladies, in loving their husbands beyond all other things whatsoever, and those that will not be moved thereto, I wish them the death of that <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, reported of by <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> and <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> called <hi>Publia Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netia Annea,</hi> who lived twenty yeares without once offending of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> and seeing him die, contracted such griefe for his death, that she threw herselfe into the grave with her husband, where she died, and lay with him. This wish I hope cannot be taken in ill part by the vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that are like <hi>Cornelia:</hi> but I feare there is none such at all. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then this point of my observation; in my judgment, no women are more faithfull, more chast, more loving, more obedient nor more devout, then Souldiers wives, as daily experience doth witnesse, and none have more reason to be so, then some of them, whose husbands doe daily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe all dangers of body for their sakes, not fearing death it selfe, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To th'end you may see, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts and vertues before mentioned, are not proper alone unto the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine sex, I will here inferre some notable examples of the good will, love and faithfullnesse of husbands to their wives, especially Souldiers, whereof amongst many, for the present, I will, to content the Reader, mention two or three, that are notable, whereof one happened at this time in our warfare, worthy to be recorded, of that noble, valorous, pious and worthy Cavalier, the Felt-marshall <hi>Gustave Horne</hi>; the Peste ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> entred his lodging, and taken away two of his Children, seazed on his vertuous Lady, daughter to the Chancellor of <hi>Sweden</hi>; the Cavaliers love was so great, that in the extremity of her sicknesse, he never suffered her to be out of his armes till she died, and then caused her to be put in a Silver Coffin, that she might be transported for her country, to be buried amongst her friends; and his love was so great unto her, that after her death, though a young man, he could never be moved to leade his life with any other woman. Another example we reade in the story written by <hi>Pli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also that which we reade of <hi>Meleager</hi> sonne to <hi>Danneus</hi> is notable, who would not rise out of his chaire, for the reliefe of the

I answer, it was all one, if shee was good: for all stories esteeme them happie, that can live together man and wife without contention, strife, or jarres, and so doe I. And, in my opinion, no wife can be ill, that wants the gall; for the gall in the body is the seate of choler, from which the love of man and wife should be free, and as of gall, so of despite, of anger and of bitternesse.</p>

               <head>The eighth Observation.</head>
               <p>HIS Majesty going to rancounter his enemy, before his rising from his Royall Leager at <hi>Swede,</hi> did wisely dispose of his Army, in making it into Briggads, that coming unto the action, he should not neede to thinke on the <hi>Theorie,</hi> when it were time to practise, as many young Commanders are forced to doe, beginning to learne of others, that which is defective in themselves, who are to be pittied, that undertake to leade others being ignorant themselves: but this wise Generall, at this time, did not only order his Army, as he would have them to stand in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> Battaile, but also knowing the gifts, and severall parts, his chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the field were indued with, he disposeth of them, in appointing such places for them, in fighting against their enemies, as did best befit their vertues, which all he knew before hand, partly by his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and partly, by enquiring of others, their qualities and vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundo,</hi> his Majesty doth forecast with himselfe, what the enemy, being strong might intend against him, and accordingly, he fore-saw wisely how to prevent him, in dividing his Army, by sending the Felt-marshall on the one side of the <hi>Oder</hi> with a part of his Army, going himselfe on the other, leaving the bridge and passage at <hi>Swede</hi> well fortified and beset with Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to the end, that which of both Armies might be constrained to retire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the bridge, being safe might then conveniently joyne with the other.</p>
               <p>As his Majesty was wise in fore-seeing what might happen, he was also diligent, in taking time of his enemies on the sudden, before they could come together; so that after this victory obtained, his Majesty did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get elbow roome by the enemies removing over the <hi>Elve</hi> and the <hi>Oder</hi>; but also he did gaine time to settle his affaires with the Princes; for those who would not before this victory, scarce keepe correspondence with his Majesty, afterwards his Majesty having freed their country from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they were then content to intreate for his friendship, by their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and he like to a cunning gamster, taking the Ball at the right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, embraced their friendship, and confederacy, having bound them

                  </gap>ded, and consequently their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons confused, and their enemies, though weake instruments, by the power of the God of Armies were made strong and couragious, for punishing them in repaying of their former Barbarity, and cruelty used by them at new <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> where we see, the lord repayeth their wickednesse, when they least expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiffenbacke,</hi> the Felt-marshall was much to blame for his command, being so strong within the Towne as we were without, that he did not adventure to fight us in the fields, or at least, to have tried our conduct and valour, with a strong party: his not daring to adventure with us made us the more couragious and resolute to seeke him, though with disadvantage, having once found him to be a timorous enemy, keeping himselfe close within walles, for we know well, the greater his strength was within, if once we entred, his confusion would be the greater: for a multitude within a strength espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially horsemen, many servants and baggage breede ever confusion, for avoiding whereof, the Governour had the more reason to have tried us in the fields, whereby he had encouraged his Garrison, who seeing he durst adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to meete us without, being retired, they would not be afraid within walles.</p>
               <p>So it is never good to resolve to be alwayes the defender, but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the time, and circumstances, sometimes to try Fortune, as well by pursuing, as by defending, that our credit may not be called in question, neither for too much slownesse, nor for too much forwardnesse, but still to presse for the Mediocrity, being the true vertue of Fortitude, without which no Souldier can attaine commendation, if he doe participate of either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, as this Felt-marshall did, staying within walles. Yet some, I know will object, that I ought rather to praise the actions of the enemy, to make ours the more glorious, to which I answer, ours at all times, as here, were so splendid, that no Lustre could be added unto them, our Leader <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stavus</hi> being <hi>Illustrissimus</hi> himselfe, and the favourite of Fortune, to whom all things succeeded fortunatly by taking of time, the most pretious of all things, especially in warres, which sometimes helpes as much as vertue it selfe.</p>
               <p>The forwardnesse and courage of Major <hi>Iohn Sinclaire,</hi> and of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, Lievetenant <hi>Heatlie,</hi> is not to be over-past, they being the first gave good example to enter this Towne, in going over the walles with ladders, with a weake party of fifty musketiers, that ventured to follow them, which were hardly received by the enemies horsemen, neverthelesse they valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously defended themselves, and made their enemies to retire with losse, so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15340:83"/>
that, as my intention here, is not to over-praise my friends vertue, I would not on the other part be silent in giving them their due, answerable to their merits, and no more.</p>
               <p>We see also by experience dayly, that at all times, as here, no man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver served God for nought, who rewardeth men, though not through me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in respect of his God-head, of whom we can merit nothing, yet of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit bounty is ever ready to reward them truely that doe serve him: his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with his Army having served God in the morning, at night he was made victorious over his enemies.</p>
               <p>And that his Majesty in the afternoone on the Sabboth pursued his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> there was a necessity in it: Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> Army being on their march for the reliefe of the Towne, his Majesty was forced to take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of time, which once being past doth never returne.</p>
               <p>Here we may see the evill, that feare bringeth within a City or Strength causing disorder and confusion, but if all those within this Towne had stood to their defen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This vice of avarice is alike common to the superiour Officer, and to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> inferiour Souldier, which oftimes makes the superiour to be despised as well by the common Souldier, as by his betters: And therefore publique imployments of command should never be given to such greedy persons; for as sparing in a private person is commendable, being done without hurt to another; even so the vertue of liberality is due to him that is publiquely imployed: as also he ought to have splendor in his carriage, and not to give evill example to others his inferiours, if once he be honoured with command in leading of others. I must then againe condemne this kinde of avarice, that makes men for booty abandon their Colours and their duety, they being the cause oftimes of the overthrow of their worthy Camerades standing to fight, when they were employed in making of booty, for which many time, they are contemned, and their money taken from them by the multitude, with disgrace and danger of their lives: for though sometimes they make booty, they have not the fortune to enjoy it one quarter of an houre, thanking God to be rid of it with their lives, though not with their credits.</p>
               <p>It is the duety of valiant Commanders, and of brave Souldiers, when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15340:84"/>
ever fire entreth into a City, strength or Leager, suddenly with their Armes to repaire to their Colours, lest at such times, the enemy being neere hand should be ready to take advantage: but here the baser sort of Souldiers, neither for obedience to his Majesties command, nor for love of their Officers, nor of their owne credits, would stirre to attend their Colours, though the enemy had shewed himselfe to pursue the City.</p>
               <p>Here also, the enemy was to blame, for leaving provision and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion behinde them, whose duety it was rather to destroy it by fire or water, then to leave it to their enemies.

               <p>THE fifth of Aprill 1631. his Majesty having left <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder</hi> well beset, under the command of Generall Major <hi>Lesly,</hi> who had direction to see the fortifications repaired, as likewise, Generall <hi>Bannier</hi> was left to command over the Army, his Majesty having taken two and twenty hundred commanded musketiers, eight hundred horsemen, twelve peece of Cannon great and small, with Amunition answerable, with spades, shovels, and axes, where the Colonell of the Artillery called <hi>Leonard Richardson,</hi> was commanded to goe with them for to attend his charge: As also Colonell <hi>Hepburne</hi> was commanded to leade the party, and I was sent as Lievetenant Colonell, to second him in this employment. Colonell <hi>Hepburne</hi> having viewed the party, and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that all things were in good order, commanded the party to march, having had a blacke-smith, that dwel't at <hi>Landsberg,</hi> for our guide, we continued our march, the first day, being come within foure miles of the Towne, we quartered at a passe on the high way, and the next morning breaking up, we marched forwards, till on the way, our fore-troopes did meete with a Regiment of <hi>Crabbats,</hi> where, after long skirmish and losse sustained by both the parties, in th'end, the Colonell that led the <hi>Crabbats</hi> being deadly wounded, retired to the Towne, casting off all bridges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, which hindered us for a day.</p>
               <p>The eight of Aprill, we lay downe before a skonce royall, built on a strong passe, betwixt us and the Towne. This skonce well fortified was well provided of Cannon; It had also a wide Graffe of running water, and a draw-bridge, which was taken up at our coming, and then they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Cannon on us; where at first there were killed some six Souldiers: the night drawing on, our watches set forth, I was appointed by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to be Captaine of the watch, being ordained to oversee the making of the Batteries: As also I was commanded to set forwards our workes, both for intrenching, and for running our lines of approach to the skonce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was so busied, that the whole night I went never off my feete, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15340:84"/>
from one part to another, having had sundry Alarums, though not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
               <p>His Majestie having taken quarters in the neerest Dorpe, he left two Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to attend on me, that if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d finding them not so farre advanced as he did expect, he falls a chiding of me, notwithstanding of my diligence used the whole night, in keeping the Souldiers still at worke, with the small number of materialls we had to worke with. But no excuse, though true, would mitigate his passion, till he had first considered on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and then he was sorry he had offended me without reason. But his custome was so, that he was worse to be pleased in this kinde, than in any other his Commands; being ever impatient, when workes were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to his minde, and the truth is, our Country Souldiers cannot endure to worke like the <hi>Dutch</hi>; neither when they have taken paines, can they worke so formally as others.</p>
               <p>Our batteries being readie against the morning, the whole day our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non played on the Skonce so fast, as they could be charged, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the earthen wall being so thicke and so well set together, that they scorned us and our Cannon both.</p>
               <p>His Majestie seeing nothing to be effectuated this way, resolved to try a second way, by the advise of the Black-smith, that knew all the passages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Towne, notwithstanding that the whole land on that side was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with water: This Black-smith advised his Majestie, to cause a Float-bridge to be made, and then setting over the water, he would lead us through shallow passes, where we might come behinde the Skonce, cutting off their passage from the Towne, and then the Skonce wanting reliefe might be ours.</p>

               <p>In this time <hi>Dowbatle</hi> his Dragoniers having followed the enemy with hot skirmish within shot of their walles, his powder being spent, desired I should fall on and relieve him and his, as I did, continuing the service till we made the enemy retire over a bridge that was hard by the Towne, so that I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for our owne safeties, having lost divers Souldiers, that were killed with the Cannon, to divide my Souldiers, making the halfe of them to cast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THis Towne of <hi>Lansberg</hi> being a Frontier Garrison lying neare the borders of <hi>Pole</hi> on the <hi>Wert,</hi> the having of it made <hi>Pomeren</hi> sure, and the <hi>Marke,</hi> giving unto his Majestie the freer passage unto <hi>Silesia</hi>; and therefore it was that his Majestie did use the greater diligence and celeritie in obtaining of it, with as great honour and reputation, as could be imagined, in respect of the inequalitie of strength betwixt us and our enemies: As also in consideration of the situation of the place, being on the one side fortified
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15340:85"/>
by nature, yet beyond nature and probabilitie of reason. This strong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was forced to yeeld to <hi>Gustavus,</hi> who was <hi>Mars</hi> his Minion, and Fortunes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Favourite, or rather their Master, as we see by his frequent Victories obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against his enemies, who, though strongest, are made to submit to the weakest partie, where we may see, that as industry is fruitfull, so there is a kinde of a good Angell, as it were waiting ever upon diligence, carrying a Lawrell in his hand, to crowne her. And therefore it was, that they said of old, that Fortune should not be prayd unto, but with hands in motion, which made this valiant King love ever to be busied in vertues exercise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a Generall, that carried a minde as this Invincible King did, while he lived, still rising to blessednesse and contentation.</p>
               <p>It is commonly seene, that those who feare least are commonly overcome, as became of <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> and this Towne also: and though victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we see be from God, yet to overcome an enemy, the courage and skill of Commanders is very requisit and necessary. And where good military dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> is observed, as was done here; there confidence doth arise, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us, we can doe what we please. Of this opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion was our Leader, and our Armie never doubted of their owne valour, nor of their Leaders good Conduct, which made our Victories the easier to be gotten.</p>
               <p>Here also we see the goodnesse of intelligence; for had his Majestie not gotten the Black-smith, or some other like unto him, to have beene intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer and guide to winne through the shallow Trinkets he led us, to the Damme upon the head of their Watch, who were surprized; hardly could we have overcome this Towne, on such a sudden, for without this good of intelligence, which is so necessary, and of so great a moment in warres, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little can be effectuated in unknowne places. For good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers are so requisit in an Armie, that no meanes ought to be spared on them, providing they be trustie: for one designe or secret of our enemies well knowne, may bring all the rest we desire to a wished end, or at least, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us and ours from danger. This Black-smith, that was our guide in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us towards our enemy, at our first on-going on service, the enemy play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard with Muskets, neverthelesse he went on without feare, under-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king alike danger with our selves, but finding in time of hot service some fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling besides him, our powder being a little wet, and not giving so good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as the enemies did, he then said, he would returne to his Majestie, and send us better powder, yet I thinke, though here there did appeare some lacke of constant resolution in him, that time, exercise, and frequency of danger would make him a brave fellow, being of a strong and a good able body, but in my opinion, the stoutest of men, till they be a little acquainted with the furious noise of the Cannon, will naturally feare and stoope at the first.</p>
               <p>Likewise his Majestie was to be commended for his diligence by night and by day, in setting forwards his workes; for he was ever out of patience, till once they were done, that he might see his Souldiers secured and guarded from their enemies; for when he was weakest, he digged most in the ground; for in one yeare what at <hi>Swede, Francford, Landsberg, Brandenburg, Verb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m, Tannermonde, Wittenberg,</hi> and <hi>Wirtzburg,</hi> he caused his Souldiers to worke more for nothing, than the States of <hi>Holland</hi> could get wrought in three yeares, though they should bestow every yeare a Tunne of gold: and this he did, not onely to secure his Souldiers from the enemy, but also to keepe them from idlenesse. When they were not employed on service, they were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15340:86"/>
kept by good discipline in awe and obedience, and that with as great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, love and discretion as could be.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And his Majestie knew well, that our Nation was of that nature, that they could take to heart the austere carriage of their Commanders, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so good. For while as sometimes, through his Majesties impatiencie, he would cause to imprison some of our Country-men, without solicitation, his Majestie was ever the first did minde their liberties; for he knew their stomacks were so great, that they would burst or starve in prison, before they would acknowledge an errour committed against their Master, except it were of negligence.</p>
               <p>Moreover, nothing can more discourage a Citie, Fort, or Strength, that is beleaguered, than when they see their secrets discovered, and their passages from reliefe cut off; as it was seene of those that yeelded up the Skonce to Sir <hi>Iohn Hepburne,</hi> being contented to come in the Colonells mercy, seeing themselves barred from all reliefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Likewise the dutie of Leaders, that lead men on service, ought to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with discretion, and not to advance further than with conveniency they may retire againe, if need be, left by too farre advancing, they not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger themselves, but also ingage others, for their reliefes, to indanger all: and a fault committed in this kinde, through too much forwardnesse, merits a harder censure, than remissenesse with discretion, seeing in the latter, a man is but censured alone, but committing the former errour, he loseth himselfe and others.</p>
               <p>Here also we found by experience, that the spade and the shovell are ever good companions in danger, without which, we had lost the greatest part of our followers. Therefore in all occasions of service, a little advantage of ground is ever profitable against horse, foote, or Cannon. And for this it was, that the best Commanders made ever most use of the spade and the shovell, and that in such ground as was found most commodious for their safeties.</p>
               <p>We see also here his Majesties disposition in entertaining his Officers kindly after victory, esteeming them not as servants, but as companions in his mirth, as a wise Master ought and should doe to those he findes obedient to his Commandements, incouraging them another time to undergoe any service or danger for his sake, that was so kinde and familiar with them, joyning their hearts as well with his love, as with his bountie; for he knew well nothing was more able to bring victory next under God, than good Commanders: As also his Majestie knew, that to be courteous unto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers was the way to triumph over his enemies.</p>

               <p>Here we see the inconstancy of the Dukes friendship, that will not be friends as well in adversity, as in prosperity: for when fortune favours us; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> all the world would seme to laugh on us; but when we are but once kik't in the heele with any malignant chance of misfortune, then our supposed friends fly from us, at a farre distance, while they see us like to be tossed by the Tempest of adversity. But as soone as they see the Tempest over-past, and fortune beginning to smile on us againe, then begin they (as the Princes did) to returne, and to desire to be made partakers of our good fortunes, though they had no minde to taste of the bitter cup of his Majesties adversity; but once seeing the sweete commodity of the peace, which they, their country and subjects did reape by his Majesties valour (with the hazard of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the lives of many Cavaliers who followed him) then their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15340:87"/>
being farre removed from them, they desire his Majesty for their Admirall, to attend when he makes saile, having seene he did valiantly ride out the storme, promising againe when his sailes were full, to bide by him; and to follow him till death should sunder them. But if they had bin gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously minded, they had imbraced the danger, and taken part with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty when honour was to be got, in the middest of greatest danger; since common danger doth conjoyne the coldest friends, to goe together against their common enemies. Likewise here we may see and observe a Royall King most loyall in keeping his Princely Parole and promise to the Duke his brother, in rendring backe <hi>Spandaw,</hi> though to his disadvantage, keeping his covenant, albeit he should lose thereby, teaching, by his owne example, all Cavaliers to keepe their word, though given to their enemies. For his Majesty knew well, that nothing was to be thought more unworthy in a Prince or common-weale, then to breake word or promise; for of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in a Prince truth is the chiefest, which once being lost returnes not againe.</p>
               <p>His Majesty taking to heart, that the Duke had so peremptorily sought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> the restitution of this strength, his Majesty being free of his word, and his Garrison march't forth, he incontinent marched to <hi>Berlin,</hi> and got both the Duke and the City into his power, in interchange of the Castle of <hi>Spandaw,</hi> which then his Majesty knew how to get againe, as he did shortly after. Where we may see, there is no Oratory of such force to gaine both men and women, as a strong well conducted Army, as this was.</p>
               <p>Here also we may see, what evill oftimes doth happen by cunctation, or delayes, as doth witnesse the overthrow and ruine of <hi>Madeburg,</hi> the Citizens whereof, in their prosperity, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At this time a great number of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> marchants, amongst which were some <hi>English,</hi> going by the Army with great packes, were seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their goods taken from them, whereof his Majesty being made foreseene, orders were given, that the whole packs, under paine of death, should be brought to his Majesty, as they were, our Army being very hungry, and almost brought to discontent, for lacke of monies, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in a faire way, was content to restore the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> goods, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the marchants amongst them would advance upon Band and surety, to

               </p>
               <p>This kinde of favour showne to Marchants by Souldiers occurres not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: for sometimes the Souldiers (the worst sort of them) measured the packes belonging to the Marchants with the long ell, and if this sort of dealing should but only happen to the churlish Marchant, it were the lesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> to be regarded; but honest Souldiers should be ever honest in their dealings towards the rancke Merchants, that have worth and discretion to respect Cavaliers being in neede, and common Souldiers also, as I have knowne by experience some worthy <hi>English</hi> Marchants to have done worthily, in relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the necessities of the common Souldiers of their country-men, and therefore in my esteeme, of all Nations, for their charity, they doe best merit the name of gentlemen Marchants.</p>
               <p>We see also here, that notwithstanding of the termes his Majesty did stand unto with the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> and with <hi>Tillie,</hi> who might have come to have made a visit in <hi>Brandenburg</hi> his lands, where our Army were laid in quarters: Neverthelesse, his Majesty was not afraid to leave his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to returne to <hi>Statin</hi> to give presence to the <hi>Russian</hi> Ambassadour, and to dispatch him; being alike ready to Governe the affaires of the state, as he was to fight against his enemies, he staied not long, but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected his forces, that were come from <hi>Sweden, Spruce</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>; giving them orders to march to old <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> his Majesty getting intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence <hi>Tillie</hi> was gone from <hi>Hessen,</hi> he then begun to make the best use of the time.</p>

               <p>THE first of Iuly, the <hi>Swedens</hi> of <hi>Axellily</hi> his Regiment, that lay in <hi>Barnoe,</hi> and we did breake up, having got orders to march to old <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> being appointed then for the Generall Randevouz of our Army to come together at. This <hi>Barnoe</hi> is a Towne in the Marke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> renowned of old, for brewing of good beere, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our residence there with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> we did merrily try, till that we had both quarrelling and swaggering amongst our selves, who before our departure againe were made good friends, reserving our enmity, till we saw our common enemy, and so we marched together following our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders towards old <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> taking but easie marches, being without feare of an enemy, and being tied to no particular diet, we tooke quarters, where we found the best entertainment to be, either in Dorpe or Towne.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding our easie march and good quarters, there were some under both the Regiments unworthy the name of good Souldiers, who in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15340:88"/>
their march leaving their Colours, and staying behinde did plunder, and oppresse the <hi>Boores,</hi> for remedy whereof, the Souldiers being complained on, accused and convicted, they were made, for punishment to suffer Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, where they were well whip't for their insolency.</p>
               <p>Likewise on this march, some of our Souldiers in their rancks, their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> Colours flying, did beate one another, for which over-sight I did cashiere a Sergeant, after I had cut him over the head, for suffering such abuse to have beene done in his presence, where such insurrection, amongst Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being in their armes, might have brought the whole Regiment into factions, where I alone was too weake, for all my authority, to command them asunder. And therefore such faults ought ever to be suppressed at first, and to be stilled by any Officer, that chanceth to be neerest him, who did give the first evill example.</p>
               <p>Having marched three dayes, the fourth we arrived at <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the Pest raging in extremity of the heate in the City, we were commanded to quarter without in the fields, and presently there was a certaine quantity of the workes about the Leaguer appointed for us, within foure dayes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and make ready: during which time, <hi>Robert Monro</hi> Furer to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Hector</hi> his Colours, died of the Pest, and was much regrated, being a youth of good hopes.</p>

               <p>THIS Regiment in nine yeeres time, under his Majesty of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> and in <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> had ever good lucke to get good quarters, where they did get much good wine, and great quantity of good beere, beginning first with <hi>Hamburg</hi> beere in <hi>Holsten,</hi> and after that in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> they had plenty of <hi>Rustocke</hi> beere, and now at <hi>Barnoe,</hi> and thereafter they tasted the good <hi>Calvinists</hi> beere at <hi>Serbest,</hi> and our march continuing out of low <hi>Germany,</hi> towards the upper <hi>Circles</hi> of the Empire, as in <hi>Franconia, Swabland, Elsas</hi> and the <hi>Pultz,</hi> they were oft merry with the fruits and juice of the best berries that grew in those Circles, for to my knowledge, they never suffered either penury or want, I being the Leader, but oftimes I did complaine and grieve at their plenty, seeing they were better to be commanded, when they dranke water, then when they got too much beere or wine. But my choice of all beeres is <hi>Serbester</hi> beere, being the wholsomost for the body, and cleerest from all filth or barme, as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15340:89"/>
is best for the soule, and cleerest from the dregs of superstition.</p>
               <p>Being once at dinner with the Rex Chancellor of <hi>Sweden,</hi> having drunke good <hi>Seebester</hi> beere, he asked me what I thought of that beere; I answered it pleased my taste well, he replied merrily, no wonder it taste well to your palat, being it is the good beere of your ill religion. I asked his Excellence how the good wine on the Rhine would taste at <hi>Mentz,</hi> being the good wine of a worse religion; he answered, he liked the wine and the beere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than both the Religions. But I said, to be his Excellence neighbour, neare <hi>Mentz</hi> in the <hi>Paltz,</hi> at <hi>Crewtsenach,</hi> I would be content to keepe mine owne Religion, and to drinke good Rhinish wine for my life time.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Nothing is more necessary on a march, then to keepe good discipline, without which there is no order, nor feare of God amongst Officers, that will suffer their Souldiers to grinde the faces of the poore by oppression, from whence oftimes doth come the unfortunat, and unhappy events of warlike enterprises and expeditions: for where the feare of God is taken away, there the common-weale must needes decay, and then the ruine of the people doth follow.</p>
               <p>Likewise we see here, that all that come to the warres, (as many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men doe thinke) are not killed, but some die, through one kinde of death, and some by another; so that we ought ever be prepared and ready, not knowing how, when, or where to die. Happy then is that man, that is prepared to die, as if he should die to morrow; for many have I seene rise well in the morning (the time of these warres) who went not to bed at night. Our care then should be still, to meditate on the end, that it may be good, and then doubtlesse we shall die well.</p>
               <p>The infection being great at this time, in <hi>Brandenburg</hi> I contracted a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine fit of sicknesse, that was vehement, and therefore did not continue above forty eight houres: It was so vehement, that if I had not suddenly overcome it, doubtlesse it had overcome me, but praised be God, then I banished death by imagination, as I did divers times before, yet at last, I know he will have about with me, but my confidence is, that by the helpe of the Conqueror I will overcome him in th'end, as my Captaine and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath done, who is gone before me, and opened a Dore to me to enter at, where I may sing Triumphing over my enemies, with those that follow the Lambe in the Communion of the Saints blessed for ever.</p>

               <p>AT this time I did remarke the great, wonderfull, rare and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mercy of God towards our Leader the Kings Majesty, and his Royall little Army, which, before our removing from old <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> was much infected with the plague of Pestilence, so that we knew not the sicke from the whole: for of our Regiment alone, there died in one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> weeke, above thirty Souldiers, and being but removed six dayes, at our downe-lying at <hi>Werben,</hi> we scarce knew there was any infection amongst us, so that in a moneths time, we were miraculously rid of it, and for mine owne part, I neither know, nor can conjecture any reason for it (cheifely being in the dogge dayes, and in a Leaguor) but the Lords mercy towards his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and his Army, being at this time, farre inferiour in strength to our enemies.</p>

               <p>Likewise here I did rejoyce, and was glad, when I did observe that it is not, nor was not peculiar to any still to have overcome, or to be victorious: the Emperialists, I know by experience, and so did the Regiment I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, had their time of the victory against the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> (where I did learne to make a retreate) but now being come under another Leader, there Fortune began to change and to retire from us, we learning under the invincible <hi>Gustavus,</hi> to advance orderly, never falling off, but ever keeping faces to our enemy, a brave lesson learned from a brave Commander. So that we see here, victory keepes no constant dwelling, being now here, now there, yet we see, that it is best kept with counsell and vertue, neither can I thinke, but fortune, and chance hath a great hand in it, for it is a greater matter to use victory well, then to overcome, and all victors have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable desire of their prosperous fortune, never appointing an end to their desires; And nothing brings victory more, next unto God, then good Commanders, whereof King <hi>Gustavus</hi> the invincible had many.</p>
               <p>Here also at the intaking of <hi>Hagleberg,</hi> Generall <hi>Bannier</hi> did well in giving the Souldiers some liberty of booty: to the end they might prove the more resolute another time, for Souldiers will not refuse to undergoe any hazard, when they see their Officers willing to reward them with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit.</p>

guarded by the River on one side, and the foreside was guarded by a long ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Dike, which of old was made to hold off the River from the Land, which Dike his Majestie made use of, dividing it by Skonces and Redoubts, which defended one another with Flanckering, having Batteries and Cannon set within them, alongst the whole Leaguer: he did also set over the River a Ship-bridge, for his Retreate in neede, as also for bringing commodiously of provision and succours, from the Country, and Garrisons on the other side, as <hi>Hagleberg, Rateno, Perleberg,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>In like manner his Majestie did fortifie the Towne of <hi>Werben</hi> for his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin,</hi> being close to the Leaguer, with workes about it, which defended the Leaguer, and the Leaguer-workes were made to defend the Towne also, so that they could relieve one another being in most distresse, and both the Towne-wall and Leaguer-wall, were so thicke and firme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bulwarkes on which the Batteries were made for the Cannon, were also very strong and formally built, and they flanckered one another, so that none could finde but folly in pressing to enter by storme; And betwixt the flanckerens were left voides, for letting Troopes of horse in and out, with slawght Bommes before them, where strong guards were kept for defending the passage.</p>

               <p>The manner we were ordained to watch this Leaguer, every Briggad of foote had such a portion of the Leaguer appointed for them to watch and maintaine by fight, in case of a storme, which part they had fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and Briggads of horse were ordained to attend particularly on a foote Briggad, to second them, if that the enemy, at a storme, should beate the foot backe from their Poasts, then the horse Briggad was ready to charge, till the foote might be recollected by the diligence and valour of their Officers: for besides the watch ordinary on the Poasts, the whole Briggads of foote stood in readinesse at all Alarums behinde the guard, and the horse Briggads did stand in Battaile behinde them. Likewise without the Leaguer, there were squadrons of our horsemen to stand in readinesse at one end, that while as the enemies foote should march on to the storme, our horsemen might charge through to the end of the Leaguer, where they were to be received againe within the Leaguer, being hardly followed, so that the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can easily judge, what a difficultie it was to storme such a Leaguer.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> His Majestie as soone as he came backe, did send incontinent Orders to all the chiefe Officers of the Armie, to come instantly to his Tent, where being come, he asked their advice, whether it were best, the enemy being strong, timely to retire over the <hi>Elve,</hi> or that he should bide their coming before the Leaguer, and finding no man to answer him, all turning it over upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, being wise, knowing that Counsell would be allowed of by a King, but according to event; But his Majestie perceiving their intentions, he resolved to abid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HIS Majestie wisely made choice of a fit place for his Leaguer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commodious for transportation of victualls unto his Armie, without being in danger of his enemies. In like manner we see his Majesties wisedome in making his friends sure behinde him (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Pomeren</hi> and <hi>Machlenburg,</hi> from whence his victualls and his supplies must needs come, and as his Leaguer was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for furnishing the Armie, so it was commodiously situated for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against the enemy, the one halfe, or backe, being naturally defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the course of the water running by; and on the other side, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Towne, and by the helpe of the old Dike, which easily was fortified.</p>
               <p>His Majesties wisedome also was seene, by keeping of his Souldiers still in Action, never suffering them to be idle (as a wise Generall ought to doe) for either they were imployed on marches, or lying still, in working, or in fighting by parties, or in grosse, as occasion offered: For this Generall knew well, that he was but the carrion of a man, and not a man, that did live idle, having in a living body but a dead minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Here also I did remarke and observe, <hi>Homo homini quid interest:</hi> for we finde a great difference betwixt his Majesties welcoming of <hi>Tilly</hi> to <hi>Werben,</hi> and the Felt-marshall <hi>Twifenbacke</hi> his welcome made to his Majestie before <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder</hi>; who never did present himselfe in the Fields, though almost as strong as we were: but here we finde the contrary, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of <hi>Tillies</hi> strength, being twenty-six thousand men, <hi>Gustavus</hi> was not afraid to have invaded his fore-Troopes with a weake partie, and did defeate them; shewing unto us the difference betwixt Commanders, by his owne valourous example, incouraging his little Armie before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Teaching others, by their examples, not to trust too much in securitie, be the place never so strong, if they be left unto themselves, and grow carelesse, they must needs suffer under the Tyranny of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Likewise his Majestie, not trusting to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> owne wisedome, he did call his chiefe Officers to Counsell, asking them, what was to be done (as wise Commanders ought to doe) and finding them all by silence to relie on his Majesties will, giving Orders for all things that were to be done before their coming, he resolved to stand to it, being truely couragious, as he did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture rashly, without asking his Officers advice, knowing once their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution agreeable to his owne, he was not inconsiderately afraid of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies strength, though mightie and strong, neither was he unprovided against their coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:15340:92"/>His Majesties dexteritie of Command is seene here, by the order of his discipline, in giving good orders for watching: First he divided the Postes, and appointed what footmen or Briggad should watch on the severall Posts, as they were severally fortified by themselves, to the end, no man might blame their owne worke, for insufficiency to hold out the enemy. As also he appointed severall Briggads of horse to second the Postes severally, every one knowing where to repaire in time of service: As also he did instruct them of the manner they were to fight, in resisting the enemies entry: As also in case of their entry, he did instruct both foote and horse, how and in what manner they should be repulsed againe, promising, according to his wonted Custome, to be a Companion both of their travells and dangers, and that he should never leave them, till first they should quit him, and that he would promise as he was a Royall King.</p>
               <p>A worthy saying of a worthy King and Generall, whose prudence and wisedome in Command, was ever answerable to the dignitie of his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> person, that ought and should be endued with infinite vertues, since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite were those things he had to foresee, and which are needfull for a man of his place. Infinite chances, and altogether divers, every moment were set before him, in so much, that <hi>Argos Eyes</hi> were too few for him, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the weight of his Command, but also in respect of the wit and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which was requisit for him.</p>
               <p>All other commands belonging to a Souldier are so inferiour to this of a Generall, that almost they are nothing in respect of this, who amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his great gifts, he must know severly to command, and softly to beare with others. As also, he must learne patiently to give place to others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, and he must not onely be powerfull to strengthen for his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, but also he must weaken his enemies, and chiefely, he must make warre by policy, without giving battell, or travell (as this wise Generall did deale twice with old <hi>Tillie</hi>) who was forced after a long march, having but visited him, and seene his orders, to retire againe, with the losse of many men, without any detriment or hurt at all to his Majesties owne litle Army, which he kept ever to the best, by preserving them from their enemies, and by supplying of them, as they became weake, so that their weaknesse could never be truly discerned. Who would not then admire the wisdome and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of this Generall, in preserving this little Army, at this time, for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fitter occasion?

               <p>HIS Majesty, like a wise and prudent Generall, we see would not sturre from his Leaguer at <hi>Werben,</hi> till first he was made certaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> by good intelligence, of his enemies designe, counsell and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which being well knowne, his Majesty then resolved, by preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, to make them unprofitable: and truly the discoverer of such, plots and counsells ought to be well rewarded, seeing by the discovery of our enemies designes, we were made to resist dis intended evill against us. Happy therefore are those intelligences that come in time, and there ought to be no delay used, in taking that counsell that cannot be praised, till the turne be done, and things once deliberated should be quickly done, and though he be a brave fellow, who doubts in advising, yet in action he ought to be confident, as <hi>Gustavus</hi> was, getting intelligence of the enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe with celerity, he tooke his horses and Dragoniers with him, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his foote and Cannon, he advanced to the passe of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> for to prevent <hi>Tillie,</hi> who was striving to make the Duke turne <hi>Emperialist</hi>; but <hi>Gustavus</hi> wisely taking the ball at the right rebound, he did turne the Duke, by Gods providence, both soule and body good <hi>Swede.</hi> Where cleerely we may see the Lords powerfull hand and providence in this, as in all humane affaires, suffering things sometimes to take delayes. Notwithstanding of mans instant urging, the Lord deferres to his appointed time, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be given unto himselfe alone, and not to mans wit or policy. For as the Rudder in a ship doth with a little motion governe all the ship: even so, God the director and governour of the world, doth move the whole, himselfe not sturring. And as there is one God in the heavens, that governes all the frame of the earth: so the Lord hath his Substitutes on earth, whom he hath made above their fellowes in judgment, and heroike vertues, yet he himselfe keepes the Prerogative above them all in commanding them, to let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> us see, that all the event, and conclusions of Kings projects and intentions, be they never so powerfull, availe nothing to the furtherance of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till they first acknowledge them to come from the fountaine God, that distributes them againe on his servants, when he pleaseth, that they may learne to glorify him, and not their owne wit or policy, which is so much as nothing, till he consent. This God then, the author and doer of all things (and of this union and confederacy) that eternall (I say) and provident God-head, that governes the motions of the Heavens, the starres variable cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Elementary changes, all things above, and beneath the earth, ruling and governing, spreading, where he pleaseth his light beames from his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with a winke, piercing into the Bowells of heaven, earth and sea, he doth not only goe before them, but in them, seeing and knowing all, and governing them all, his will is so, that he converts our noisomnesse unto health, and our sinnes being ill, he turnes them unto our good: that eternall Governour triumphs in the Chariot of his providence, and if willingly we follow him, then freely, as his Souldiers, if unwillingly, we must follow him, as captives and servants. We see then here by Gods providence, the Duke was contented to joyne his Army with the Kings Majesties Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> to goe <hi>Conjunctis viribus</hi> against their common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Catholique league.</p>

But now the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> terrified by their example, thinkes it better to prevent such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wound, by joyning with his Majesty, being made warie by others fall: for it is better late to thrive then never, and it is better to prevent evill, then to suffer; and it was better for the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> to blush in time, then out of time to grow pale; for now being taken at the rebound, <hi>Tillies</hi> Army being at <hi>Lipsigh,</hi> seing his own house on fire to be relieved, he offers his service to his Majesty, damning himselfe, soule and body, if ever he will forsake his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and his Crowne, if then he would but helpe him to beate the enemy out of his country againe: So that he, which could not be tied with one knot before, is now hard tied by foure great points, which he was made to condescend unto, on his honour and credit, to have bin kept unviolable. And his Majesty getting him once thus bound, the way to make him sure, was to make him fight, that having dipped his hands once in the bloud of his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies, he was not suddenly to be clensed, and this was the manner to tye him harder, then the custome was of old amongst the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were wont (when they entred in confederacy) to draw bloud in a Goblet of both their browes, and drinke of it mutually, for the more strict observance of their fidelities to each others. But shortly after this confederacy was made, much <hi>German</hi> bloud was drawne, and of other strangers bloud, to make the tie so much the harder, and before the tie was broke, his Majesties bloud was shed, to the perpetuall disgrace of him, that after his Majesties death, forgetting his honour and credit, did violate his confederacy made with the crowne, as with the King our Master, of never dying memory.</p>

The ceremony past, we were all remitted to take rest for that night in our former quarters: the next morning, by breake of day, we were called up to march, where both our Armies were ordained to march on severall streets; one Randezvouz being appointed for us at night, within a mile and a halfe of the enemies Armie; where being come to our Randezvouz by foure a clocke in the after-noone, and drawne up in battaile; our guards drawne out to watch, were directed to their Postes, and then we resting by our Armes, as we were in battaile, we slept lying where we stood, that in case of a Alarum, we were not to be found in disorder, being ready to fight where we stood.</p>

And then I thought with my selfe, after I had awaked from sleepe, going on to march, that my life was much like a tale, and that we should not care how long this life of ours should last, but that wee should bee carefull, how well our life should bee acted: for it is no matter, where wee end, if wee end well; and we should not aske, when, or where, but we ought to bee ever mindfull, how wee are prepared going to fight. Nature did beget us miserable, we live over-burthened with cares, and like a flower, wee vanish soone away, and dye. Our hunting then here, and our care should bee onely for a perpetuall good name to leave behind us, that so being absent wee are present, and being dead, wee live.</p>

               <p>Our Horsemen of the right wing of Finnes and Haggapells, led by the valourous Feltmarshall <hi>Horne,</hi> finding the enemies Horsemen out of Order, with resolution he charged the enemies left wing, forcing them to retire dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly on their battailes of foote, which caused disorder among the foote, who were forced then to fall to the right hand; our Horsemen retiring, his Majestie seeing the enemy in disorder, played with Ordnance amongst them, during which time, the force of the enemies Battailes falls on the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> charging with Horse first in the middest of the Battailes, and then the foote giving two <hi>Salves</hi> of Musket amongst them, they were put to the Rout, horse and foote, and the enemy following them cryed <hi>Victoria,</hi> as if the

day had beene wonne, triumphing before the victory; But our Horsemen charging the remnant of their horse and foote, where their Generall stood, they were made to retire in disorder to the other hand towards <hi>Leipsigh</hi>; our Armie of foote standing firme, not having loosed one Musket; the smoake being great, by the rising of the dust, for a long time we were not able to see about us; but being cleared up, we did see on the left hand of our reserve two great Battailes of foote, which we imagined to have beene <hi>Saxons,</hi> that were forced to give ground; having heard the service, though not seene it, we found they were enemies, being a great deale neerer than the <hi>Saxons</hi> were: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> His Majestie having sent Baron <hi>Tyvell</hi> to know the certaintie, coming before our Briggad, I certified him they were enemies, and he returning towards his Majestie, was shot dead; his Majestie coming by, gave direction to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Hepburne,</hi> to cause the Briggads on his right and left wing to wheele, and then to charge the enemy, the Orders given, his Majestie retired, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to bring succours unto us.</p>
               <p>The enemies Battaile standing firme, looking on us at a neere distance, and seeing the other Briggads and ours wheeleing about, making front unto them, they were prepared with a firme resolution to receive us with a salve of Cannon and Muskets; but our small Ordinance being twice discharged amongst them, and before we stirred, we charged them with a salve of mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, which was repaied, and incontinent our Briggad advancing unto them with push of pike, putting one of their battailes in disorder, fell on the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, so that they were put to the route.</p>
               <p>I having commanded the right wing of our musketiers, being my Lord of <hi>Rhees</hi> and <hi>Lumsdells,</hi> we advanced on the other body of the enemies, which defended their Cannon, and beating them from their Cannon, we were masters of their Cannon, and consequently of the field, but the smoake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, the dust being raised, we were as in a darke cloude, not seeing the halfe of our actions, much lesse discerning, either the way of our enemies, or yet the rest of our Briggads: whereupon, having a drummer by me, I caused him beate the <hi>Scots</hi> march, till it cleered up, which recollected our friends unto us, and dispersed our enemies being overcome; so that the Briggad coming together, such as were alive missed their dead and hurt Camerades.</p>
               <p>Colonell <hi>Lumsdell</hi> was hurt at the first, and Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Musten</hi>

                  </gap>her Ensignes were hurt and killed, and sundry Colours were missing for that night, which were found the next day; The enemy thus fled, our horsemen were pursuing hard, till it was darke, and the blew Briggad, and the commanded musketiers were sent by his Majesty to helpe us, but before their coming, the victory and the credit of the day, as being last ingaged, was ascribed to our Briggad, being the reserve, were thanked by his Majesty for their service, in publique audience, and in view of the whole Army, we were promised to be rewarded.</p>
               <p>The Battaile thus happily wonne, his Majesty did principally under God ascribe the glory of the victory to the <hi>Sweds,</hi> and <hi>Fynnes</hi> horsemen, who were led by the valorous Felt-marshall <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi>; For though the <hi>Dutch</hi> horsemen did behave themselves valorously divers times that day; yet it was not their fortune to have done the charge, which did put the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to flight, and though there were brave Briggads of <hi>Sweds</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in the field, yet it was the <hi>Scots</hi> Briggads fortune to have gotten the praise for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15340:97"/>
the foote service: and not without cause, having behaved themselves well, being led and conducted by an expert Cavalier and fortunat, the valiant <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> being followed by Colonell <hi>Lumsdell,</hi> Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Musten,</hi> Major <hi>Monypenney,</hi> Major <hi>Sinclaire,</hi> and Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Iohn Monro,</hi> with divers others Cavaliers of valour, experience and of conduct, who thereafter were suddainely advanced unto higher charges. The victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ours, we incamped over night on the place of Battaile, the living merry and rejoycing, though without drinke at the night-wake of their dead Camerades and friends, lying then on the ground in the bed of honour, being glad the Lord had prolonged their dayes for to discharge the last honourable duty, in burying of their Camerades.</p>
               <p>Our bone-fiers were made of the enemies Amunition waggons, and Pikes left, for want of good fellowes to use them; and all this night our brave Camerades, the <hi>Saxons</hi> were making use of their heeles in flying, thinking all was lost, they made booty of our waggons and goods, too good a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for Cullions that had left their Duke, betrayed their country and the good cause, when as strangers were hazarding their lives for their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>Our losse this day with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> did not exceede three thousand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> men, which for the most part were killed by the enemies Cannon: of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Officers we lost a number, and chiefely our horsemen; as Colonell <hi>Collenbagh,</hi> Colonell <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Addergest</hi>; and of the foote Colonells, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>Tivell,</hi> being all of them brave and valorous gentlemen, we lost also foure Lievetenant Colonells, together with a number of Rutmasters, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Lievetenants and Ensignes.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were lost five Colonells, three Lievetenant Colonells, with divers Rut-masters and Captaines, and of inferiours Officers many.</p>
               <p>To the enemy were lost on the field neere eight thousand, besides Officers of note, such as the Felt-marshall <hi>Fustenberg</hi>: the Duke of <hi>Holsten,</hi> the Count of <hi>Shomeberg</hi>: old Generall <hi>Tillie</hi> hurt and almost taken; a number of other Officers of the Field were killed, and taken prisoners. They lost also thirty two peeces of Cannon, with three score waggons of Amunition, and their Generall, and <hi>Papingham</hi> were chased towards <hi>Hall,</hi> and from thence were forced with a small convoy to take their flight for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to <hi>Hamell</hi> on the <hi>Waser.</hi>

               <head>The sixteenth Observation.</head>
               <p>FIrst then we see here the goodnesse that followes on that laudable and Christian custome, used by those, that doe first begin the workes of their calling with their true humiliation to God by prayers, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their sinnes and unworthinesse, and in renouncing trust or confidence in any thing but in God alone, knowing their owne wisdome, strength and valour to be of no moment, without the speciall aide and assistance of the Almighty and powerfull God; who alone can teach our fingers to fight, giving victory with few as with many.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was that this Magnanimous and religious warriour, with his whole Army, publiquely did call on the Lord, praying for his assistance against his enemies, and for a happy event of the day, before he begun to set his Army to worke against their enemies, the enemies of God and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15340:98"/>
true Catholique and Apostolique faith; which they had endeavoured to subvert with the professors of the truth, to hold up and maintaine the man of sinne and his erronious doctrine, by the power of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of the Catholique League. We see then, this duty being religiously and piously discharged by his Majesty and his Army, the fruite was answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their desire: having obtained victory over our enemies by the good command of his Majesty, and the ready obedience, dexterity and valour of his Majesties supreme Officers of the field; who in all charges did direct those under them to the ready discharge of their duties, every one of the whole united body of the Army following the example of their head and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> Leader, the magnifick and Magnanimous King, for to abate and lay downe the pride of the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; and for to teare and strip naked that old proud and Ambitious Generall <hi>Tillie</hi> of his former glory and honour; for having bragged and vainely gloried, he had conquered two Kings before: here now the Captaine of Kings, and King of Captaines doth victoriously Triumph, having robbed him of glory, and clipped the wings of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with his little Royall Army.</p>
               <p>Likewise, next unto God, a second helpe unto this glorious victory, was the great execution made by his Majesties Cannon; and though ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Tillie</hi> did pride himselfe all his life time in the course of the warres, in his dexterity of his great Cannon; here from a Master he was turned againe unto a prentice, being cunningly over shot with Cannon, so that his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and three score waggons belonging thereto, were taken from him by <hi>Gustavus</hi> the first, and most valiant Captaine of the world, with the helpe of the nation which was never conquered by any forraine enemy, the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Scots</hi>; whose prayers to God were more effectuall through Christ, then theirs through the intercession of Saints.</p>
               <p>The third cause of this glorious victory, was his Majesties good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline houlden over the Army, horse and foote, not suffering them without great and extraordinary punishment, to oppresse the poore, which made them cry for a blessing to his Majesty and his Army.</p>
               <p>The enemy on the contrary provoked the wrath of God against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Army, for their cruelty used in torturing the poore, and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their monies from them did further their punishment, and his Majesties glorious victory.</p>
               <p>The fourth helpe to this victory, was the plottons of Musketiers, his Majesty had very wisely ordained to attend the horsemen, being a great safety for them, and a great prejudice to the enemy, the Musket ball carrying and piercing farther then the Pistolet: As also the great celerity used in charging and discharging of our small cannon brought the enemies battai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> care and diligence, that was used by his Majesty, and his Officers, in seeing and foreseeing of the defects and disorders amongst our selves; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suddenly remedied, was also a helpe to this victory: And last of all, the invincible courage and resolution both of Officers and souldiers in standing firme, Notwithstanding of the fury of their enemies; and which was more, they were no wayes dismayed or discouraged at the flight of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but thought it their greatest glory to be victorious without them; standing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutly till they saw the backe of their enemies, the undoubted tokens of their glorious victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:15340:98"/>His Majesties Army on this service as at all times, might be called truely valorous, for those are called valorous Captaines, and holden for such; that when their Camerades are flying, they notably with hands, voice and wounds (if wounded) sustaine the fight, doing at once the duty of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and of Captaines, by those meanes, bringing backe, and restoring the suspected losse unto victory, for their credits. For as ignorance doth easily precipitate men into danger, even so to a generous heart nothing can seeme difficult or fearefull, being once resolved to fall on, though towards the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> mouth of the cannon; but before resolution flesh and blood have their owne disturbances, even in the most valorous: and valorous men, as they feare nothing after resolution; so they disdaine nothing entering upon danger.</p>
               <p>Here also the resolution of our horsemen on this service was praise worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing they never loosed a pistoll at the enemy, till first they had discharged theirs: for the enemy being fierce and furious; while as ours were stout and slow, the enemy was made weary when ours were fresh, which made the enemy being weary, and charged with a fresh succour, being once set on going, they followed hard their victory, not giving them time to breath, or recollect their forces againe, till they were utterly defeated; that the night and darkenesse was their best safety. For I did observe here, that the duty of valiant Commanders is to know not onely the nature of their enemies, but also their spirit, and wherein they pride them most: we ought to make our best use for to deceive and out-shoote them in those same things wherein they delight and trust most unto. Likewise this day I did observe, that as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;"/> to great travell and paines is glory and honour, even so courage and constant valour may be attained unto by exercise in warre, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of dangers, wherein Souldiers, Companies or Briggads are used with, and made once familiar with that cruell and vehement, horrible and terrible fellow, death, having seene many dead bodies before; and being inured to bloud, such Souldiers will stand to it and desire to fight, when ignorant Novices (as the <hi>Saxons</hi> were) are afraid of death; who seeking their safety in flying, they were miserably cut downe by their enemies.</p>
               <p>I did likewise observe this day, that it is not the multitude doth the turne, but under God it is good command, good conduct, art, and skill in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the weapons of our warfare, and in taking the occasions in time that beget victory.</p>
               <p>Therefore he that would labour an Army as <hi>Gustavus</hi> did, he will finde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fruite, yea even the best that groweth under the Empire, good Rhenish and Necker wine, not onely for himselfe, but for the meanest Souldier, and that unto excesse, which hath made me sometimes complaine more of the plenty our Souldiers had after this victory, through the abuse of it, then ever I did before for any penury. He is therefore in my opinion farre deceived that thinkes that it is the time or number of yeares that makes a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; no, no, it is rather the continuall meditation of exercise and practise; for Souldiers should be in running, not in running away, as horsemen ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily doe. But on the contrary, that with the greater force they may be able to invade their enemies, as our Briggad did here, who seeing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in confusion with their Pikes charged ranne fiercely upon them till they were beaten. And surely I doe thinke no man so ignorant, but knowes that more come to be good Souldiers by exercise and frequency of danger and use, then by nature: and he is not a man that will not sweat, nor couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15340:99"/>
that eschewes danger, when hee should fight, as our <hi>Camerades</hi> did the painted Souldiers the <hi>Saxons,</hi> with their plumed Officers; which feathers served them I thinke in their flight, for tokens rather to cut them downe by, than for their safeties.</p>
               <p>Courage should growe by frequencie of danger, the onely way, in my opinion, to feare nothing, and then he may be called stout, before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of a qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrell at home, who once drawing a sworde, when he knowes of twentie Part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, or Redders, is there called stout; but when he comes abroade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the warres, at first, the thundering of the Cannon and Musket roaring in his eares makes him sicke, before he come neere danger, as I have known some: but where vertue and honour doth growe, there labour, exercise and danger is needfull: <hi>Nam ardua &amp; difficilis virtutis est via, tamen, nil tam diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile est, quod non solertia vincat</hi>; And death it selfe is never bitter, when it leaves an immortall, and glorious name behind it; <hi>Vivit enim post funera virtus: &amp; animus moderatis laboribus adjuvatur, immoderatis autem abluitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude then this observation, we see that as courage in warres is much worth, for obtaining of victory: so is the wisedome of a Generall or Leader in warres, as <hi>Gustavus</hi> was, of so much worth, even in the obtaining of this victory, that the spirit of him alone, and skill in direction, was better than thousands of armed men. The enemy being in this Battaile neere twelve thousand men, at least, stronger than we; yet <hi>Gustavus</hi> alone on our side was better, and of more worth to us, then that multitude to our enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Wee see then here, that no greater joy or pleasure can come to mortall man, than to overcome his enemy by Armes: and we see also, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he event of Battaile doth not consist in number of Fighters, but, under God, in the order and courage used in Battaile.</p>
               <p>Here also we see, that a good cause and a good quarrell is ever to be had, if thou wouldest have victory over thine enemies; and who would wish a better quarrell then we fought for, this day being for the reliefe of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed friends, and for the libertie and promotion of Christs Gospell; or who would not hazard, in such a quarrell, especially against such enemies, that had banished the daughter of our dread Soveraigne, and her royall Issue, from her Kingdome and Dignities?</p>
               <p>O would to GOD I had once such a Leader againe to fight such an other day; in this old quarrell! And though I died standing, I should be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I died well; and I wish, that as wee have received the light of truth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, that fought in that quarrell: even so we may happen to restore that light againe pleasantly; that as wee did overcome that day our carnall enemies; even so we may overcome in our last fight our spirituall enemies; that after death we may be crowned with immortall Glorie.</p>

               <head>The eighteenth Observation.</head>
               <p>THIS great Army of Generall <hi>Tillies</hi> being defeated, did seperate themselves in great Troopes and bands, especially the foote; who ought ever to stand well, and fight with courage bouldly in field, and not to suffer themselves to be rent; though the horsemen should runne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> away, and being they cannot runne so fast for their safeties; my counsell then shall be ever to them, to fight well for victory, and though they should lose all hope of victory, I would not have them to disbandon or scatter; but rather to stand together, till at last they might get honourable quarters for themselves, rather then shamefully to be cut off in flying away.</p>
               <p>Here we see, that the foote Souldiers suffer ever the greatest losse in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and they have ever least gaines, though most credit: but we see his Majesty with clemency doth follow the example of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who, of all victories, thought that victory best, which least was stained with bloud, having given quarters and service to three thousand Emperiall Souldiers, without drawing one drop of bloud.</p>
               <p>Likewise we see here the continuance of his Majesties industry and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, aswell in prosecuting his victory, as he was valiant in obtaining of it, in the one as in the other vindicating his owne honour, and the honour of his noble friends, shewing, after the fury was past, his clemency and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards his enemies; yet who ever was more valiant than he, being ever in all his on-sets a Leader? And as we see his Majesties valour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in prosecuting his victory: so we see also his care, in supplying the weakenesse of his Army, as a wise Generall should doe, in not letting his enemies see the weakenesse of his Army, which ought never to be knowne to those, who would rejoyce at the same.</p>
               <p>Likewise here I did observe a great thankefulnesse in a King, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging openly in view of an Army, the good service done by his servants: wherein I did especially see his love to our Nation beyond all others, that did
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15340:101"/>
serve him, to make other Nations emulous of their glory, in following of their vertues; and though his Majesty used them here, rather like unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> friends then to servants, it should not make them the more sawcy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the more humble, as both Officers and Souldiers did verifie, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising the continuance of their faithfull obedience, and of better service, as the Lord would enable them, on the next occasions.</p>
               <p>Likewise we did see here, how few of our Nation are induced to serve those Catholique Potentates: and for my part, I finde the reason good: for if we have any enemies in <hi>Europe,</hi> it must be those, that would not onely overthrow our estates at home (if they could) but also would force us (if it lay in their powers) to make shipwracke of our consciences, by leading us unto Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Moreover we see here, that his Majesty and the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> having once beene companions of danger together, they were then entertaining one anothers familiarity, in renewing of their friendship, confirmed againe with the <hi>German</hi> custome, in making their League the firmer, by drinking brother-ship together, where I having entred the <hi>Hall,</hi> and being seene by his Majesty, I was presently kindely embraced by houlding his Arme over my shoulder: wishing I could beare as much drinke, as old Generall Major <hi>Ruthven,</hi> that I might helpe his Majesty to make his Guests merry, and holding me fast by the hand, calling to the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> declared unto him, what service our Nation had done his Father and him, and the best last, at <hi>Leipsigh</hi>: commending in particular to the Duke, Colonell <hi>Hepburne,</hi> and <hi>Lumsdell,</hi> and having called Colonell <hi>Hepburne</hi> unto him, he did reiterate the former discourse, and much more, in commendation of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the continuance of this warre in <hi>Germany</hi> (as the sequell of the Story will prove) from the Balticke coast unto the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Tyroll</hi>; where Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Hepburne</hi> was sent out as Colonell, to command a party, I was sent with him, as his second, being ever much obliged unto him, not onely for his love on those occasions, but also for his good counsell, he being long before me in the <hi>Swedens</hi> service. And as we were oft Camerades of danger together; so being long acquainted, we were Camerades in love: first at Colledge, next in our travells in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Poictiers,</hi> Anno 1615. till we met againe in <hi>Spruce</hi> at <hi>Elben</hi> in August 1630. Nothing therefore in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> my opinion, more worthy to be kept next unto Faith, then this kinde of friendship, growne up with education, confirmed by familiarity, in frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dangers of warre; and who is more worthy to be chosen for a friend, then one who hath showne himselfe both valiant and constant against his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as the worthy <hi>Hepburne</hi> hath done, who is generally so well knowne in Armies, that he needes no testimony of a friend, having credit and reputation enough amongst his enemies.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this observation as I begunne it, I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Majesties wisdome and fore-sight, in bringing the Rex-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Oxensterne</hi> on the <hi>Dutch</hi> bottome, to be second to his Majesty, and to free him of a part of his buthens, by placeing him at <hi>Hall</hi> (as Legate) being <hi>Centrum Germani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The seventeenth of September, our first nights quarter was taken at a Dorpe, two miles from <hi>Hall</hi>; where those of <hi>Erfort</hi> being so displeased at our coming, as unwilling to entertaine such Guests (they being all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, Iesuits and Monkes) being mightily afraid, they did send their Commissioners before them, to treate with his Majesty, but his Majesty did give them their answers, by Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wymar,</hi> that they should quit the Catholique faction, and give their oath of fidelity to his Majesty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and that they should take in his Garrisons within their Towne, and render up to his Majesty the Castle of <hi>Eryackburg,</hi> with the Colleges to come in his Majesties will; who should suffer them to be untroubled in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, paying their contribution to the warres, like the other Burgers and country.</p>

               <p>The Councell being called to come on the market place, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to render the Towne keyes unto the Duke; who getting the keyes, the Towne was taken without bloud.</p>

               <p>His Majestie tooke in his way <hi>Konickhoffen</hi> by accord, being strong, and having beset it with a Garrison, he marched from thence to <hi>Swinfort,</hi> and tooke it in also, and having beset it with a Garrison, the Burgers being made to give their Oath of fidelitie; Duke <hi>Ernest</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> was appointed Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder over <hi>Franconia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this time we marched over the <hi>Vault</hi> to <hi>Smalka,</hi> and from thence to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat, Milerstad, Gemond,</hi> and <hi>Carlestat</hi> on the <hi>Maine.</hi> The first night we quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the side of the <hi>Vault</hi> next unto <hi>Franconia,</hi> in a Citie called <hi>Smalka,</hi> where we were well quartered; and the next morning we marched to <hi>Maini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> from thence to <hi>Mellerstat,</hi> and then to <hi>Newstat</hi> on the <hi>Salt,</hi> from thence to <hi>Hamelburg,</hi> from thence to <hi>Gemond,</hi> and from <hi>Gemond</hi> to <hi>Carlstat</hi>; and these six Cities we tooke in by accord; and having gotten a Composition of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of them, they being sworne to give their obedience unto his Majestie, having quartered in them as we past, they were free, paying the moneys they had promised, and the monethly Contribution. In this march, though the Generall Lievetenant commanded in chiefe, and made the Accord most to his owne advantage; having got of these Townes above fiftie thousand Dollers, whereof he made neither accompt to his Majestie, nor yet was he

               <p>His Majesty having taken in <hi>Swinsort,</hi> and beset it, he continued his march <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> to <hi>Wurtzburg,</hi> and coming before the Towne, he summoned them to render, whereupon they did send Father <hi>Ogleby,</hi> Abbot of the <hi>Scots</hi> Cloyster at <hi>Wurtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> to capitulate with his Majestie, in the behalfe of the Burgers, who got granted unto them the like accord, as was made with <hi>Erfort,</hi> in all degrees; the accord subscribed, his Majestie entered the Towne the same day that our forces arrived at <hi>Carlstat,</hi> being within two miles of them that night.</p>
               <p>The Citie given over, the Castle refusing to heare of any Treatie, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne from the Castle-workes to plague his Majesties Armie with Cannon; where ever they could lie or stand, within or without the Citie, on either side of the <hi>Maine,</hi> they were cruelly tormented by the enemies Cannon; so that at last it went on in earnest on both sides, for his Majestie having had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> with a strong Armie of fiftie thousand men, being joyned with the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> were coming for the reliefe of the Castle; his Majestie resolved, that taking of time was best, and that it behooved him on the sudden to have it, or not at all.</p>
               <p>This Castle being a strong Strength, sequestred on a height from the Towne; and the Souldiers as they retired from the Towne, they did breake off one Arch of the Bridge, to hinder his Majesties passage over the Bridge unto the Castle; being the onely way he could get to it; and the Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes did so command the Bridge, that a single man could not passe over without great danger of life, being the whole Bridge did lie open just under the Castle; where there was one long plancke laid over the broken Arch, being distant in height from the water, neere eight fathom, so that it seemed a hazard or torment to any man, to passe over alongst the plancke; where some valourous Officers and Souldiers would rather adventure to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mouth of the Cannon, than to crosse over the plancke, though there were no danger of the enemies Cannon or Musket, which still played furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously on that passe of the Bridge, to hinder his Majesties Souldiers in setting over; where at first, two valourous Gentlemen of our Nation, being bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, were killed on the Bridge (<hi>viz.</hi>) Sir <hi>Iames Ramsey</hi> his Major, called <hi>Bothwell</hi> and his brother.</p>

               <p>HIs Majestie at this time, as formerly, used great expedition in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching unto <hi>Franconia,</hi> knowing it was one of the Circles of the whole Empire, that was of most importance for the enemy; being a straite and a strong Country, by reason of the strengths within it: And therefore it was, that he divided his Armie in crossing the <hi>Vault,</hi> at divers places; that his Artillery might passe the sooner through. For he knew, who ever was Master of <hi>Wurtzburg,</hi> he commanded the whole River of the <hi>Maine,</hi> and consequently, whole <hi>Franconia,</hi> which fortunately happened, according to his Majesties deliberation.</p>
               <p>Here also we see the evill that comes of greedinesse, in making generall Commanders to be hated by those that follow them; for <hi>Bawtizen</hi> having got a great summe of money of these Townes, by the helpe and service of the foote, it became him, according to right and discretion, to have shared with the Colonells, who commanded the Briggads and Regiments; but seeing his want of discretion in not acknowledging them, they being once joyned againe to his Majesties Army, would never consent to be commanded by him a foot-step afterwards, for ought his Majestie could doe, having dealt so niggardly with <hi>Cavaliers</hi> of their worth, so that his Majestie was forced to direct him to command elsewhere.</p>
               <p>This greedinesse is the most pestiferous roote, that ever grew in a generall Commander; for on this march, Souldiers were usually commanded to lie in the Fields, and not suffered to quarter in the Townes, which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> for feare to hinder the payment of the moneys imposed on them; so that publique employment is ill bestowed upon a greedy person; and this greedinesse in a man of warre, to gather riches, may los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here also we see, that of old, our Nation was much esteemed of abroad, especially the Clergie, who in all Kingdomes, as in <hi>Germanie,</hi> had their

               <p>It was the custome observed ordinarily by his Majesty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to make use of our countrimen on service, wherein he desired they should shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves examplary to others, as at this time, he made choice of Sr. <hi>Iames Ramsey</hi> and Sr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> to be the first should adventure, of the whole Army, to force the enemy to give way to his Majesty to set his Army over the Maine; where, on that bridge Major <hi>Bodwell</hi> and his brother being killed, were buried in <hi>Wurtzburg</hi> Church, leaving the Trophie of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour amongst strangers, in honour of the Nation, that was ever glorious abroad.</p>
               <p>Sr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> disdaining the orders his Majesty did give, for storming the Castle, having employed the <hi>Sweds</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> on the storme, neglecting him and the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had made the way to the rest, in the extremity of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> danger, the Cavalier, I say, therefore disdaining the service, seeing his countrimen neglected, he desired of his Majesty his honourable passe, which his Majesty delayed, promising to give content another time, which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refused, but tooke his passe, seeing he thought the Nation was wronged; for which in my opinion he merits praise: for if many such Cavaliers thus served strangers, that would not care for them nor their service, when once they begin to neglect them, others that were but Cavaliers of Fortune of the Nation, would be the better respected and used. Which should teach all Cavaliers that serve truely abroad to take their time with credit of those they serve, seeing they doe not respect Cavaliers, but when they have most use of them,</p>
               <p>Here then we see that no strength, be it never so strong, is able to hould out, when as God doth not watch the Fort, the watch-man watches in vaine, and we see by the submission of <hi>Franconie</hi> after this victory, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Ensignes are ever followed: for where Fortune doth favour, there the Commons doe follow, and their study also with their favour followes the victorious.</p>

there was money given out by his Majestie, that it was the onely way to weaken and dissolve the enemies Armie, in making their Souldiers runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and to take service under his Majestie, which in effect accordingly fell out: for it being neere Winter, and their Armie marched away, their strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Souldiers did strengthen our Garrisons, having taken service under us; having but heard of the brute of money, that was given ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where we see, how necessary it was, at this time, in such a dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, for this little Armie to have beene commanded by a wise Generall, that steered his course aright in middest of the greatest tempest, like to a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marriner, where an arrogant fellow, without skill, that had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, had made shipwracke of all.</p>
               <p>As his Majestie was wise and moderate in his Command; so those who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> obeyed were faithfull and intire to their Superiour. Here inferiours whom Fortune favoureth, though weakest, were subject in all things to him, who was Fortunes <hi>Minion,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> his equall, <hi>Gustavus</hi> the Invincible; that by his wisedome, and foresight, forced old <hi>Tillie</hi> to retire to <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained nothing but losse, which retreate was the presage of his future ruine, at the <hi>Leacke,</hi> where it enters into the <hi>Danow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here also we are instructed, as well by his Majesties politique government, as by his military; He being alike expert in both, discharging the dutie of a King, and a Generall, <hi>Tam Arte, quam Marte:</hi> for the enemy was no sooner gone, but incontinent his Majestie caused serve his publique <hi>Edicts,</hi> for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Country-men, to give their oaths of fidelitie; moving them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to partly by compulsion, and partly by promises of dutie and of libertie to their Consciences, two strong Arguments to move those to obedience, who had seene their friends forced to turne backes upon them, from whom, under God, they did expect Reliefe to come.</p>
               <p>Moreover we see here, that those who are honoured by God, are also wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of honour from their equalls: other Kings, Princes, and Confederates sending their Ambassadours unto them, to <hi>congratulate</hi> their good Fortunes and successe; as also to Treate with them in matters belonging to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall States and standing: at this time also, there were Commissioners sent from <hi>Vlme, Strasburg, Nurenberg,</hi> and <hi>Francford,</hi> treating with His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie for themselves apart, as free from the bodie of the Empire: And such feathers his Majestie was glad to get out of the Emperours wings, knowing the more he wanted of such feathers, the worse he could flie: and some of them were light, changing as the winde. To conclude then, whom fortune favoures, the world laughs on, as may be seene here, by the example of Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonell <hi>Howbalt,</hi> after the intaking of <hi>Hanow</hi> by meere fortune being surprized; which was the occasion, this Cavalier was so suddenly made up, in getting Command over horse and foote, from Livetenant Colonell; who, foure yeeres before, was Sergeant under the blew Regiment.

               <p>Therefore the Lords of <hi>Francford</hi> did well, in preferring good conditions of peace before an uncertaine war, especially against such a Heroick King as <hi>Gustavus</hi> was, then the Patriot &amp; Protectour of their faith and Religion, and consequently of their freedome, and their countries freedome, and for their rewards, to my knowledge, they were inriched three yeares together (by the hant of the Army) with the substance of the foure upper Circles of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>; which in th'end they rewarded with unthankefulnesse, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse will be punished for it sometime.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> Here also we have the power of example; for the Towne of <hi>Francford</hi> having taken his Majesty of <hi>Sweden</hi> for their Protector, following their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the two <hi>Landgraves Hessen</hi> and <hi>Darmstat,</hi> with the Earles of the <hi>Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raw</hi> desire also to be in the confederacy, and were most gladly accepted of. <hi>Vlme, Nurenberg</hi> and <hi>Strasburg</hi> ended also their confederacy with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty after the example of <hi>Francford,</hi> promising supply of men, money and victualls for the Army, Amunition and horses for the Artillery, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Armes for horse and foote, with powder, ball, match, waggons, spades, shovells, Pikes, mattockes, axes and all other things fitting for the advancement of the warres.

               <p>In this point of recognoscing his Majesties judgement was wonderfull, as in all other practicall duties fitting a great Commander, and as his Majesties judgement was great and good, so he was of that minde, nothing in this kinde could be well done, which he did not himselfe, neither could his Majestie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, at such times, as he went to recognosce, any other to accompany him in the danger, other reasons doubtlesse His Majestie had, which were onely privie unto himselfe.

My advise then to all brave fellowes watching in trenches, or guarding Cannon, while as the enemie would try their valour by out-falling, in assailing them, at such times, let the defender doe as was done here, leaving the use of the Musket, as being more unreadie, let them make use of their pikes, meeting their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the teeth, with a strong firme bodie of Pikes, (after the old <hi>Scots</hi> fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, used by our Predecessours, that fought pell mell; with two-hand swordes, till one of the parties did quit the field) for though they suffer losse, sure they must winne credit, that repulse their enemie, rather than disgracefully suffer their Cannon to be nayled, or their braines knockt out in trenches, while as they take them to the uncertaintie of the musket. Therefore let resolution be ever present, repulsing force with force; for if thou wouldest be esteemed amongst the number of brave fellowes, thou must resolve to shew thy selfe resolute, couragious, and valiant, going before others in good example, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to dye with credit standing, serving the publique, than ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to live in shame, disgracing both thy selfe and Countrie.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Here also I did observe, that oftentimes those, that durst not lift up their heads in time of danger, doe often better speed and thrive in worldly things, than those that merit the best: as was seene on those Briggads entred first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mentz,</hi> that did get both Prisoners and spoyle with the best Quarters, when others, that deserved better, were worse quartered in emptie houses, while as other Colonells and Souldiers, of farre lesse deserving, were making up of estates for their posteritie, in better Quarters, within the <hi>Paltz</hi> and <hi>Franckonie.</hi>

               <p>But on the contrary; valourous men their labours and travells ought to be rewarded, with honour and profit, by those they did truely serve.

Where we see, that all Potentates and great Kings, doe keepe no Confederacy nor League, but only so farre as they are helpfull for their owne aimes and designes; preferring their benefit before the keeping of their covenants; where we see, that Kings hand-writings or seales, in pactions making, tye them no more then as nothing, when they finde them prejudiciall to their owne greatnesse, and cannot be made to keepe their covenants, but with stronger power. Then we see here, his Majesty of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was nothing moved with the King of <hi>France</hi> his threatning (except he would retire over the Rhine againe) seeing he knew his owne ability at that time, that being once over the Rhine, he could march unto <hi>France.</hi> The consideration whereof made them agree better on secondary conditions, having past from the first covenant; so that we see there is no dealing with Kings but on equall termes, and then are they most reasonable; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Kings, in this point of their covenants, is not to be imitated by any other inferiours; for in respect of them, though not in respect of God, they are privileged persons; who cannot be punished for their faults but by God alone. And therefore, amongst inferiours, nothing is to be kept more strict next unto faith unviolated, then mens word and promise, especially promises betwixt old friends. But alas! no friendship is permanent, seeing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15340:116"/>
many things come betwixt, turning it unto hatred and hostility; for where love doth not grow, the friendship is not durable.</p>
               <p>Likewise here we see, his Majesty of <hi>France</hi> made haste to interpose his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for the weale of the Catholique League, shewing himselfe disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their usage, to make them the more ready to thinke on him, before they should any wayes leane in their necessity to the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> As also we see the policy of the League, though in their necessity they seemed to make use of the King of <hi>France</hi> his friendship, yet they would not cast off the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and King of <hi>Spaine</hi> their ould friends, for the hope they had in their new friend the King of <hi>France,</hi> lest their new friend might disappoint them of their expectations, as he did in th'end, missing his owne aimes.</p>

               <p>Those we see are the best friends, that in necessity keepe their paction, as the Catholique League did at all times unto the Emperour, who otherwise had bin no Emperour, neither yet had he bin Emperour, had the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists kept together and hazarded their meanes and bloud, in defence of the publique cause, as the Catholiques did in their greatest necessity, once eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeere setting up ever new Armies, as one was beaten unto them: their wisdome and constancy were so great, that presently the next Spring, through their power and diligence, they had ever another new Army afoote, which in th'end made their enemies the Evangelists weary, sparing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> meanes, they suffered in a manner the cause and the publique to be neere lost; being since beaten by their owne Armes and meanes, seeing they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected time, while as they might employ their meanes to the finall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their enemies: and yet to my knowledge, in <hi>Germany,</hi> if they would conjoyne their strengths together constantly against the Papists, they are powerfull enough to free all <hi>Germany</hi> of Popery, banishing them over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> from whence they came. And I perswade my selfe, none that knowes <hi>Germany,</hi> but in his conscience he must confesse this to be truth. But when our fellowes in friendship faile us, as the Evangelists one after another, for a skurvy losse, quit the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the great Duke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> of <hi>Saxon</hi> having left them first, breaking his oath and promise, in prejudice of the publique peace, excluding the Protestants impiously for his owne aimes, he did prejudice the Gospell, his country, and confederates, and by his evill example: for plaine necessity, while a storme should blow over the townes of the upper Circles of the Empire, as <hi>Strasburg, Vlme, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renberg</hi> &amp; <hi>Francford</hi> did accept of an unsetled peace, contrary to their mindes, in prejudice of the publique, losing themselves and the publique, for the losse of one day, being without their head, which first brought them together.</p>

Where we see cleerely that there is no friend in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, except it be a friend in Christ, who will never forsake or leave us. This then is the friendship we should make to league and confederate with, our brethren in Christ, with whom we have unity in Faith, if that we would have our friendship durable and constant: others will change as the winde blowes plenty or penury upon us; being but temporary friends (as many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> are) but our brethren in Christ will never totally leave us, no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> not in our greatest wants and extremity of Fortune.

And to verifie this, I can beare witnesse, that though the enemy did keepe our brethren in Christ, that were in the <hi>Pultz,</hi> under ten yeares bondage; Neverthelesse that bondage, nor the tyranny used unto them by their enemies, made them never forget their fidelity and love to their King and Prince; neither yet could their tyranny make them forsake or renounce their faith in Christ, but as they continued true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If my fortune were once againe to command the Guards in <hi>Memmungen</hi> in <hi>Bavier</hi> (the Dukes chiefe residence) though I would not breake my word, I would hazard to breake my sword, to be avenged on those who keepe no promise or oath, being enemies to God and to his truth, as they did witnesse by their cruelty used at <hi>Bamberg</hi>; where the Felt-marshall being set on unawares, was forced to retire, having sent away his cannon before him, choosing the least of two inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, having thought better to endanger a few men in skirmish, than by stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hazard the losse of all, and of his cannon. Where we see that it is hard for a brave Commander to make a good retreat without cannon, where on the contrary having a little time, with some advantage of ground, it is easie retiring from the fiercest enemy, who may lose himselfe and his Army with pressing too farre forwards against cannon.</p>
               <p>Likewise there is nothing more able for to make a partie of horsmen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, than a reasonable supply of musketiers ever to attend them, for they are ever best together: Moreover, we have here a laudable custome of a brave Commander, as his Majesty was, being as carefull in maintaining his conquest, as he was fortunat in conquering: for before his Majesty would march from the Rhine towards the <hi>Danow,</hi> he first established the Rex-chancellor

               <p>It is the dutie of all good Commanders, at their downe lying and uprising from quarters, to be very carefull to prevent fire; seeing thereby the whole Armie may be endangered by the losse of men, Amunition, Armes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; and since such losse is irrecoverable, our care should be the greater to avoyde the hurt.

make diligent roundes over the Quarters, to prevent the like accidents, and to give Orders to the Gavilliger and his servants, to oversee all fires, and to see them quencht, at all upbreakings, and dislodging: otherwise, the enemy being neere, great inconvenience might happen, and if any enemy, at such times, trusting to our disorder, should offer to invade us, finding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it were easie to beate them backe; as also, it were a fit time to try their valour, they being more than halfe afraid.

The Towne also was spoyled and quite plundered: but some of the Souldiers, with the Iesuites and Monkes, that had escaped alongst the Bridge, being sent after were overtaken, and the most part cut off: the rest above three hundred were brought backe prisoners: within the Garrison were found dead above five hundred, and some were drowned in the streame, and a thousand that had gotte their lives, were forced to take service under the Regiments; but being Papists of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as soone as they

smelt the smell of their Fathers houses, in lesse than ten dayes they were all gone.</p>
               <p>The in-taking of this passe on such a sudden, wrought a terrible feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Papists in <hi>Bavaria</hi>; in like manner, his Majestie did send Palsgrave <hi>Augustus,</hi> with some Forces to <hi>Hechstat,</hi> a passe on the <hi>Danube,</hi> which he immediatly tooke in, and by this time was Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> with his Armie come on the <hi>Leacke</hi> towards <hi>Rhine</hi> on the River: and having beset it strong, he beset also all other parts betwixt that and <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and the Duke himselfe caused to take their Armes from all the professors of the reformed Religion in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and having beset it with two thousand Souldiers, he retired himselfe to <hi>Engolstat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majestie after the in-taking of <hi>Donavert,</hi> commanded Generall <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> with a partie of foure thousand strong, of horse, foote, and Artillery, towards <hi>Newburg</hi> on the <hi>Danube</hi>; but it was beset before their comming, and they retiring againe to <hi>Donavert,</hi> where our whole Armie being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we marched towards the River of the <hi>Leacke,</hi> of intention to force a passe unto <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being then thirtie two thousand strong, of horse and foote.</p>

               <p>Here we see his Majesties diligence alike, in following of his enemy, as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> fled before him; as in his pursute at <hi>Donavert,</hi> being the passe, we were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den up at, which his Majestie with diligence did get in his power, being so hard pursued, that the enemy got no time to relieve it, though the Cavalier that defended it, shewed himselfe resolute in defending of it, as in out-fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on our Guards, which were <hi>Swedens,</hi> who having neglected their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, were blame-worthy, as their Captaine that commanded them, who ought to have preferred death before life, ere he had quite his Poste; seeing his standing could have moved others to helpe him, though the <hi>Swedens</hi> left him.

               <p>Likewise here we see that stone houses are vaine defenses against cannon:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> where the walles once pierc't, those within are in worse case then if they stood on plaine fields. Therefore at such times, it is better to adventure forth unto the fields out of reach, then to be smothered within walles, as were many within this house both of horse and foote.</p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:15340:121"/>Here also as in the continuance of the Story, we see the valour of <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> and of his Briggad praise worthy, being first and last instruments of the enemies overthrow in grosse or by parties, being commanded men: where often we were well seconded by <hi>Ramseys</hi> men, seeing those were ever commanded on desperat exploits, being still appointed the fore-troopes of the Army, well led and conducted by Major <hi>Sidserffe,</hi> who was a Cavalier both diligent and valorous, being also trusted on good occasions for his judgment in command.</p>
               <p>As his Majesty was diligent in the taking of this passe, so he was carefull to repaire it, by helping of the ruins, and in besetting it againe with a strong Garrison, establishing good order and discipline, having left Colonell <hi>Worbrane,</hi> an <hi>Osterriker Freher,</hi> as Governour, being a man expert in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of cannon, and in devising of fire-workes; As also he understood well how best to fortifie irregular workes as these were.

were made to lie dead by our cannon; for those that were not hurt by the Bullets, they were lamed by branches and trees, cut by the cannon, being they stood in a thickewood, which shooting continued a whole day, being on the fifth of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1632; a day ominous to Generall <hi>Tilly,</hi> who was shot in the knee with a cannon bullet; a cruell blow for an ould man of seventy two yeeres, who, being carried from thence to <hi>Engolstat,</hi> died within three dayes, being cruelly tormented with the smart of his wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tilly</hi> being gone, the Army discouraged for their great losse sustained; The Duke remarking his Majesty would force the passage, he thought best in time to retire, taking his flight confusedly upon <hi>Engolstat</hi> and <hi>Nuburg:</hi> after that <hi>Altringer,</hi> then a Colonell was shot in the head, and above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand did lie dead on the place they stood on.</p>
               <p>His Majesty having crost over with the Army, he incontinent comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded certaine Troopes to follow the fugitives, getting orders to cut them off as they were found.</p>
               <p>This victory happily attained unto by his Majesty, incontinent the Towne of <hi>Rhine,</hi> being the first frontier Garrison in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> rendered up, and his Majesty having beset <hi>Rhine</hi> with a Garrison, he marched with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my alongst the <hi>Leacke</hi> side on <hi>Ausburg</hi>; where by the way a Commissary from <hi>Nuburg</hi> came to his Majesty, making their excuse for receiving of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
                  <hi>Tillies</hi> forces, and withall they declared, that the enemy had quit their Towne againe; and therefore they interposed with his Majesty for neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which being refused unto them, a Garrison was sent to keepe them in awe, to bring their landes in contribution, and to repaire the bridge which was broken by the Dukes command.</p>
               <p>His Majesty having continued his march towards <hi>Ausburg,</hi> the eigth of <hi>Aprill</hi> we lay downe before it, and immediatly we set over a bridge over the <hi>Leacke,</hi> during which time the Commandant spared not his Amunition, but continually Cannonaded amongst us; but our batteries being once ready, they received their interchange, and his Majesty offered the Garrison free passage, and to retire in safety with his folkes, whether he pleased, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there should no quarter be granted unto them, if they pressed to hould out longer, whereupon the Governour resolved to accept of his Majesties offer, and having made his Accord, on the tenth of <hi>Aprill</hi> he marched out, and was conveyed towards <hi>Engolstat.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>GENERALL <hi>Tillie</hi> being neere unto his end, behooved to make a march unto <hi>Bambricke,</hi> to shew the <hi>Swedens</hi> by his retreat the right passe unto <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with his owne death. Wherin we have a notable example of an old expert Generall, who being seventy two yeeres of age, was ready to die in defence of his Religion and Country, and in defence of those whom he served, being then Generall for the Catholique League: which end of his should encourage all brave Cavaliers, following the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable profession of Armes, to follow his example in life and death, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Souldiers: where we see, that though death be fatall unto all, yet such a death, as happened unto this old Generall, is only proper unto the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who though often contemned death and eschewed death, during the warfare, yet at last he is overtaken by Gods Almighty hand and power, though formerly in his life-time he had escaped, by the same providence, many dangers. And sometimes we see in the very entrance of warres, some suddenly taken away, to teach us alwayes to trust more unto God then unto the arme of man, which is but a vaine strength.</p>
               <p>Likewise, though this worthy Generall did fight often, and obtained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable victories till this time, against Kings, yet at last he is overcome by a King, and a more skilfull Generall then he was, and though before the battaile of <hi>Leipsigh,</hi> he did give no higher title to his Majesty then to a Cavalier: Neverthelesse his Majesty hearing of his death, called him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable old <hi>Tilly,</hi> whose Acts were so Heroicke in his life time, that after his death, they were his everlasting monuments, making his memory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, suffering his name never to ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Also here we see the great force of Artillery, either in forcing of passes against our enemies, or in maintaining of passes with a little advantage of ground, for seventy two peeces of Ordinance, with such continuance, were of mighty force to make passage to an Army: for this victory was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the force of our Cannon alone, which made the enemy runne away, before we could come at them to fight, and the discouragment given unto them, by the losse of their Leaders caused their disorder, and consequently safety to us in our passage. Where we see, that as victorie is from God, so the helpe, judgment and dexterity of good Commanders is furthersome to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the lawfull meanes ordained by God.</p>
               <p>Moreover we see here, how easie it is for a victorious Armie, that is once master of the Field, to take in Frontier Garrisons, while as they are possessed instantly with a Panicke feare, especially being taken at the Stot or rebound, before they have time to disgest their feare. But had Generall <hi>Tilly</hi> drawne up

his Army out of reach of his Majesties Cannon, and resolved to suffer his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Majesty to have set over his Army, the passe being so narrow, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As his Majesties Iudgment in command was great, so his Example was good and commendable, in giving God thankes in his Church, for his victories and for the preservation of his life from danger; wherein his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty chiefely shewed the example of his Piety and religious exercise, for he knew well that Religion and Iustice were the fundaments of all good so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and being much inclined unto both, he would winne the people by his owne example: since of all men it becomes Kings and Princes worst to be irreligious and ungodly: for on earth we have nothing more worthy than Religion to be respected and honoured, it being unto Heaven our guide, on earth the fountaine of our Iustice, whereby we governe our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires well or ill, expelling and putting away unjustice or unrighteousnesse: for where there is most Religion or piety; there also is most happinesse: and without her no Crowne can be established; and as his Majesty was religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous himselfe, so he maintained good lawes and good discipline, grounded on religion and holinesse of life, which made the happy events and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate end of his warlike expeditions to follow. Blessed therefore shall they be, who follow his Majesties example in this, as in all other his warlike enterprizes; for I dare affirme on my conscience, never man served this Master truly (whom his Majesty our Master did serve with his heart) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reward.</p>

Majestie: which Graveshaft or Earledome could pay yearely, beside Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to the warres, ten thousand Rex-Dollers, being a good augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of pay for an old servant, who had served long and valourously, without the least blot of discredit, and retired bravely with meanes and credit to his Country, carrying the markes of his valour in his body, being above the waste full of tokens of valour, credibly gotten in his Masters ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for as he was couragious before his enemy, he was also fortunate in his Conduct, in obtaining victory beyond his fellowes; and being often singled out, man to man, to make his courage the more undoubted, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gave testimony in this kinde of his valour, answerable to the externall shew and hansome frame of his body, being in personage inferiour to no man, for strength and comely stature.</p>
               <p>His Majesty continuing his March towards <hi>Engolstat,</hi> coming within sight of the Towne, he drew his Armie in Battaile, horse, foote, and Artillery, where we stood the whole night at Armes.

               <p>His Majestie, in the beginning of the night, commanded a thousand <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> being Musketiers, led by sufficient Officers in his Majesties owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to fall on the Skonce, before the bridge, which was beset with fifteene hundred foote, and five hundred horse, lying open on the side, that lay next the Towne, that if the enemie should storme and enter, he might be clensed out againe with Cannon and musket, from the Towne wall; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof, the <hi>Swedens</hi> bravely advanced, even to the graffe, being ready to storme they were plagued with the musket, and with fire-workes, that leaving three hundred men killed about the Skonce, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> the enemy continuing a thunder-clap of Muskets for one halfe houre, till they were fully retired.

Neverthelesse, having once recognosced the Citie, he would not leave it, till he had showne his resolution, and left his intrenchment, as the tokens of his worth, in hazarding to beleaguer it, having an Armie to second them; and while as his Majesties horse was shot under him, he said, it did put him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in minde, he was but mortall and subject to mischances, as others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew no better remedie, but to resigne himselfe and all his to the providence of the Almightie: and that he was perswaded, that though <hi>God</hi> should call him out of the world, yet the Lord would not abandon his owne Cause, being so just, but he was assured, <hi>God</hi> would stirre up some other worthier than he, to put a period to those warres, for the libertie of <hi>Gods</hi> service in <hi>Dutchland</hi>; and withall, he tooke <hi>God</hi> to witnesse, he had no other intention in prosecuting those warres, but onely to pull downe the tyranny of the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; and to obtaine a solid and a setled peace unto all men, that were interessed in the quarrell.</p>
               <p>Where, by this his speech, we see, that as he was a brave and a valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous King; so he was wise at this time in preserving himselfe and his Armie from losing them before such a strong Citie. As also we see, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of mortall men have their changes common unto them, that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are crossed by contrary fortunes, as formerly they did prosper; and the Lord doth hide the causes of both from us, to spurre us ever to seeke to his Majestie, in doing good; and those good of themselves, as this just King was, who notwithstanding had need of Gods direction in all his wayes and enterprises: which should make us all earnest in seeking the <hi>Lord,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in all our wayes; seeing of our selves we are not able to doe any thing that is good; neither ought we to ascribe any thing of our prosperous successe or fortune unto our selves, being but the Lords servants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments he useth, as weake meanes of his glory, and the well-fare of his Church on earth.

               <p>Here also I would exhort by the way all worthy Souldiers, who aime at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> credit, never to give themselves to mouze or plunder aside from the Armie, lest they be punished, in dying ignominiously by the hands of cruell tyrants, as the ignorant Papist-Boores, that have no more knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> than to tell over their Beads, being taught, as their best devotion and knowledge of the mysteries of <hi>God</hi> tending to salvation, to glory in their ignorance, which makes many of them to commit any wickednesse whatsoever, to winne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to themselves; being once commanded by a Priest, that can make the poore ignorant beleeve, that to doe wickedly is the way to heaven. Who cannot then see, how detestable this Doctrine is, that gives people libertie to commit all villany, and then to assure them of pardon for it?</p>
               <p>The use then we should make of this, who professe another truth, is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre their examples of life, as we doe their doctrine; seeing wee should know, that no crime before God is so abominable, as to glory in sinne; for where sinne groweth, there groweth also the punishment: And he that sinnes openly with an out-stretched necke, as these villaines did in <hi>Wisenburg,</hi> in sight of God and before the Sunne and the world, they offended double, teaching others by their example to sinne.</p>
               <p>Happie therefore is the man, who delights not in sinne, but happier is he, that glories not in sinne, yea happiest of all, that continues not in sinne, but repenteth of the evill done, and ceaseth to doe so any more.</p>

               <p>In like manner we see here the diligence and celerity used by his Majesty, according to the occasions that happened, in going so suddenly towards <hi>Ossa,</hi> and in returning againe at the Poast, with a convoy of Dragoniers towards <hi>Munchen,</hi> to breake up with his Army, having left Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> of <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> with Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> to attend on <hi>Ossa</hi> his Army, on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Tyroll,</hi> towards <hi>Landaw</hi> and the <hi>Boden</hi> sea, till businesse were pacified.</p>

               <p>HEre we see againe his Majesties wonderfull diligence, wherein doth ever consist the best part of warre; for hearing in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> that <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> was marched with a strong Armie out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> towards the over <hi>Paltz</hi>; and knowing the Duke of <hi>Baviere</hi> had the passe of <hi>Rhinesberg</hi> free unto the upper <hi>Paltz,</hi> he was not able to hinder their Conjunction, if <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> his designe were on <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> as it was; his Majestie knew then dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was to be used for the reliefe of <hi>Nurenberg</hi>; and therefore, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> he hasted his march thither; for his Majestie knew well, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of time in warres was of much importance, especially, knowing the enemies designe being on <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> which to have, the enemy he knew, would not spare either money or travell; for if they could cut off his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie from the helpe and assistance of this Towne, it was the best way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Baviere, Schwabland,</hi> and <hi>Ostreigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, it was the onely meanes to recover againe the Bishopricke of <hi>Wurtzburg,</hi> and the Dukedome of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and by that meanes (if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together) yet farre they might, drive backe againe his Majestie of <hi>Sweden</hi> and his Forces, keeping him out of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; as also out of the Emperours hereditarie lands. This was their cunning enterprise on <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> and the reasons of it, which his Majestie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that Heroicke and magnanimous King tooke betimes unto his consideration; having had a wake-rise or vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye over the safetie and preservation of this Citie; seeing it stood of so much importance unto his Majestie, and unto the whole <hi>Evangelists</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, that the enemy should not be Master of it. And therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the hurt thereof, his Majestie used the greater haste out of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> For his Majesty knew well, that the opportunitie of time was like a swift Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, which being at ones foote may be taken, but when once he mounts in the ayre, he laughs at those would catch him, not meaning to returne unto them: which moved his Majestie, not to suffer the Eagle to mount so high,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15340:128"/>
as to be laughed at, but imbracing opportunitie, while he had it, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the enemies designe by taking of time, that augments our experience in warfare; which experience gives us confidence in our behaviours, in the greatest extremitie, giving us resolution and courage against our enemies; as also graces our behaviour towards our friends and confederates.</p>
               <p>Here then we see the enemies designes prevented by the diligence, labour, and danger of the most valiant, the <hi>Lyon of the North,</hi> the invincible King of <hi>Sweden</hi>; who was so diligent or wake-rife, that his delight was to try the Conclusions of Fortune against his enemies; forcing Fortune to make him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> her Favourite, and sometimes her Master, as he was on this expedition, in coming betwixt the enemy and the Citie of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> as a good Shepheard goeth betwixt the Flocke and the Corne.</p>
               <p>Moreover, here we see also the great wisedome of his Majestie, in making his league and confederacy sure with the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> before he could perceive the enemies strength that were coming against him, taking a catch of time, which being over-seene, could never have beene had againe; and therefore it was, that his Majestie used the greater celeritie in binding up that confederacy, having then his Armie under the Duke of <hi>Wirtenbergs</hi> nose, to force him to Conditions, if he had not willingly yeelded: where we see, that the power of an Armie, led by a King, much availeth to bring inferiours to Conditions, not being able againe to resist a Kings power with Force. And as his Majestie was wise in making his confederacy with the Duke, so he was diligent in fore-seeing to write to the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> to get the passage closed on his enemies behinde him; As also we see here his Majesties care to supply his Armie, by giving Patents to our Country-men, whose fortunes were much to be lamented; for having brought their Regiments suddenly together, they were as suddenly scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for both the Colonells being taken prisoners, they were kept pittifully in bondage for the space of three yeares, being neglected of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, till they were forced to ransome themselves, and Colonell <hi>Iohn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse</hi> having afterwards taken service under the King of <hi>France,</hi> being of short continuance, was much regrated, he being a young Cavalier, free and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, and of good hope.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this observation, it was necessitie, that vehement fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> did bring his Majestie and his Armie so soone out of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being the enemy pressed strong against our friends, he was diverted. Where we see, that necessitie in warres admits of no reason, more than in other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for seldome it suffers to make choice of times. And therefore it is holden as the best teacher, that teacheth all most diligently, even Kings as well as meane men, and Armies as well as parties, and parties as private men: for it brings ever great celerity and quicknesse with it, as it did on this our march, for the safetie of <hi>Nurenberg.</hi>

               <p>First being both of one religion, their consciences tied them, not to see one anothers hurt or detriment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they saw and considered, that the good arising of the union re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded alike to both their wealls.

               <p>All these considered, they joyned hand in hand, and with one courage they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> resolved to be enemies to those that were come to be their enemies, finding it was lawfull for them, before God and the whole world, to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And therefore they prepared for it, where at first the Towne of <hi>Nurenberg</hi> made up twenty foure strong Companies of foote, that carried in their Colours the twenty foure letters of the Alphabet, which they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for a supply for his Majesties Army, that their City might be the better watched, for they resolved, their best remedy against feare was not to feare at all, since they had <hi>Gustavus</hi> and his Fortunes under God for their Leader: And therefore they were assured of deliverance from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, with the losse of a little mony, and the spending of a little provision, which they had long kept in store to sustaine them in their necessities, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had within their walls to sustaine dayly besides the Army, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand soules, being no small burthen to a Land-towne.</p>

               <p>HIS Majesty having Recognosced the City and situation thereof, finding his Forces weake in respect of the enemies, he resolved to take all the advantage he could in setting downe his Leaguer, for the preservation of his Army, and the safety of the City, and therefore he caused to draw the draught of the Leaguer to goe in a circular <hi>Orbe,</hi> round <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> the whole City, the water running through the middest of it; The Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer begun at the East, without the Suburbes called in <hi>Dutch Marke,</hi> were towards the South, to the part called <hi>Lightenhooffe</hi>; where his Majesties quarter was, and from thence towards the west, to the Townes new workes, crossing over the water; This Leaguer being accomplished in ten dayes, and in full defence, with strong Skonces, Redoutes, Fossies, batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and being well fortified round with Stakkets, without the Fossio; and at all sorting Ports, being well foreseene with slaught-bomes and triangles; well fastened and close; His Majesty then upon the North side of the City, made the retrenchment goe likewise round the City, being also well fortified with strong Skonces and Fossies, from the East unto the West, beginning at the <hi>Marke Flect Were,</hi> and going round the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:15340:130"/>
towards the Leaguer, there was another strong Skonce made: likewise towards the wood at the South, on the street called <hi>Rottenbacherstreete</hi> there was made an extraordinary strong Skonce, set about with foure cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Stakkets, of strong timber, so that there was no meanes to storme it; the like was made on the streete called <hi>Altoffer</hi> streete. These workes, Skon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Redoutes being accomplished, a great number of Cannon great and small, were brought on the workes; the Batteries all ready, there could be reckoned in the Leaguer about this Towne, without the walls, of Cannon on their Carriages, above three hundred, great and small.</p>
               <p>Our Leaguer thus fortified, the Emperiall Army led by the Duke of <hi>Fridland Walestine</hi> joyned with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> his Forces, consisting both of fifty thousand men, having the first of <hi>Iuly</hi> taken in <hi>Schawbach</hi>; the second day after they drew towards the Dorpe called <hi>Steyne</hi> over against <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> which doth lie about a <hi>Dutch</hi> mile from the Towne; there they begun to pitch a Leaguer, and from <hi>Steyne</hi> towards the <hi>Fleckt</hi> called <hi>Zern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorfe,</hi> the Leaguer being well fortified, on the seventh of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Duke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> of <hi>Fridland</hi> made his Leaguer also towards <hi>Zerndorfe</hi> on the top of the hill called <hi>Altberg</hi>; wherein he tooke, for an advantage, an old ruinous and waste Castle, neere which there lay a hunting house in the wood, on the top of the hill over against the <hi>Fleckt</hi>-Fort, which was called the old strength in <hi>Dutch,</hi> This Fort he caused strongly to pallisade without the workes, with Fossies and Stakkets without the fossie, other great and strong Skon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he caused to make, and divers other strong Skonces on the old hill, the Fossies and brest workes were all fortified with great and strong Trees, and within the workes, were severall barrells or hogsheads filled with sand and stones for throwing, placed on the Batteries, and by this strong and great Leaguer <hi>Valestine</hi> did cut off from his Majesties Army and the Towne of <hi>Nurenberg</hi> all kinde of victualls or provision, could come unto them by the <hi>Axile,</hi> thinking thereby to blocke up his Majesties Army, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to take another resolution, and then he thought to compell the Kings Majesty to a peace, according to his minde.</p>
               <p>These two Armies thus incamped and set downe opposite one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they begun all of them, as they went forth in the country about, to steale, to rob, to plunder and to spoile the whole country, for to supply with victualls and other furniture these two great new-founded Cities of short continuance, though it is certaine, many of them did get life-rent-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their new built houses.</p>
               <p>Thus having set downe the manner of both the Armies incamping, we lay still one against another a long time, neither giving nor offering offence one to another, except it were by meere accident in the country, amongst stragling troopes. Neverthelesse though we looked on each others, we had our watches night and day, before one anothers noses, without loosing of one Pistoll, or without one Alarum in two moneths time, as if in effect there were a Stil-stand of Peace.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15340:131"/>
but short; for when the <hi>Swedens</hi> Forces drew out of the Garrisons, they killed the most part, and drove the rest unto woods, to seeke their food with the Swine, in burning a number of their Dorpes, to give them worke to thinke on against the winter, to build new houses, or to dwell in woods: but repenting their Rebellion, they turned their Armes against their owne Masters, that moved them to rise against the <hi>Swedens:</hi> and cutting off a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, they possessed their houses, turning good <hi>Swedens</hi> againe, being beaten with the rod of Correction in their bodies and meanes.</p>
               <p>By this time Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> of <hi>Wymar,</hi> with his Troopes did cut off above five hundred men of <hi>Leopoldus</hi> folke by <hi>Fussen</hi> on the <hi>Leacke,</hi> where he caused to demolish sundry Skonces made up by the Country-Boores, in time of their uproare, and divers of their skinnes were pierced by Musket and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll, till they were taught to be more sober and quiet, on their owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and after this uproare was setled, the <hi>Leopoldish</hi> Boores againe out of <hi>Tyroll</hi> recollected stronger Forces, and marched towards the <hi>Leacke</hi> againe on <hi>Fussen,</hi> and <hi>Lansberg,</hi> both strong passes, and got them in; yet in the end all turned to a slight conclusion: for Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> againe, having come upon them with his Forces; First he tooke in <hi>Lansberg,</hi> and then on the sixteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> he cut off two Companies of <hi>Leopoldish</hi> Dragoniers, and a Troope of Horsemen, by a Towne called <hi>Rosshaupten,</hi> where few or none did escape, and in the end, marching on <hi>Fussen,</hi> having stormed the Towne, they cut off above three hundred of the Garrison, and tooke prisoners ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred with their Officers; and a number of the Country Gentlemen, that were Papists, and sought to save themselves in that strength, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, their Colours being taken from them, and above a thousand of their Souldiers were forced to take service.</p>

               <p>I hope the Reader will excuse this extravagancie of discourse, seeing all this time we lay idle at <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> being sometimes without imployment in our calling, I thought better to collect at this time somewhat of the actions of others, than to be altogether idle. Therefore I crave pardon againe, to tell as yet somewhat that happened about this time in the neather <hi>Saxon Creitzis,</hi> which I set downe in paper, as his Majestie was informed of it, we being then at <hi>Nurenberg</hi> without hostile employment.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15340:131"/>
being neere unto him, <hi>Eynbeck</hi> and divers places more, and then having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creued his Armie againe out of <hi>Westfalia,</hi> he then marched on <hi>Stoade,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it before Generall <hi>Tott</hi> his nose, that lay before it, and about it; and all things succeeding still well with him, he not alone relieved the Towne in making the <hi>Swedens</hi> to quit it, but also cut off unto them fifteene hundred men, which were but Novices, being new levied; and he did get divers colours of theirs, as Trophees of his victorie; amongst others he did get three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Obstell</hi> his Regiment, which were then led by Captaine <hi>Francis Sinclaire,</hi> who after a little skirmish had with the enemie, their powder being spent, and they environed by the horsemen, knowing of no reliefe, tooke quarters for the Souldiers, and the Officers were prisoners, being long kept unrelieved at <hi>Minden,</hi> above a yeare and a halfe; but the Captaine having ransom'd himselfe came loose soone after he was taken; but two Lievetenants <hi>Monro,</hi> and Ensigne <hi>Monro</hi> remained eighteen moneths lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Papenhaim</hi> after relieving of <hi>Stoade,</hi> having gotten intelligence, that Duke <hi>Francis Carolus</hi> of <hi>Saxon Lovanburg</hi> had come to the <hi>Swedens,</hi> with two strong Regiments, of intention to blocke up <hi>Stoade</hi> againe, the <hi>Swedens</hi> growing still stronger and stronger, so that it was thought <hi>Papenhaim</hi> was inclosed as in a snare or grinne, and which was worse, that he was scarce of victuals in the Towne, and the Towne not strong enough to hold out, he then resolved to quit it, taking out with him the Emperiall Garrison that was therein, and taking his march againe towards the <hi>Weser</hi> streame; so that he leaving it, the <hi>Swedens</hi> patronizing the Towne they did beset it againe with a Garrison.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this brave fellow rencountring againe with some <hi>Hessen</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> troopes, he did sore beate them also backe and side. By this time Generall Lievetenant <hi>Bawtishen</hi> had got the Command of the <hi>Swedens</hi> Army, after Generall <hi>Tott</hi> had quit it; who incontinent after followed <hi>Papenhaim</hi> towards the <hi>Weser</hi>; But this brave fellow <hi>Papenhaim</hi> not for feare of <hi>Bawtish</hi> comming, but being called by the <hi>Infanta</hi> for ayde, crossed the <hi>Weser</hi>; and comming on the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> continued his march towards <hi>Mastricht</hi> to assist the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in their need. This brave Commander, as he was full of action, so he was still employed, and I was sorry he was not of my minde in serving the good cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Papenhaim</hi> gone to <hi>Mastricht, Lunenburg,</hi> and Generall <hi>Bawtish</hi> (under whom was my brother Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Obstell</hi>) they returned towards <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstat,</hi> which <hi>Papenhaim</hi> had strongly beset before his going away, and they neverthelesse got it in with little paines, by reason the Souldiers, that were therein, being fifteene hundred begunne to mutine, and to give themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto the <hi>Swedens</hi> service; after this they commanded some forces to blockquer <hi>Wolfembittle,</hi> wherein the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> in person was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; And Generall Major King, being with some forces employed on a Poste apart, the Duke hearing the enemie was marching strong, for the reliefe of the Towne, he did breake up, and marched away for his owne safetie, without advertizing Generall Major King of the danger he was left unto, by the enemies approaching so strong, till in the end they came so neere to the Generall Majors Poste, having no conshaft of them, till they had strongly invironed him with their horsemen, so that the Generall Major finding no passage open, he being pursued did valourously with a few men defend themselves, till in end being weakest, they were made to yeeld, where
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15340:132"/>
after divers wounds honourably received, the Generall Major was taken prisoner, and kept long under cure, till that after he ransomed himselfe, and being come loose againe, he levied more Forces of horse and foote for the <hi>Swedens</hi> service, to be the better revenged of his enemies, and after that fortunately and valourously behaved himselfe, with the generall applause as well of strangers as of his Country-men; being also well reported of by his very enemies, so that since his vertues and noble carriage have still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced his credit, which for my part, I wish to continue, he being now Lievetenant Generall.</p>

               <p>His Majesty againe like a wise Generall, pondering and considering how weighty his enemies enterprizes were, in seeking to overcome <hi>Nuren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and knowing, if that once they did get <hi>Nurenberg</hi> on their side, the rest of the great Cities would follow, in regard whereof his Majesty resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the safest course for him and the Towne both was, to set downe his Leaguer strongly betwixt the Towne and the enemy, aswell to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their correspondence, in case of their unconstancy, as for their defence, in case of their loyalty. For his Majesty knew well there was as great vertue in keeping of a conquest, as in getting of it: And therefore at this time, as formerly at <hi>Statin, Werben</hi> and at <hi>Wertzburg</hi> against <hi>Tilly,</hi> he resolved to take him to a defensive warre, with the spade and the shovell, putting his Army within workes, having the supply of such a back-friend as <hi>Nuren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> was, to assist him with men, meate and Amunition, untill such time as he might weary his enemy, as formerly he had done, or that succours might come to him, that he were bastant for them in the fields<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having thus happily resolved, both the Armies strongly intrenched before others, they did bring the eyes of all the Potentates in <hi>Europe</hi> upon their actions, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> designes, to see how the end would prove, and who should be thought wisest of both. But you shall see that he that was at this time the terrour of the world, the subduer of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the daunter of <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15340:133"/>
the hope of <hi>Britaine, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> was able even unto his death to suppresse the pride and Tyranny of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of his Ministers and Servants, being all but Novices in warres, in comparison to the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the North, the invincible <hi>Gustavus,</hi> who in glory and dignity did farre surpasse all his enemies, as is cleered by his former wisdome, in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his victories, and hereby his great care and diligence in preserving his friends from the fury of their enemies, exercising his Army within a close Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer, to handle their Armes well, after his owne new discipline, being taught to keepe their faces to their enemies in retiring as in advancing, never turning backs on their enemies as of old.</p>
               <p>It is also to be admired the great provision this City was provided with, being no Sea-towne, as of victualls and Amunition, where it was reported that they had oates, which was distributed to the Army, that had bin kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred yeares, and this City was ever from the beginning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their wisdome and policy in counsell, more then for their force in Armes, from whence did come the <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverbe, that he who had the wit of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> the money of <hi>Vlme,</hi> the pride of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> with the power of <hi>Venice,</hi> might doe much in this world.</p>
               <p>Here then at <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> as at a safe bay, his Majesty like unto a wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Master of a ship perceiving the storme coming on, casts out his best Anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, riding out the storme till it blowes over, and then finding the Gale to favour him, he lanches forth to looke for his enemies. For his Majesty knew well when it was time to give a blow, as he did know the surest way to ward and hold off a blow: and we see here his Majesties counsell was of much worth to the good of the City, as his power in Armes; so that his very enemies did not only praise his wisdome, but oftimes did admire it, and as the enemy did strive to starve us, his Majesty knew well, that such a strong Army as they were in the dogge-dayes, lying in the Leaguer in time of so great infection, betime would become neere as weake as we were. As also his Majesty knowing the evill that is incident to all Armies through idlenesse, he pressed to keepe us still in handling and exercising our Armes; for he knew well, mans nature was like Iron, that did rust when it was not used, and on the contrary, he knew that well exercised Souldiers, as he had, would desire to fight, when Novices (as his enemies had) would be afraid to stirre out of their Leaguers: for oftimes it is not the multitude doth the turne, but it is Art begets victory.</p>
               <p>Having spoken in the discharge of this duty of the actions of some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy personages, I minde here to observe somewhat in commemoration of the persons worths that did leade them.</p>
               <p>First then we see, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> divers times was forced with little credit to retire out of the <hi>Paltz,</hi> and that in respect he never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For we presuppose, in foure dayes retreat the defender could once have made choise of ground, where making use of his Cannon, his enemies would be glad they had not advanced so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but rather that they had suffered them to passe: but an enemy once feared never fights well, except extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity make him desperate, and then it is not safe to deale with him.</p>
               <p>Likewise we see here, as they were not all <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, so they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> were not all <hi>Swedens,</hi> that followed; so that we finde there are some good of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15340:134"/>
all Nations: but it is certaine that at such times the worth and valour of a Leader is best knowne, not only in fighting examplary to others, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in directing others.</p>
               <p>We see here, that the turbulent insurrection of the Boores in <hi>Schwabland</hi> is soone stilled, when they want a head to leade them, where we see, the giddy-headed multitude doth ever wagge like the bush: for though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they grow pale for feare, they are so impudent, that they never blush at their faults, though oftimes they are well corrected for their errors.</p>
               <p>Here also we see, the valour and policy of Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> much to be commended, as a prudent Commander in all his enterprizes, overcoming more by wit and policy, then by dint of Armes. For though resolution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failes, yet by stratagems he overcomes more, then by killing; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victorious he did shew his clemency, that another time his enemies might yeeld the sooner unto him, seeing he had used these well, whom formerly he had subdued: and this Cavalier being noble, according to his birth, he knew that the strength of victory consisteth in the using of it well, which made hime ever give the better quarters; for as he was noble, to make him the more noble, he was indued with reason; so that he conjoined Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Vertue, which made his worth much esteemed of, and though he was descended of noble Progenitors, yet his minde raised him above his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he being fit to command Armies, and his birth did beget the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test obedience next unto his Majesty over the whole Army, being resolute, noble, and prudent withall.</p>
               <p>In the former discourse had of the acts of that noble and worthy Cavalier, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> though our enemy <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> his name merits to be inregistred, for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous courage, extraordinary diligence in his expeditions, and the fortunate successe, that did accompany his valorous conduct at divers times, even unto his death. This noble Cavalier was so generous, that nothing seemed difficult unto him, fearing nothing, not death it selfe, once resolved, and as he was valiant, so he was most diligent in all his expeditions; for while he lived, those Armies next unto him were never suffered to sleepe sound, which made his Majesty of <hi>Sweden</hi> esteeme more of him alone, then of all the Generalls that served the Emperour, wishing one day he might rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him, to try his valour, whom he honoured so much, though his enemy.</p>
               <p>This valorous Captaine after the Battaile of <hi>Leipsigh,</hi> was the first that adventured, with a single Convoy, to passe through his Majes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies Armies, unto the neather <hi>Saxon Creitz</hi> to put life in the cause, being come againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Majesty of <hi>Sweden</hi> and home, desirous to gaine credit, he delaied no time, but on the contrary used all diligence, till he got an Army of old Souldiers together out of the Garrisons, and then began to take advantage of his enemies, catching them unawares, like a valiant Captaine and Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he suffered no grasse to grow where his Army did tread, but traversed from one place to another, adding and augmenting still to his owne credit, but diminishing and substracting from the reputation of other Generalls, till he obtained the name and fame of the most valiant, and most vigilant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall that served the Emperour, being in effect more furious sometimes in his conduct then requisit for a Generall, fearing nothing but the indignation of his Superiour, whom he served valianty and truely. This kinde of bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though haply it doth prosper for a time, yet sometimes in others, it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15340:134"/>
may overwhelme all the good fortune that formerly they attained unto. For nothing is lesse to be allowed of in a Commander, then bouldnesse without reason, though sometimes things happen to succeed well, being pregnable for such daring men, as the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Papenhaim</hi> was, being both truely couragious. Neverthelesse, this daring is not to be made a custome of; so being oftimes the example is as faulty, as the deede in an Army.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Papenhaim</hi> in his attempts, so farre as I could learne, was unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his carriage, as a Leader, except at <hi>Mastreicht,</hi> where he was blamed for too much forwardnesse with disadvantage, having lost more men then the attempt proved credible.</p>
               <p>As this valiant Cavalier strived to doe notable service unto the Emperour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> even so Felt-marshall <hi>Gustavus Horne,</hi> being a valiant Cavalier, without either gall or bitternesse (as they say) but on the contrary he was wise, valiant, sober, modest, vigilant and diligent, striving in all his actions to please God, and his Master the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Papenhaim</hi> was thought bould, and heady in his resolutions; The other <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> was remisse in advising, but very resolute and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the execution; partes most worthy praise in a Commander, being Subalterne to anothers command, as he was unto his Majesty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who could never enterprize of himselfe, more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here also we have occasion to praise the wise and valorous conduct of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Felt-marshall <hi>Arnheim</hi> in <hi>Silesia,</hi> where he obtained great victory over his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, being indued with a singular gift befitting a great Commander, in giving every man that was under his command, his due meanes allowed to him by his Superiour, a rare quality in a great Commander, being one of the speciall points that is powerfull to oblige the love of Officers, and Souldiers unto their Superiours, making them refuse nothing against their enemies they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto: in the greatest extremity Souldiers can feare no danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well paied by their Superiours.</p>

with us really; and then they would with hunger, starve both the City and our Leaguer, which hardly they could doe, we being provided of good men to fight, as also of good entertainment to sustaine our number. But the enemy feebly remaining within his workes, though beyond us in number, we thundered on them with Cannon, repaying their cannona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding spent before <hi>Verbine,</hi> the yeare before, on the <hi>Elve.</hi> And it is thought,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> that the invention of Cannon was found first at <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> for the ruine of man, being at first a long time used for battering downe of walles and Cities, and for counter-batteries; till at last they were used in the fields, to breake the Squadrons and battailes of foote and horse, some carrying peeces called <hi>Spingards,</hi> of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Likewise here we have set before us the revolution of humane affaires,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> being ever inconstant, shewing us that good Fortune, Lucke, or chance, as they call it, is never still in one side: for his Majesty that formerly was alike fortunate with few, as with many, here though having a mighty strong Army, he is crossed, being frustrate of his expectation, arising by the neglect of a small point of recognos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing, his Majesty having trusted too much to others wrong relation, that did not satisfie themselves; which made his Majesty contrary to his custome ingage his Army, and once being inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon slight intelligence, the reliefes went on so fast, the service being so hot for a time, that it was long before the losse was perceived, where it is to be pittied, that the errour and fault of another should be made to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, as his Majesties over-sight, by those that know no better: for though a King leading an Army had <hi>Argos</hi> eyes, yet it is impossible he should looke unto all things himselfe. The fault of one here we see with the losse of many was irrecoverable, and he that before this day was the terrour of the Empire, by his former successe, being deceived with false intelligence, is thought to have overseene himselfe, the errour of another being imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesty in losing so many brave fellowes; which shou'd teach others to be the more circumspect in recognoscing, before they should ingage men in bringing them upon the shamble bankes.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15340:139"/>
Retreate, after such a great losse, for if the service had continued, the whole Armie had beene indangered; yet a valourous Captaine, as our Leader was, as he feares nothing entering on service, so he ought to set light by nothing, he sees tending to his prejudice, but ought timely to retire, with as little losse as he may: for it were a grosse errour to despise our enemies through too much confidence in our selves; for some times by despising our enemies (as here) we make them the more valiant, and if they be ambitious, the more respect we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> give them, the lesse we neede to feare them. And it is necessarie, when an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth get a clappe, as we did here, then incontinent and with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we should presse to trie our enemie againe; wheresoever we can have any advantage, lest our enemy might judge us altogether to have yeelded and given over, which were very dangerous.</p>
               <p>The bouldnesse of one bould fellow at first, being a Leader may ingage a whole Armie for want of judgement, as was done here going before this hill of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> where as many were brought in danger, as did tread in the first Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders paths, through lacke of judgement, having beene all of them more heady than wise; yet to dare being annexed unto vertue is the beginning of victory: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, a hasty man in an Armie, without judgement and discretion, is to be disallowed of, aswell as a coward.</p>
               <p>On my Poste under the Hill, after I was shot, a sudden feare came amongst the Souldiers, some thirtie horse having suddenly come through the wood, as if they had beene chased, the most part both Officers and Souldiers ranne away, leaving mee with a few number on the Poste, so that if the enemie had fallen out, I could not have escaped from being kill'd or taken; but as soone as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that I with the Souldiers remained by me, had unhorsed and taken some of the horsemen, who were found to bee friends, they being ashamed of their miscarriage retired, having accidentally rencountred with <hi>Hepburs</hi> Captaine Lievetenant, who brought them up againe, whom I threatned to shew his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of their behaviours: neverthelesse being loath to incurre the hatred of a brave Nation, for the misbehaviour of some unworthy fellowes, their blemishes I pressed to cover: notwithstanding afterwards some of the Officers amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves came to a publique hearing, having blamed one another, till the question and disgrace was taken away; by shewing their particular courage in fighting one against another, whereof I kept my self free, suffering them to deale amongst them, being Country-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> This kinde of Panicke feare without cause doth betray many brave men, and divers good enterprizes. And therfore all good Commanders ought most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to looke unto it, to avoyde the inconveniences incident unto the like, while as they leade either partie or Armie. Wee once marching through a woode towards <hi>Franckfurt</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> the white Regiment marching in the Van, having a naturall foole, that marched alwayes before them, going within a bush, throwing off his clothes returning naked, and crying, he had seene the enemie, the whole Souldiers of that Briggad throwing downe their Armes, they ranne backe on the next Briggad being <hi>Swedens,</hi> and they running also away, till they were holden up with pikes by our Briggad, being the third, who having stood, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the reason of their running away; in end, being found a false, and a foolish Alarum, the poore foole was pittifully cut and carved by the Officers, for the Souldiers phantasticke feare, being a poore revenge for their cowardize, so that we see by the example of the third Briggad, that the best remedie against such Panicke feares is not to feare at all; and none should leade Armies, but those that are both wise and stout.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> THE separation of these two mightie Armies was wonderfull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shot of Cannon, Musket, or Pistoll, the like we can hardly finde in any Historie.</p>
               <p>We see then here, that when the foundation of mans actions is laid sure by vertue, the building hardly can faile, especially when we lay our chiefe dependance on <hi>God,</hi> and our cause being good, the lawfull meanes used (as was done here by the <hi>Lyon of the North,</hi> the Invincible King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Nurenberg</hi>

all their enemies; yet, with all their bragging, they durst never present themselves in the Fields, with one Cornet, Colour, or Regiment before <hi>Gustavus,</hi> being terrified at his presence, which did prove their valour was not correspondent to their power in Armes, otherwise they had given us greater reason to have esteemed better of their Conduct, so that wee see, there is neither wisedome, force, or power of counsell, that can prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that cause the <hi>Lord</hi> defends; and who can thinke those could prosper better, who formerly pressed by their crueltie to have subverted the truth of Religion; by banishing the Gospell, and Ministers of it, forcing Commons against Conscience, either to forsake their Country and possessions, or to renounce the truth they professed, persecuting those that would not conforme themselves to their Devilish Traditions; what wonder then, those Generalls could not prosper against the truth, or against him that tooke the defence, both of truth and people, against the Tyranny of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and their cruell Generalls, that were not onely cruell to their enemies, but also to their servants and Souldiers, whom they left bleeding behinde them in their Leaguer, destitute of all comfort; not so much as once to cause to dresse their wounds, that they received honourably for their safeties? Truly I dare be bold to say, the <hi>Lord</hi> will not suffer the negligence and inhumane crueltie of such Commanders to be unpunished, that left unchristianly those poore Souldiers, which were bould to open their brests to receive wounds, for the safetie of those that had no compassion on them in their extremities. O cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of all cruelties! when we see a valiant Souldier naked, hungry, or pined, with his wounds bleeding for our sakes, and then to leave them destitute of helpe, to the mercy of their enemies, especially, when we are not compelled to leave them! This fault of all faults in a Commander or Souldier, in my minde, is most unpardonable, which is too common. Therefore, I conclude,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> such persons to be unworthy Command, that preferre any thing before the health of those, who were willing to give their lives for the safetie of their Commanders.</p>
               <p>Sith then we see, that the greatest part of humane happinesse doth consist in vertue, let him that would prove wise, fix his eyes and minde to judge other mens actions, to the end he may grow the more circumspect and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, pressing to doe good by continuance of time, if he but observe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of chances incident unto all estates, from the Crowne to the lowest Cottage, in the end, through their examples, he may learne to better him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and become wise in his profession: for a diligent servant to such a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as <hi>Gustavus</hi> was, might in a few yeares time observe many things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the knowledge of a Commander, though I grant, never attaine unto the perfection of his Calling; for the accidents of warres being infinite, the knowledge of them can never be limited. But we must alwayes be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of new things, till we become more prudent, though not perfectly wise in our calling, being infinite; and though many thinke a man may be wise, and not couragious, seeing the wise fore-sees all dangers; truely I will thinke, he that is circumspect and wise in this kinde, may be called a stout Commander: for to a wise man, we say, nothing comes wrong; and he that cannot be surprized in this kinde, must needs be both wise and stout.</p>

               <head>The thirty-ninth Observation.</head>
               <p>IN the discharge of the former dutie we see his Majestie was troubled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> with a double care; the one for his <hi>Queene,</hi> the other for his Armie; being diligent in bringing both forwards, as also carefull to put them both in assurance; for having left the <hi>Queene</hi> at <hi>Donavert,</hi> he marched on <hi>Rhine</hi> to subdue his enemies. Where we see, that it behooved him first to put his <hi>Impedimenta</hi> in assurance, teaching thereby Cavaliers, that followed him in time of service, to quit their wives, whereby their care might be the better employed in discharging the points of their Calling; which shews us, that such impediments at such times were better away than present: for our nature is ever to grieve much for the losse of things we love. Therefore our care that are Souldiers having wives should be to settle them, where they should not be <hi>Impedimenta</hi> unto us, in discharging of our duties before our Enemy, to the end we might the better be freed of this double care, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie was subject unto at this time, which no question troubled his Majesties resolutions more than any thing else.</p>
               <p>The tragicall end of this <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonell <hi>Metzlaffe,</hi> should teach all Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, to whom Strengths are concredited, not to give over without great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie; especially being made fore-seene of a Reliefe to come. And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test blame, that was imputed unto him, was his too much neglect of the duties of his Calling, being too carefull to entertaine Cameradeship night and day, the fruit whereof in the end was ignominie, with the losse of life and credit. Which should teach all men to avoide such a beastly life, dishonouring the noble profession of Armes.</p>
               <p>We see then no law or justice is more strict or more summary, than the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> Discipline military; where the Articles we are sworne unto, are our lawes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15340:144"/>
which being transgressed, we are subject to the punishment: and if our lawes were not strict, and our punishment sharpe, it were impossible to keepe us in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. But I am sorry, that for the most part we abstaine more for feare of punishment, than for obedience to <hi>God</hi> and the law. This censure though hard from me, the truth is still the same, though man were silent.</p>
               <p>On this march towards <hi>Saxonie,</hi> all things succeeded to his Majesties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, as presages of his ensuing victorie; seeing Fortune smiled on him, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life time, being Fortunes fellow, he was still incouraged to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, though weakest: for magnanimitie and the vertue of true humilitie were both cohabitant in him. For as he had courage with a weake Armie to rancounter a stronger; Even so he humbled himselfe before <hi>God,</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before the people, he was but dust and ashes, like unto other men. And therfore he wished the people they should not trust or repose any thing in him, but to put their trust and confidence in <hi>God,</hi> saying, he was but a servant: and though the <hi>Lord</hi> would be pleased to take him away from amongst them, yet, he doubted not, but the <hi>Lord</hi> would raise up others more powerfull than he, to defend the good Cause he had begunne, till at last it were brought to a good end.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> These speeches, and much more to this purpose, his Majestie out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie uttered on this march; and as his Majestie was humble, so his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie to all men that loved him, was the gemme of his Crowne, especially honouring and respecting ever His <hi>Queene,</hi> as the glory of her sex, his Royall Majestie being truely indued with such true splendour of noble worth, that he ever seemed like unto the Sunne, that shineth alike on the Paisant in the field, as it doth on the Emperour in his Throne. And when his Majestie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us at <hi>Rhine</hi> on the <hi>Leacke,</hi> then our Sunne on earth went away unto another <hi>Horizon,</hi> leaving us eclipsed, through the want of our Leader; so that in the rest of our warfare we had none to depend on, but on <hi>God</hi> alone, the onely sure Anchor for a troubled soule to rest on.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this Observation, having followed the <hi>Lyon of the North</hi> thus farre unto the Battaile of <hi>Leitzen,</hi> though I was not at the Battaile, yet for my love to my Master, and to discharge the dutie I owe unto my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, I will relate the true manner of this Battaile in short, being the end of the second part of my expedition, under his Majestie of <hi>Sweden,</hi> of never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing memory, leaving the third part of the expedition to a fitter opportunitie; except so farre as we marched before we were sworne to the Evangelist Stends, under the Conduct of Palsgrave <hi>Christian Brickerfeild</hi> in <hi>Baviere,</hi> and afterward under the Feltmarshall <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> in <hi>Schwabland.</hi>

               <p>THE Kings Majestie of <hi>Sweden</hi> knowing that the Duke of <hi>Freedland</hi> had quit the Towne and Castle of <hi>Visenfelts,</hi> and had the fourth of <hi>November</hi> marched with his Armie towards <hi>Leitzen,</hi> two miles from <hi>Leipsigh,</hi> his Majestie on the fift of <hi>November,</hi> with the whole Armie, two

houres before day brake up from <hi>Nawmburg,</hi> setting after the enemy, coming the same day after noone-tide in sight of them; He presented himselfe with his Armie in order of Battaile, so that incontinently the skirmish went on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace by the Troopes, which were commanded out from both Armies, whereupon the <hi>Swedens</hi> made still good use with their small Cannon, till the night did put them asunder. In which skirmish the <hi>Swedens</hi> had gotten one of the Crabats Standards, whereon was drawne the Fortune, and the Eagle, which on our side was holden for a good beginning.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedens</hi> Armie this whole night standing in Battaile, his Majestie was of intention to have fallen on the Emperiall Armie two houres before day: but by reason of a thicke mist which had fallen, it behooved his Majestie to attend the rising and clearing up of the day. But the enemy perceiving the <hi>Swedens</hi> coming so neere unto him, it could not goe off without fighting: he did in the meane time see well to his owne advantage, giving out orders they should incontinent make the Graffe or Ditch, they had before their Front, deeper than it was first made, and to lodge Musketiers within it, which they might have before them, equall to any breast-worke or Parapet for their better safeties.</p>
               <p>His Majestie then having ended the morning prayers, and that the mist was vanishing away, by the rising of the Sunne, giving out, by all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the tokens of a cleare day. His Majestie then with comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation exhorted every man, foote, and horse, to fight bravely, especially directing his speech unto the <hi>Swedens</hi> and <hi>Finnes:</hi> You true and valiant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> brethren, see that you doe valiantly carry your selves this day, fighting bravely for <hi>Gods</hi> Word, and your <hi>King</hi>; which if you doe, so will you have mercy of <hi>God,</hi> and honour before the world; and I will truely reward you; but if you doe not, I sweare unto you, that your bones shall never come in <hi>Sweden</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> also his Majesty exhorted after this manner: You true and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Dutch</hi> brethren, Officers and common Souldiers, I exhort you all, carry your selves manly, and fight truely with me; runne not away, and I shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard my body and bloud with you for your best, if you stand with me, so I hope in <hi>God</hi> to obtaine victory, the profit whereof will redownd to you and your successours: and if otherwise you doe, so are you and your liberties lost. His Majestie having ended this speech saith, now let us to it, and let us cry unto <hi>God</hi> with one voice, <hi>Iesu, Iesu, Iesu</hi> helpe me this day to fight, for the glory of thy Name: He advanced then in full Battaile fasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tasted meate nor drinke, right forwards towards the Towne of <hi>Leitzen,</hi> where on both sides the Duke of <hi>Freedland</hi> his Horsemen did present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, untill such time as their Generall had brought their Infantrie in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, beside the Winde-mill, and then to a side, by the Ditch that was before their Front, they retired backe a little, and set themselves in Battaile, on the right hand of the Towne of <hi>Leitzen,</hi> and then putting the Towne on fire, to the end the <hi>Swedens</hi> on that quarter could doe them no harme.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding whereof, with full resolution the <hi>Swedens</hi> Armie, in full Battaile marched by the side of the Towne on the ditch, where their Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were lodged, and presented themselves in good order, against the mighty and strong Emperiall Armie, whereupon, the Emperialists great Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

noyse; so that the Cannon played two long houres on both sides, the fight going bravely on, betwixt nine and tenne of the clocke, that his Majestie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe advanced towards the enemie, with the Van-guarde of his Armie, even to their Graffe, where their Musketiers were set much to his Majestie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, so that sundries of his Majestie forces fell therein; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, they chased the enemie a little out of the ditch, and tooke seven of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> the Emperialists Cannon, that were planted alongst the Graffe. After this, the other <hi>Swedens</hi> Briggad, or yellow Regiment of the Guard is come after, and not esteeming of the Graffe in their way, or of the three squadrons, or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes of the enemies foote, being foure times stronger than they, which they manfully did beate, making them to give ground, till they were ruin'd, and then on the second time, scattering them also even untill the third advancing, and being growne weake, and wearie with so many brave Charges, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the enemies third Battaile, which were seconded well with two squadrons of horsemen, at last, with the blew Regiments comming up to relieve them, driven backe, and almost so scattered, that they were ruined, and the seven Cannon which formerly they had wonne, were taken from them againe. In the meane time, the <hi>Swedens</hi> small Cannon, that were planted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Briggads, being righted on the enemies Cannon at the winde-mill, whereon also Duke <hi>Barnards</hi> Cannon, which were before his Briggad, played on the enemies Cannon towards the wind-mill, doing great hurt to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, so that they were forced to retire their Cannon a little behinde the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars house; in this meane time, his Majestie with some squadrons of horse charged the enemie, that was thrice stronger than they, charging with their right wing, his left wing falling on them with such furie, that their Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, or reserve were astonished, being so furious, that they went through their enemies, putting them to the flight. But especially his Majestie himselfe having charged too farre with foure Cornets in the midd'st of the enemies troopes being deadly wonded gave up the Ghost, fighting for God and for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> defence of the true Religion, he departed valiantly and happily for him, in <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse two great bodies of <hi>Crabbats</hi> of the enemies left wing stood firme, and falling on the right wing of the <hi>Swedens</hi> horsemen, with such a crie and furie, advanced so farre, that they were Masters of the <hi>Swedens</hi> Amunition waggons, bringing also some of the <hi>Swedens</hi> horsemen in disorder: whereupon incontinent did fall on three squadrons of the <hi>Swedens</hi> horsemen, under whom Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Rolingen</hi> was one, that did second the rest bravely, who was shot in the Arme. Neverthelesse the <hi>Crabbats</hi> were beaten backe againe with losse, during which time, Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> was not idle, with the left wing of the <hi>Swedens</hi> horsemen, but with the commanded musketiers being of <hi>Leslies</hi> Regiment, and with the small Cannon, charged the enemies right wing, making them retire on their Cannon by the wind-mill and Gallowes, and after long fighting, they were made at last to give ground, quitting to the <hi>Swedens</hi> fourteene peeces of great Ordinance.</p>
               <p>As the Duke of <hi>Wymar</hi> did charge the enemie, their Amunition waggons tooke fire, which did indammage the enemie much, but thereafter, <hi>Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haim</hi>

               <p>In this Battaile as was thought, were killed nine thousand men, besides, those were hurt, whereof many thereafter dyed of their woundes, such as on the Emperours side <hi>Grave Berhertbold, Fon Walestine,</hi> Colonell <hi>Comargo,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Browner,</hi> the old Colonell <hi>Viltzleben,</hi> and others.

               <p>After his Majesties death, there was great and extraordinary griefe and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> over the whole Armie; yet they never suffered the same to be seene out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but prosecuted still the enemie more vehemently, and more cruelly than before. For the Duke of <hi>Wymar,</hi> and the rest of the Cavalieres of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie understanding the great misfortune of his Majestie death, resolved all alike, it was better to dye on the place with his Majestie, than to retire one foote of ground: which resolution was the cause, that in the end they did crowne the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable death of the Kings Majestie with a stately and heroicall Victorie, so that his Majestie in the highest degree of glorie, may be imagined before any King, or Emperour to have dyed, and his life doth eternize alike both his prayse and glorie, being victorious before death, in his death, and after death.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Fridland Walestine,</hi> after the losing of this Battaile, retired with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> his scattered Armie towards <hi>Leipsigh,</hi> and having had no time to continue there, he was forced to take his retreate further unto the Hill's of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and thereafter <hi>Leipsigh</hi> was freed from the enemies forces, by the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that were comming with succours unto his Majestie before the Battaile, whose march was too slow, their succours being come but after the stroaks were given.</p>
               <p>The Castle of <hi>Leipsigh</hi> called <hi>Plassenburg</hi> having holden out long, was taken againe, together with which all other partes in <hi>Saxon,</hi> that the <hi>Emperialists</hi> had taken, were freed againe, by the <hi>Swedens</hi> the second time, as <hi>Camnits, Fryburg,</hi> &amp;c.

all Maiesty to fall. But we may say with <hi>Salomon</hi> in the twenty-eight of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and twenty-one verse. <hi>It was for the sinnes of the Land, and our sinnes, that he was taken from amongst us,</hi> and from those poore Cavaliers, that did follow him, for his Maiesties love, and the love of the cause. He was shot with three Bullets, dead with the last, for our sinnes and the sinnes of the Land. And what he did before his death, for the liberty of <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Gospell none but knowes it: he left his owne Kingdome, to bring strangers to freedome in theirs, he set light by his owne life for <hi>Dutch-land,</hi> that they might keepe theirs, he waked and cared day and night for them, as a father for his children, that at last he might bring peace for them to sleepe sound; he brought the keyes and opened their Church doores that were closed up by the Antichristian Idolaters, that the Devills doctrine was banished againe out of the <hi>Paltz,</hi> and Christs Gospell preached, and the Sacraments duely administred, which I saw, and was partaker of, singing thankes unto God for their deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> He it was and none other under God, who helped them to their liberties, He it was and none other releeved <hi>Israell.</hi> Notwithstanding whereof, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse of the people was so great, that with my eares, divers times I did heare some of them say, he might as wel have stayed in his own country, till they had sent for him, so great was their unthankfulnesse! Likewise they said, if he had had much at home, he had not come unto them over seas such a farre Iourney. Was not this to recompence good with evill? Was not this right the chiefe Butlers part, that did not remember <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but forgot him? Was not this <hi>Ioas</hi> his part to <hi>Iehoida</hi> his Father? O then this was the poisonable bullet of ingratitude of the people, for which our King and Master was taken away! Oh would to God the people had never bin so unthankfull, that our King, Captaine and Master had yet lived!</p>
               <p>Moreover as these people were unthankfull, so they were Godlesse many of them in the time of their troubles, as I did behould oftimes with mine eyes a carelesse security amongst them, thinking their victories were so frequent, and their owne power so great, they needed not the assistance of the <hi>Swedens</hi> nor of strangers, and their pride was so great, that disestee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of strangers in their pride, they led a life very insolent and deboist, being given to the workes of the flesh, adultery, fornication, uncleannesse, lasciviousnesse, idolatry &amp;c. In a word, it was even amongst them, as it was in the dayes before the flood, as if the Lord had forgotten them, or could not see their villany, so it behooved God to have punished them by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties death. For in their hearts they said there was no God; so that their mischiefe came on them unawares; and this the peoples carriage caused his Majesties untimely death, being shot the second time. O would to God they had done otherwise, and served God more truely, that we might have had the presence and conduct of our Magnanimous King longer, till the pride of <hi>Austria</hi> had bin more humbled, and the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> brought unto repentance of her Idolatries! O would to God I could enough lament his death! As also lament my owne sinnes, and the wickednesse of the people, that was the cause of this untimely death, through their sinnes! And his Majesties selfe also being a sinner, as he himselfe oftimes confessed, wishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that God would not lay to his charge the greate respect and reverence the best sort of the people did give unto him, being but a sinfull man, as they were; for which he feared the Lord was angry with him; shewing by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15340:146"/>
did glory in nothing but in the Lord, ascribing ever all his victories unto God, and nothing presuming of himselfe. For I dare be bould to say he was a man according to Gods minde, if there was one on earth. Such was our Master, Captaine and King. As was <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of many, so was our Master, Captaine and King. Was <hi>Noah</hi> in his time unreproveable? So was our Master, Captaine and King. Was <hi>Iob</hi> in his sufferings patient? So was our Master, Captaine and King. Was <hi>Ionathan</hi> true and upright in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his word? So was our Master, Captaine and King. Was <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> in his warres penitent, and busie craving the helpe of the Lord? So was our Master, Captaine and King. Was <hi>Simeon</hi> good and full of the spirit? So was our Master, Captaine and King. Was young <hi>Tobias</hi> mindfull all his dayes of the Lord, in his heart, and his will not set to sinne? So was our Master, Captaine and King, like unto a stone most precious, even like a <hi>Iasper,</hi> cleere as <hi>Christall</hi> ever and ever. And truely if <hi>Apelles</hi> with his skill in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> painting, and <hi>Cicero</hi> with his tongue in speaking, were both alive, and pressed to adde any thing to the perfection of our Master, Captaine and King; truely the ones best Colours, and the others best Words were not able to adde one shaddow to the brightnesse of his Royall Minde and Spirit; So that while the world stands, our King, Captaine and Master cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough praised. Alas then! it was our sinnes, and the sinnes of the Army, and the Land, was the cause of our punishment in losing of him, with that unhappy last bullet of the three shot through his head, who was the head of us all under God our Father in Christ, that did undoe us, it was we, I say, that sinned against the Lord and his Anointed. It was our misdeedes did thus grow over our heads that made us lose our Head and Leader. Woe, woe then to us that left the Lord, till we made the Lord take him from us, that was our guard and comforter under God in all our troubles! What then ought we to doe that one day we may raigne with him in glory? While it is to day we must cast off the workes of darknesse, and embrace the light in newnesse of life, repenting of the evill, and turning away from our wickednesse by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, not like unto <hi>Cain,</hi> not like unto <hi>Saul,</hi> not like unto <hi>Achitophell,</hi> not like to <hi>Iudas Iscariot,</hi> who all doubted; but like those of <hi>Nineve</hi> in dust and ashes, to fast and pray beleeving in the Lord; and with <hi>David</hi> to say, <hi>We have sinned against thee, and against the Heavens,</hi> be mercifull unto us o Lord: like unto <hi>Peter,</hi> let us, ô Lord, <hi>Weepe bitterly</hi>; let us then repent, and beleeve the Gospell, beleeve, yea and turne to the Lord with all our hearts, with fasting and praying, and mourning with <hi>Saul,</hi> that said, <hi>Thou art more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous then I, in shewing me good for evill</hi>: much more ought we to lift up our voices, and with teares of repentance mourne for the losse of our Master, Captaine and King, through our sinnes and unthankfulnesse. Therefore to day while we have time, let us acknowledge our sinnes before the Lord, and repent, <hi>lest a worse come unto us,</hi> and that then we be cast into prison, <hi>till that we pay the last farthing</hi>; for if the Lord spared not his owne Sonne who was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> blamelesse and without sinne, while he tooke on him our sinnes, what shall then become of us? No otherwise, but except we turne from our sinnes, we must also die the death. Let us not then close our eares, as at <hi>Meriba</hi> and at <hi>Massa</hi> in the wildernesse; but with the forlorne Child cry, <hi>Father we have sinned against thee, and against heaven, and are not more worthy to be called thy Sonnes.</hi> Lord therefore be mercifull unto us, and enter not into judgment with us. Then let us all weare mourning, and lament the death of the valiant

Yet what helpe? <hi>Res est irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, et quod factum est infectum fieri nequit,</hi> what is done cannot be recalled, and should we mourne like unto those who have no hope?

Let us then say with <hi>Micha,</hi> let it be with us as it pleaseth God, and let us say with <hi>David, It is good for us o Lord, that thou hast chastened us with thy Rod</hi>; thou canst also helpe us, and bring us to an happy end of all our miseries, the Lord will not suffer us nor our seede to lacke bread, and the Lord our God did ever give unto the people of <hi>Israell</hi> at all times Rulers, Iudges and Kings, and <hi>Iael,</hi> though a woman de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as a Mother doth not forget her Child, so will not the Lord forget us, but in place of our Master, Captaine and King, will yet give unto us a valiant Leader, come, I hope, of the valiant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>

From her I wish the Leader to come into the field, to fight with goodlucke &amp; victory, with strength &amp; power, with wisdome and understanding &amp;c. against her enemies and our enemies, alwayes well furnished and prepared, the Lord will give him an Horne of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and feete of Brasse to beate his enemies in peeces, the Lord will lift up his hand upon his adversaries, and cut off all his enemies; and to conclude, he will make him treade the Devill under his feete.

Some were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

out to scoure the fields on that side the enemy was to come, others were appointed to remaine beside the Infantry, to second us against the out-falling; or otherwise to second us against the reliefe, that might come to the Towne. The rest of our Horsemen were directed to Quarters, having left Ordonance Rutters to bring them intelligence.</p>
               <p>The Towne being beleaguered on all Quarters, a Bridge was made over the River, where a strong Guard of horse and foote were sent to hinder both their supply and escape on that side. Likewise the approaches were begun, and orders were given in haste for making the Batteries. And the Guards being set both to the Cannon, and to those that wrought in the Trenches, the Colonells were Recognosceing about the walls before their severall Postes. Where at the first, Colonell <hi>Fowle</hi> was shot through the thigh with a Musket,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> who immediatly was sent to <hi>Ausburg</hi> to be cured.</p>
               <p>Before night a second partie of Horse were sent forth for Intelligence, lest any mis-fortune might befall the first partie; whereby we might not be surprized by the Enemy being strong together at <hi>Minchen. Spence</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mine were appointed to attend on the Generall at his Quarter, my Lievetenant Colonell commanded the Guards on the Battery and the Trenches on our Quarter. And the Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> his Briggad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other Quarter next the water, there grew a contestation of vertue betwixt the Officers of both Briggads, who should first with their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches come to the wall; but those of <hi>Ruthvens</hi> Briggad were forced, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their diligence, to yeeld the precedency unto us being older blades than themselves: for in effect we were their Schoolemasters in Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as they could not but acknowledge. So being they were trained up by us from Souldiers to be inferiour Officers, and then for their preferments and advancement they went from us with our favours towards the Generall Major, such as Captaine <hi>Gunne,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Brumfield,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Macboy,</hi> Lievetenant <hi>Southerland,</hi> Ensigne <hi>Denune,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers more, which were preferred under <hi>Ruthvens</hi> Regiment, till in the end they did strive in vertue to goe beyond their former Leaders. Neverthelesse we kept ever that due correspondence together, that where ever we did meet we were but one, not without the envie of others.</p>
               <p>This strife amongst us furthered so the victory, that before the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from our Battery, where <hi>Sinclaire</hi> did command, there was a breach shot in the Skonce without the Towne, as also from the Generall Major his Quarter, there were two Officers of the enemies killed on the wall, their Cannon dismounted, and a great breach made in the wall. So that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my perceiving he had two breaches to defend, he tuck't a Drumme, desiring to parlé. Which being granted; the Accord went on, and they were suffered to march out with their Armes, seeing the Generall had intelligence their Armie was comming to releeve them, he was glad to grant them any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, before he were forced to rise from the Towne by the Enemy, being so neare for reliefe of it.</p>
               <p>The enemy being marched out and convoyed away, the Generall directed Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> into the Towne with a strong partie of foote to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set all the Posts, and then to take notice of all provision and goods that were in the Towne; such as Corne, Wine, Artillery, Amunition, Horses, and all other goods or cadducks in generall, to be used at their pleasure. Which being done, the foote Armie were directed to their former Quarters, to rest
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:15340:148"/>
till further Orders. The Horsemen were directed also to Quarters, and then there were Quarters made in the Towne for the Generall and the <hi>Hoofstaffe,</hi> as also for the Colonells of horse and foote, during the Generall his further pleasure.</p>
               <p>Diverse of our foote Souldiers were hurt on the Batteries and Trenches, which got Quarters in the Towne, being allowed to have Chirurgians to cure them And the Towne was incontinent beset againe with foure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Colonell <hi>Hugh Hamilton</hi> his Regiment, being new levied men out of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and his Major being an <hi>Irish</hi>-man, commanded the men. But another <hi>Dutch</hi> Major called <hi>Mountague</hi> was left to Command the Garrison. Where those that entred first the Towne, did make good bootie of horses and other goods. But the most part was seazed upon by the Generall <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> taking the benefit unto themselves, though not the paine. Where we did first finde missing of our former Leader the invincible <hi>Gustavus,</hi> who not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respected Cavaliers of merit, at such times, but also was ready to reward them by his bountie, allowing <hi>Cadducks</hi> unto them, as he did unto Lievetenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Gunne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day a partie of a thousand Horse, with eight hundred Musketiers, were commanded out toward <hi>Minchen,</hi> to get intelligence of the Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, getting Orders to fall into their Quarters, if conveniently they could. But beside their expectation the Enemy being together and in readinesse in a Wood, unawares our partie was ingaged amongst them, so that with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie having lost prisoners, they were forced to retire, and the Enemy getting intelligence that the Towne was given over, to prevent us they continued their march towards <hi>Rhine</hi> on the <hi>Leacke,</hi> to take it in, in compensation of the losse of <hi>Lansberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The partie being retired, and the Generall understanding the Dukes Army had marched on <hi>Rhine,</hi> he brake up with our Armie, and marched on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the <hi>Leacke</hi> towards <hi>Ausburg.</hi> And fearing the Skonce at <hi>Rhine</hi> and the bridge might be taken by the Enemy, he did direct Captaine <hi>Iames Lyell</hi> with two hundred Musketiers as a supply to the Skonce, being ordained at his comming thither to take the Command of the Skonce on him. Who being come, finding Colonell <hi>Wornbran</hi> there, shewing his Orders, he was made welcome by the Colonell, being hard pressed by the Enemy, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afraid: so that the Captaine had no difficultie in getting the command, which he gladly accepted, being more ambitious of credit than of gaines, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposit to the Colonels humour.</p>
               <p>The Armie having come in time for the reliefe, our Horsemen were left on the side of the River next to <hi>Donavert,</hi> except my Cosen <hi>Fowles</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which marched over the Bridge with the Infantry, being ordained the first nights watch to second the foot. And immediatly after our over-going there were five hundred Musketiers of supply sent unto the Towne, in despite of the Dukes Armie. And then we begun to make up our Batteries, and to run our lines of approach towards the Towne, advancing our Redoubts and Batteries, as our approaches were advanced.</p>
               <p>The second night our Batteries being readie, there were mutuall interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of Cannonading amongst us, where Ensigne <hi>Murray</hi> was shot dead with the Cannon, his thigh bone being broken, who was much lamented, being a daintie Souldier and expert, full of courage to his very end.</p>
               <p>On Sunday in the afternoone the Enemy having heard certaintie of his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:15340:148"/>
Maiesties death, they drew up their whole Armie, Horse, Foote and Cannon before the Towne; and rejoycing at the Newes, they gave three <hi>salves</hi> of Cannon, Musket, and Pistoll. Which we not understanding, made us admire the more. Neverthelesse, the Generall resolved to get some prisoners of them, to cause to make an out-fall the next morning: and to that effect, five hundred Commanded Musketiers were sent under the Command of Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell <hi>Lesly,</hi> who had Orders to fall out before day upon the Enemy. Which he did; and beating them from their Posts, there were above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score killed, and thirtie taken prisoners; which revealed the reason of their <hi>salve.</hi> As also by them it was found, the Armie had been broken up at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and crossed the <hi>Danube,</hi> having made over a Ship-bridge, thinking with expedition to haste unto <hi>Saxonie,</hi> to supply the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> that were reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after their defeat at <hi>Leitzen</hi> unto <hi>Boheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding of the advantage we had to prosecute the Enemy, being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> divided by the River, our Generall would not suffer to pursue them, though Generall Major <hi>Ruthven</hi> with the whole Officers offered to doe good service. The Generall fearing they might be brought to fight through despaire, he would not permit to follow them, but choosed rather to lose a golden oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie.</p>
               <p>Within three dayes afterwards we marched towards <hi>Ausburg,</hi> where we lay two moneths in open Feilds, in the extremitie of cold, without houses or buildings, which undid the Army being idle without hostile imployment, our Generalls giving time to our Enemies to gather strenth to beat us againe out of the Country, which formerly we had subdued by his Majesties valou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>During this time I remained on my Muster place at <hi>Webling</hi> Cloister, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out patents to my Officers, and money to recrue and strengthen their Companies. But the enemy having taken-in the Passe and Towne of <hi>Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> which was given over upon accord by Colonell <hi>Hugh Hamilton,</hi> who was prisoner, and kept almost three yeares; so the enemie getting the Passe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Schwabland,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Menning,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> on the <hi>Eler,</hi> and chased mee over the <hi>Danube.</hi> Being forced to quit a good Muster place, we retired unto <hi>Ausburg,</hi> having set the <hi>Danube</hi> betwixt us and the enemie; where, on our march unfortunately my horse fell on my leg, and being six weekes under cure I continued still with the Armie, on all occasions commanding on horse-back, being unable to travell a foote.</p>
               <p>The next day after our comming to <hi>Ausburg,</hi> Generall <hi>Bannier</hi> did breake up with the Armie to march towards <hi>Vlme</hi> on the <hi>Danube,</hi> there to joyne with the Felt-marshall <hi>Gustavus Horne,</hi> who was to come with a strong partie of horse, foot, and Artillerie from <hi>Elsas,</hi> with whom was come Major <hi>Sidserfe,</hi> and the whole Musketiers of Sir <hi>Iames Ramsey</hi> his Regiment; who being valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and expert old Soldiers, they were commanded on all exploits of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being conducted and led by a discret Cavalier their Major.</p>
               <p>The enemie, before our joyning with the Felt-marshall, had taken in <hi>Landsberg, Kaufbeyre, Kempten</hi> and <hi>Menning</hi> where their Armie did lie, while as we joyned with the Felt-marshall at <hi>Vlme.

               <head>The fourty-one Observation.</head>
               <p>AFter his Majesties departure unto <hi>Saxony,</hi> our Briggad, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly on all occasions followed his Majestie, being often the Guard of his person, as at his crossing the <hi>Rhine</hi> and at <hi>Miniken,</hi> were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; which then we thought very hard, as if thereby we had beene lost, which may be was the meanes of our safetie; for as some flying from danger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> meet with death, others doe finde protection in the very jawes of mischiefe, and some others in their sleepe are cast into fortunes lap, while as others, for all their industrie, cannot purchase one smile from her. Wee see then, that man is but meerely the ball of time, being tost too and fro is governed by a power that must be obeyed: and we know there is a providence ordering all things, as it pleaseth him, for which no man is able to finde or give a reason: we must therefore beleeve S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ierome,</hi> saying, <hi>Providentiâ Dei omnia gubernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; quae putatur poena, medicina est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In vaine then we murmur at the things that must be, and in vaine we mourne for what we cannot remedie. Therefore let this be our chiefe comfort, that we are alwayes in the hands of a Royall Protectour: what ever then befalls us, we must be contented, not strugling against power.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> We see also there is nothing more dangerous for Commanders in warres, then to be thought once by their fellowes, Officers and Souldiers to be greedy of the evill of gaine: which opinion once received by inferiours, may mightily crosse the fortunes of their Leaders: for when Officers and Souldiers conceive an evill opinion of their Leaders, no eloquence is able to make them thinke well of them thereafter; for, a supreme Officer being once remarked to keepe the meanes of those that served them, they are without doubt thereafter despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by their followers. And therefore he is never worthy the name of a glorious Commander, that doth not preferre the vertue of liberalitie before the love of perishing gold; otherwise in his teeth he will be aswell despised by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers, as by his betters; for a brave Commander ought never to make an Idol of the moneys which should satisfie Souldiers, but he should rather looke unto that which may follow, to wit, his overthrow, or at least his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Therefore I would advise Cavaliers, that command and leade others, to entertaine the affection of those that have served bravely and truly, lest being unjustly disdained, they might turne their Armes the contrary way.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> Wee see also the emulation of vertue betwixt friends commendable, in stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving who should force the enemy first unto a parlé; where the diligence and valour of Major <hi>Sinclaire</hi> is praise-worthy, who feared nothing but discredit;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:15340:149"/>
where we see, that the enticement to great travell and paines is glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And we see, all Arts and sciences are attained unto with diligent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise; So that it is not time, or number of yeares that makes a brave Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but the continuall meditation of exercise and practise; For Souldiers should be frequented in running, not to runne away, as some doe, but on the contrary, that with the greatest celerity they may prosecute their enemies, taking time in overtaking their flying enemies, and that they may the better releeve their friends, for more come to be good Souldiers by use then by nature. Here also I did see our Generall following <hi>Guischardin</hi> his counsell, that wished to make a silver bridge to let passe our enemies, but if the enemy on his retreat would grow carelesse and amuse himselfe once on booty, then it were a fit time to medle with him being loaden with booty.</p>
               <p>After his Majesties death we see the alteration of time did give greater advantage unto our enemies; for while as our Army lay idle the whole winter at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> the enemy was gathering his forces, and we losing time neglected our duty, having lost our Head and Leader, when we ought rather to have followed our enemies with fire, sword, spoile and slaug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Dukes Army on their march by the way, tooke in a Castle besides <hi>Koffbier,</hi> where Captaine <hi>Bruntfield</hi> and Quarter-master <hi>Sandelens</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoners, and were sent to be kept at <hi>Lindaw.</hi> As also in their by-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they tooke in <hi>Koffbier,</hi> and continued their march alongst the <hi>Eler,</hi> till they crossed with their Army at <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> we lying that night with our Army within a mile of them; The next day we strived who might passe the <hi>Danube</hi> first for going to <hi>Vertenberg,</hi> where it was our Fortune to get betwixt them and the passe, having line at <hi>Monderkine,</hi> while as they had crossed a mile below us on the River. Which when we understood by our intelligence of their being so neere, incontinent the Felt-marshall caused our Artillery and foote to march over in the night, so that before day our Army advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards the Passe, leaving Dragoniers behinde us, to burne and to cast off the Bridge; But the Bridge was no sooner set on fire, but the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fore troopes did drive our Dragoniers after us, they coming up full Squadrons of horse and foote driving up our Reare, consisting of three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of horse, Colonell <hi>Daggenfield,</hi> Colonell <hi>Cratzstein</hi> and Colonell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> 
                  <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Fowles,</hi> being three valorous Barons, who resolved amongst themselves, <hi>Daggenfield</hi> should charge the enemy first, which he manfully did, and then retired, who immediatly was rescued by Colonell <hi>Monro,</hi> having charged the enemy, retired, being shot through the right foote with a Musket Bullet, and Colonell <hi>Cratzstein</hi> rescuing him againe, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the enemy the last time, keeping them up till the rest were safely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and then retiring himselfe at the Spurres, being last, was pittifully cut over the head with a <hi>Poles-shable,</hi> the enemy following them still, till they were repulsed by our Dragoniers. Neverthelesse they did get the most part of our baggage, and a great number of the horsmens led horses, servants and Coaches.</p>
               <p>The Passe being narrow, and we having the advantage of them, being able to receive them with our whole army, horse and foote, while as they could not advance unto us but by divisions, at most thirty in Front against a steepe hill, where our Army was standing ready in battaile, to receive them horse, foote and Artillery. Which they considering the great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they had to pursue us, drawing their Army also in battaile, they planted their ordinance against us, where once begun, we continued the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> whole day Cannonading one against another, where neither foote nor horse could joyne to skirmish. But the night comming on, the Felt-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall directed his great Cannon away before, and leaving a strong Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of Horse and Dragoniers at the Passe, getting orders to remaine there till midnight, wee retired the rest of our Army unto <hi>Vertenberg</hi> land, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving five miles to march, before day, our retreate being in the night, though safe, was confusedly made.</p>
               <p>The Enemy finding at mid-night that we were gone, followed up our Rere-guard, skirmishing a little, in the end retired. And the whole Armie crossed the <hi>Danube</hi> againe, of intention to ruine all our Muster-places in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15340:151"/>
                  <hi>Schwabland:</hi> and in their way they tooke a <hi>French</hi> Marquesse prisoner on his Muster-place, and Colonell <hi>Iohn Forbesse,</hi> being both carelesse they were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in their Quarters, and were kept prisoners for three yeares.</p>
               <p>The Army quartered themselves in <hi>Schwabland</hi> and <hi>Tyroll</hi> alongst the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Sea, setting Garrisons in Townes, as in <hi>Costance, Pybrach, Vberling,</hi> and divers more. During this time our Armie was well entertained and refreshed in good quarters in <hi>Vertenbergland,</hi> having secured them for that time from their Enemies, we attended the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> his comming with a supply from <hi>Elsas:</hi> as also we did get a strong supply of Country Souldiers from the Duke of <hi>Vertenberg,</hi> with a great deale of Amunition, and a supply of Horse and Cannon. The <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> being come, finding our selves strong againe, we resolved to search the Enemy, for to make him retire unto <hi>Baviere</hi> againe, which we effectuated within ten dayes. After our up-breaking having cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Danube</hi> againe, the Enemy being retired, our Armie did settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> in a close Leaguer at <hi>Donavert</hi> for three moneths together, attending the conclusion of the meeting at <hi>Hailbron,</hi> resolving to enterprise no exployt or hostility against the Enemy, till such time as they should know, who should content them for their by-past service, as also whom they should serve in times coming.</p>
               <p>During which time I went to <hi>Hailbron</hi> to solicite my Regiments affaires with the <hi>Rex-chancellor,</hi> and being there my Cosen Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Fowles</hi> dyed of his wounds at <hi>Vlme,</hi> where he was buried, and there after my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was killed by the insolency of some <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldiers, which were of another Regiment, not his owne, who was also buried at <hi>Bachrach</hi> on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and his Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Iohn Monro</hi> discharging himselfe of the Regiment, they were reduced at <hi>Heidelberg</hi> on the <hi>Neckar</hi> to two Companies under Captaine <hi>Adam Gordon,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Nicholas Rosse:</hi> which two Companies by the Chancellor his Orders I tooke from Palsgrave <hi>Christian</hi> his Armie, and marched with them to <hi>Donavert,</hi> where in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1633.

               <head>The forty-two Observation; being the last.</head>
               <p>IN warres wisedome is of such worth, that the spirit and skill of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> is sometimes better than thousands of armed men. And nothing encourages an Enemy more than the foolishnesse and ignorance of their Enemies in warlike businesse: But on the contrary, he sleepes not sound that hath a wise enemy. For a wise Leader doth all things wisely, and it becomes not a Leader to use himselfe to vanitie, or to intemperate appetites, for, how
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:15340:151"/>
can he command others, that never pressed to command his owne inordinate desires? and brave Leaders of Armies and valourous Captaines should ever looke to their honour and renowne, more than unto riches or pleasure, spoyle or gaine, quitting the spoyle of their Enemies to their Souldiers, they ought to reserve the honour and fame for themselves: for, he wants not meanes but inriches his family, that hath wonne credit, and leaves it to his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Our contestation then should be for honour and credit, and not for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull spoyle or gaine, esteeming more of magnanimitie, where ever it is found, than of riches attained unto; it may be, through feeblenesse and cowardice, lying in a Garrison, having never seen an enemy, or a man killed in the Fields; when other Cavaliers did shew their valour before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, gaining more credit, though lesse wealth, which is of shortest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. For we are not worthy the name of Souldiers, if we glory (as many doe) more in gathering riches (that perish faster than they come) than we doe to get an immortall good name: for we must thinke still, that true honour doth consist onely in vertuous actions, which should make us more ambitious of credit, than of unlawfull gaine attained unto by avarice.</p>
               <p>Here also we see great difference betwixt Leaders; For after we had gotten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Feltmarshall <hi>Horne</hi> to leade us, we began by his valourous good Conduct to recover againe, what others had suffered the Enemy to possesse: and before he advanced, he made his friends sure behind him, as <hi>Vlme,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Vertenberg,</hi> that alwayes in necessitie he might make a safe retreate, as a wise Generall ought to doe, looking what might happen. So then we see, that as Resolution is needfull, Counsell is not to be despised coming from a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast minde; for it is better to save our selves and others, than to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to lose both. But when we have no time to resolve long in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deplorable, then resolution should have place before long advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Here also I did observe, that Generalls are forced to be ruled according to the occurrences in warre. For the Feltmarshall thinking to get advantage of the enemies Armie, he left the Garrison of <hi>Memming</hi> behinde him; For he knew well, if once he did beate or remove the enemies Armie, he could deale the easier with the Garrison in subduing of it. Moreover, we see here, how necessary Cannon are to a Generall to make a safe Retreate, getting any advantage of ground.</p>
               <p>Likewise we see here the goodnesse of Intelligence, which is ever most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> to an Armie, without which no good can be done or effectuated. Which made the Feltmarshall quit the gaining of <hi>Kempten,</hi> to save the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Vertenberg</hi> by his diligence and celeritie, in marching to gaine the passe before the <hi>Imperialists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other part, sloath and neglective watch is to be condemned, while as through securitie Cavaliers suffer themselves to be surprised, as became of the <hi>French</hi> Marquesse and Colonell <hi>Iohn Forbesse,</hi> being both taken in their beds, who ought rather, through good Intelligence, to have been on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe in the Fields before the Enemies comming.</p>
               <p>Also the valour of those Cavaliers that made the Retreate good, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy praise, they having carried the tokens of their valour in their bodies, for the safetie of their Camerades.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:15340:152"/>My Cosen <hi>Fowles</hi> being shot in the foot, retired to <hi>Vlme</hi> to be cured, who through the smart of his wound fell into a languishing Feaver: and as the wound was painfull to the body, so the sinfull body was painfull to the soule, the body being endangered except the wound were cured, and the soule was not sound till the bodies sinne were healed, and both for six weekes did much smart the patient, while as his wounds were dressed. But though his bodily wound was incurable, yet his soule was cured by the punishment of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For, all the time, he like to a good Christian, made himselfe night and day familiar by prayers unto <hi>God,</hi> till he found reconciliation through Christ. So that his end was glorious, having long smarted under correction, though his life was painfull.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> O happie wounds that killed the body, being they were the meanes to save the soule by bringing him to repentance!

My brother Colonell <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Obstell</hi> being untimely and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently taken out of this life, being a true Christian and a right Traveller. His life was his walke, Christ his way, and Heaven his home. And though during his life time his pilgrimage was painfull, yet the world knowes, his way did lead to perfection: for he leaned still on Christ, in whom he was made perfect. And therefore let no man doubt, that though his end was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but his home was pleasing, being by his brethren after death made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Heaven: and though he travelled hard, yet I perswade my selfe he walked right, and therefore was rewarded and made welcome through <hi>Christ</hi> his Redeemer.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="&amp;."/> Shortly after him, my deare Cosen and Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Iohn Sinclaire</hi> being killed at <hi>Newmark,</hi> he did leave me and all his acquaintance sorrowfull, especially those brave Heroicks (Duke <hi>Barnard</hi> of <hi>Wymar</hi> and Feltmarshall <hi>Horne</hi>) whom he truely followed and valourously obeyed till his last houre, having much worth he was much lamented, as being without gall or bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Likewise at this time Lievetenant <hi>Hector Monro,</hi> being also a stout and a valourous Gentleman, died of a languishing Ague in <hi>Vertenberg,</hi> being much lamented by his Camerades and friends.</p>
               <p>We reade in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story; That the memory of the dead was ever honourable and precious, so that the <hi>Romans</hi> wore mourning for their dead friends above a yeare. And the <hi>Athenians</hi> had an Order amongst them, that all those who dyed bravely in warres, their names should be inregistred and set in Chronicle: as also frequent mention was ordained to be made of their names, and of the exploits done by them, in the publique meetings. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it was ordained by them to celebrate dayes in their remembrance, wherein the youth should be exercised in divers exercises of body, called <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres,</hi> whereby the people might be incouraged to follow Armes, for to gaine honour to themselves, to the end that disdaining death they might be encouraged to fight for the weale of the publique. And <hi>Polemarche</hi> the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for those youths, in time of their Exercise, was wont to sing Verses and Songs made in praise of those that dyed valourously serving the publique, and to incite others to the like magnanimitie.

            <p>This Company hath allowed them for Officers, a Captaine, a Lievetenant, an Ensigne, two Sergeants, foure under-Beefeeles, being a Captaine of Armes, a furer of Colours, a furrier, and a Muster-schriver; as also to serve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, three Drummers are allowed, and fourteen passe-volants, with foure muster-youngs, are allowed to the Captaine, as free men unmustered, to make up the complete number of one hundred and fiftie, besides the Officers.</p>

               <p>HAving thus formed a Company, and showne the manner to draw up a complete Briggad, for the younger Officer his better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being a Novice to this Discipline, I will set downe briefely the best way, suddenly to bring a young Company to be exercised, which in my opinion would be thus. First, since every Rot of the twenty-one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Company doth consist, hath allowed a Corporall or a Rot-master as the Leader of the other five, which Leader is supposed to be more expert in handling of Pike or Musket, then the other five, who make up the Rot, and the under Rot-master is supposed to be more expert in handling his Armes than the other foure, so that he is appointed as a second to the Leader, being sometimes a Leader himselfe, then after the company is made up, for the first weeke I would have every Corporall of the six, and the fifteene Rot-masters, being Leaders, with the helpe of their under Rot-masters, in a weekes time, to make the other foure as expert in handling of Pike and Musket, as themselves, or to be punished with Irons in case of their neglect, which the Sergeants should see done, as they should answer to the Lievetenant, the Lievetenant to the Captaine, and the Captaine to the Major, the Major to the Lievetenant Colonell, and they all to the Colonell, which they ought to practise in the fields apart, till the Rot were acquainted, every one with his Leader, from the first to the last: and while as the under Rot-master should turne Leader, then all the followers before, were then Leaders also, and then the Rot being apart, the middle man of the Rot should be taught to double to the Front, till their deepe were three, that was six before, and in falling off againe, the middle man should turne to the contrary side or hand he came up upon, carrying their Armes handsomly free from others,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:15340:155"/>
without making noise in their retiring to their former station, and orders.</p>
               <p>Likewise I would have the Corporall, Rot-master or Leader, being a Musketier, having his Rot once expert, in handling severally the Musket well, then to discharge their Muskets in winning ground, advancing to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Leader having discharged his musket, standing still to blow his pann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and prime againe, having cast off his loose powder, then to cast about his Musket to his left side, drawing backe with his Musket his left foote and hand, till the mouth of the musket come right to his hand, to charge againe in the same place, standing firme till his follower marched by him on his right hand, standing at the same distance before him, that he stood behinde, and then to give fire, blowing his pan, priming, casting off and retiring his musket with his left hand and foote, and to charge againe, as is said, and so forth, one after another, discharging at a like distance, till at last the Rot-master should be under-rot, and the under-rot Leader, and then his follower marching up by him, while as he is charging, giving fire on the enemy, and having discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, standing still also charging, till in th'end, the Rot-master come to be Leader againe, and so forth, still advancing <hi>per vices,</hi> till the enemy turne backe, or that they come to push of Pike, and Buts of Muskets. Thus having exercised the Rots apart for a weeke or two, doubtlesse they will become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Souldiers in using their Armes, when they are joyned in a strong body, lesse or more.

               <head>The manner to exercise a body of Musketiers.</head>
               <p>TO exercise a Squadron of Musketiers, how strong soever they be, the number of Rancks being no deeper than six, the files being even may be so many as your voice can extend to, ever observing that your Command be given in the Front, otherwise may breede disorder, and before you begin to command, you would enter first with a Prologue, as good Orators commonly doe, to reconciliat their hearers attendance: even so you ought with an exhortation of attendance entreate, but by way of command, your Souldiers not to be gazing in time of their exercise, but with stedfastnesse to settle their mindes on their exercise, that they may the better observe and obey the words of command; and above all things, you are to command them to keepe silence, not babling one to another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their motions, to suffer their Armes to rattle one against another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to take heede to their Leaders, that goe before them, and to follow them orderly without disturbance, keeping and observing their due distance either of Ranckes or Files: which may be easily done, if they but duely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Leaders, and have an eye on their right and left fellow Camerades, for keeping their Ranckes even in a like Front. Likewise they are to observe when they are commanded to turne any where, whether it be by Rancks or Files, that their faces may by turned to the hand they are commanded to, before they sturre to march, and then to march alike, and when ever they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouble Rancks or Files, or counter-march, they must ever observe to retire to the contrary hand, they were commanded to double on, if they doubled to the right, when they fall off they retire turning to the left hand, <hi>et contra,</hi> for avoiding of disorder or hinderance, that their Armes would make, if they retired to the same hand they were commanded to double or march to; In their counter-marches it is also requisit in time of exercise, that neither Officer nor Souldier doe presume to command, direct, or finde fault with the errour, but he that commands in chiefe, whether he be superiour or inferiour Officer for the time, since it is said, when many speake few heare; Therefore he must command alone, suffering no rivall, for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of disorder. Order therefore of distance being a chiefe point observed in exercising is three fold, to wit, Open order of Rancks or Files is six foote of distance, being betwixt Rancks and Files both alike, only requisit to be observed in mustering, or while as they stand in danger of Cannon, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in battaile, where in battaile order the distance to be observed betwixt Rancks or Files should be three foote, where Elbow to Elbow of the side Camerades may joyne, where in the open order aforesaid, hand to hand can but joyne. But in close order used most in conversion, or wheeling is shoulder to shoulder, and foote to foote, firme keeping themselves together, for feare to be put asunder by the force of their enemies, and then to disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is ever to be looked unto, chiefely before an enemy. Your speech thus ended, for your generall directions, you begin againe to command silence, and to take heed what is commanded to be done, saying. Height

               <p>All that doubled, turne first about, and then they retire falling behinde those were their Leaders, before in the same place or distance. This dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the bringers up or of middle-men, is very requisit in giving a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>salve</hi> of Musket, and as it is to be observed in rancks, that the best men are placed in front, reare and middle, even so in files, every Corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship being foure files of Musketiers, the likeliest are put ever in the right and left files of the foure, being also of best experience.</p>
               <p>The doubling of rancks being done, and all remitted in good order, and to their first distance of open order, you are to command, and exercise Souldiers in three severall wayes of counter-marching, requisit in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, but in my opinion to be used but seldome, except it be in necessity in such parts, as the ground will not permit otherwise, therefore to avoide disorder, Souldiers ought not to be ignorant of any of the three sorts of counter-marching.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:15340:156"/>First having commanded the Souldiers to dresse their rancks and files, and to carry their Muskets handsomly keeping silence, say.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To the right hand the counter-march without noise or losing of ground.</l>
                  <l>To the left hand retire againe to the former ground.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Then command againe to dresse rancks and files, and to right their Armes keeping silence, taking heede to what is to be commanded, and say.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>To the right hand turne.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Then the Flancke before being now the Front command,
<q>
                     <l>To the right hand counter-march and lose no ground.</l>
                     <l>To the left hand as you were.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is used ordinarily to change one wing of Battaile in place of the other, then that the Front may be as it was first before they Countermarcht.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>To the left hand turne, dresse your Rankes and Files, and be silent.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Another sort of Countermarch is the <hi>Slavonian</hi> countermarch, where you lose ground, the Front being changed also: then you command the first Ranke to turne about to the right hand, then you say to the rest,
<q>
                     <l>Countermarch, and through to your former distance after your Leaders,</l>
                     <l>Then say, <hi>Leaders as you were</hi>; and to the rest:</l>
                     <l>To the left hand countermarch as you were to your first ground.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The third sort of countermarch I esteeme most of to be practised, being rather a conversion very requisit to be well knowne to all Souldiers in all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, chiefly to be used before an enemy: for as it is most sudden; so in my opinion, it breeds least disorder and disturbance, the Souldiers once used to it, of themselves they will willingly doe it on any occasion, the body being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in open order or Battaile order, say. Close the Ranks and Files to your closse order, without encumbering one of another, every man following right his owne Leader, keeping closse to his side man, then say. To the right hand the quarter turne halfe or whole, as the occasion and the ground doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and then say. Dresse your Armes, and follow your Leaders, and open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to your Battaile order.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the body of your Musketiers exercised perfectly after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for the better bringing of them in exercise and breath, that in case any disorder may happen amongst them, they may the better afterward be acquainted one with another, say to your open order of six foote distances. Open both Rankes and Files, and set downe your Armes handsomely where you stand, then command your Sergeant to goe an hundred paces from the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15340:157"/>
body of your Musketiers, and sticke in his Holbert in the ground, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish your Souldiers, that at the tucke of your Drumme they runne from their Armes about the Holbert, and to stay there till the Drumme recall them againe to their Armes, which being done, it makes the Souldiers able in breath to know one anothers place, in case they should be brought at any time in disorder, to recover themselves the better. Thus much for the training of Souldiers in changing of place, as you will have them, without giving of fire.</p>
               <p>When you have gotten your Souldiers thus experimented in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then are you to acquaint them with shot in giving of fire, to make them fix against their enemies, which is easily done, having once apart and singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used their Muskets, after the order of the severall postures, belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as was commanded their inferiour Officers and Leaders to teach them before they were exercised. Therefore before you come to the particular formes of giving fire, you shall first give some generall directions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by all, for avoiding the hurting of themselves, or of their Camerades, as also how they can best offend their enemies; and to this effect, you shall admonish in love all brave Musketiers, first to have their Muskets cleere and hansome, and above all fix in the worke, especially every Souldier would be well knowne with his owne Musket and cocke, to cocke aright, then to hold the mouth or Cannon of his Musket ever high up, either being on his shoulder, or in priming or guarding of his panne, but in giving fire, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver higher or lower than levell with the enemies middle, then your Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers being in readinesse, your Muskets charged, they may be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give fire in skirmish, disbandoned as their Officers doe direct them, to advance or retire, as the occasion offers; also to give fire by Ranckes, Files, Divisions, or in <hi>Salves,</hi> as the Officer pleaseth to command, to the effect they may be fixed <hi>Omni mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> though in my opinion, one way is the best, yet there are severall wayes of giving fire in advancing to an enemy, as retiring from an enemy, or in standing firme before an enemy, either by Rancks, or by Files made to Rancks.</p>
               <p>Advancing to an enemy not being disbandoned, but in one bodie they give fire by Rancks to Rancks, having made readie alike, they advance ten paces before the bodie, being led up by an Officer that stands in even Front with them, the Cannon or mouth of their Muskets of both Rancks being past his bodie. The second Rancke being close to the backe of the foremost, both gives fire alike, priming and casting about their Muskets they charge againe where they stand, till the other two Rancks advance before them, and give fire after the same manner, till the whole Troope hath discharged, and so to beginne againe as before, after the order of the through-counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march; ever advancing to an enemie, never turning backe without death, or victorie. And this is the forme that I esteeme to be the best: as for the rest, they are not to be much used; but this order can be used winning ground, advancing or losing ground in a Retreate. When you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the body of your Musketiers to give fire in a <hi>Salve,</hi> as is ordinarie in Battell, before an enemy joyne, or against Horsemen; then you command the bringers up or Reare to double the Front to the right hand, and to make readie, having the match cocked and their pannes well guarded, having closed the three Rancks, though not the Files, the Officers standing in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Front with the foremost Rancke, betwixt two Divisions, he commands
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15340:157"/>
to give fire, one <hi>Salve,</hi> two or three, and having charged againe, and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Armes, they retire to the left hand againe, every man falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde his owne Leader.</p>
               <p>Being on retiring from the enemie, the whole bodie having made readie, as they march off in order, a qualified Officer being in the <hi>Reare,</hi> and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Officers in the <hi>Van</hi> to order them that fall up, the last two Rancks in the <hi>Reare</hi> turne faces about, and the whole body with them, and the two Rancks having given fire, they march through the body to the <hi>Van,</hi> and order themselves as they were before, and so successively the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die gives fire ever by two Rancks, and falls off till such time as they have made their Retreate sure. Thus much of fire-giving by Rancks on two or three, as you please, at once and no more.</p>
               <p>Now a little for the exercising of the Squadron of Pikes in generall; for the generall motion certaine directions are to be observed concerning Pikes, that the Souldiers keepe their Pikes cleane and cleere, and never to be suffered to cut off the lengths of their Pikes, as often is seene upon marches, being very uncomely to see a Squadron of Pikes not of one length; likewise in all motions with the Pike, the hand and foote ought to goe alike, and the Souldier would be expert in giving the right pousse with the Pike backwards and forwards. Your Squadron of Pikes as they ought to march with the Drumme; so they ought to obey the Drumme beating a Troope, a Charge, a Call, a Retreate. As also to traile their Pikes, to make reverence with the Pike being shouldred: and your Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Pikes being but six deepe in Rancke, your Files may be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as can well heare your voyce in Command, providing there be no odde File; and thus well ordered at their open order of six foote distance, command to mount their Pikes, then calling for a Drumme beside you, let him beate a march, then they are to shoulder their Pikes, flat or slaunt carried, and then to march a little, let your Drumme againe beate a Troope, then they mount their Pikes and troope away fast or slow, as your passe leades them stopping, or advancing as you doe, then let your Drumme beate a Charge, then they charge their Pikes and advance fast or slow, as you lead them, and retire also backwards, their Pikes charged as you will have them, then troope againe, and they mount their Pikes, march and shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and haulting, let the Drumme beate againe, and they order their Pikes on the ground as first, being at their distance, and trooping againe they mount their Pikes, so that you can command them to Battell order or closse order, for Wheeling or Counter-marching at your owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>In repayring to their Colours, or comming from watch, they should ever walke with their Pikes mounted, as also they may use this posture on Centrie; and your Pikes mounted and at your open order, you can use all doublings that your Musketiers used, as also to present, to Front, Reare, right or left hand, the curiositie of the turnes to the right or left hand in <hi>Van</hi> or <hi>Reare,</hi> the Pike being shouldred, you can also teach them, as you will, though not much to be used in exercise: and the Pikes thus well exercised, having seene frequent danger, can doe good service against Horsemen and against foote to foote, either in battell entering a Towne or breach, or retiring, or advancing to choake an enemie, on walls within
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15340:158"/>
Townes or Forts they are very commodious for service, providing they resolve to fight well and to abide by their Officers, and, in my opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well led they may beate Musketiers accidently off the Feild, and being well lined with shot they are a safeguard against Horsemen, having the least advantage of ground. Thus much in briefe for the use of the Pike, the most honourable of all weapons, and my choice in day of battell, and leaping a storme or entering a breach with a light brest-plate and a good head-piece, being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with good fellowes, I would choose a good halfe-Pike to enter with.</p>

               <p>The duty of a good man, is to reserve himselfe for the well and use of his country and friends, being wary lest he should be lost rashly (as my deere and only Brother was) who did not neglect his duty, neither in word nor deede, but to his death served God in his calling, though his death was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, being the condition of mortall men, that are still subject unto such changes, that oftimes in their greatest prosperity comes adversity, and from their adversity their prosperity againe, God hiding the cause of both from us. It were better then to prevent a wound, then out of time to seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: for in the middest of evill is not the time to be merry, and those hurts are most, which we receive unlooked for. Therefore it were much better to prevent, then to suffer, and it were much better to enter in danger being guarded, then out of time to grow pale. Vaine then are the counsells of mortall men, when we see no humane happinesse to be permanent, since the Roots are taken up before they come to maturity, except they be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the divine providence; And chiefely in warres, as being most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, as we see by the untimely death spoken of; but no man can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Gods decree. Neverthelesse men that through age, and long experience have obtained wisdome, before they enter in a businesse, they should looke unto the event, and unto that, which by all expectation may happen: for it is ever the greatest wisdome to use the present time best; we ought then on all occasions we are employed on, to strengthen our minds with vertue, that we may be safe overcoming all incumbrances, that once we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the judgment seate of wisdome, which alwayes is accompanied with praise and glory, when we not only equall our selves with those that excelled in vertue, but also presse to goe before them.</p>

So that wee see that dissension, or discord amongst the Superiours was the first cause of the suddaine losse of <hi>Nerling.</hi> Next wee see that the Countrie was destroyed, not onely for their sinnes, but also for not punishing of sinne. For after his Majesties death, what punishment was to be seene in our Armie? none at all: when our owne horsemen plundered their friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not being punished, they began to intercept Letters, and to robbe the common Poste, and to hinder the Countries correspondencie, and common traffique: which being overseene, and winked at by our Generalls, they begun then to plunder the Chancelours owne waggons, abusing his servants, and taking his baggage: thereafter the strongest amongst themselves set the weakest party to foote, taking away their horses, till at last the whole Armie refused to obey the <hi>Director</hi> and his <hi>Concilium formatum,</hi> lying idle for three moneths in <hi>Donavert</hi> Leaguer, suffering the enemie to over-runne the Countrie, and all because that the Officers alleadg'd after his Majesties death, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners who followed the Chancelour, were in better esteeme, than the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, that had done notable good service unto his Majestie: so that, through this jealousie, the Armie came in disorder, being the first change, and the rest, piece and piece did follow, till at last the whole Armie was lost, through the number of wrongs that went before, in the end custome and use of wrongs infected the nature it selfe, and the lacke, or want of punishment, and the libertie and freedome, which was given to offend, at last the ruine of families, that were famous did follow, for not punishing of sinne.

               <p>To repent a thing, when it is done, is most foolish, which might have beene prevented with counsell: for none that doe repent counsell can be esteemed wise. Therefore a Counsellour should bee very faithfull, never counselling his friend for his owne ayme, lest he that is counselled per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not his drift, and then be deceived. But counsell is taken from necessitie, and follow'd. And a good Commander deserves prayse as well for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as for his valour: But evill counsell is a plague or judgement from the Lord; yet those counsells are ever safest, that come from him that will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker both of the danger, and of the counsell. Therefore it is not good rashly to use the counsell of a Traitor, nor of an enemie: but wee should rather exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and shift counsells, and not trust easily, and bee deceived. Counsell then we see is the chiefe ground to governe matters well, being secret, true and free, without flatterie, or respect of persons, just and holy, casting aside all private gaines, and utilitie, foreseing the publique weale; and if thou wouldest be truly counselled, thou must take heed to those Caveats: first that the speech be wholesome, and unreproveable; his counsell profitable, his life honest, his sentence pleasant, not wavering like a childe, or unconstant, neither ought you aske many what you would doe, but shew it to a few and trustie friends, which are rare to be found: and when thy neere friends cannot resolve thee, flee to those for their counsells, whose daily experience is approved for their wisedome in their owne affaires, and then you shall doe well.</p>

As if we were to blocke up a Towne with a part of an Armie, we must first being accompanied with a few Horsemen recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosce the bounds, riding the Circuit short or long from it, fore-seeing how to divide our number on the Passes &amp; Avenues from or towards the Towne, to stop out-fallings, or in commings, in ordering such Workes and Skonces to be made on the passages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as may put us in safetie, as well against out-fallings, as against their pretended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reliefes to come: and our watches one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, must keepe due correspondence by their Centries, that none can passe betwixt them without advertising one anothers guard.</p>
               <p>Next being to beleaguer a Towne neere hand, we ought to recognosce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so neerer, having first placed our Armie foote and horse Battell without reach of their Cannon, though in their view: having first directed our parties of horse to batter the streets without us, then the Commander is to ride the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Towne within shot, as neere as he can, having another riding at a distance behinde him, and having a Boore beside him, resolving him of all Questions concerning their Ports, their Graffes, their Bulworkes, where weakest, and where the Graffe is shallowest; which being knowne, he dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Armie on severall Posts, where againe the Commanders are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which being done, to advance their workes againe night and day, till the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be forced to Accord.</p>
               <p>In the night also a sufficient Sergeant being seconded by another stout fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, should creepe to the Graffe, with two halfe-Pikes, for to wade through, to know the shallowest parts, being helpt thereto by some knowne Boore, who might give certaintie of the enemies strength within, and of their defects they have of victualls, Amunition, fire or water. As also to know their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate sorting-Ports, to watch their out-commings; he ought also to learne what draw-bridges are within, and what Portcullis, and what store of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, or Amunition is to be had within, in case the Strength be pregnable, that he may the better make his Accord. Also he ought to learne what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery or Armes are within, and what Caducks, or what number of Horses pertaining to the enemie, and what other riches they have, and where kept; or if otherwise the Towne be not taken by Accord, or strength of hand, we must strive to force it to yeeld by hunger, or by lacke of fire or water, or otherwise by throwing Artificiall fire amongst them with Cannon, or with other fiery Engins, fiering their houses, or spoyling their Watches on their Posts or Guards; as also we must deale by fraud to convey private Letters unto them, for deboysing the Inhabitants, to resist the Garrison in making ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Port or Post good, while as the pursuer intends to fall on, on storme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> breach.</p>
               <p>Likewise the pursuer had neede to dispose well of his owne watches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that he be not surprized, his hooffe-watch, particular watches, reserves, or by-watches, are to be still in readinesse to attend the enemies out-falling, lest he may cut off his Guards, or spoyle his Cannon by nayling of them, or by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Carriages, or Amunition, being disgracefull in the highest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as oft-times hath hapned to unprovident and sluggish Commanders, who have unwisely despised their enemies.</p>
               <p>An enemy being in the Field, either with a strong partie or Armie, a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Commander must be carefull in recognoscing the Field about him, for taking his advantage of the ground, in advancing to an enemie, as also in spying his advantage in case he be put to a Retreat, that he may the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in order, not being put to rout, as our Armie was at <hi>Nerling,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hapned unto them before during the time I served the <hi>Sweden.</hi> As also being in the Field he ought to observe where most conveniently he can plant his Ordnance, as Generall <hi>Tillie</hi> did at <hi>Leipsigh,</hi> and as the <hi>Emperialists</hi> did on the Hill at <hi>Nurenberg</hi>; as also at <hi>Nerling.</hi> For Ordnance being planted with advantage is oft-times the winning of the Field, and the losse of Artillery is ever reputed and holden for a defeate, although both foote and horse be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. There is also advantage of ground very requisit to be taken by foote against foote, as the advantage of hights, passages, woods, hedges, ditches, as also the advantage of Sunne and Winde with you, and against your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; which his Majestie of worthy memory did strive to get at <hi>Leipsigh</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Emperialists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise it is a great advantage of ground, when one of both the Armies is brought to that inconvenience, that they cannot come to fight, but the one Armie may be forced to come up but by Divisions, while as the other by advantage of the ground may receive them with full Battailes of horse and foote, the one to second the other; and this advantage <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> did get of the <hi>Emperialists,</hi> while as he retired before them unto <hi>Vertenberg-land</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:15340:164"/>
in <hi>March</hi> 1633. the enemy not being able to pursue our Armie but with great disadvantage, which freed us of them for that time, he being stronger than we, and afterward the <hi>Rhinegraves</hi> Forces come from <hi>Alsas</hi> being joyned with us, we made the <hi>Emperialists</hi> againe retire over the <hi>Danube</hi> unto <hi>Schwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at the passe of <hi>Munderken,</hi> where we came within Cannon-shot; yet they getting the passe, retired in safetie; as they did another time from us, out of <hi>Schwabland</hi> unto <hi>Bierland,</hi> having got the passe before us at <hi>Kempten,</hi> and afterward over the <hi>Eler</hi> in <hi>Schwabland,</hi> having (I say) got the passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, they were safe, and we frustrate. So that the advantage of ground is of great importance in warres, as I have often knowne by experience, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before the Hill at <hi>Nurenberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise a wise Commander being defender must observe all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as he did in pursuing for his owne safetie; he must also being defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beset well all passes, and frontier Garrisons, whereupon the enemie must passe to come unto him, having timely recognosced the same, that it may either be beset by him, or otherwise being found more advantagious for the enemie, it would then be timely demolished.</p>
               <p>As also your enemies Armie, or strong partie being drawne up in the field, you are to recognosce both his strength and order, by the sight of your eye, before you intend to pursue him, where you are to consider, how he can advance to you, or you to him without disorder, but doe you never pursue, except with advantage; though you shall be deemed by others to be remisse, but rather suffer him to be gone, than to take the disadvantage of pursute, since time will alter any thing, and he that preserves an Armie will doubtlesse finde a convenient time to fight. And it had beene good for the <hi>Evangelists</hi> in <hi>Dutchland,</hi> that this point had beene more wisely lookt unto at <hi>Nerling</hi> than it was, for they might have saved their Armie and Countrey both, had they not presumed with disadvantage in their owne strength and courage, where GOD the disposer of hearts made their pride suffer a great fall.</p>

               <p>The posts then orderly and well beset, there should be orders given for by-watch, or reserve, where to stand in readinesse, whether on the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, or some other convenient part, having sufficient Officers ever to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, who must be kept to strictnesse of dutie, left they should be to seeke when honour were to be maintained, while as on Alarum they were to repaire to poste, street, or wall, to resist the enemie, and to succourse the weaknesse of any accident might befall by pursute or fire, or to resist enemies

within or without, being as well on continuall Guard against the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, in case of uproares, or treacherie, as against their outward enemies: since no enemy is so dangerous, as the inward enemy being least suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>Likewise the Governour or Commandant ought to observe and keepe a due proportion in all commandements given either for workes, service, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or parties, that no man might justly complaine, that there is more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie layd on him than on his neighbour, but according to proportion of strength.</p>
               <p>The keyes of the Ports, and of all sorting doores and prisons, are to be brought in and out by the Captaine of the maine Watch to the Governour, and the Captaine of the Watch is to appoint Guards, to stand at the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges, Portcullis; and sorting Ports, and he is obliged to bring all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence himselfe unto the Governour, and never to open a doore night or day without a sufficient Guard by him with the Limits past, for feare he might be surprised, and the whole Garrison in danger.</p>
               <p>Also the Governour is to give Orders at night, whether every man must resort with their Armes in case of Alarum, and the Towne being divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And to supply the defects of the fortifications, the Towne should be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into equall deales, to worke their day about, with all materialls need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for repayring the defects, that there be nothing to mend when they ought to fight; and to that effect, Officers should be appointed by the Governour to over-see the workes, that things may be the better done, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour must often visit all himselfe, taking reckoning what is done every day, till all be put in good order. The Governour ought to have a Register of all inquartering, that he may the better be made acquainted by the Burgers of every mans behaviour for keeping good order. He ought also to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all victualls in their store-houses, both of Corne and all other furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of all Caducks within the Garrison; and the out-setting of all safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards belongs unto him as his due. He ought to suffer no man to make commoditie without his knowledge, but all to put in to him, that he may the better maintaine his state, and entertaine strangers, seeing he ought to be a good fellow, and a common receipt for commers and goers, otherwise he will faile to be thought of; and he must give orders to the Captaine of the watch, that no man come or goe without his knowledge, under paine of punishment, and the Captaine of the watch should direct those that enter the Citie, having seene their passes, with a Convoy and an Officer by night or by day, unto the Governour to be inquired of at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>The Governour as he ought to give out the word, so he ought to see all Parads at the ordinary time they goe to watch, where comming off againe, they ought to repaire to the Parad-place, and draw up orderly, before they lodge their Colours, and the Governour is obliged to visit the Posts, and to goe the round himselfe, and to make the rest goe the rounds orderly after him.</p>
               <p>Likewise it is his due to command out all parties, being first drawne up on the Parad-place, seeing them to be provided of Amunition, and of all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, before their parting, giving strict orders that at their returnes all boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be brought orderly before him, and nothing to be put out of the way or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,

When the defender makes a slight Accord, the heads whereof are set downe in writing, and afterward advised, but once gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cannot be recall'd; the guard once changed, a Commander doth goe to possesse withall, according to the Accord, where incontinent the pursuer makes preparation for the enemies out-comming, that there be no disorder committed in breaking the Accord by either of the parties; for it is a grosse errour for a Christian to violate their word once given: but they doe strive before ending, for honourable Conditions on both sides, the particulars accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on are not necessary to be inserted here, since they doe varie according to the occasions; where sometimes the defender makes Conditions for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, their Liberties, Traffique and Religion, as the place is of importance; and if the defender looke for succours seeing his advantage, he shifts in making the Accord, prolonging time till in the end, as sometimes, the Treatie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves; as was done at <hi>Traylesound</hi> 1628. against the <hi>Emperialists.</hi> And the partie beleaguerer finding himselfe weake without, he continues their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marching till his weaknesse be supplied; as his Majestie of worthy memory

               <p>A Commander ought not be ignorant of the circumstances belonging to the quartering of an Army, therefore for the better Information of the younger sort, who have not seene such Marches as I have bin at, with his Majesty of worthy memory, who quartered his Army Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or Winter, according as the occasion or neerenesse of his enemy did offer, where many times the whole winters night, the Army, horse, foote and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, being without fire, did stand in battaile order by their Armes in the fields, having placed their Artillery apart, with a guard to attend them, their baggage also being behinde them apart, and well guarded, and a maine guard being commanded out apart before the Army, of horse and foote; And the Armies being neere one another, all Officers were commanded to abide on their severall charges, as they were commanded on the March, to leade Briggads, Troopes or Divisions; The commanded men being also apart next unto the enemy, with their Officers by them, which all being orderly quartered in this first manner, they entertained one another with such dainties as the time afforded, passing the night with variety of merry jests and discourses till day, that either Drumme or Trumpet did invite them unto earnest.</p>
               <p>The second forme of our quartering was in the fields not being neere an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, where we quartered a little more commodiously for our ease, being commonly drawne up by foure or five of the clocke in the afternoone, neere some Towne or Village, in some faire meadow by water, if it could be had in the Summer, and in the Winter being quartered, we drew neere the side of some wood, both for fire, and for build or shelter; The Army drew up in battaile by Briggads, as they ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Artillery and Amunition waggons being also drawne up a part, and well guarded, their horses were sent to grasse for good quarters, then the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and wagons as they came up did draw up orderly behinde their owne

So that they may be called <hi>Sine quo nihil</hi>; but supreame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Field, are no more troubled with them, but so farre as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others to doe the service, their owne Officers being appointed to attend them, as the Generall to the Artillerie, his Colonells, Lievetenant-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, Majors, Captaines, Lievetenants, Constables, and all other inferiour Officers needfull to attend, who know and keepe their owne Turnes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes, as other Officers doe theirs; their furniture is great and their charges also in buying Horses to draw their Cannon and Amunition, Waggons, with Powder, Ball, Match, Materials, Fire-Engins, Petards, storming Ladders, Artificiall Bridges carried on Waggons to passe over Rivers or Graffes.</p>
               <p>In all quartering they are quartered next after the Hoffestaffe before any Briggad, and the furniture and charges needfull to maintaine this third part of the Armie is extraordinary great, there being alwayes something to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, while as the Armie doth rest; and oft-times they must be provided of a great deale of new furniture, and they lose yearely an extraordinary number of Horses of great price. But his Majestie during his time was very fortunate in this, as in other things; for I never knew his Majestie lose any Ordnance, but I have seene him get supply of Amunition and Cannon from his enemies; as first, at <hi>Garts</hi> and <hi>Grefenhangne, Damaine, Francford, Lansburg, Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when every Cavalier is commanded apart with a partie where he must make use of Cannon, he would be (before his departure with his partie) very carefull to receive his Cannon with the furniture belonging unto it timely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with sufficient Officers for discharging that part of the dutie, on his march he must command his partie as if it were a little Armie, being ever well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Guides, and of carefull, wittie, and painefull Intelligencers, that he may leade and quarter his partie with assurance, directing alwayes his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer before him, being ever carefull to beset the passes and avenues well. As also sufficiently to guard his Cannon, Baggage, and Amunition, since ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times great hurt doth come thorow the neglect of guarding the Cannon and Amunition: which over-sights once committed are irrecoverable; in regard whereof I must entreate the gentle Reader to pardon me a little here out of Historie (for the younger Souldier his better instruction) to discourse a little of the hurt and inconvenience hath happened many times by Cannon and powder; as also of the manner they were first invented, being found out by <hi>Gods</hi> permission for the ruine of man punished for sinne; experience doth teach daily that the strength of it is not to be resisted.</p>

The maker of it an Abbot, the childe of the Devill, assisted by his Father found out this cruell invention, which serves alike for the pursuer of Townes as for the defender till it ruine both. It is said of <hi>Archidamus,</hi> Sonne to the King <hi>Agesilans,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at a new invention of Cannon brought from <hi>Sicilie,</hi> complained the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:15340:167"/>
valour of men was beaten downe and trod under foote, seeing there was no more fighting without monstrous hardnesse and Armour. And it is thought that a blacke fellow called <hi>Berthold Schuvart</hi> an Abbot invented it. Reade <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> in his second booke and sixt Chapter <hi>de invent.</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus</hi> in his <hi>Ennead. lib.</hi> 9. a fellow having some beaten Brimstone for Physicke closed in a pot covered with a stone, he striking with a file on a stone to give fire, a sparke lighted in the pot, and incontinent the flame came forth, heaving the stone in the ayre; and chewing his Cud thereon, he made a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Iron, closing powder within it, till that peece and peece he found out the invention. And we reade that in the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> in the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> both Printing and Artillerie were knowne and practised there, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were found out in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that there, there be many Cannons, which I will rather beleeve than goe to see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> also in the sixt booke of his <hi>Aeneids</hi> doth speake of the like in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Salmoneus</hi>; and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> in his third booke and ninth Chapter of the <hi>Iewes</hi> warres, makes mention of an Instrument they used against the Towne of <hi>Iotapat</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and saith, the stones shot by Engines did breake the walles and Towers, and there was no Troope of men so well ordered, but was scattered by it, and beaten to the ground. The same Author speaking of the Batteries made against the walles of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> affirmes that the stones shot by the Engines were as heavie as a man: And neverthelesse they were carried above six hundred paces by the Engine, killing many men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinius</hi> writes in his thirty-one booke and tenth Chapter, in his voyage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Babylon,</hi> that powder was in use of old, and reporteth he did see powder-milles on the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> though of another sort than our powder.</p>
               <p>Of this invention also you may reade <hi>Cornel de Campe,</hi> in his storie of <hi>Frise,</hi> in his second booke and twentieth Chapter. Also <hi>Simoscus</hi> King of <hi>Frise, Beresne</hi> Lord of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Olympia</hi> Daughter to the Earle of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Simoscus</hi> killed with one shot of Pistoll the Earle and his two sonnes; and that afterward he would have killed <hi>Rowland</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but the Pistoll mis-giving, <hi>Rowland</hi> did kill him with his sword, and did throw the Pistoll in the Sea. But we reade that <hi>Barbadigue</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>Venice</hi> was the first that carried them on his Gallies and Shippes, wherewith he did terrifie the <hi>Genoweys,</hi> being at hunting by their noise: and <hi>Paul Iove,</hi> in his third booke of illustrious persons, writes that <hi>Barthelem Cokone</hi> Generall to the <hi>Venetians</hi> for the space of twentie yeares and more, was the first that used Cannon in the Fields, while as the banished people of <hi>Florence</hi> made warres against the familie <hi>De Medices,</hi> being first used to make breaches in walles, and to defend walles: but afterward they came in use to breake the Battailes of horse and foote; for if the warres of old, and their inventions were compared to now adayes, it were a sport to laugh at, rather than warres.</p>
               <p>Now of late the invention is found out of burning Bullets, full of fire, shot out of Cannon, to fire houses within Strengths, and to fire Pallesads and Gabeons set before Batteries on walles or in Fields, whereof his Majestie of <hi>Polle Estien Bathon</hi> made good use in his warres of <hi>Musco,</hi> within a few yeares.</p>
               <p>This invention is thought to have been invented by the King of <hi>Pole</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his civill warres of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> finding other Cannon made greater noise than hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:15340:168"/>The manner a piece is charged with a hot Bullet, is, the piece is charged with powder convenient, then it is covered with sand in a little quantitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the powder, then with a little greene grasse presently pluct, being a little dampish or moist, then the hot Bullet being put in must be presently discharged, otherwise the Invention is very dangerous for the Constables; for oft-times minding to ruine others, they are ruined themselves.</p>

                  <hi>Albert Gantz</hi> writes, that <hi>Christophel</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was killed by a shot of Cannon in the yeare 1280. Also we have a deplorable storie written by <hi>Gyrrard de Rooe</hi> and <hi>Conrade Decius,</hi> of the Battaile betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Albert</hi> and the <hi>Poles</hi> in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Amongst their Cannons there was one Cannon greater than the rest, which for her execution was most used, shee killed so many of the <hi>Poles,</hi> that they were so affraid, that they ranne all away, leaving their tents: and it is reported, that at one shot shee killed fourescore men, the Divell (as I said before) was (by the permission of God) the inventor of such a Monster, being offended with mankinde in this last old age of the world, those thunder-claps putting us in minde that this whole round Globe shall be shaken and perish.</p>
               <p>We reade also in the thirty-fourth booke of <hi>Paul Iove</hi> his story, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a <hi>Turke</hi> reprehended of his cowardize, having runne away at the noise of a Cannon, being besieged by the Emperour within <hi>Goullet.</hi>

on the Castle of <hi>Edenburrough,</hi> being so wide, that it is reported, that a man did get a Child within, which I also warrant from my owne deede, but the truth is, it is a huge great peece, from whence did come our old <hi>Scots</hi> Proverbe, the Devill shoote <hi>Mounts</hi> in your arse.

               <p>These kinde of Peeces are very large, and carry stones for bullets.
