            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter written to D. SAMUEL TURNER,
concerning the Church, and the Revenues thereof.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Noble Doctor,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Expected when you had ſeen the Kings
laſt Meſſages, your reaſon would have
prompted you to have look'd this way,
which cauſed a delay in ſending unto
you, untill the difficulty of the paſſage
made me ſuſpect whether this may
come ſafe to you, and by the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and deſignes here, I feare I ſhall
not have another oportunity; take this therefore as a
<hi>farwell-truth,</hi> that the <hi>moderate party</hi> here, are at their <hi>Ne
plus ultra,</hi> the presbyterians &amp; Independants will agree,
and the <hi>Scots</hi> and we ſhall not fall out; and it muſt now
be the wiſdome of your ſelfe, and ſuch as have power
and intereſt with the King, to ſave him, your ſelves, and
Country from ruine: Your viſible ſtrength to hold out,
(much leſſe to prevaile) is too well known here, and
your hopes from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> will ſoon vaniſh,
which if ſucceſſefull by a victorious Army (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
you ſhall never ſee) would but make you and us
ſlaves to a forraign Nation, and extirpate that Religion,
both ſides pretend to maintaine.</p>
            <p>To be plaine, I know no way left you, but to accept
ſuch conditions of peace as may be had; you are too
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114107:3"/>
much a ſouldier, to thinke a retreate (upon ſo many diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages)
diſhonourable to a Generall, or acceptance of
hard conditions by a ſtarved beleagured Garriſon to the
Governour.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, of evils chooſe the leaſt; and I muſt tell you, it is
expected from you, (and the more wiſe and honeſt party
with you) that they ſhould make uſe of their reaſon, and
adviſe the King to ſave what is left, wherein it is believed
you may prevaile; conſidering what hath already paſſed
in ſo many free offers to give ſatisfaction in the <hi>Militia,
Ireland, paiment of the publique Debts, choice of Judges, Lord
Admirall, Officers of State, and others, with an Act of oblivion
and free Pardon, free exerciſe of Religion, to Presbyterians, and
Independants their own way, and a promiſe to endeavour in all
particulars, that none ſhall have cauſe to complaine for want of
ſecurity:</hi> things ſo farre beyond our former hopes, that
I cannot doubt, but the ſame reaſon which moved the
offer of theſe, will obtaine to conceſſion of ſuch others, as
the Parliament ſhall require in order to peace, which (as
neere as I can gueſſe) will be either the removall and
puniſhment of evill Counſellors, and Miniſters, who
have drawn the King into theſe troubles, or the buſines
of the Church, (all other materiall things to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
being already offered.)</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, I know not how you can with
reaſon gain-ſay the bringing offenders to Juſtice; and if
the Parliament Prerogative ſtreine juſtice in the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and puniſhment (beyond example of better times)
it were wiſdome for ſuch as may therein be concerned, to
withdraw, <hi>Dum furer in curſu,</hi> for if it muſt come to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Melius unus quam unitas:</hi> for the buſines of the Church
I wiſh it could be prevented, (there are who can witneſſe
the labour and hazards I have undergone for that end)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114107:3"/>
conceiving no government equall to a well ordered E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall,
for the well-being of this Church and State:
But when the neceſſity of times hath propoſed this ſad
queſtion for reſolution, whether conſent to alter Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
government in the Church, or let both Church and
State ruine together, my reaſon aſſents to the former. I
beleeve the doctrine of the place where you are, would
perſwade the contrary, and it hath been from thence
tranſmitted hither as an orthodox truth, that the altering
that government, being as they ſay <hi>jure divino,</hi> is ſinfull;
and the taking away the <hi>Church-lands, ſacriledge,</hi> at leaſt
unlawfull; which if I could believe, would change my
opinion, for I cannot give way for the committing a ſin
for a good end, (what ever the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuited Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
pretend in defence of it) but if I miſtake not, (and if
I doe, I pray reforme me) the opinion that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Biſhops is <hi>jure divino,</hi> hath but lately been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
in England, and that but by ſome few of the
more <hi>Lordly Clergy;</hi> for we alwayes acknowledge the
Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countryes,</hi> and elſewhere,
part of the reformed Proteſtant Catholique Church
though they had no <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and I am certaine the King
would never have given way for the extirpation of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had he conceived them to be <hi>jure divino;</hi>
nor to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Independants</hi> here to exerciſe
their Religion their own way, (as by his late Meſſages)
when ſuch a tolleration in the face of ſuch a divine Law,
muſt needs be ſinfull: and for the latter opinion againſt
taking away of Church Lands, I am leſſe ſatisfyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo farre from conceiving it ſacriledge, that I do not
conceive it unlawfull, but may be done without breach
of any Law, (which muſt be the rule for tryal of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
or unlawfulnes of every action) nay though there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114107:4"/>
be never ſo many curſes or imprecations added to the
donation: nor do I herein ground my opinion barely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the frequent practiſe of former times, not only by
Acts of Parliament, (in the times of Queen <hi>Eliz,</hi> and King
<hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> if you have not forgotten the
exchange of <hi>Durham houſe)</hi> aſwell as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth)
but even by the Biſhops themſelves, and Deanes and
Chapters, inſomuch, that if the wiſdome of the State (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Clergy men were permitted to marry) had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
their alienations, and reſtrained their Leaſes to
21. yeares, or 3. lives, their Revenues at this day would
not have been ſubject to envy.</p>
            <p>But to deale clearely with you Doctor, I do not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
how there can be any Sacriledge, properly ſo
called, which is not a theft and more: <hi>viz.</hi> a theft of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dedicated to holy uſe, (a Communion-Cup for
inſtance, or the like) &amp; theft you know muſt be of things
moveable, even by the Civil Law, and how theft can be
of Lands, or ſacriledge committed by aliening Church-Lands,
I pray aske your friend <hi>Holbourne</hi> and his fellow
Lawyers, for ours here deride us for the queſtion. As
for the main quere, touching the lawfulnes of aliening
Church-lands, (I uſe the expreſſion for the lands of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Deanes, and Chapters,) good Doctor give me
your patience to heare my reaſons. And firſt I lay this
as a foundation, that there is no divine command that
Miniſters under the Goſpell ſhould have any lands, (the
hire of a labourer at moſt, a fitting maintenance is all to
be challenged) nor do we read that the Apoſtles had any
Lands, (which I mention to avoid the groundleſſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the lands and portions allotted to the Tribe
of <hi>Levi</hi> by Gods appointment, to whom our Miniſters
have no ſucceſſion) and then it will follow, that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114107:4"/>
enjoy their lands by the ſame Law of the State as others
doe, and muſt be ſubject to that Law which alone gives
ſtrength to their title; which being granted, I am ſure it
will not be denyed, that by the Law of the Nation, he
that hath an eſtate in Lands in Fee-ſimple, by an imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
power, may lawfully alien, though there be an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in his Deed of purchaſe or donation to the contrary:
which being ſo, makes the alienation of Biſhops Lands
even without any Act of Parliament, to be lawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done by thoſe who have an eſtate in Fee ſimple, (as
the Biſhop, with the Deane and Chapter hath.)</p>
            <p>Then further, I am ſure it will be granted, that by the
Law of this Nation, whoſoever hath Lands or goods,
hath them with this inſeparable implyed condition or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Parliament may diſpoſe of them
or any part of them at pleaſure. Hence it is they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſpoſe ſome part in Subſidies and other Taxes; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Tenant for life, to ſell an eſtate in Fee-ſimple, and
not at all unlawfull, becauſe of that limitation or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before mentioned; and who ever will be owner muſt
take them according to this Law: Now hence comes
the miſtake, by reaſon there is not ſuch an expreſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or limitation in the Deed of Donation, (which
would ſilence all diſputes) whereas it is as cleare a truth,
that where any thing is neceſſarily by Law implied, it is
as much as if in plaine words expreſſed, of which your
Lawyers (if Reaſon need a helpe from them) can eaſily
reſolve.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it were ſomewhat ſtrange, that the Donor of
the Lawes ſhould preſerve them in the hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
from the power of the Parliament; which he
could not doe in his owne, and give them a greater and

ſurer right then he had himſelfe: Nor doe I underſtand
their meaning, who terme God the Proprieter of the
Biſhops Lands, and the Biſhop the Uſufructuary. For I
know not how (in propriety of ſpeech) God is more
entituled to their Lands then to his whole Creation;
and were Clergie-men but Uſufructuaries, how come
they to change, diſpoſe or alter the property of any
thing, (which an Uſufructuary cannot doe) and yet is
by them done daily? Aske them by what Divine Law
S. <hi>Maries</hi> Church in <hi>Oxford,</hi> may not be equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for temporall uſes, as for holding the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours
Court, the Univerſity Convocation, or their
yearly acts? And for the Curſes (thoſe bug-beare
words) I could yet never learne that an unlawfull curſe
was any prejudice but to the Author, of which ſort thoſe
curſes muſt needs be, which reſtraine the Parliament or
any other from exerciſing a lawfull and undenyable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
which in inſtances would ſhew very ridiculous, if
any curſe ſhould prejudice anothers lawfull right. I am
ſure ſuch curſes have no warrant from the Law of God
or this Nation. If this doth not ſatisfie the former doubts
in your Biſhops, (for I know you to be too great a Maſter
of Reaſon to be unſatisfied) aske them whether Church-lands
may not lawfully (the Law of the State not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting)
be transferred from one Church to another upon
emergent occaſions? which I think they will not deny.
If ſo, who knowes that the Parliament will transferre
them to Lay-hands? they profeſſe no ſuch thing, and I
hope they will not, but continue them for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Miniſtery, (which prevents all diſputes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the laſt queſtion) but if they ſhall hereafter do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
you know my opinion: Onely miſtake me not in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114107:5"/>
this free diſcourſe, as if I did countenance or commend
the Parliaments proceedings in their new Reformation,
but as a caution to you in the exigencies of times, what is
fitteſt to be done, when (I take it) Miſtreſſe Neceſſity in
all things indifferent, or not unlawfull, muſt be obeyed,
in which caſes the moſt conſtant men muſt be contented
to change their reſolutions with the alteration of time.
Your party have been reſolute enough to preſerve the
rights of the Church, and further peradventure then
wiſe men would have done, but at an <hi>ultra poſſe</hi> you and
we muſt give over, eſpecially for an imaginary right.
And think ſeriouſly with your ſelfe, whether after all
other things granted, it will be fit to run the hazard of
the very being of this Church and State, the King and
his poſterity, and Monarchy it ſelfe, onely upon the point
of Church-government by Biſhops, or aliening the
Church-lands, or rather whether the Kings Councell
(in duty) ought not to adviſe him the contrary, who
ſhould be wiſe as well as pious, yet herein may be both,
(for I doe not thinke Conveniencie or Neceſſity will
excuſe Conſcience in a thing in it ſelfe unlawfull, what
ever States-men maintain to the contrary) your intereſt
with the King is not ſmall, and your power with the
Lords (who are guided by reaſon) very conſiderable,
you cannot doe better then make uſe of both at this time.
If they have a deſire to preſerve the Church, it were wel
their thoughts were fixed upon ſome courſe for ſetling a
Superintendencie in the Presbyteriall Government,
(which no way croſſeth the Nationall Covenant) and
preſerve the Revenues in the Church, which I beleeve
at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> Treaty would have been granted, what ever

            <p>YOu have put an odde taske upon me, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my judgement on a Letter lately ſent to a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> with a commiſſion to ſhew it to the Lord
of <hi>Dorſet, and to as many more as own reaſon and honeſty;</hi> for
this is the Poſtſcript, and many the like paſſages in the
Letter, (as that the more <hi>wiſe and honeſt party would make
uſe of their reaſon,</hi> and <hi>I know you too great a maſter of reaſon,
to be unſatisfyed)</hi> makes me feare, that if I ſhould perhaps
diſſent in opinion from this <hi>Epiſtler,</hi> I might be thought,
(at leaſt in his conceite) to incurre a ſharpe cenſure both
in point of <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>honeſty:</hi> Which I confeſſe at firſt
ſomewhat troubled me, untill I remembred you were
wont to ſay, that when <hi>veſſels do once make ſuch noiſes as
theſe, tis a very ſhrewd ſigne they are empty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who wrote the Letter ſeemes moſt deſirous of
<hi>Peace,</hi> and truly Sir ſo am I; beſides we agree in this, that
<hi>we muſt not commit ſinne for a good end;</hi> ſo that if <hi>Peace</hi> it
ſelfe cannot be attained without that guilt, we muſt be
content with a worſe eſtate. But you very well know,
with how many ſeverall deceipts our affections can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
our reaſon; you remember who it was that ſaid it
unto the very face of a Prophet, <hi>I have kept the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the Lord,</hi> and yet his ſin remained ſtill a great
ſinne, and much the worſe becauſe he excuſed it: For
his guilt is leſſe that commits a crime, then his that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to defend it; becauſe this cuts off all repentance,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114107:7"/>
nay, it makes a ſin to grow up into that more wicked
heighth of a ſcandall, and ſo tis not only a ſnare to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
himſelfe, but it warrants many more to be ſinfull.</p>
            <p>Whether this <hi>Oxford Londoner,</hi> for ſo I take the <hi>Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
to be, hath not defended or made apologies for ſinne,
and hath not in that ſenſe, <hi>done evil that good may come
thereof,</hi> I am now to make an enquiry, and I ſhall follow
him in his two generals. 1. <hi>The delivering up the Kings
friends,</hi> whom they above call <hi>evil counſellors.</hi> And 2.
<hi>The buſineſſe of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>For the Kings friends.</hi> He ſayes,<hi>—I know not how
you can with reaſon gainſay the bringing offenders to juſtice:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nor I neither, but what if they be not offenders?
What if they muſt be brought to injuſtice? I know no
man that will refuſe to be judged by a Parliament, whoſe
undoubted Head is the King, and the King ſitting there,
with an unqueſtioned Negative, nay for his Majeſty to
referre Delinquents to be judged by the Houſe of Peers,
ſitting in a free Parliament, and judging according to the
known Lawes of the Realme, is that at leaſt which in my
opinion would not be ſtucke at. But the Parliament pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
which this Letter ſpeakes of, being now ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
as we have cauſe to thinke it is, I doubt in this
caſe, whether not only in point of honour, but in point
of juſtice and conſcience, the King for his own Peace,
can leave his friends to ſuch men, whom he is clearely
bound by ſo many grand ties to protect. But this Sir I
ſhall commit to you to determine, and if you returne me
a negative, I ſhall not preſume to queſtion your <hi>reaſon</hi> or
<hi>honeſty;</hi> nor ſhall I perſwade the Kings friends that they
would baniſh themſelves, unleſſe it were only to do that
great favour to the two Houſes now at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as to
keep them from ſome future foule acts of oppreſſion and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114107:7"/>
bloud, becauſe they ſhall have none left to act upon.</p>
            <p>2. For the buſines of the Church, which he againe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
into two parts, firſt that of Epiſcopacy, &amp; ſecondly
of Sacriledge. And in theſe Sir I ſhall ſpeake with leſſe
heſitation, I ſhall clearely tell you the Epiſtler is cleane
out; and though you very well know me a great honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of your profeſſion, yet I cannot hold it fit to decide
caſes of conſcience, or in humane actions to tell us what
is ſinne or no ſinne: and I am confident, Sir, you will not
take this ill at my hands.</p>
            <p>Firſt for Epiſcopacy, his words are, if I miſtake not,
(and if I do, I pray reforme me) <hi>The opinion that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by Biſhops is</hi> jure divino, <hi>hath but lately been counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
in England, and that by ſome few of the more Lordly
Cleargy.</hi> Theſe laſt words make me ſuſpect ſome paſſion
in the Writer, as being in ſcorne heretofore taken up by
men, who for a long time were Schiſmatiques, in their
hearts, and are now Rebels in their actions: And ſince
the Lawes of this Land makes ſome Church men Lords,
I do the more marvaile that the Epiſtler lookes awry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it: ſo that though his profeſſion be, that he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
labours and hazards for the Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet truly Sir I muſt thinke, that tis then only fit for
the Church to give him thankes, when ſhe has done all
her other buſines.</p>
            <p>But grant that Tenet to be but of late countenanced,
it thence followes not, that tis any whit the leſſe true. For
in reſpect of the many hundred yeares of abuſe, the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
it ſelfe was but of late countenanced here, yet I
take it for an unqueſtionable truth that the Laity ought
to have the cuppe. And though I was not deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this Epiſtlers errour, yet in charity I ſhall tell
him, that he is out, when he affirmes that this opinion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114107:8"/>
was but of late countenanced in this Church, as I could
ſhew him out of Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi>
and others: and ſince perhaps he may thinke theſe to be
but men of the more Lordly Clergy, I ſhall name one
more who may ſtand for many, and who wrote forty
yeares ſince, that moſt excellent man M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> (a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of moſt incomparable learning, and of as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
who I dare be bold to ſay, did not once dreame of
a Rotchet) he averres in cleare tearmes, <hi>There are at this
day in the Church of England, no other then the ſame degrees of
Eccleſiaſticall order, namely Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons,
which had their beginning from Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles
themſelves,</hi> or as he expounds himſelfe, <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
ordained by Chriſt himſelfe in the Apoſtles and
the ſeventy, and then Deacons by his Apoſtles; I may
adde <hi>Bucer</hi> too, no man I am ſure of the Lordly Clergy,
who though he were not Engliſh born, yet he was profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
here in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and he wrote and dyed
in this Kingdome, <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſaith he, are <hi>Ex perpetua eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum
ordinatione ab ipſis jam Apoſtolis,</hi> and more, <hi>Uſum hoc
eſt ſpiritui ſancto:</hi> and ſure if <hi>Biſhops</hi> be from the Apoſtles
and from the holy Spirit himſelfe, they are of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
Nay what thinke you if this Tenet be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a plaine act of Parliament? I hope then it wants
no countenance which England can give it, and it needs
not fly for ſhelter under the wings of the Lordly Cleargy;
you have theſe words in the booke of Conſecration of
Archbiſhops and Bishops, which is confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>It is evident to all men reading holy Scriptures, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authors, that from the Apoſtles times there have been
theſe orders of Miniſters in Chriſts Church, Biſhops, Presbyters
and Deacons.</hi> And againe, the prayer in the forme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
of <hi>Biſhops, Almighty God giver of all good things,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114107:8"/>
which by thy holy Spirit haſt appointed divers orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in thy Church, mercifully behold this thy ſervant now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the worke and miniſtery of a Biſhop;</hi> and in queſtions to
the perſon to be conſecrated a Biſhop, <hi>Are you perſwaded
that you be truly called to this Miniſtration, according to the will
of our Lord Jeſus? &amp;c.</hi> I beſeech you Sir conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe words, or this prayer could fall from any man,
not poſſeſſed with this Tenet, that Epiſcopacy was of
divine right: For if the three orders may be found by
reading the holy Scriptures together with ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
if men are taught to pray, that God by his Spirit
has appointed divers orders in his Church, and this made
the ground of praying for the preſent Biſhop, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be conſecrated muſt profeſſe that he conceives he
is called according to the will of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
either all this muſt be nothing elſe but pure pagentry, and
then the Parliament mocked God by their <hi>Confirmation,</hi>
or elſe Epiſcopacy is grounded in Scripture, is appointed
by the Spirit of God, is according to the will of our Lord
Jeſus, and all this hath not been ſaid of late, nor counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
only by ſome few of the more Lordly Cleargy.
And we have the leſſe reaſon to doubt that this Tenet
was countenanced in this Church of ours, becauſe we
find it in thoſe parts that have loſt Epiſcopacy, for we are
told by Doctor <hi>Carlton,</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and
that wrote againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> more then twenty five
yeares ſince, that ſitting at <hi>Dort,</hi> he then proteſted in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Synod, <hi>That Chriſt inſtituted no parity, but made twelve
Apoſtles, the chiefe, and under them ſeventy Diſciples: That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
ſucceeded to the twelve, and to the ſeventy, Presbyters of an
inferiour ranke; he affirmed this order had been ſtill maintained
in the Church, and then challenged the judgement of any learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
man, that could ſpeake to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114107:9"/>
Their anſwer was ſilence, which was approbation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but after, (ſaith he) diſcourſing with diverſe of
the beſt learned in the Synod, he told them how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Biſhops were, to ſuppreſſe their then riſen Schiſmes;
their anſwer was, <hi>That they did much honour and reverence
the good order and Diſcipline of the Church of England, and
with all their hearts would be glad to have it eſtabliſhed among
them; but that could not be hoped for in their State: Their hope
was, that ſeeing they could not do what they deſired, God would
be mercifull unto them, if they did but what they could.</hi> If they
hoped for mercy that might pardon what they did, ſure
they muſt ſuppoſe that what they then did, was ſinfull:
Nay, they thought their neceſſity it ſelfe could not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excuſe their ſinne; for then in that particular there had
been no need to hope for Gods mercy: nor could they
well thinke otherwiſe; ſince being preſſed, they denyed
not but that Epiſcopacy was of Chriſts own inſtitution,
and yet they were no Lordly Clergy, nor do I well ſee
how either by charitable or civil men, they can at all be
taxed either for want of reaſon or honeſty.</p>
            <p>1. Indeed ſome ſeem to ſtartle at this Tenet, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy
is of Divine right: as if, becauſe Divine, it might
therefore ſeem to endanger Monarchal power. But under
favour I conceive this fear to be among us very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
for ſince the Tenents of our Church are in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
the very ſelf ſame with the ancient times: as that the
Biſhops have no power, but what is meerely directive on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that all power co-active either in them or in others, is
derived meerly from the Royal authority; that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
legally make uſe, no not ſo much as of this directive
power, but only by the Kings leave: So that if the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Lawes ſhould forbid them to preach that, which
in point of ſalvation is neceſſary to be ſpoken, yet they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114107:9"/>
cannot preach but upon the forfeiture of their Heads, and
thoſe being demanded by the Kings Lawes, they muſt
ſubmit to a Martyrdome, (though twere ſinne in them
that demand it) ſo that in the execution of all eccleſiaſtical
power, the ſupremacy is in the King alone; theſe I ſay
being ſo much the Tenets of our Church, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there is no learned man amongſt us, who would
not readily ſubſcribe to them, I cannot ſee at all where in
the opinion we defend, any danger lies to this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
            <p>But examine the Presbyterian principles, and you
will clearely find, Kings and they cannot ſtand together,
for either you conſider that new government in the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
ſence, which allowes no appeale to any other power,
and then tis plaine, that where men admit this, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a ſupremacy, which doth not reſide in the King;
and by conſequent, of two ſeverall ſupremacies within
the bounds of the ſelfe ſame Kingdome, which can no
more ſtand with Monarchy, then it can with Monogamy
to be maried to two ſeverall wives. And though tis ſaid
that this Presbyterian government meddles only with
ſpirituall things, which concerne the good of the ſoule,
and ſo it cannot hurt Regall power, yet this is but onely
ſaid, and no more: for it is well known, that <hi>in ordine ad
ſpiritualia,</hi> (and all things may by an ordinary wit be
drawn into this ranke, as they have been by the Church
of <hi>Rome)</hi> this government intrudes upon what things it
pleaſeth; and indeed where a ſupremacy is once acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
no wiſe man can thinke, that it will carry it ſelfe
otherwiſe. So that King <hi>James</hi> his maxime was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
moſt true, upon this ſame ground we are on, <hi>No Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
no King:</hi> For that moſt prudent Prince did ſoone
diſcerne, that if a power were once ſet up, which at leaſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114107:10"/>
in the legall execution of it, did not derive it ſelfe from
the King, there was no doubt to be made, but it would
ere long deſtroy the very King himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Or conſider Presbyterian government in the Engliſh
ſenſe, as it is now ſet up by the Two Houſes at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
which is a government limited by an appeale to the
Parliament, for either by Parliament here they meane
the Two Houſes excluding the King, and then tis as plain
as before, they ſet up two ſupremacies, his Majeſties and
their owne: or elſe by Parliament they meane the King
with both Houſes, and then it will follow, that either
there muſt be a perpetuall Parliament, (which ſure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King nor Kingdome can have cauſe to like) or elſe
the ſupremacy will be for the moſt part in the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
becauſe when ever a Parliament ſits not, there will be
no Judge to appeale to; or if it be ſaid the Parliament
may leave a ſtanding Committee to receive appeales
in ſuch eccleſiaſticall cauſes; then either in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
the King hath no negative; and in that caſe tis clear
that the eccleſiaſticall ſupremacy will be not at all in the
King; or elſe the King hath a negative, but yet is joyned
with perſons whom he himſelf chooſes not, and ſo moſt
probably will be check'd and affronted in any ſentence
he intends to give; and this clearely overthrowes that
which is already declared by Parliament,<note place="margin">25. H. 8. c. 19.</note> to be a right
in the King, as inherent in his Crowne, that eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
appeales may be made to him alone in Chancery,
(for the Statute names no other) and that his Majeſty
alone may appoint what Commiſſioners he pleaſe for
their finall deciſion: I ſay, conſider the Presbyterian
government in the Engliſh Parliament ſenſe, and in the
ſenſe of the Engliſh Aſſembly, for the Presbyterians
there are wholly for the Scotiſh forme, as appeares by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114107:10"/>
their quarrels at what the Houſes have already done in
their Ordinances; ſo that their aime is not only to ſet up
a new Government, but in plain tearmes, a new ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy:
And hence, to ſay truth, he muſt ſee very little who
diſcernes not, that though the Presbyterian party ſeemes
to ſtrike at the Biſhops, yet their maine aime is at the
King; whoſe ſupremacy they endure not, as being a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which they intend for their owne Garland; and ſo,
though they hypocritically cry out (that they may abuſe
the People) againſt the pride of the Lordly Biſhops, yet
in the meane time, the wiſer ſort muſt needs ſee, that
they intend to make themſelves no leſſe then indeed
Kingly Presbyters.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge the Proteſtants of Germany, the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,

her ſelfe was become no true part of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique;
and yet ſhe breakes a flat Precept of Chriſt,
<hi>[drinke yee all of this]</hi> and ſhall we be thought to deny the

            <p>We affirme then Epiſcopacy to be of divine right, that
is, of divine inſtitution, and that muſt needs tacitly imply
a divine Precept too; for to what end are things inſtituted
by God, but that it is preſumed, it is our part to uſe
them? And to what end ſhould ſome men be appointed
to teach, and to govern, but that its clearely implyed,
then there are other men too, that ought both to heare
and obey? He that inſtitutes or erects a Bridge over a
broad ſwelling ſtream, needs not (you will think) adde an
expreſſe command, that men ſhould not walke in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Thus when our Lord and Saviour made his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that great Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> he gave
command indeed concerning the Bread, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114107:11"/>
of me;</hi> and concerning the Cup, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi>
But he gave no expreſſe command to do both theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and yet his inſtitution hath been ſtill held to have
the nature of a command; and ſo for a thouſand yeares
the whole Church of Chriſt did ever practiſe it, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in ſome few caſes, in which men ſuppoſed a kind of
neceſſity: I ſay then Epiſcopacy is of divine right, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Chriſt in his Apoſtles, who ſince they took upon
them to ordaine and to govern Churches, you need not
doubt they received an authority from their Maſter to do
both; for ſince men will not thinke they would breake
their own rules: <hi>No man taketh this upon him, but he that is
called of God, as Aaron was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Epiſcopacy then was inſtituted in the Apoſtles, who
wer Biſhops <hi>et aliud amplius;</hi> and diſtinguiſhed by Chriſt
himſelf from the Seventy, who were the Presbyters. So
the moſt ancient Fathers generally, or if you will take S.
<hi>Hierom.</hi> opinion, (who was neither a Biſhop, nor in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
mood any great friend to that Order) they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Apoſtles, who being themſelves <hi>Epiſcopi et
amplius,</hi> did in their latter dayes formalize and bound out
that power which ſtill we do cal Epiſcopacy. And ſo their
received opinions may ſtand together for <hi>Epiſcopatus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in Apoſtolatu tanquam conſulatus in dictatura,</hi> as the leſſer
and ſubordinate power, is alwayes in the greater: we
may truly ſay it was inſtituted by Chriſt in his Apoſtles
who had Epiſcopall Power and more, and then twas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malized
and bounded by the Apoſtles themſelves, in the
perſons of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> &amp;c. So that call the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
order either of Divine right, or Apoſtolicall Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and I ſhall not at all quarrell at it: For Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
will ſeeme Divine enough, unto Chriſtians; I am ſure
<hi>Salmatius</hi> thinks ſo, (a ſharpe enemy to the Epiſcopall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114107:12"/>
Order) if (ſaith he) it be from the Apoſtles, tis of Divine
right; thus we find the power of ordination and of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to be given to thoſe men alone; For then that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is properly Epiſcopall, when one man alone may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
it, ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi>
1 Tim. 5. 22. Lay hands in the ſingular number, <hi>thou, &amp;
thou alone,</hi> without naming any other: <hi>Againſt an Elder,
receive not an accuſation,</hi> in the ſingular number too; <hi>thou,
receive not, thou</hi> alone, <hi>but under two or three witneſſes;</hi> and
then the Text is plaine, <hi>He</hi> and <hi>he alone</hi> might do it. So to
<hi>Titus</hi> for this cauſe, and that <hi>thou,</hi> and <hi>thou alone, ſhouldeſt
ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Elders
in every City,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. where plainly thoſe two powers
of government and ordination are given unto one man;
So S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Churches of <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 2. 3. when he
preſumes all the governing power to reſide in the Angels
of thoſe Churches, and only in them alone, as all Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
underſtand it. And hence tis plaine, that though we
ſhould yeeld that the Apoſtles only did inſtitute Biſhops,
yet in this <hi>Revel.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe immediately in his own
perſon, and the holy Spirit withall, did both approve and
confirme them: And the Learned obſerve, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of thoſe Sees, are therefore called Angels by S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> who was born a Jew, becauſe in <hi>Paleſtina</hi> their chief
Prieſts were then called their Angels; and ſo this appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was taken up by the Apoſtle in that place, becauſe
the Biſhops were thoſe Churches Chiefes: this truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
not only from thoſe cleare Texts, but from the
mutuall conſent and pactiſe for more then 1500. yeares
ſpace of all the Chriſtian Church; So that neither S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
nor any other Ancient, did ever hold orders to be
lawfully given, which were not given by a Biſhop, nor
any Church jurisdiction to be lawfully adminiſtred,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114107:12"/>
which was not either done by their hands, or at leaſt by
their deputation.</p>
            <p>I know there are men lately riſen up, eſpecially in this
laſt Century, which have collected and ſpread abroad far
other Concluſions, and that from the authority of the
Text it ſelfe: But as tis a Maxime in Humane Lawes,
<hi>Conſuetudo optima Legum Interpres,</hi> Cuſtome and Practice
is the beſt Interpreter: So no rationall man but will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yeeld, it as well holds in Lawes Divine: For I would
gladly aske, What better way can there be for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
of Texts, then that very ſame meanes whereby
I know the Text it ſelfe to be Text? Sure the ſame
courſe whereby I know the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
to have been written by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> muſt needs be the beſt
courſe to underſtand the ſenſe of thoſe Epiſtles; and if
I therefore beleeve them to be written by that Apoſtle,
becauſe the Univerſality of the whole Chriſtian Church
has brought me to that beliefe, (and there's no other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
way of beleeving it) why doe I not beleeve the
ſame Chriſtian ſenſe, which the univerſal conſent aſſures
me they were written in? Shall I beleeve, and yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeve
that ſelfe-ſame conſent which is the beſt ground
of my beliefe? This is as it were in cleare terms to ſay,
that I beleeve ſuch a tale for the Authors ſake who hath
told it, and yet I doe now hold the ſelfe-ſame man to be
a lyar. Men doe beleeve the teſtimony of univerſall
conſent, in the ſenſe it gives of ſingle termes, and why
not in the ſenſe it gives of ſentences or Propoſitions?
without the help of this Conſent, (which is indeed the
ground of our Dictionaries) how ſhall we know that
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies the Reſurrection of the body, which the
Socinians at this day deny? And I know no ſuch way to
confute your error, as by the authority of your conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114107:13"/>
Admit then of that Rule, that conſent univerſall is the
beſt interpretation of Texts; and then I am ſure, it is as
cleare as true, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolicall
Right;</hi> yea and that propoſition, <hi>There can be no Ordination,
without the hands of a Biſhop,</hi> will clearely appeare to be as
well grounded as this; <hi>There can be no Baptiſme without a
lawfull Miniſter,</hi> which is good Divinity amongſt our new
Maſters in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and Antiquity allowed of it, <hi>Extra
caſum neceſsitatis:</hi> For I aske upon what Text doe they
ground this Rule? I ſuppoſe they will ſay upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
words, to the Eleven, <hi>Matth. 28. Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and baptize them:</hi> But in the inſtitution of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi>
He ſpake thoſe words too; but only to the Twelve,
<hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> Matth. 26. I demand then how ſhall I
know that when our Saviour ſpake thoſe words unto the
Eleven, he ſpake them only as to lawfull Miniſters; but
when he ſpake the other, to the Twelve he ſpake at large
as unto them that did repreſent all Chriſtian men? So
that though only Miniſters may Baptize, yet all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
may receive the Cup: Perhaps they will ſay, that
the generall practiſe of receiving the Cup, is manifeſt
from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and I thinke ſo too, where <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſeems
to chide the whole Church for their irreverence at that
great <hi>Sacrament:</hi> But if a quarreler ſhould reply, that he
there ſpeaks but of the Presbyters alone, whereof many
were at that time at <hi>Corinth:</hi> As when in the 5. Chap. he
ſeemes to chide the whole Church for not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the inceſtuous Perſon: yet tis plain, he meanes
none but the men in government (as ſure all Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will allow me) I know not what could be ſaid but to
make it appeare out of the Fathers, and others, that the
whole Chriſtian Church never tooke the words in that
ſenſe. And if to ſtop the mouthes of wranglers, we muſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114107:13"/>
at length be conſtrained to quote the Authority of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
conſent, and the Common practiſe of Chriſts
Church, then you will eaſily ſee that thoſe two named
Propoſitions do ſtand faſt on the ſame bottome, <hi>There can
be no Baptiſme without a lawfull Miniſter, extra caſum neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
for ſo the conſent and practiſe of the Univerſall
Church hath ſtill interpreted that Text: And againe tis
true, <hi>There can be no Ordination without the Hands of a Biſhop,</hi>
for ſo thoſe Texts both out of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> have
been underſtood, and practiſed for 1500. yeares together
by the conſent of the whole Church of Chriſt. Tis true
that this precept, <hi>Go ye teach, &amp;c.</hi> runnes not in excluſive
words, yee Apoſtles, or yee lawfull Miniſters, and none
but yee; yet <hi>extra caſum neceſsitatis,</hi> no man was allowed
to baptiſe but a lawfull Miniſter: ſo though theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>[Lay hands ſuddenly on no man]</hi> and <hi>[Do thou ordaine
Elders in every City]</hi> runne not <hi>in verbis excluſivis, thou</hi> and
<hi>none but thou,</hi> or <hi>men of thine Order only:</hi> yet the Church
underſtanding and practiſing them in an exclvſive ſenſe,
no man for 1500 yeares in any ſetled Church, was held
rightly ordained, without the hands of a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Nay that there is ſomething Divine in the <hi>Epiſcopall
Order,</hi> will appeare clearely by this, that immediately
from the times of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, (yea within the
reach of thoſe times) twas univerſally ſpread throughout
the whole face of the Churches: ſo that no man can
name a Nationthat was once wonne unto the Chriſtian
Faith, but he ſhall ſoon find that there were Biſhops:
ſo that there muſt needs be an Uunverſall Cauſe, for an
Effect that was ſo Univerſall. Generall Councell there
was none about it, at which all Chriſtians might have
met, and might have thence obeyed her directions.</p>
            <p>Nor can any name a Power to which all Chriſtians
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114107:14"/>
ſhould ſubmit (for they were ſoone fallen into Factions)
but only the authority of Chriſt or of his Apoſtles; from
them then muſt needs flow the <hi>Epiſcopal Order,</hi> and at that
<hi>Fountaine</hi> I ſhall leave it. I ſay within the reach of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
times, for before S. <hi>Iohn</hi> dyed, there are upon
good Church Records above 20. Biſhops appointed to
the ſeveral Sees; as at <hi>Hieruſalem, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and
<hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Creece,</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> &amp; divers
others, it being eaſie to draw a Catalogue of them out of
ſeveral Eccleſiaſticall Writers.</p>
            <p>And here it will be plain, that its a foule corruption;
nay, how flat a ſinne is brought into the Church of
Chriſt, where Epiſcopacy is thrown down! and ſo where
Ordination is performed by any hands without theirs, tis
as groſſe, as if Lay-men ſhould be allowed to baptize,
when a Presbyter doth ſtand by: nay more, it is as bad
as if the Order of Presbyters ſhould therefore be thrown
downe, that Lay-men might Baptize: and what's this,
but willingly to runne into a Neceſſity it ſelfe, that wee
might thence create an Apology? Tis a corruption farre
worſe, then if a Church ſhould audaciouſly attempt to
pull down the Lords Day; ſince the obſervation of
that Time is neither built on ſo cleare a Text, nor on
the helpe of ſo Univerſall a Conſent, as is the Order of
Epiſcopacy: So that if men can thinke it ſinfull to part
with the Lords Day, though the inſtitution of it be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apocryphall, they muſt needs confeſſe there is at
leaſt ſo much ſinne, (nay indeed more) in parting with
their Biſhops, and then the <hi>Oxford</hi> Doctrine which the
<hi>Epiſtler</hi> gybes at, and talkes of, as tranſmitted for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox

Mat.</hi> 25. If Chriſt do not accept of theſe things, he may
ſay indeed, yee <hi>offered</hi> me meat, but he cannot ſay that
yee <hi>gave it:</hi> for a Preſent is then only to be called a Gift,
when it is accepted as his own that takes it. And do's he
thus accept of Meat and Clothing, and do's he not accept
of thoſe kind of endowments, that bring both theſe to
perpetuity? Will He take Meat and refuſe Revenues?
Doth He like (can you imagine) to be Fed and Clothed
to day, and in danger to be Starved to morrow? The
men thus provided for, He calles no leſſe then His Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
<hi>In as much as you have done it unto the leaſt of theſe my
Brethren, yee have done it unto me.</hi> Whether theſe were of
thoſe Brethren which he had enjoyned to teach others,
or of thoſe which he would have inſtructed, the Text
there doth not decide; without doubt it muſt be meant of
both; for it were a ſtrange thing to affirme that Chriſt
liked it extreame well to be Fed and to be Clothed, in all
thoſe He called His, but only in His Seventy, and His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but to put it out of doubt, that what is done to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114107:15"/>
them, is done to Him too, His owne words are very plain,
<hi>He that receiveth you,</hi> teaching Diſciples, <hi>receiveth me;</hi> in
the Tenth of that Goſpell, where He ſends all forth to
preach, and that reception implyes all ſuch kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
as is apparently plaine throughout the whole Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Chapter. And againe, I quote that ſo well

his ſin was, he kept back part of the price of thoſe Lands
he had given to God, for the publique uſe of the Church,
yea, given to God, and tis as plaine that he did accept it;
for S. <hi>Peter</hi> you know thus reprooves him, <hi>Why haſt thou
lyed, or why haſt thou deceived the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> for ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
do's properly import, why doeſt thou cheat him of what
is now his own proper right? And againe, <hi>Thou haſt not
lyed unto men, but unto God:</hi> and is this ſo ſtrange a thing?
Are not all our <hi>lyes</hi> to be accounted <hi>ſinnes</hi> before God?
yes, all againſt God, as a Witneſſe and a Judge; but yet
not all againſt God as a Party: and therefore tis a more
remarkeable, a more ſignall lye, <hi>Thou haſt not lyed unto
men;</hi> a negative of compariſon, not ſo much to men, as to
God: whats done to them is ſcarce worth the naming,
<hi>but thou haſt lyed unto God,</hi> as a Witneſſe and a Judge; yea
and a party too. Thou haſt lyed, &amp; rob'd God by lying,
and ſo runne thy ſelfe into an eminent ſinne: and that ſhall
appeare in Gods judgement, ſo the Fathers generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
that place; both of the Greek and Latine Church,
and affirme his crime was a robbing God of that wealth,
which by Vow or by promiſe was now become Gods
propriety: So the Modern Interpreters, yea, ſo <hi>Calvin,
Sacrum eſſe Deo profitebatur,</hi> He profeſſed that his Land
ſhould be a ſacred thing unto God, (ſayes he) on that
place; and there <hi>Beza</hi> too, <hi>Pradium Deo conſecraſſent;</hi> the
the man and his wife, they conſecrated this Land to God,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114107:15"/>
And he that will not believe ſo Univerſall a conſent in
the interpreting a place of Scripture, ſhould do well to
conſider, whether upon the ſame ground (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
he may not be brought to doubt of his Dictionary,
for that is but Univerſal conſent; he may almoſt as well
doubt whether <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The New Teſtament will afford more places for this
purpoſe; <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, committeſt thou Sacriledge?</hi>
Rom. 2. 22. Tis true, theſe words are ſpoken as to the
perſon of an unconverted Jew, and may be therefore
thought to aime only at thoſe ſinnes, which were deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but do but view S. <hi>Pauls</hi> way of
arguing, and you will quickly find they come home to us
Chriſtians too: he there tells the Jew that he taught o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thoſe things, which yet he would not do himſelfe:
and he ſtrives to make this good by three ſeverall inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
firſt, <hi>Thou that Preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteale, doeſt thou
ſteale?</hi> Secondly, <hi>Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit
adultery, doſt thou commit adultery?</hi> In both theſe, tis plain,
that the Jew he dealt with did the ſame things he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
and ſtraightway the third comes, <hi>Thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt
Idols, doſt thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> So that hence
'twill follow (if S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words have Logique in them)
that theſe two ſinnes are of the ſelfe ſame nature too:
And that to commit a ſacriledge is a breach of the ſame
Law, as to commit an Idolatry: ſo that crime will appeare
without all doubt a plain robbery of God; for he that
ſteales from men, yea though a whole community of
men, though <hi>bona univerſitatis,</hi> yet he ſinnes but againſt
his Neighbour, tis but an offence againſt the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Law, in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale:</hi> but
Sacriledge layes hold on thoſe things which the Latine
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114107:16"/>
Lawes call <hi>Bona nullius,</hi> it ſtrikes downright immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at God, and in that regard no Idolatry can out doe-it: as
this is, tis a breach of the firſt Table of the Law, and both
theſe crimes are equally built upon the ſelf-ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of God; the offenders in both kinds, the Idolater
and ſacrilegious perſon both thinke him a dull ſluggiſh
thing; the firſt thinkes he will patiently looke on, while
his honour is ſhared to an Idol; the other imagines he'l
be as ſottiſhly tame, though his goods be ſtoln to his
face.</p>
               <p>This was without doubt the ſenſe of all ancient church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
for upon what ground could they profeſſe they gave
gifts to God, but only upon this, that they preſumed God
did ſtil accept them? So S. <hi>Iraeneus, We offer unto our God our
Goods in token of thankefullneſſe.</hi> So <hi>Origen, By gifts to God
we acknowledge him Lord of all:</hi> So the Fathers generally;
ſo Emperours and Kings; ſo <hi>Charles the Great, To God we
offer what we deliver to the Church,</hi> in his well known <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulars:</hi>
And our own Kings have ſtill ſpoken in this good
old Chriſtian language; <hi>We have granted to God, for Us and
Our Heires for ever, that the Church of England ſhall be free,
and have her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable;</hi> they are
all the firſt words of our <hi>Magna Chart. Her whole Rights &amp;
Liberties,</hi> words of a very large extent, and imply farre
more then Her Subſtance: and yet theſe, and all theſe
Lands, and Honours, and Jurisdictions; all theſe have
beene given to God; yea, and frequently confirmed
by the publique Acts of the Kingdome: and yet if <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>

tells him, that becauſe his God may be robb'd, he may
therefore have a Propriety; And if Sacriledge be a ſin

to the Crowne, but if ſhe ſometimes tooke order that
Church, men ſhould not be Biſhops, untill they had firſt

that if Princes or Subjects reſolve to ſell the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
tis great odds but that in a Clergy conſiſting
of above 16000. Perſons, they ſhall not want Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

frame all the phraſes of their ſpeech according to the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſmes

If not, why may not ſome uſe the word <hi>furtum</hi> in
<hi>Sabinus</hi> his ſenſe, as well as others may in <hi>Ulpians?</hi> and
then ſacriledge may be properly called a theft, and as
properly in immoveables; or if we will needs ſpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ſenſe whom <hi>Juſtinian</hi> hath approved, I
do not well ſee how men can ſpoile the Church of her

he is without doubt a ſacrilegious perſon: but where

knew not well how to weild: But to ſay truth he deales
clearely with the Doctor, and tels him that for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
he doth not yet underſtand; which for my part I
believe; and do not only wonder, he would gibe at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>But theſe Arguments it ſeemes are but only the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne-hope,
the main Battell is yet to come. He calls
this the main quere, and deſires patience from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,

ſuch goods and poſſeſſions which have been given
him by good Chriſtians: and this title you now heare
will go as farre as a law, and that is we conceive farre
enough, for it gives God a propriety in ſuch lands, and
ſo keeps men from a re-aſſumption.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <hi>The hire of a Labourer at moſt, as fitting main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,

ſo that it ſignifyes little to ſay <hi>the Apoſtles had no
Lands;</hi> for they who had the money for lands fold, might
(no man can well doubt) have ſtill kept the lands had
they liked it: but the Church was ſtraight to be in hot

ſo they hold from him by the Law morall too; and
therefore though by the lawes of the land they hold

it without the guilt of ſinne, as being a breach of the law

better themſelves by ſome gainfull, or at leaſt by ſome

Sir is ſtrange Doctrine; for either the Parliament, (I hope

the beſt of all humane Governments, <hi>the King ſhould take

leaves every man his propriety, onely the Prophet there
averres it ſhould be not puniſhable in him, they ſhould
have no remedy, ſince being the ſupreame power, 'twas
in no Subjects hands to judge him: So if the King in
Parliament ſhould take away Church-lands, there is (I
confeſſe) no reſiſtance to be made, though the act were
inhumanely ſinfull. Or ſecondly, the Parliament does
this as repreſenting the whole people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo including

againe they were there, I would gladly know what
Burgeſſe, or what Knight of a ſhire, nay what Clerke,

to beginne to tell him of implyed conditions, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations:
For it were a ſtrange ſcorne put upon God, if
men ſhould make this grand promiſe to their Maker, and
then tell him after ſo many hundreds of yeares, that their
meaning was to take it back at their pleaſure: I believe
there is no good Pagan that would not bluſh at this dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and conclude, that if Chriſtians may thus uſe their
God, without doubt he is no God at all.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <hi>[Hence is it they ſometimes diſpoſe ſome part in
Subſidies, and other Taxes.]</hi> The Parliament diſpoſeth part
of mens eſtates in Subſidies, and Taxes, and with their
conſents, <hi>ergo,</hi> It may diſpoſe of all the Church Lands,
though Church-men themſelves ſhould in down right
termes contradict it: Truly Sir, this Argument is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worth an anſwere nor a ſmile: For I am ſure you
have often told me that the Parliament in juſtice can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
no private mans eſtate: Or if upon neceſſity it may
need this or that Subjects Land for ſome publique uſe,
yet that Court is in juſtice bound to make that private
man an amends. Subſidies you ſaid were ſuppoſed to be
laid on <hi>Salvo contenemento,</hi> ſo that a Duke might ſtill live
like a Duke, and a Gentleman like a Gentleman: Is it not
ſo with the Clergy too? By their own conſent indeed,
and not otherwiſe; they are often impoſed, and they are
paid by them; but yet they are burthens which they may
beare <hi>Salvo contenemento:</hi> and they are paid not out of
Gods propriety, by alienating of his Lands, but out of
that <hi>uſus fructus</hi> they receive from God: and ſo the
maine doth ſtill go on to their ſucceſſors. So that to
inferre from any of theſe uſages, that the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and Deanes, and Chapters, may be wholly alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from the Church, is an inference that will prevaile
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114107:22"/>
with none but thoſe, who being led by ſtrong paſſions
that it ſhould be ſo, make very little uſe of their reaſon
to oppoſe that paſſion.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, <hi>[Now hence comes the miſtake, by reaſon there
is not ſuch an expreſſe condition or limitation in the Deeds of
Donation, (which would ſilence all diſpute) whereas it is as
cleare a truth, that where any thing is neceſſarily by Law imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
It is as much as in plain termes expreſſed.]</hi> No marvell if
ſuch conditions be not expreſſed in Benefactors Deeds
of Donation, becauſe it would make pious deeds moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
ridiculous: For who would not bluſh to tell God,
that indeed he gives him ſuch Lands, but with a very clear
intent to revoke them; And what Chriſtian will ſay that
ſuch an intent is tacitely there, which it were impiety to
expreſſe? Nay tis apparantly cleare, in the curſes added
by ſuch Donors, upon thoſe who ſhall attempt to make
void their gifts, that their meaning was plaine, ſuch lands
ſhould remaine Gods for ever: By <hi>Magna Charta</hi> theſe
gifts are confirmed unto the Church for ever, <hi>(She ſhall
have her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable)</hi> and yet is
there a tacite condition in the ſelfe-ſame Law that they
may be violated.</p>
               <p>No marvell if with us men cannot truſt men, if God
himſelfe cannot truſt our lawes. And if that Charter, or
any elſe made by ſucceeding Princes, do indeed confirme
ſuch Donations (as without all doubt they do) ſure they
muſt confirme ſuch Donations in that ſame ſence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Donors made them; for ſo do all other confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
nay in this caſe of a totall diſ-inhaeriſon, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in law any ſuch tacite conditions or limitations as
the <hi>Epiſtler</hi> ſpeakes of: For I have ſhewed ſuch to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and tyrannicall in a private Subjects eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Gods they are much more unjuſt; becauſe they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114107:22"/>
are ſure he cannot offend; and an unjuſt and tyrannicall
meaning muſt not be called the meaning of the Law.</p>
               <p>The Letter goes on. <hi>[Beſides, it were ſomewhat ſtrange,
that the Donors of the Lands ſhould preſerve them in the hands
of the Biſhops from the power of Parliament, which he could
not doe in his owne, and give them a greater and ſurer right
then he had himſelfe.]</hi> The Lay-Donee might preſerve
them thus in his owne hands, ſuppoſe him but an honeſt
perſon: for though a Parliament may <hi>Impunè</hi> diſinherit
ſuch an innocent man, yet they cannot doe it <hi>Juſtè;</hi> and
ſo in this regard both the Donor and the Donee are in
the ſame condition. Beſides, tis no ſuch ſtrange thing,
for the ſelf-ſame right (as a right ſuppoſe of Fee-ſimple)
to become more ſure in his hands that takes, then it ever
was in his hands that gave it. For though the right it ſelf
be ſtill the ſame right, (for <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet)</hi> yet
by gift it may now come into a more ſtrong hand, and by
this meanes that ſelfe-ſame right may become the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
And ſure with us Gods hand ſhould be more ſtrong
then mans: Nay hence, as ſome think, Lands given to
the Church, were ſaid to come <hi>in manum mortuam,</hi> as it
were into a dead hand, which parts with nothing it hath
once cloſed upon. And why the Epiſtler ſhould call this
a ſtrange thing, I doe not yet ſee the reaſon, becauſe tis
alwayes ſo, when any one Benefactor doth by vertue of
a Mortmaine convey his Lands to any kind of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>[Nor doe I underſt and their meaning, who terme
God the Proprietor of the Biſhops Lands, and the Biſhop the
Uſufructuary.]</hi> I conceive I have made this plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch Lands were firſt offered to God, and became
his owne Property by his owne divine acceptation: And
if the <hi>Dominium directum</hi> of theſe things doe once reſt in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114107:23"/>
God, the <hi>Dominium utile,</hi> the <hi>uſus fructus</hi> alone is the
onely thing left to be the patrimony of his Clergie. But
he addes a reaſon, <hi>[For I know not how (in propriety of
ſpeech) God is more entitled to their Lands, then to his whole
Creation.]</hi> Here the Epiſtler ſpeaks out: For truly, Sir,
I feare the Lawyer your friend is little better then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent.
How? hath God no more Title in proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſpeech to one piece of ground then another? No
more to a place where a Church is built, then where
men have now placed a Stable? Our Engliſh Homilies,
which are confirmed by Law, cry downe this croſſe
piece of Anabaptiſme. Tis true, God made all things,
and ſo the whole world is moſt juſtly his by that great
right of Creation: But yet the Pſalmiſts words are as
true, <hi>The earth hath he given to the children of men.</hi> So as
that great God is now wel content to receive back what
men will give him: And this acceptance of his muſt
needs in all reaſon make thoſe things his more peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Thus Chriſt calls the Temple his <hi>Fathers houſe:</hi>
'Twas God's, and God's more peculiarly, not onely by
right of Creation, but by gift. Thus Lands given unto
God are his, and his more peculiarly; His, becauſe he
made them, and his againe, becauſe having once given
them to the children of men, upon their gift he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them: So that his Prieſts, and his Poore being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
by them, he calls it in a more peculiar manner,
<hi>His</hi> meat, <hi>His</hi> drinke, and <hi>His</hi> cloathing: And then if in
point of acceptance with God, there be great difference
between feeding his Prieſts, and feeding them that doe
him no ſuch ſervice, there muſt needs be as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Lands ſet out unto that ſacred uſe, and
Lands of a more common employment.</p>
               <p>He gives a ſecond reaſon, <hi>[Were Clergie-men but Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuaries,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114107:23"/>
how come they to change, diſpoſe, or alter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of any thing, (which an Uſufructuary cannot doe) and
yet is done by you daily?]</hi> How come they to change or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
any thing? Yes, they may change, or diſpoſe, or
alter many kinds of things, for ſo without doubt any
Uſufructuary may doe, ſo he wrong not his Lord by an
abuſe done to his Propriety. Thus he may change his
Corne into Clothing, or, if he pleaſe, his Wool into
Books: Nay he may alter the property of his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
too, if he have expreſſe leave of his Lord: And God
himſelf did tell <hi>Levi,</hi> That he was well content that men
ſhould alter ſome things that belonged to him, ſo it were
for the Tribes advantage, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 13:</p>
               <p>The Letter goes on. <hi>[Aske them by what Divine Law S.</hi>
Maries <hi>Church in</hi> Oxford <hi>may not be equally imployed for
Temporall uſes, as for holding the Vice chancellors Court, the
Univerſity Convocation, or their yeerly acts?]</hi> He might as
well have asked, Why not as well for temporall uſes, as
for temporall uſes? For if thoſe he names be not ſo, his
argument is naught; and if they be ſo, tis not well put
downe. His meaning ſure was for other temporall uſes,
as well as for thoſe. And truly Sir, to put a Church to
any ſuch kind of uſe, is not to be defended; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I excuſe not the Univerſity: eſpecially ſhe having
had (at leaſt for a good time) ſo many large places for
thoſe meetings. Yet ſomething might be ſaid for the
Vice-Chancellours Court, becauſe tis partly Epiſcopal,
ſomething for the act at leaſt <hi>in Comitiis,</hi> becauſe tis part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Divine; but I had rather it ſhould receive an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then an excuſe. Though it follow not neither, that
becauſe this Church is ſometimes for ſome few houres
abuſed, therefore it may be alwayes ſo; as if becauſe
ſometimes tis made a profane Church, tis therefore fit
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114107:24"/>
'twere no Church at all.</p>
               <p>He proceeds. <hi>[And as for their curſes (thoſe Bug-beare
words) I could never yet learne that an unlawfull curſe was any
prejudice but to the Author: of which ſort thoſe curſes muſt
needs be, which reſtraine the Parliament, or any there from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
a lawfull and undenyable power, which in inſtances
would ſhew very ridiculous, if any curſe ſhould prejudice ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
lawfull right. I am ſure ſuch curſes have no warrant from
the Law of God, or this Nation.]</hi> No warrant from the
Word of God? I conceive there is a very cleare one: &amp;
our Mother-Church commends it to the uſe of her ſons
in the expreſſe words of her Commination, <hi>Curſed be he
that removeth away the mark of his neighbours lands: and all
the people ſhall ſay, Amen. Deut.</hi> 27. 17. If he be accurſed
that wrongs his neighbour in his Lands, what ſhall he
be that injures God? If a curſe light upon him (and a
publique curſe confirmed by an <hi>Amen</hi> made by all the
people) who removes but the mark whereby his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Lands are diſtinguiſht; ſure a private curſe may be
annexed by a Benefactor unto his Deed of Donation, in
caſe men ſhould rob the very lands themſelves that have
been once given to their mother.</p>
               <p>That ſuch curſes reſtraine the Parliament in its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
undenyable Rights, is (you have told me) but a
great miſtake: For though the Parliament may <hi>Impunè</hi>
(which in ſome ſenſe is called lawfully) take away the
Church Lands, (though it may doe it without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe (the King being there) it is the higheſt
power) yet that Court it ſelfe cannot do it <hi>Juſtè,</hi> cannot
doe it without ſinne, and that a fouler ſinne then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
a Land-marke, and then a fouler curſe may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it. Let the Epiſtler then take heed of theſe more
then bug-beare words; For believe it, Sir, in ſuch curſes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114107:24"/>
as theſe there is much more then Showes and Vizards:
And if you will give truſt to any Stories at all, many
great Families and Men have felt it.</p>
               <p>His laſt Argument is (for all the reſt is but declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<hi>[Aske your Biſhops whether Church Lands may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
(the Law of the State not prohibiting) be transferred from
one Church to another upon emergent occaſions, which I thinke
they will not deny: if ſo, who knowes that the Parliament will
transferre them to Layhands? they-profeſſe no ſuch thing, and
I hope they will not, but continue them for the maintenance of the
Miniſtery.]</hi> I conceive the Biſhops anſwer would be, that
tis no ſacriledge to transferre lands from one Church to
another: but yet there may be much rapine and injuſtice,
the Will of the Dead may be violated, and ſo ſinne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in that Action; many may be injuriouſly put from
their eſtates, in which they have as good Title by the
lawes of the land, as thoſe ſame men that put them out.
To ſay then the Church lands may be totally given up,
becauſe the Epiſtler hopes the Parliament will commit
no ſacriledge, is a pretty way of perſwaſion, and may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
worke on him to give up his own lands, becauſe he
may as well hope to be re-eſtated again, in that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
will do no injuſtice.</p>
               <p>And now Sir, having thus obſerved your commands,
I ſhould have ceaſed to trouble you; yet one thing more
I ſhall adventure to crave your patience in: and tis to let
you know, that if this <hi>Epiſtler</hi> had been right in both his
Concluſions, <hi>That Epiſcopacy is not of Divine inſtitution, &amp;
that Sacriledge is no ſinne;</hi> yet if you caſt your Eyes upon
His Majeſties Coronation Oath, wherein he is ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſworne to defend both the Epiſcopall Order, and the
Church-lands and poſſeſſions, you would eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the King cannot yeeld to what this <hi>Letter</hi> aims
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114107:25"/>
at, though he were in danger of no other ſinne then that
of Perjury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though I muſt needs gueſſe that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtler</hi>
knew well of this juratory tye, yet you will the leſſe
blame him for a concealment of this kind, becauſe he
was not retained of the Churches Counſell.</p>
               <p>His Majeſties Oath you may read publiſhed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

Kings have by Law ſetled Chriſtian Religion, and
ſworne to defend thoſe perſons that ſhould preach it, he
ought ſure to beare his Sword to defend his Lawes, and
to keepe his ſoule free from perjury.</p>
               <p>And by Canonicall priviledges that belong to them
and their Churches, there muſt needs be implyed the
honour of their ſeverall Orders, as that Biſhops ſhould
be above Presbyters, &amp;c. together with all their due
Rights and Juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>The words, <hi>Due Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> cannot but import
that His Majeſty binds himſelfe to ſee that juſtice be
done to them and the Churches, according to the Law
then in force when he tooke that Oath. And when the
King ſweares Protection and Defence, that Clauſe muſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114107:26"/>
needs reach not only to their perſons, but to their rights
and eſtates; for he ſweares not onely to men, but to men
in ſuch a condition, to Biſhops and their Churches; and
thoſe conditions of men grow little leſſe then ridiculous,
if their eſtates be brought to ruine; ſo that ſuch a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were neither at all worth the asking, nor the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
if the King ſhould protect a Biſhop in his life, and
yet ſuffer him to be made a begger, ſince to ſee himſelfe
in ſcorne and contempt, might more trouble him then to
dye.</p>
               <p>And whereas He ſweares to be their Protector and
Defender to his power by the aſſiſtance of God, theſe
words <hi>(to his power)</hi> may ſeem to acquit him of all the
reſt, if he fall into a condition wherein all power ſeemes
taken from him: But that Sir will prove a miſtake; for
one of the greateſt Powers of the King of England is in
the Negative in Parliament; So that without him no
Law can be enacted there, ſince tis only the power-roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that can make a Law to be a Law; ſo that if the King
ſhould paſſe a Statute to take away the Church-lands, he
protects it not to his power: ſince tis plaine, that ſo long
as a man lives and ſpeakes, he hath ſtill power to ſay,
No: For it cannot be ſaid that the Church in this caſe
may be as it were raviſhed from the King, and that then
he may be no more guilty of that ſinne then <hi>Lucrece</hi> was
in her rape, for though a chaſte body may ſuffer raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet the ſtrength of a <hi>Tarquin</hi> cannot poſſibly reach
unto a mans will or his aſſent.</p>
               <p>Now in all promiſſory Oathes made for the benefit of
that Party to whom we ſweare; tis a rule with Divines,
that they of all others do more ſtrictly bind, except then
alone when remiſſion is made, <hi>Conſenſu illius cui facta eſt
promiſsio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114107:27"/>
So although the King ſweare unto the People of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that he will keepe and confirme their Lawes, yet if
you their Commons deſire theſe ſaid Lawes, be either
abrogated or altered, tis cleare that Oath binds no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe remiſſion is made by their own conſent
who deſired that promiſe from him: and upon this very
ground tis true, that the King ſweares to obſerve the
lawes only <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> ſo long as they are Lawes.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the deſire either to alter or abrogate either
Law or Priviledges, proceed from any other, but from
them alone to whoſe benefit he was ſworne, tis cleerely
plaine by the rules of all juſtice, that by ſuch an act or
deſire his Oath receives no remiſſion: For the foundation
of this promiſſory Oath is their intereſt he was ſworn to
And it cannot therefore be remitted but by them alone
for whoſe ſake the Oath was taken. So that when (in the
ſecond Paragraph of the firſt clauſe, and more plainly in
the fift) he ſweares a benefit to the Biſhops alone, in the
behalfe of them and their Churches, tis apparent that
this Oath muſt perpetually bind, except a remiſſion can
be obtained from the Biſhops themſelves, and their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
he was ſworne to.</p>
               <p>This then muſt be confeſſed to be the ſenſe of the oath,
that when the King hath firſt ſworn in generall to grant,
keepe and confirme the Lawes and Cuſtomes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England, he farther yet particularly ſweares unto
the Clergy, to preſerve their Lawes and Priviledges, and
Cuſtomes; becauſe ſince they are not able to make a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
in Parliament, ſo that the Clergy may eaſily be
ſwallowed up by the People and the <hi>Lords:</hi> Therefore
in a more particular manner they have obtained an oath
to be made unto them by the King, which being for their
particular benefit, it cannot be remitted without their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114107:27"/>
expreſſe conſent, ſo that although an Act of Parliament
being once paſſed by the Votes of the King and both
Houſes, it doth Sir (as you have told me) bind the whole
People of England: yea the whole People as it includes
the Clergy too; yet it concernes the King by vertue of
his Oath to give his Vote unto no ſuch Act as ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
what he hath formerly ſworne unto them, except
he can firſt obtain their expreſſe conſent, that he may be
thereby freed from his <hi>juratory obligation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be ſaid perhaps that in the conſent given by both
Houſes of Parliament, the conſent of the Clergy is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
implyed, and ſo it is, (ſay our Lawyers as you have
told me Sir) in reſpect of the power obligatory, which
an Act ſo paſſed obtaines upon them, for they affirme
that it ſhall as ſtrongly bind the Clergy, as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had in expreſſe termes conſented to it. Although
Biſhops being men barred from their Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
And neither they nor their inferiour Clergy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made choice of any to repreſent them in that great
Councell, their conſents can in no faire ſenſe be ſaid to
be involved in ſuch Acts as are done as well without
their repreſentative preſence, as they once without their
perſonall.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, whether a tacite conſent, (though
it be indeed againſt their expreſſe wils) can have a power
remiſſory to abſolve the King from his Oath; he that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
it hath, muſt reſolve to meet with this great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
that although (beſides his Generall Oath unto
the whole People of England) His Majeſty be in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſworne unto the Rights. of the Clergy, yet they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
no more benefit by this, then if he had ſworn onely
in generall; which is as much as to ſay, that in this little
draught Oathes are multiplyed without neceſſity, nay
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114107:28"/>
without ſignification at all, and that the greater part of
the firſt, and the whole fourth clauſe, are nothing elſe but
a meere painfull draught of ſuperfluous tautologies.</p>
               <p>For his yeelding to the two firſt lines ſwears him to keep
and confirme the Lawes and cuſtomes of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England; which word <hi>(People)</hi> includes thoſe of
the Clergy too, and therefore in generall their Lawes
and Cuſtomes are confirmed no doubt in thoſe words,
and ſo confirmed that they cannot be ſhaken but at leaſt
by their tacite conſent in a Parliamentary way. But ſince
the King condeſcends to afford to their Rights, a more
particular juratory tye, there is no doubt but it binds in a
way too, that is more particular; ſo that His Majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect a remiſſion of this oath, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
clearely expreſſed: For as when the King ſweares
to keep the Lawes of the People in general, he cannot be
acquitted but by the expreſſe conſent of the people, or by
a body that repreſents the People, <hi>quatenus</hi> the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo
that when in particular he ſweares unto the Lawes and
Cuſtomes of the Clergy, this Oath muſt needs bind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it be remitted in an expreſſe forme, either by the whole
Clergy, themſelves, or by ſome Body of men at leaſt,
that repreſents the Clergy, <hi>quatenus</hi> the Clergy, and
not only as they are involved in the great body of the
People, ſo that he that ſhall preſume to perſwade His
Majeſty to paſſe an Act in prejudice of this eccleſiaſtical
Body (to whom he is thus ſworn) without their expreſſe
conſent firſt obtained, councels him to that which is both
groſly injurious unto his fellow Subjects, nay which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a moſt damnable wickedneſſe againſt the very
ſoule of the King.</p>
               <p>Sir, as I conceive tis now plaine enough, that if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhould deſtroy the Epiſcopall Order, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114107:28"/>
the Lands of the Church; the Houſes in that Act
would runne themſelves into two ſinnes, and His Majeſty
into three; and upon this ſuppoſition the <hi>Epiſtler</hi> and I
are agreed: <hi>[I do not thinke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Conveniency or Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
will excuſe Conſcience in a thing in it ſelfe unlawfull]</hi> and
before that, he calls the contrary the Tenet of <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,
or Jeſuited Puritan:</hi> Onely I would beſeech him
for his own ſoules ſake to conſider how great a ſcandall
he hath given to mankind, in defence of ſuch ſinnes as
theſe. For I conceive that <hi>Durand</hi> offended more in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Fornication was no ſinne againſt the Law naturall,
then <hi>Shechem</hi> did (who was onely under that Law) in his
Luſt upon old <hi>Jacobs</hi> Daughter, <hi>Fraudem legi facere,</hi>
(ſaith the Civilian) is worſe then <hi>Legem violare,</hi> it argues
a more un-Subject-like diſpoſition for a man to put tricks
and quirks upon his Prince his Lawes, then to runne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into a down-right violation: And God we know is
King, <hi>I am a great King (ſaith the Lord of Hoſts) and a King
in whoſe hand is vengeance,</hi> Malach. 1. 14. Tis true Sir, we
are thus put into a very ſad condition, when the only Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ſeemes left us now, is either to chooſe ſinne or
ruine; but yet (if well uſed) tis a condition glorious; a
condition wherein all that noble Army of Martyrs ſtood,
before they could come at Martyrdome, and if in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of mind we thus lay our lives downe at the feet of
Chriſt, I am undoubtedly perſwaded tis our only way
to preſerve them.</p>
