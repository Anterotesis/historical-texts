         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there was a great and solemne Fast:
insomuch that those who did abhorre
to keepe it. were to suffer the penalty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
            <p>The Churches were well filled, and the best
Teachers which were to bee had preached upon
that day: to the comfort and stirring up of those
which were the Audience to Piety, and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>But as it hath bin commonly knowne, that
when the best things are in agitation, then are the
wicked most enflamed to worke mischiefe. So
it proved then, as shall now appeare: for at that
present time<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> when most devotion was used, then
did a company of <hi>French-men</hi> raise a most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
commotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97759:3"/>In the Market place of <hi>Edinborough,</hi> where
Commonly Farmers leave their corn which they
doe not sell upon one Market day for the next
market, there did these Traytors gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together, and about ten of the clock before
noone they resolved all together to fire those
chambers, where in all manner of corne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
was left, that therby the place might come
to the more need and want: and consequently,
that a dearth might presently ensue.</p>
            <p>Fire they did set unto those places of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
which would soonest take, which did flame
out after an extraordinary manner. Then did
these <hi>
                  <unclear>French-men</unclear>
               </hi> goe crying up and down, Fire,
fire, to the great amazement of all those which
were gathered together at Kirk: but God which
will not suffer treachery to lye hid, revealed
their damnable intents, thus.</p>
            <p>There were certaine strangers travelling that
way, which did see them when they were about
their hellish enterprises: and as they were cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
fire, fire, they did lay hold on them, and as the
multitude came to quench the flaming market,
they wondred why those French-men were laid
hold on.</p>
            <p>Then did the strangers relate unto them the
whole matter, how that vvhatsoever was there
done, was acted by the treacherous <hi>French-men,</hi>
who vvere presently committed to the custody
of Officers: and being examined they answered,
that had their purpose taken full effect, it had bin
<pb facs="tcp:97759:3"/>
the best deed which in many yeeres had beene
<unclear>done</unclear> in <hi>Edinborough,</hi> they said the people being
<hi>
                  <unclear>Hereticks</unclear>,</hi> would have had a good fire to warme
them by, after that their rites had bin celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French-men</hi> which were about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of twelve, are at this time in the Castle of
<hi>Edinborough,</hi> and wait for their judgment, which
will be, according as all traytors merit, a rope to
hang them, and good sharpe knives to quarter
them.</p>

part was saved.</p>
