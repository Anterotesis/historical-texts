            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE King parted from hence the 26th inſtant for <hi>Breda,</hi> where His Majeſty intends to ſtay till Sunday next, and then to go on for <hi>Flanders,</hi> to Head the Army, which is drawing together for the Relief of <hi>Mons;</hi> Ten Thouſand Brandenburghers quartered in the Countrey of <hi>Liege,</hi> are already advanced as far as <hi>Leeuwe,</hi> and the reſt of the Forces march with ſuch Diligence, that they will be to morrow at their place of Rendezvous, between <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and together make a Body of 50000 Men, without reckoning the Scots Regiments that are newly arrived at <hi>Sluyce</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time we have this Account of the Siege. On the 15th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Mons</hi> was inveſted by the <hi>French</hi> Horſe; The next day part of their Foot came up, as the reſt did the day following, and took their ſeveral Poſts. On the 19th the Enemy began to work on their Line of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation, having for that purpoſe ſummon'd in ſeveral thouſands of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey People. On the 22d the <hi>French</hi> King arrived in the Camp, and it was thought the Trenches would have been open'd that day, but it was not done till the 25th at Night, when the Enemy began likewiſe to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town from three Batteries, but one of their Batteries ſunk and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted their Cannon. The <hi>French</hi> King did not ſtay in the Camp, but went to St. <hi>Guiſlain,</hi> where he has his Quarters; and the Dauphin his at <hi>Maubeuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide the Town is well fortified, and has in it a Garriſon of 7000 Men, beſides the Burghers, who make as conſiderable a Body, are moſt of them Men well Diſciplined and experienced in War, and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and active in the Defence of the Place, in order whereunto they have uncovered their houſes, and unpaved the Streets, to hinder the effects of the Enemies Bombs. They are very well Stored with Proviſions and Ammunition, and the Prince <hi>de Bergue,</hi> the Governor, has ſent Word to the Governor of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he wants nothing, and doubts not but to give the Enemy work enough. The Beſieged have made two Sallies, in which, 'tis ſaid, they have killed 700 of the French, and very bravely repulſed the Enemy, in an Attack they made upon a Wind-Mill and a ſmall Redoubt which lies at ſome little diſtance from the Town, and in this laſt Action the French loſt almoſt a whole Regiment, and 'tis very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reported that their Famous Enginier Monſieur <hi>Vauban</hi> was likewiſe killed here, Several Spaniſh Officers are got into the Town; From whence in a word, we have as good an Account of things as can be expected.</p>
