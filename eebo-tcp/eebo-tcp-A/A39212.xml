            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

credit of the opinion, that it may carry the greater countenance and authority with
it, are (by those that have published books of the same) mentioned and described with
high applause, insomuch as the Doctrine is almost generally entertained both by
Ministers and people, and those especially that seem the most zealous, who embrace
it with great affection, as a most excellent mystery of truth.</p>

it is not said their souls arose, but their bodies onely.</p>
            <p>And although in some other cases while the soule and the body li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

will make the soule to dye or be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lain with the body, and so lye dead
in the grave with it, that it may rise with it, as some of them have
been bold to say, and some to publish, contrary to many cleare testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Scripture, and to the words of Christ, <hi>Iohn 11. 25. I am the
resurrection and the life, he that beleeveth in me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live; and whosoever liveth and beleeveth in me, shall never dye.</hi> By
which words it is evident, that whosoever is once quickned and made
alive again in soule, by faith in Christ, from that spirituall death,
which it (being once alive in <hi>Adam</hi>) was brought unto by the fall,
and his own sinnes, this soule shall never dye more, he is passed from
death to life, as Christ saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24, 25. and Christ will raise his
body up at the last day, according to his word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 4.</p>
            <p>It is true, that the soules of the unregenerate reprobates, which were
never quickned and made alive again by faith from that death they
had by the fall, and their own sinnes, their bodies dying, their soules
remain spiritually dead in some low place of darknesse, where evill
spirits are, untill the last day, when both body and soule shall come
forth and live, to undergoe the second death.</p>
            <p>So then, when <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>And I saw the soules of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed

Christ a thousand yeares,</hi> he meaneth their soules and not their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

according also to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. where the soules under the Altar

of the world, because their brethren that should be killed as they
were, would not be fulfilled till then; and all the Saints are in one
kind or other, killed for Christs sake, as it is written: <hi>For thy sake, O
Lord, are we slain all the day long, and counted as sheep to the slaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because this resurrection of the soule is effected here while the
soule is in the body, by the Word and Spirit of God, as <hi>Iohn</hi> well
knew, according to that which Christ had said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 21, 24, 25. and
11, 4, 5, 6. and to that of <hi>Paul, Ephes. 2. 1, 4, 5, 6. Col. 2. 12, 13. Col.</hi> 3.
1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. Ephes. 4. 23. Titus</hi> 3. 5. and other places, and was
also in those dayes well known to the Saints; in consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>This is the first Resurrection: The first,</hi> implying plainly,
that it is the very fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall reigne with him a thousand yeares,</hi> even till Christ shall come in his

body and soule into his kingdome.</p>
            <p>If therefore this resurrection of the soule and spirit, be the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,

same things that had been so largely shewd before from <hi>chap.</hi> 12. to
this place.</p>
            <p>But there are yet other places where a thousand yeares are named,
which the Millinaries to confirm their opinions) add to this, as,</p>
            <p>2 Pet. 3. 8. One day is with the Lord as a thousand yeares, and a thousand
yeares as one day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 8. For a thousand yeares in thy fight are but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> yesterday
when they are past, and as a watch in the night, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Both these places they will have to intend their thousand yeares
Monarch and day of judgement, though neither of the places aim at
any such things: but they speak of the time of Gods long forbearance
for the bringing in of his chosen, and of their sufferings during that
time before the Lords coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As first for the words of</hi> Peter, <hi>it is manifest that he speaketh first
in reproofe of those s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>offers that in the latter dayes should mock and
say,</hi> Where is the promise of his coming? For since the Fathers slept, all
things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation, &amp;c. vers 2,
3, 4, 5, &amp;c. <hi>and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith to the faithfull,</hi> But (beloved) be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand yeares,
and a thousand yeares as one day: The Lord is not slack concerning his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
as some men count slacknesse, but is long suffering to us ward, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the
day of the Lord will come as a thiefe in the night, &amp;c. vers. 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Where the Apostle giveth them and us all to understand, that the
long time of a thousand yeares and more, (which he fore-saw would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63532:7"/>
passe before the day of the Lord should come, would be the time of
Gods long-suffering to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>-ward, that all his elect might come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and be saved, though they were to passe through many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
especially under the long reigne of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Which time therefore, they might well think long, though in the
account of God in respect of his eternall mercies, they are but as one
day, as yesterday, when they are past.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to this purpose also are the words of</hi> Moses <hi>in his Psalm,</hi> vers.
8. <hi>And therefore he saith after,</hi> vers. 13, 14, 15. Return, O Lord, how
long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants, O satisfie us early
with thy mercies, that we may rejoyce and be glad all our dayes. Make us
glad according to the dayes wherein thou hast afflicted us, and to the yeares
wherein we have seen evill.</p>
            <p>Where <hi>Moses</hi> (counting also the time long wherein the Lord affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
his servants) prayeth as we see, not that he would have us to
understand him, as the Millinaries conceive, as if he desired that the
mercies of God which he prayed him to satisfie his servants with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp;c. should be limited to the time of a thousand yeares, or to be
of no longer continuance than the dayes or yeares of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Which although they were and are to be and continue, all the
dayes of this present world, yet when they are past, are but as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
as a watch in the night; yea but as a moment in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his everlasting mercies; For so speaketh the Lord unto his
afflicted Church, to comfort her in all her afflictions, saying, <hi>For
a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy will I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thee. In a little wrath I hid my f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e from thee for a moment, but with
everlasting kindnesse will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer,
&amp;c. Esay</hi> 5 4. 7, 8, &amp;c. According to which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
saying, <hi>For our light afflictions which are but for a moment, worketh
for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.
<hi>Worketh for us,</hi> saith he; not that affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction doe merit or deserve the
same, but because of the Lords promise and mercies, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them according to their workes, as Christ saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10.
11. and other places: not in proportion of time, or worth of work,
but for exceeding all, <hi>an eternall weight,</hi> as he saith.</p>
            <p>And so the words of <hi>Moses, Make us glad according to the dayes
wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the yeares wherein we have seen evill,</hi>
are to be understood. It is too farre fetcht, and very unreasonable, to
turn his words to a thousand years Monarch; especially, considering
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63532:7"/>
what he said before, <hi>vers. 8. For a thousand years are but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a

saith of the whole time of all the Saints affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions, counting it but as
a moment, and all their afflictions but light in respect of the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercies and kindnes of the Lord, and the exceeding and eternall
weight of glory he hath prepared for them, and they shall receive in
the kingdome of Christ, when he cometh in his glory, and all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels with him, and shall fit in the throne of his glory, as he hath
said, which is never likened to a small moment, or watch in the night,
or to yesterday, as the time of their afflictions is; nay what were his
kingdome then?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next chiefe place whereon they would ground their thousand
yeares Monarch, is,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 24, 25, 26. Then commeth the end, when
he shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even the Father, when hee
shall have put down all rule, all authority and power: For he must reigne
till he hath put all enemies under his feet, the last enemy is Death, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These words of the Apostle they make great use of to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
conceiving, that the Kingdome which Christ is to deliver up
at the end of the world, is his own Kingdome which he is to possesse
at his second appearing, concluding in their minds, that there shall
be a thousand yeares time between his appearing and the end of the
world, wherein he with his Saints is to reign and judge: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
the end of those yeares, all the dead that were not raised at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of them, and that shall die within the time, to be raised, and he
to deliver up his kingdome.</p>
            <p>This in briefe is that which they conceive and conclude to be the
meaning of the Apostle, and so they argue from these words, <hi>Then
cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even
the Father,</hi> to prove the kingdome of Christ to be in this world, for a
thousand yeares, and then to end; often using the words, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in their bookes, saying, For Christ is to deliver up his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
at the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Here also, I request ye to confider, how they misunderstand the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
turning <hi>The Kingdome,</hi> into <hi>His Kingdome;</hi> whereas the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
are plain, <hi>Then cometh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he end when he shall have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to God, even the Father, &amp;c.</hi> meaning by <hi>The Kingdome,</hi> the high
and supream Kingdome of God the Father, where Christ is now fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and reigning with him at his right hand in the heavens, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till his enemies be made his foot-stoole. Which Kingdome when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63532:8"/>
he cometh from thence to judge the quicke and the dead, and to
reign in his own Kingdome) hee is to deliver up and resigne unto
God the Father: Then are the Saints raised up, the last enemy is
destroyed, the end is come, as the Apostle saith: <hi>Christ the first
fruits, then afterward they that are Christs at his coming, then cometh the
end, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when he shall have put down all Rule, all Authority, and Power.</hi> All
these are to be done at one time, without any yeares or dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
            <p>And so the Apostle argueth, saying, <hi>For he must reign till he hath
put down all enemies under his feet, the last enemy that shall be destroyed, is
Death, &amp;c.</hi> proving by the words of <hi>David (The Lord said unto my
Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thy enemies thy Foot-stoole,
Psa.</hi> 110) That the Kingdome which Christ is to deliver up
at his coming, is the Kingdome wherein hee now reigneth in the
throne of God the Father, with him, at his right hand in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
expecting till his enemies be made his foot-stoole. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saith, <hi>For he must reign untill, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the same purpose hee proceedeth further, and saith,
<hi>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Sonne also
himselfe be subject unto him that put down all things under him, that God
may be all in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> declaring plainly, that while Christ sitteth at the
right hand of God in his throne reigning with him, hee is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto him, as hee shall bee when God the Father shall have <hi>put
down all things under him;</hi> nor God all in all now, as he shall bee
then when he hath delivered up the supream Kingdome wholly
unto God the Father, which he is to doe at his coming to judge
the quick and the dead, and to reigne in his owne kingdome, and
sit upon the throne of his Father <hi>David</hi> for ever; not in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s world,
but in that to come, which is to be subject unto him, as the Apostle
testifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8 9.</p>
            <p>This is Christs Kingdome, which God the Father hath appointed
unto him, wherein the Saints shall reigne with him, as he said, <hi>And
I appoint unto you a kingdome as my Father hath appointed unto me, that
ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdome, and sit on Thrones, &amp;c.
Luke</hi> 22. 29, 30. And again, <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to fit
with me in my throne, even as I overcame, and am set down with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his throne,</hi> Rev. 3. 21.</p>
            <p>And so it is true, that the Kingdome wherein Christ now reigneth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63532:8"/>
with God the Father crowned with glory and honour, is limited
within the compasse of a certain time, even untill the Father hath
put down all things under him. And it is true also, that the living
and reigning of the souls of the Saints in the first resurrection, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
within the compasse of the same time, even till he cometh,
and shall bring them all with him, and cloath them with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and heavenly bodies, to live and reign with him body and
soule in his kingdome for ever.</p>
            <p>Which kingdom of his, he is never to resign nor deliver up, neither
is it to passe away, nor be destroyed, nor have an end, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
witnesse, 1 Chron. 17. 11, 1, 29, 13, 4. Psal. 89. 36, 37. Esay
9, 6, 7. Dan. 7. 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 27. Micha 4. 7 and sundry other

            <p>But there is yet one thing more, (which hath been a long time
held as an Article of faith, that notonely at first drew them o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
the opinion, but doth still hold them fast to it) the thing is this,
That Christ at the end of the world (after the generall resurrection
and judgement) shall ascend with all his Saints into heaven, and
there remain and dwell for ever, and the creation of the Heavens
and the Earth passe away and be no more, as is commonly beleeved
by the multitude, and they judge to be true, which if it be, then of
necessity, the glorious Kingdome of Christ, with his Saints (so
much spoken of in Scripture to he on earth, and not yet fulfilled)
must be before the end of the world, and then at the end thereof
cease, as they say. The Scriptures they alledge for proofe, are, <hi>Iohn</hi>
14. 2, 3. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. 1 Pet. 3. 4, 5, 6. Heb. 6. 19, 20. 1 Thess.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>This likewise I request ye to consider, not so much the common
opinion of the multitude, or judgement of the Millinaries, which
proves nothing, as the Scriptures they alledge for their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which ought duly to bee weighed. And first, the words
of Christ, <hi>In my Fathers House are many mansions, if it were
not so, I would have told you: I goe to prepare a place for you, and if I goe
and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto my
selfe, that where I am, there ye may be also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ doth not say nor mean here, that he would goe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his Fathers house, or the many mansions that are therein, for
them, as some think; but <hi>a place,</hi> as he saith, which no doubt is that
whereof God spake before unto <hi>David,</hi> saying, <hi>Also I will prepare a

            <p>Neither doth Christ say, I will come again and receive you up
into heaven to the Throne of God from whence I shall come, but
unto <hi>my selfe, that where</hi> I <hi>am, there ye may be also.</hi> And Christ is then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63532:9"/>
to be in his Kingdome, which the Father hath appointed unto him,
in the world to come, where all things shall be in subjection unto him,
when there shall be new heavens and a new earth, as the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
testifieth, and <hi>Peter</hi> also; and as <hi>Iohn</hi> foresaw with the new <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
coming down from God out of Heaven, even that heavenly
Countrey and Citie, having foundations, which all the holy Fathers
thers looked for. And this is the place which Christ went to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for them, and for all their children, and wherein (when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and receiveth them unto himselfe) they shall be with him, and he
will be with them, and God himselfe also, and will dwell with them,
and they shall be his people, and he will be their God, as he hath said,

            <p>
               <hi>And concerning the words of</hi> Paul, 2 Cor. 5. 1. For we know, that if
our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of
God, an House not made with hands, eternall in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Here the Apostle speaketh of our bodies, which hee calleth <hi>

                  </gap>
earthly House of this Tabernacle,</hi> and before, <hi>chap. 4. our outward man, if
this be dissolved, we have a building of God, &amp;c.</hi> By which he declareth
plainly, that as wee beleeve the resurrection of our bodies at the last
day; so we are to know, they shall not be then, earthly, naturall, vile,
corrupt, mortall, weak, dishonorable, without glory, as now they
are: but they (both the dead that are risen, and the living being
changed) shall be heavenly, spirituall, incorruptible, immortall,
powerfull, honorable, glorious, for so he had testified before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. And in another place again, saying, <hi>For our conversation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
from whence we look for the Saviour the Lord Lord Iesus Christ, who
shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
&amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21. And that this building of God, or House, is not
temporall, or fading, but eternall; and not lying now in the grave,
nor being any where now in earth (in respect of this glorious change
of cloathing) but in Heaven, from whence it is to come, as he saith, <hi>v. 2.
For in this we groan earnestly, desiring to be cloathed upon with our House
which is from Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> And he calleth it <hi>a building of God, an house
not made with hands,</hi> as having respect unto the day of the Lord, that
great day of the generall assembly of them all, his first born; so cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
and adorned, when they shall manifestly appeare to be that true
and heavenly Tabernacle spoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 2. and 9. 11. that holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw coming downe from God ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63532:10"/>
change shal there be of the bodies of the Saints at the resurrection.</p>
            <p>And as touching the words of <hi>Peter, Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Iesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Christ from the
dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
reserved in Heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through
faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s inheritance
incorruptible, &amp;c. is the same spoken of before, (reserved in heaven
ready to be revealed from thence in the last time, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
5.) and that within the veil, spoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. whereinto the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
Jesus Christ is for us entred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for the words of</hi> Paul, 1 Thess. 4. 17. Then we which are alive and
remain, shall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in the aire,
and so shall we be ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>If the Apostle had said, the Lord would come to meet us in the
aire, there might have been some reason for us to think (as many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
doe) that he meant to take us up into heaven from whence
he came. But his words being, <hi>We shall be caught up to meet him,</hi> doe
plainly imply, that he cometh unto us, to the earth which is his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and to some one place therein, which no doubt will be (as the
Prophet sait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>The mount of Olives,</hi> from whence he did ascend, neare
unto <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> where <hi>Davids</hi> Throne was, and his is to be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God said (notwithstanding all his opposites) <hi>yet have I set
my King upon my holy Hill of Sion.</hi> And because his elect wil be then (at
his coming) as they are now, dispersed over all the earth, and he being
one person, who can be but in one place at once, and coming from
heaven, he will send his Angles, as he hath said, who shall take them
up out of all places, to meet him in the aire, and so they shall be ever
with him in his Kingdome, which at his appearing shall be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
as it is written.</p>
            <p>Neither is there a word in all the Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iptures that speaks of Christs
ascending up with his Saints into the heavens (where he now is) after
his coming, and the resurrection of their bodies; nor that promiseth
the same for their habitation. But that they shall inherit the earth,
and dwell therein for ever, there are many words and promises in
many places of Scripture, where this is exprest, as <hi>Psalm 25. 13. Psalm</hi>
37. <hi>Mat. 5. 5 Heb. 11. 8. Rom.</hi> 4. 13. and sundry other.</p>
            <p>And whatsoever things are said to be prepared and reserved in
heaven for the Saints, or promised as rewards unto them, as Christ
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63532:10"/>
saith, <hi>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall
say all manner of evill against you falsly for my sake, Rejoyce and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in heaven, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 5. and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
All those great rewards and things that no eye hath seen, will
Christ bring with him, as it is written, <hi>Esay</hi> 40. 10. and 62. 11. <hi>Rev.</hi>
22. 12.</p>
            <p>And as concerning Gods creation of the Heavens and the Earth,
that God should destroy the same, or turn all unto a Chaos again, as
some imagine, the Scriptures no where speake to any such purpose,
but the clean contrary often, That he hath established it, and will, so
that it shall never be moved, as 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 30. Psal. 78. 69. Psal. 93. 1.
Psal. 104. 5. Psal. 144. 5, 6. Esay</hi> 45. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Onely the corrupt and evill estate of all things, with the curse
which our sinnes have caused, shall bee r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>moved, in which respect
the whole creation is said to groan, and the creature to be delivered
from the bondage of corruption, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. So the Heavens and
Earth that now are, shall passe away, and no place any more be sound
for them, as it is written, <hi>Esay 65, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 3. 10. Rev.</hi> 20. 11. and
21. 1.</p>
            <p>And all this shall be done in the very same day wherein Christ
shall come, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, and as <hi>Iohn</hi> also testifieth, saying, <hi>And I saw
a great white Throne, and him that sate on it, from whose face the Earth
and the Heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them.</hi> They
are to flye away at his coming.</p>
            <p>For, corruption and evill may not abide where the Throne of
God, and of the Lamb shall be, nor where his holy City shal appeare,
and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>I saw a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and the
former were passed away, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were a very unreasonable thing, &amp; unbeseeming us once to think,
that God should make this excellent frame and wonderfull worke of
the world, the Heavens, Sunne, Moon and Starres, the Earth, plants,
&amp; all other creatures, to destroy the same. This were to make God
weak, like unto man, that builds and pulls down again, because it is
not to his minde.</p>
            <p>Neither are we to conceive that God doth alter his purpose in any
thing, but what he first determined shall stand. God created not the
world for the time or state before the flood, that old world which
perished, nor for this corrupt on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that now is, as if it had been the

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63532:11"/>
it was for that which is to come, where God onely shall be exalted in
that day above all, and his anoynted one Jesus Christ be under him
King over all the earth, and his redeemed an holy Nation, and a
Kingdome of Priests before him for ever, world without end, as it

            <p>But the Scriptures absolutely deny such things to be in that world
where the Kingdome of Christ is to be with his Saints after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of their bodies, when God shall have created new Heavens
and a new Earth, and <hi>Ierusalem a rejoycing, &amp;c.</hi> as he saith, <hi>There shall
not be thence an infant of dayes, nor an old man that hath not filled his
dayes, &amp;c. Esay</hi> 65.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Christ also more fully confirmeth it, saying,</hi> The children of this
world marry, and are given in marriage, but they which shall be counted
worthy of that world, and of the resurrection from the dead, neither marry
nor are given in marriage, neither can they dye any more, &amp;c. Luke 20. 34,
35, 36.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the faithful, <hi>Behold, I shew you a mystery,
we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an eye, at the last Trump; for the Trumpet shall sound, and the dead

1 Cor. 15. 51, 52, 53. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which testimonies it is plain, that in the world to come after
the resurrection of the Saints, there shall be no more marrying, nor
any more children of dayes, nor old men whose dayes are not filled,
nor any mortallity or dying. All these things (which were before in
the former worlds) shall now cease and be no more, The childe of
what dayes soever he was before, few or many, shall die and be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
as the old man that is an hundred yeares old, there shall be in
the resurrection and change no such difference, there shall bee on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the child for want of dayes, nor in the old man by reason of
many dayes. Both shall be, thence, in a perfect, incorruptible, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and unchangeable estate. But the sinner being an hundred
yeares old, shall be accursed, as the Prophet saith: Hee shall have

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63532:11"/>
Now if all these things be so, if there shall be no more infants of
dayes, nor old men that have not filled their dayes, nor marrying,
nor dying after the resurrection of the just, but all Gods chosen, as
well they that are alive, as they that are dead, being raised, shall bee
changed to perfection, incorruption, immortallity and glory; and
the sinners be accursed, as the Scriptures declare; where then will the
Millinaries find time, or place, or persons for their Millinary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
let them speak.</p>
            <p>And as concerning the other sort of Millinaries, I mean those
that will have all the prophesies and promises of the Kingdome of
Christ with his Saints, so abundantly spoken of in Scripture, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on a remnant of naturall Jewes, which they imagine shall bee all
converted to the faith of Christ, and gathered out of all parts to the
land of Canaan, and with the Christian Gentiles, become a glorious
Church and Kingdome for a thousand yeares before the end of the
world, or resurrection of the bodies of the Saints. Let these also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

            <p>And first this, That if the promise of the Land of Canaan, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 13.

of all, that the children of the promise are counted for the seed,
and not the children of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lesh, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8.</p>
            <p>If all these things be so, as these Scriptures speake, which I suppose
no understanding Christian will deny; Then I demand of them a
reason why the holy Fathers themselves, as well as their seed, and all
the seed as well as a part, should not inherit the same, and not any
one, or part to be excluded, seeing God is faithfull that promised.
Let them answer.</p>
            <p>God did covenant also with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. to be his God, &amp;
the God of his seed, &amp; he established the same in no plainer nor surer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63532:12"/>
ner than he did to give them the land for an everlasting possession.
But if God should faile either <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any of his seed in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
how did he then keep his covenant? Even so of the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Land, which <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth by the name of the <hi>World,</hi>
saying, <hi>For the promise that he should be the heire of the world, was not to
Abraham or to his seed, through the Law, but through the Righteousnesse of
Faith, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that therefore as God will not faile <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor any of his
seed, to bee their God, neither will hee faile to give them the Land
of Canaan, and all the world besides (after the resurrection and
change, when all things shall be heavenly) for an everlasting posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>And all this did <hi>Abraham</hi> well understand, and looked for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
thereof accordingly; as the Apostle declareth, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
11. saying, <hi>By Faith Abraham when hee was called to goe into a place,
which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and went not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whither he went. By faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e sojourned in the land of Promise as in a
strange Countrey with Isaac and Iacob, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eires with him of the same
promise. For he looked for a Citie which hath foundations, whose Builder
and maker is God,</hi> vers. 8, 9, 10. and so to vers. 13. where hee saith,
<hi>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen
them afarre off, and were perswaded of them, and embraced them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that they were strangers and pilgrimes on earth. And they that say
such things,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>declare plainly that they seek a Countrey.
And truly,</hi> (saith he) <hi>if they had been mindfull of the Countrey from
whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but now they desire a better countrey, that is an heavenly. Wherefore
God is not ashamed to be called their God, for hee hath prepared for them a-Citie,</hi>
vers. 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>And so through the Chapter, the Apostle having spoken of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and the Prophets, and others of the faithfull, concerning their
faith, and patience in suffering, saith, <hi>And these all having obtained a
good report through faith received not the promise, God having provided
some better thing for us, that they without us, should not be made perfect.</hi>
vers. 39, 40.</p>
            <p>By which testimony of the Apostle it is evident, that all the holy
Fathers, Prophets and Saints (upon the words of the promise) looked
for a heavenly countrey, and an eternall Citie in a better world
than this is, and that they all died in faith, and received not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63532:12"/>
nor might, untill all the seed were accomplished as well they
of the many nations, as they of the Jewes. And then they shall hee
raised out of their graves, even all the holy Fathers and Prophets, &amp;
obtain that better resurrection w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they so confidently (in their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages)
and suffrings hoped for, and be delivered (all of term) from all their captivities and troubles, and brought to their owne land,
where Christ their Redeemer shall be their King, and they with all
their seed be an holy nation, and a kingdome of Priests unto God
the Father for ever, according as <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and Christ
and his Apostles have spoken.</p>
            <p>But that all the Jewes and Israelites now remaining, should be all
converted to the faith of Christ, and become a great nation and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
this is a thing not onely beyond all probability in reason, but
also besides all ground of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The sayings of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. which they chief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3, 4. and his own present time, as <hi>vers.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 14. And also of the
time from thence to come, and severeth and distinguisheth them from
the rest; (the reprobate part) as verse 7. where he saith, <hi>What then,
Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it, and the rest were blinded, according as it is written, God hath

saith not in the whole, he still reserveth them of the <hi>Election,</hi> as in v. 7.
<hi>The Election obtained it, the rest were blinded.</hi> And so vers. 18. <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: But as touching the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
they are beloved for their Fathers sakes:</hi> hee still severing them of

he concludeth, saying, <hi>Who both killed the Lord Iesus, and their owne
Prophets, and have persecuted us, and they please not God, and are contrary
to all men, forbidding us to speak unto the Gentiles, that they might
be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fill up their sin alwayes, for the wrath is come upon them to the
uttermost,</hi> 1 Thess. 1. 15, 16. According to that which <hi>Moses</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
of them long before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 49. And <hi>Esay 6. 9, 10. David</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63532:13"/>
All which hath been seen fulfilled not only upon those of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
age, who so obstinatly stood out against Christ and his Apostles,
and their manifest approved testimonies to the very destruction and
and desolation of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but upon their posterity also to this
day, even as it was foretold, and as themselves in their rage against
Christ, cryed out, saying, <hi>His blood be upon us and upon our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this blindnesse and wrath fore-told, was to continue upon
them not for a short time like to the captivity in Babylon, nor for a
thousand and six hundred yeares, as already it hath, and then, or soon
after to cease, as the Millinaries imagine; nay but continually as <hi>David</hi>
said, <hi>Psal. 69. 23. 24. alwayes,</hi> even untill the fulnesse of Gods elect
Gentiles should come in, as <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. which must
needs be understood to the end of the world, because the fulnesse of
them will not be come in till then.</p>
            <p>And so the fulnesse of the Gentiles being come in, as the Apostle
saith, <hi>All Israel shal he saved, as it is written, There shal come out of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodlinesse from Iacob;</hi> v. 26. meaning by <hi>all
Israel</hi> and by <hi>Iacob,</hi> all the whole house spirituall, even every one of
that seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who are the children of the
promise, and heires with them, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17. <hi>Rom 9. 8. Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 28, 29. Not one shall be lost of what Nation,
Tribe or people soever, they that have been in times past, are now, or
shall be hereafter among the blinded Jewes, or the ten Tribes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
disperst, the Lord that knoweth them all, will search them
out, and gather them together, that they with their Fathers and
their brethren, Gods elect Gentiles (whom the Lord will also search
out and bring,) may make up that one fold, and one nation, to that
one King and one Sheepheard, Jesus Christ, and be the Tabernacle
and Sanctuary of God for evermore, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prophesied, <hi>chap.</hi> 37.
and as Christ also fore-shewed, <hi>Iohn 10. 10. Rev.</hi> 21. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>All these things considered, what ground or foundation is there to
be thought the Millinaries can find in Scripture for a thousand years
Monarch of any kind, let them search and see.</p>
            <p>Nay, if they did rightly understand the Scriptures that speake of
those glorious things that are to be manifested at the appearing of
Christ and his Kingdome, and of the fignes going before the same,
and the end, they would know that there is not, nor will be found
so much as one hundred years time to come (here in this world) for
any Monarch or Kingdome soever.</p>

            <p>Meaning by <hi>surfeiting and drunkennesse,</hi> that of the soule, with the
wealth, pride, fulnesse, pleasures, profits, and prmotions of this
world, which will assault you, and are apt to entangle even your

world, and have respect to the Christian Gentiles, as well as to the
Christian Jewes, which those learned men ought to have known, and
that it was no senslesse thing, nor without reason or cause to watch
and pray in hope and expectation of the same, especially considering,
that all the wise virgins in all ages and times, did so watch and pray,
and though (they being weak) did some times slumber and sleep,
yet they had their lamps alwayes burning, and oyle with them, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
with fervent desires in their heart, the coming of their Lord the
Bridegroome.</p>
            <p>For they well understood by the word of the Lord, that
all those evill servants, and foolish Virgins, which say in their heart,
<hi>My Lord delayeth his coming, and begin to smite their fellow-servants,

            <p>Therefore ye that are the Lords faithfull and wise Servants, and of
the wise virgins, watch ye, and pray alwayes in the Spirit, as Christ
and his Apostles have exhorted you, and in meeknesse doe ye minister
unto your fellow-servants (in the House) good things, whatsoever
those evill servants, and foolish virgins say or doe.</p>
            <p>And take ye heed also of those, who would make ye beleeve, that
the Bridegroome Jesus Christ is already come, and fitteth now in the
Throne of his glory, judging the quick and the dead.</p>
            <p>That the resurrection of the Body, spoken of 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 115<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other places, the perfection, the salvation, the glory, and all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Scriptures have spoken concerning Christ and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and reign with all his Saints, are now at this present time (in a

and making Jesus Christ a mysticall thing, and all persons

            <p>And is well pleasing to those wandring professors that could never

to another: and now, at last, meeting with this, readily entertaine
it; and especially such men, as are most delighted with their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
tending so much to liberty, and such wanton women, as
like to fulfill their carnall pleasures, of which sort the most are that
embrace the doctrine, as experience proveth.</p>
            <p>And strong reason ariseth from their doctrine, that it should
be so.</p>
            <p>For if Christ be already come in his glory, &amp;c. And that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the body is now, while men live, and that when they

they were before they knew they had a Being, as they say. Then
well may they eat and drink and take their pleasure: for who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of any felicity or pain he had before?</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed, hearken not unto them, but know yee, and
beleeve it assuredly, that the Lord Jesus Christ shall come personally
and truly, and be seen in his glory with all his Saints, as hee was by
<hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> (with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>) in the holy mount.
And the bodies of the Saints shall be truly raised and changed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is proved by cleare Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And be ye ware also of those that shall offer to perswade you, that
the Scriptures which we have in our native language, is not, nor do
declare unto us, the word or minde of God; but that we must looks
for some new Apostles, endued with such miraculous gifts as <hi>Peter</hi>
and the other Apostles once had, to be sent from God to instruct us,
and to plant new Churches. Or that another <hi>Elias</hi> must come and
restore all things, before we can know the truth, or see a true
Church.</p>
            <p>Beleeve them not, but know yee, that if it were true, that some

And as for miracles to confirm it, there is no need, because that
hath been done sufficiently already.</p>
            <p>Neither is there such necessity of new Apostles, or of another <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>

Jewes, <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets, let them heare them, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>So now, we have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets as well as they; yea

            <p>And Christ himselfe prayed for those that should beleeve in him
through their word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>And if we will not heare nor be perswaded by them, to repent and
beleeve, neither will we if new ones, or some of them should come and

            <p>And as concerning the Church, or House of God, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
declareth unto us plainly, that it is, and hath been ever since his time,
<hi>built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe
being the chiefe corner stone.</hi> There are no new builders to be looked for,
to lay a new foundation.</p>
            <p>And the living stones of this House, are those wise Virgins that
