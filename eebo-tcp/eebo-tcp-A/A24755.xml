            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Mr <hi>Froſt,</hi> it ſeems, at the time of his being taken, which was in <hi>July</hi> laſt, lived at <hi>Rotherith</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> a Houſe-keeper there; and about the ſame time kept one <hi>Wheat</hi> as his ſervant: which <hi>Wheat</hi> (as is reported) being formerly a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and not being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelf from thence, was by the ſaid <hi>Froſt</hi> kindely and Charitably Redeemed from his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, ſet at Liberty, and afterwards taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Service, where he continued till ſuch time as for his lend practices the ſaid <hi>Froſt</hi> diſmiſt him. After which, the ſaid <hi>Wheat</hi> being taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>Southwark,</hi> upon ſuſpition of the ſame Crime of Clipping of Money, was for the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at the laſt Aſſizes held for the County of <hi>Surrey:</hi> But upon his then proffering to Impeach the ſaid Mr. <hi>Froſt,</hi> his Tryal was then reſpited for ſome time, and he kept to proſecute againſt him. And the ſame <hi>Wheat</hi> was the chief Witneſs that came in againſt him upon his Tryal.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Froſt</hi> having lain neer a Twelvemonth in the <hi>Marſhalſey</hi>-priſon, for want of Air and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe began to grow very ſick and infirm, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with great Swellings in his Limbs, in ſo much as they could not get Irons to come upon him:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64252:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and continuing ſo ill, as was feared he could not live till the Summer Aſſizes; It is ſaid, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon his own Innocence, did endeavour by his Friends, to have this ſpecial Court appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his Tryal, whereby he might have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to clear himſelf of the Crime he was accuſed of before he died, although at laſt it fell out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his pretences and expectation.</p>
            <p>At his Tryal, which began about three or four of the clock in the afternoon of the aforeſaid 17th day of <hi>June</hi> inſtant, after the Commiſſion read and Jury called and Sworn, the ſaid <hi>Froſt</hi> being brough to the Bar, as it appeared, in a very low and weak condition, was arraigned for Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Clipping and defacing of ſeveral pieces of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Coyn upon the 4th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, &amp;c. to which he pleaded Not Guilty.</p>
            <p>The other perſon, <hi>William Griffin,</hi> who came in upon Bail, was likewiſe Indicted for the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who alſo pleaded Not Guilty; and both put themſelves upon their Country. The principal Evidence that came in againſt <hi>Froſt</hi> was the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Wheat,</hi> who ſwore directly againſt him, that upon the day laid in the Indictment, he did ſee the aforeſaid <hi>Jonathan Froſt</hi> in the Fact, Clipping of Money; which although he was but a ſingle Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prove the Fact, yet ſeveral other Witneſſes came in to prove other circumſtances relating to it, as the frequent uttering of ſeveral parcels of clipt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64252:4"/>
Money by the ſaid <hi>Frost</hi> at ſeveral times to them; as alſo his offering to ſell ſeveral pieces of Silver which had been melted down, and which were alleadged as probable circumſtances to make the ſaid <hi>Froſt</hi> guilty of the Clipping. And for <hi>Will. Griffin,</hi> it was alleadged againſt him, that while he was ſervant to <hi>Froſt,</hi> he had offered to ſell ſome of the aforeſaid melted pieces of Silver: which the ſaid <hi>Frost</hi> replied, was done by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that the Silver ſo melted down, were ſome pieces of Spaniſh Coin which he had by him, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>After the Evidence againſt the Priſoners had been called and heard, the witneſſes on their part were produced, and ſeveral did teſtifie their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſaid <hi>Froſt:</hi> As for <hi>Froſt</hi> himſelf, his Spirits being weak through ſickneſs, he ſpake but little; but in effect did utterly deny the Fact charged upon him, and did except to the Evidence of the aforeſaid <hi>Wheate,</hi> as a perſon of a very ill fame and life, and malicious; and did call ſome witneſſes to prove that the ſaid <hi>Wheate</hi> during the time he was in Priſon, ſhould ſay, that he muſt get him (meaning the ſaid <hi>Froſt</hi>) hanged, or elſe he ſhould be hanged himſelf, or ſomething to that purpoſe. Many other circumſtances on both ſides were given in evidence, which would be too tedious to enumerate. But in concluſion, the whole matter being loft to the Jury, they went together, and after about an hours debate upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64252:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Evidence, they brought in their Verdict, and thereby found the aforeſaid <hi>William Griffin</hi> not guilty; who was thereupon that night diſcharged: but found the ſaid <hi>Froſt</hi> guilty of the Treaſon whereof he was indicted; who thereupon, after a grave exhortation made to him by the Judge who paſt the Sentence, had Judgement paſt upon him <hi>To be carried back to Priſon, and thence to be drawn upon an Hurdle to the place of Execution, and there to be hanged by the Neck till he were dead</hi>; which Sentence being given, the Priſoner was carried back to Priſon, and the Court broke up about 9 of the clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonathan Froſt</hi> was committed to Priſon about half a year ſince or more, and could not be tried the laſt Aſſizes paſt, but was forced to ſue out a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> at his own charge, and was thereby accordingly tried on Thurſday the 10 day of <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
