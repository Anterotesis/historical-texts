            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THough there was not Divine Authority for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> it, yet there is very good Reason to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and Censure Mens positive Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of <hi>doing this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Respect to the <hi>Lord's Will</hi>: for both Great and Small, whether they will or not, are altogether in the Power of God; who very often, by his secret and unforeseen Providence, disposeth them, as both short of, and beyond, so besides those Expectations and Desires with which they amuse themselves, and please others:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But though both Scripture and Experience teach us this important Truth; yet such is the Vanity of Man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105767:3"/>
that he resolves, promises, and undertakes, as if he were Master of himself, and wholly at his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> I cannot free my self altogether from this Common Infirmity, when I publish'd my First <hi>Narrative of Bourignianism.</hi> Indeed, I was never so prophane, as to forget my Dependance upon God, or to think that I could undertake or execute any thing, without His Permission and Assistance: But supposing that He would grant Life and Health, and that Assistance which may be expected, upon his own Promise, to all sincere Endeavours to serve Himself, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Truth and Religion; I say, supposing this, I did not apprehend any occasion of delaying the other <hi>Narratives,</hi> which I intended and promised; I did not expect, neither had I any fears of an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to lay down my Pen, and take up my Staff; to leave <hi>England,</hi> and walk as a Pilgrim again, into a Foreign Country, which hath frustrated several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Designs, as it hath interrupted the prosecution of this about <hi>Bourignianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
               <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> are all Masters of Celestial Politicks, and take upon them to assert the secret Reasons of all Publick and Private Dispensations, as positively as if they were Secretaries of Heaven, or sate in the Council there, or kept an intimate Correspondence with the Supreme Court: Wherefore some of the Admirers and Followers of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps say, That God has forced me to wander thus, to punish my assaulting the Credit of so Excellent a Person, and the endeavouring to raise Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Doctrine and Principles, which not only may contribute much to reform the World, but also which are the only means by which a General Reformation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105767:3"/>
can be effected. I do grant indeed, that that which hath befallen me, is a new Affliction, attended with several Inconveniencies to my self; which I take from God, both as a Punishment and Trial, and I do pray most heartily unto Him who over-rules all things, that this and other Misfortunes which have befallen me, may add to my Faith, and produce Repentance, Wisdom, Experience, Patience, Hope, and all other <hi>Fruits of Righteousness.</hi> But though I have many things to repent of, yet I see no reason to repent of my undertaking the Detection of the Errors and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions of <hi>Madamoiselle Bourignon,</hi> and her Followers: Nay, I may rather think, that the Wise Providence of God, that useth to contrive all things so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that each most fitly answereth divers excellent Purposes, hath cast me upon this Shore, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Will, as for other Ends, so to render me more capable to prosecute this useful Design; for now I have opportunity to speak with those who knew <hi>Antonia Bourignon.</hi> I can have a better Account of her Self, and I am better furnish'd with her Books, and other Books relating to her, than could have been had in <hi>England.</hi> Thus while I am removed from dear Relations, and most worthy Friends, and the Satisfaction and Conveniency which I enjoyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, I am brought nearer to this purpose; which, I hope, will prove both acceptable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Publick.</p>
            <p>It was impossible to go on with the <hi>Narratives,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> while I was travelling and unsetled in a most severe Winter; but the Delay shall, God willing, be now compensated, by making them more full and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative. Early Buds are wont to please the Curious, who generally are a little impatient; but the Trees
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105767:4"/>
flourish best, and are most fruitful, which do not over-hastily put forth before their proper Season. I would not have publish'd the Account of <hi>Bourignianism</hi> by Parcels, nor the <hi>First Narrative</hi> so soon, if it had not been to satisfie the Curiosity of some, who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired any Tast of that Matter, to which they were altogether Strangers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> But instead of Apologies for my Delay, it may seem to some more adviseable, to leave off the Thoughts of continuing this Subject, that I may have rest from the Censures of Men, and not be obliged to engage in some unpleasant Contests, for which, they say, some are preparing. But whether it be so, or not, I am not much concerned; nor did I enter upon this Subject so rashly, as to be thus easily diverted from it. The Censures of Men, do neither surprize me, nor disturb my repose: I know every Reader will be a Judge, and will pass Sentence according to his Knowledge and Inclinations, and I am willing it should be so. If the Censure be Just, it is useful ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Confirm or to Correct; if it be trivial and malicious, it gives Matter for the Exercise of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Patience and Meekness; and if it be material, it affords Occasion for further Illustrations: so that one way or another, Censures are profitable. I have had Time to inform my self of those which have been poss'd upon the <hi>First Narrative,</hi> and I crave leave to offer them to your Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Some say that the Design is not <hi>tanti</hi>; that there is more noise made about the matter than is needful: <hi>Why,</hi> say they, <hi>all this Zeal against</hi> Antonia Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon? <hi>What though her Principles prevail, some of them are harmless, others tend to Piety; and what may produce so good an Effect, ought not to be obstructed. If
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105767:4"/>
Persons be Good, it is no matter upon what Motives and Inducements. Suppose she was not absolutely Perfect, yet she was Pious, and her design was to reform the World; she shews wherein its Corruption lies, and lays down very good Moral Rules and Directions how to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. What then is there here which should offend?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all this, I answer, First, That the Offence is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> not because she is a Woman. Monsieur <hi>Poiret</hi> says, That <hi>Bearded Animals take it ill, that God should have manifested himself so far to a Woman.</hi> But by his leave, he is mistaken; we do not quarrel at the Divine Oeconomy, nor envy his Grace in any. I am far from advising Men to enter into a War with the other Sex; they will gain nothing by it, inasmuch as it would be very unnatural. They employ their Wit very ill, who write Satyrs against Women; for at least as severe ones might be made against Men: and commonly they have but small share of Sense, Discretion and Vertue, who deny them to Women. But whatever Respect be due to the Sex in general, or to any particular Person we must guard against Dotage: we ought to be Just to all, but not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably Fond of any. The Behaviour of <hi>Lysis</hi> the phantastical Shepherd, was not Respect, but Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and they are not much wiser than he, who, like him, admire the very Deformities of their Mistress, who fansie her without all Imperfection, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Divine, the Master-piece of the Creation, and who follow her, as he did, through all places, gathering the Rags and Scraps, and licking up the very Dirt and Dust that falls from her. The Application is plain.</p>
            <p>Again, As I do not oppose <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> any pique against her Sex, so neither upon the account of her presuming to Teach and Reform the World;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105767:5"/>
which, it may be thought, we would have reserved to our selves, as our own particular province: for whatever be the Privileges of our Charter, we have no reason to fear or quarrel with Interlopers, if they do not impose upon and cheat People with false and counterfeit Wares. Would God all were Prophets! I heartily wish that the True Spirit might rest upon all; this would be no Prejudice to the Clergy, but a great Ease to them; this would not abate the true Respect which is due to their Persons or Functions, but rather encrease it. The Ministry is so much slighted, and the Sacred Offices thereof so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, only because there is little Communication with the Spirit of God, little Knowledge of Him or his Ways, and because generally Men favour more the things of the World, than those that are of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Finally, I do not oppose <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> because I am an Enemy to true Piety: I would promote this, as much as She, or any of her Followers. But what, shall we Lye for God? or spread Errors, to advance Piety? Every one ought to be zealous for Holiness and Piety: But this Pretext will not justifie a Cheat, nor make it lawful to impose that which is not True; nor is the Piety solid or sure, which is so gained. There are important and certain Truths, sufficient to convince and persuade Reasonable and Thinking Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and 'tis but doing disservice to Religion and Piety, to call in the Assistance of Dreams, Whimsies, and phantastical Delusions: The mixture of these raises a Suspicion, and renders the Wary even jealous of what cannot be denied. The Judgment of those who pretend to Sence, and more Knowledge, will sway the ignorant Mobb, who are never at the pains to Think. The prevalency of Atheistical Opinions, at present,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105767:5"/>
proceeds from the favourable reception which they are believed to have amongst some Knowing Persons, who yet never examin'd them throughly. And as the Atheism of these Parts has been derived from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> so it had its Original there, by Preaching up so much the Fables of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the ridiculous Stories of the <hi>Bon Dieu,</hi> the <hi>Legends</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> Saint <hi>Teresa, Mary Magdalen</hi> of <hi>Puloczi,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis, Loyala, Xavier,</hi> and other Ancient and Modern Saints, instead of those Certain and most Instructive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are set down in Holy Scripture. These Delusions can be currant only for some time, or with the very Credulous; and when they are detected, they do all the mischief, which the Devil, who first suggested them, did intend: that is, they shake Mens Faith, and fill their Minds with Doubts about Religion; seeing those who teach it, while they pretend to be Infallible, take occasion to teach and advance such things as could come only into the Heads of Knaves or Fools.</p>
            <p>The Devil certainly is a great Enemy to Piety: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> the Pretext of it, has been as serviceable to him, as any other Stratagem. He, as an Usurper upon the Kingdom of Christ, who has form'd a Design of wresting it out of the hands of its Rightful and Lawful Lord; I say, as such, he dissembles mightily, he insinuates himself with Persons of all Humours and Interests, and deludes the Serious and Well-meaning, with Promises and Expectations, and high Pretences of Publick Good; he pretends Piety and Religion, but it's to usher in Rebellion and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, a Contradiction to some positive Article, or express Precept, something or other which breaks the Chain of Faith, and interrupts that Universal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105767:6"/>
Respect which is due to God's Word and Commands. If the Devil shewed himself always bare-fac'd, or held up his Cloven-Feet, People would be afraid of him, few would be so hardy as to entertain him: but therefore he transforms himself into an Angel of Light, that his Cunning and Cheat may be the less suspected. So his Agents and Ministers put on Sheeps Cloathing, when they are sent out to devour; and he and they both have their aim, if their Arts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail but so far, as to hinder a hearty assent to, and compliance with any particular positively required. If any join issue here, he allows him to show as much Zeal as he pleases in other Matters; and the more Zeal, the better for his purpose; because nothing can be a better Blind to keep either the Person himself, or others, from discerning his crime, and dangerous state; how that from henceforth both the Character and Privilege of a faithful Disciple is forfeited, according to those certain and unchangeable Maxims,<note place="margin">Joh. xv.14.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do</hi> whatsoever <hi>I command you:</hi> And, <hi>Whosoever shall keep the whole law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. ii.10.</note> 
               <hi>and yet offend in</hi> one point, <hi>he is guilty of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

It is impossible that this Coin can come from the Devil's Mint. The Spirit of God only can be the Author of true and perfect Piety: I do not mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to degrees, but which is not lame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, which wants nothing to render it compleat, which has all the requisite parts and proportions, and an universal conformity to the Mind and Will of God.

Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Wickedness is not always joined to monstrous Opinions: The Authors and Maintainers of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies, are not always guilty of gross Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities. If <hi>Vaninus</hi> had conceal'd his Atheism, his Enemies could not have accused him. <hi>Tertullian</hi> was deceived by <hi>Montanus</hi>'s prosess'd Austerity, as well as by the pretended Revelations of <hi>Maximilla</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> the two Women he carry'd about with him. The <hi>Messaliani,</hi> or <hi>Euchitae,</hi> were otherwise very innocent. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us of one <hi>Hieracas</hi> a Physician of <hi>Leontopolis,</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who was both a learned Man, and very mortified to the World, he neither ate Flesh, nor drank Wine, and seemed in all things very Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary; and yet this very Person did pervert the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine very much, and did propagate very dangerous Sentiments, which corrupted the minds

There be few even wicked Men, who have not some commendable Qualities; and there are few Hereticks who do not hold some certain and profitable Doctrines. But as a few good Qualities cannot excuse a general Course of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so some few good Doctrines must not abate our Zeal against such impious and dangerous Tenets as may be mixed with them.

I know it is the Principle of some <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> to stretch out the Right-Hand of Fellowship to all Parties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions; for they think Errours and Mistakes of the Judgment very innocent: The Condition of their Communion is Comprehension and Morality; and to shew their Moderation, they can plead the Defence of a <hi>Bury,</hi> when he strips the Gospel naked of its Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, out of a pretext to take off the foreign Cloaths and disagreeable Dress which others have put upon it; and that they may not scare <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> from the Church, while they throw out all distingishing Creeds; so while in the Pulpit they look upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at a distance only, and talk authoritatively from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105767:7"/>
               <hi>Epictetus, Seneca, Hierocles,</hi> and other Natural Men. They should be drawn in the Centre of a Circle, which contains Jews, Pagans, Mahumetans, and all without the Church, and all the several Sects which pretend to belong to it, only the Papist should be but half in; for it is not popular to make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt him and others. I wish these Church-Levellers would consider, that as there is a Dwarfish Littleness, so there is a monstrous Latitude-Moderation, as all other Vertues have their Limits and Extreams on both sides, within which they should be kept, and without which they lose their Name. The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is praised for not <hi>bearing them which are evil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2.2.6.</note> for trying them who say, <hi>they are Apostles and are not,</hi> for discovering <hi>them to be Liars,</hi> and for <hi>hating the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans:</hi>

            <p>The growth of Sects and Heresies has been very much furthered by an indiscreet Moderation towards them, upon the Account that those who followed them, either were generally esteemed Innocent, or held something that was good. If it had not been for this, neither <hi>Socinians</hi> nor <hi>Quakers</hi> would have spread so much, nor their damnable Doctrines taken such root. Moderation and Charity are good, but God never required them to encourage Error and Wickedness; nor yet to indulge Mens perverting the Faith, and contradicting the Infallible Declarations of his Holy Word.</p>
            <p>By this it may be perceived whence my Zeal against <hi>Bourignianism</hi> ariseth. I have no personal Prejudice against the Author of this Sect, nor any of her Followers. I have all the good Will and good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105767:8"/>
Wishes for them all, which Christian Charity can suggest, and besides a particular Kindness for some: but as there are some good Things in the Writings of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> so there be other Things very bad; she advanceth some Things of pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and the whole Scheme of her Principles have in my Judgment a tendency contrary to the Christian Constitution, which I think my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to discover. It's true, I do not pretend to be infallible, but I will leave it to any indifferent Reader to judge, whether I be mistaken here, and whether I do this Woman and her Party any Injustice.</p>

I understood this Passage according to their own meaning, and published it only to show that the Author plac'd her in the highest rank of Prophets, payed her the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that was wont to be given to <hi>Samuel, Isaiah, Huldah,</hi> and others, who had Power with God; and was very much displeas'd that none ask'd her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession with the Almighty, for preventing those Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judgments which were threatned and deserved. I did not apprehend that any would have interpreted me otherways, nor is there need to set my Invention on work to fix Absurdities upon them that do. I could have produc'd an Hundred more Instances, if I had not shunned being tedious. It's true, the Translation is a little close and literal, because I stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to deliver their Sentiments in their own words,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105767:8"/>
as much as possible: And if there was any Mistake here, it is a small one, and the taking notice of this so narrowly, is a proof of my Truth and Candour in other particulars; for <hi>omnis Exceptio firmat in non Exceptis.</hi>

            <p>Again, It is laid to my Charge that I am like to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> a Painter, who designing an Ugly Face, gives it a squint Eye, a crooked Nose, a big Tooth, and such like Deformities; in as much as intending a malicious Representation of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> and her Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I pass by what is good in her or them, and only pick up here and there such things as may serve to this purpose.</p>
            <p>May it not be a proper Answer to this, to say that he or she who has a very Ugly Face should not tempt a Painter to draw it: and if it must be done, it ought to be done Like, otherwise there is a Cheat put upon all who see it. The <hi>Italians</hi> are in Love with fine Pictures, and are not Curious what resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance they bear to the Original: But here it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to have a true Picture, an Exact and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Representation of the Person; and if such shew any Deformity, who can help it? The Painter is not to blame.</p>
            <p>I have not given any Instances, but such as are true, nor shall any Provocation tempt me to do it: and if telling the Truth diminish the Character of <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> those who have doted upon her, as a most perfect Beauty, and who have in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies magnified her as incomparable and above any thing in Nature; those, I say, may readily fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some Censures, but I am innocent. When vain Women come to have their Pictures drawn, they desire the Painter to draw it very like, and only to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105767:9"/>
do them Justice; which he knows is a plain Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he should add some stroaks of his Art and Skill, and so to order it, that their Natural Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes may be shadowed. They would have me to do so with <hi>Madamoiselle Bourignon</hi>; but I crave their Pardon: This doth not answer my Design, which is to shew her, not according to their Fancy, but as she is; and their Complaints are only as those against a Painter, for coming too near to the Original, and for representing Nature a little too much. It is strange to see how much some love to be Cheated, and how much the Truth offends them.</p>
            <p>As according to the Poets, there was once a Contest betwixt <hi>Three Goddesses</hi> about their Beauty; so now there is a Debate whether <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> is to be preferred to all the Learned World; to Fathers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles; and we would have this Debate decided, not by some partial <hi>Paris</hi> that is Bribed, but by a serious Consideration of the Truth, of which every one may be Judge. Wherefore the giving Instances which are incompatible with such Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are Pleaded, is not Malicious, but Just and Necessary.</p>

The setting up new Names and Authorities, and the pressing zealously the particular Opinions of Men, whether true or false, and the proposing plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Truths, as Private Doctrines, is a great Service to the Devil and his Interest.

They who fall into this Error, are more conversant with the particular Authors they are besotted with, than with Jesus Christ; and their Minds are more intent upon their Writings, than upon the Sacred Scripture. Whereas we should consider the Truth as it is in Jesus only, and not contend for <hi>Paul, Apollo, Cephas,</hi> or any other, so as to dishonour Christ, and forget his Authority.

Fact should be nakedly delivered, without the byass'd Sentiments of the Relater. As there is either a Real or a fancied Defect of Natural Beauty, where Paint and Patching is used; so pure Truth is wanting where Fancy is studied, where big swelling words are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, where every Circumstance is exaggerated, and no Consequence left to the Reader's Judgment, but all positively dictated, and magisterially imposed, not to perswade and convince, but to ensnare the unwary, and to obtrude upon them what might be rejected, if fairly offered.

            <p>Wherefore whatever honour is due to <hi>Madamoiselle Bourignon,</hi> whether she ought to be received as a new Light, as the Organ of the Holy Ghost, as the Great Restorer of the Church, as the last and highest Gift of God to Mankind, sent to perfect the Redemption begun by Jesus Christ, of whom he was a Type and Figure, whether she be greater or equal, or how far a just Comparison may be made betwixt him and her, whatever be in this, certainly <hi>Messieurs de Cort</hi> and <hi>Poiret,</hi> her two great Evangelists, from whom the Rest copy, are not to be compared to his, nor near so worthy of Credit: and yet it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, why the last and greatest Manifestation of Wisdom, Goodness and Mercy, should not be as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly Attested as the former, and as free of Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Abstracting from their miraculous Gifts, the Candour and Simplicity of the Sacred Penmen are so convincingly visible, that none but very perverse

Persons will question their Veracity. 'Tis true, they were as much in the Interest of Jesus as could be, nor was it possible to be more zealous to have others into it; yet, like faithful and impartial Witnesses, they deliver Matters of Fact nakedly, and set down that which may seem to disgust, as well as what is pleasing; that Jesus Christ may be received, not upon their Authority, nor by virtue of enticing Words, and subtle Reasoning, but by the natural and undeniable Consequence of those things which they relate as Eye and Ear-witnesses. Whereas the Spirit and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>De Cort</hi> and <hi>Poiret</hi> are quite contrary, and therefore their Credit is too weak to sustain so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Character as is raised by them to <hi>Madamoiselle Bourignon</hi>; and they must be very credulous, who, upon their simple Authority, believe her to be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily Inspired and Dignified.</p>
            <p>This was all I aim'd at, in that <hi>First Narrative</hi>: I purposed only in it to prove, That their Judgments are not Infallible, and far from being a competent Evidence of, so weighty Matters; and without great vanity, I may be allowed to say, That at least a second reading will convince those who are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced.

Where Prejudices have entred and taken possession, it is hard for Reason to force its way: and yet we must not give over the attempts. If Physick do not perfect the Cure at first, it must be renewed; and there is ground for Hopes, if once the malignant Humours be loosened from their seat, and set in motion: which may be, and often is done by other Remedies than those they call proper Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks; for commonly these are not applied, until the Body be first prepared. So I intended the <hi>First Narrative,</hi> only as a Preparation to the main Cure; and whether that be well or ill done, it may be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, if it has but this effect, to shake a little the lazy and unreasonable Credulity of the <hi>Bourignianists,</hi> and if it does but put them upon the Enquiry into the truth of such important Matters as they have over-hastily believed. I expect this at least, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Persons are truly irrecoverable; no cure can be wrought, unless they will think, and consider: and if once they do it, I doubt not the success. For as the Devil flees, when he is resisted; so Errour, which comes from him, loses ground, when it is enquired into; neither of them can endure a Tryal: this is the peculiar property of Truth.

               <hi>The State of the Philadelphian Society.</hi> He is offended with a Passage of my <hi>Preface,</hi> which insinuates, That the Refutation of <hi>Bourignianism,</hi> will overturn the Principles and Practices of our <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians,</hi> as well as the <hi>Quietists</hi> and <hi>Pietists abroad, because they are of the same kidney, and do all stand upon the same foundation.</hi> And I still think that I had good reason to say so, because some Sentiments and Practices are common to all the Enthusiastick Tribe; and whatever particular Differences there are amongst them, they nevertheless flow all from the same Cause and Source: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. An intolerable Pride, That they have the Spirit, more than others; That all their Fancies and Conceits are of God. And 2. Either a total Contempt and Disregard of the Scripture, or a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling it with their own private and particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; so that it must either speak as they do, or have no Force and Authority. Now that which is a good Antidote against these two Evils, may be esteem'd a <hi>Catholicon</hi> for all the Distempers of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm, whatever Names and Distinctions they go under.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>Omne simile claudicat</hi>; and indeed, I do not see how his is in anywise pat to the purpose: <hi>Sure I am</hi> (saith he) <hi>That our</hi> Church of England-men <hi>and</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>as well as the</hi> Unitarians <hi>and</hi> Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians <hi>abroad, are not so very easily to be wounded all by one Blow, though they pretend to stand all upon the same Foundation, and do resolve the Principles of their Faith according to the same Rule.</hi> For as sure as he is, I am very much persuaded, and I believe so are you, that he is mistaken; for they do not stand upon the same Foundation, nor have they the same Rule for resolving their Faith. The <hi>Church of England,</hi> and those of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105767:13"/>
Episcopal Persuasion, you know, defend Episcopacy by, 1. Its being more proper to preserve the Order and Unity of the Church, even in the Judgment of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> the great Patron of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as they imagine. 2. The Universal Practice of the Church, which was never introduc'd by any Council, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority. 3. The Practice of the Apostles, which is above all Humane Authority. 4. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Oeconomy, which was estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by God himself, and which, by the Example of Christ, and the frequent Reasoning of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was to be the Rule and measure even under the Gospel, as to all things suitable to the Nature and Ends of the same. Now how can this Foundation be shaken by the proper Arguments against <hi>Presbytery</hi>? As, 1. The Confusion of Parity. 2. The Novelty of its Constitution: 3. Which was introduc'd and occasion'd by the Necessity of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Circumstances. And, 4. The Unsufficiency of his Authority, when laid in the balance with that of the Catholick Church, and the undeniable Instances of the Apostles. Those of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Communion cannot fall with the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> unless the <hi>Quaker</hi> can effectually prove that there is no setled Ministry; and the <hi>Libertine,</hi> that there ought to be no Government; and the <hi>Erastian,</hi> that Religion and the Church are and ought to be entirely subjected to the Prince and Civil State; that their Will and Humour are as much to be regarded as the Practice of the Apostles, the Example of Christ, Reason, or Divine Institution. If Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi>'s famous Sermon, and Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s late Book, can be shewed as undoubted Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both the <hi>Church of England</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105767:14"/>
may put up their Papers, and lay their Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Mouths; and so may both <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, those who hold a <hi>Trinity,</hi> build their Faith upon the Authority, Certainty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity of the Revelation of the Scripture; constant Tradition, which gives this, with other Articles, as <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> by Christ and the Apostles; the weakness of Humane Reason, to comprehend all Mysteries, and particularly the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nature of God; and the unreasonableness of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing an assent to a plain Revelation, only because the Subject is above our reach, when there are many things in Nature which we are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though their Consistency is an hidden and unintelligible Mystery. But these are things which <hi>Unitarians</hi> will not yield; they refuse this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and build upon a particular one, which may be overturned, while the other stands sure. Indeed, both <hi>Trinitarians</hi> and <hi>Unitarians</hi> would be thrown to the ground, if the Doubts of <hi>Deists</hi> could be turned into indubitable Proofs, that there never was any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all; or the Atheists Quibbles and Witticisms could be changed into solid, irrefragrable Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that there is no God. And at this rate there may be, with as great likelyhood, <hi>one Comprehensive Blow</hi> given to all the several Disputes amongst Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by advancing Sceptical Arguments, that there is no Certainty at all; that it is doubtful whether Men, as well as Brutes, may not be meer <hi>Automata,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sense, Reason or Perception; that it cannot be known when they are asleep, or when awake, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not always dream, when they think
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105767:14"/>
they see clearly. If there be no other Life, no State after this, we and the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> both trouble our selves to no purpose: And yet he must be very ignorant of our Principles, who would say, that we resolve our Faith alike: or that the proving them guilty of gross Delusions, does also prove, that we have no sure, fixed, or sufficient Rule to walk by.</p>
            <p>I cannot chuse but laugh, when I see him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to abate Mens Reasonable abhorrency of a private deluding Spirit, by calling it <hi>the Principle of Internal Light</hi>; as if soft and new Names could change the nature of old, ugly Diseases. Nor is it less ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, how he shuffles off the Imputation of <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Impostures and Delusions</hi> from his Party, and others of the <hi>same kidney,</hi> by saying, <hi>That none have written better, or with more perspicuity and solidity against</hi> these, <hi>than they who have possessed this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>: as if it was impossible or unheard of, for one to be deluded, and yet not to be sensible of it; or to exclaim against a thing, of which he himself is as guilty as any: And I do not mean the Exclamations of gross, designing Hypocrites; as when a Rogue holds up his Hands, and cries out, <hi>Villany! Villany!</hi> or like that notorious Whore, Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange</hi> some where speaks of, who had always in her mouth, <hi>O the Impudence of Women now a-days!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems that this Author did never walk about <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> where he might have seen some who very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong'd to the House, laughing and bemoaning the Madness of others that were shut up there. <hi>Burton</hi> wrote a large <hi>Folio</hi> upon Melancholy, and yet, they say, he was Hypocondriack as much and as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as any. Monsieur <hi>Iurien</hi> cautions against
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105767:15"/>
False Prophets, and yet none can deny now, but that he ought to be listed amongst them, having with a witness come short of his peremptory Prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So <hi>the profound Iuan de la Cruz</hi> (which this Author admires) may have written well against En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm, and yet, for ought I know, as much an Enthusiast as any; for I own that I have not perus'd him, having long since turn'd off the Conversation of the Mysticks. For though they, now and then, do deliver pious and useful Thoughts; yet generally their Imagination is so much heated with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of uncommon things, that they, for the most part, rave and talk extravagantly: and, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is equally useful and well-spent time, to dive into their Meaning, as to trace the Notions of a Bedlamite. Mystical Divinity contributes as little to True Religion, as Profound Metaphysicks do to the solid Use of Reason: the Chimera's and subtle Notions of the one and other, make giddy Heads fit only to be kept within the Walls of a Cloister; for if they walk abroad, they are laugh'd at, and their singular Notions and Whimsies obstruct both their Esteem and the Good which otherwise they might do.</p>
            <p>But to return to this <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> who, it seems, has a tender Respect for <hi>Madamoiselle Bourignon</hi>: He says, <hi>That he hopes to see her true Character under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by one that is neither a Friend nor an Adversary.</hi> Who, I pray, can this be? or from what part of the World must he come? Certainly he is an <hi>Utopian</hi>; and this Author is a new <hi>Hennepin,</hi> he knows Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Creatures, different from the Good and Bad both of this World and the other, who can see Good
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105767:15"/>
and Evil, without Love or Hatred, Favour or Aversion. And from whence will this wonderful Undertaker have his Instructions? All that have yet written of this Woman, are either <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Adversaries</hi>; and if he be a meer Transcriber, he is as little to be trusted as his Authors. The Character of <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> is not, according to my judgment, to be undertaken as the <hi>History of Troy,</hi> or the <hi>Battel of Pharsalia,</hi> with a perfect Indifferency whether the Conquerors or Conquered were in the Right, or which of them shewed most Valour. He that enquires into the Character and Principles of <hi>Madamoiselle Bourignon,</hi> and has a just value for important Truths, cannot chuse but be of one side or other: if he find her truly and divinely Inspired, he will and ought to be a Friend; otherwise he ought to contemn her as an Impostor, or deluded Person, and then I think he may be reckon' an <hi>Adversary</hi>: and if we can suppose him very little concern'd whether she be one or other, his Account is not much to be regarded; for then we may very well suppose that he did not take pains to know the Truth.</p>
            <p>But I believe by this Periphrasis, the Author meant an Impartial Person, which he thought a Friend or Adversary could not be; 'tis true, the Characters both of Friends and Enemies are sometimes liable to Suspicion; for the first generally over-do, and the other seldom come a just length: Love and Hatred blind the Judgment, and are like Impetuous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which commonly overflow the Banks of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Discretion. But yet it is possible, and I hope frequent, whatever this Author thinks, that both Friends and Adversaries will be just, and give a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105767:16"/>
to be relied on; nor can the Testimony of either be reasonably doubted, when it is evident that they respect Truth, and not the Persons of Men, and are moved by the Merits of the Cause, and not by Interest, or unreasonable Prejudices. If the Ingenuity of such cannot be trusted, we shall never be able to discuss <hi>Bourignianism,</hi> or any other Matter; and he is at needless trouble, when he writes and prints the Accounts, of the <hi>Philadelphian Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am of the opinion, that no body suspects the learned Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> of <hi>Mahometanism,</hi> or is so uncharitable as to think him no sincere Friend to Jesus Christ: Is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Life and Character of Mahomet</hi> to be question'd, which he has written with so much Ingenuity and Accuracy? I cannot satisfie this Man that I am his just <hi>Medium</hi> between a Friend and an Adversary; for truly, I am as yet no Friend to <hi>Madamoiselle Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon,</hi> but such an Adversary as would become a Friend if Truth could oblige me. As one was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be a Papist, if he could get over Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, but said he, <hi>it is past my belief.</hi> Once for all, I promise to be as faithful in relating <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> according to my Knowledge, as if I was a Witness upon Oath; and I shall also endeavour to judge impartially according to Truth.</p>
            <p>But, Dear Sir, I ask you Pardon for detaining you so long with my Scribble: Nor can I give Monsieur <hi>Paschal</hi>'s excuse when he wrote a long Letter, that <hi>he had no time to make it shorter</hi>; but 'tis the Custom of this Country to use little Ceremony, they are seldom at the Pains to put on fine Cloaths, but walk Abroad, give and receive Visits in their loose Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-dress: Now I treat you thus familiarly, I send
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105767:16"/>
you a careless Letter, which wants the Accuracy of those Books you are Perusing; and yet I know that you have so much Kindness and good Nature, as not to be offended, or to think your self slighted: for 'tis your Maxim to welcom your Friends heartily, whatever way they come.</p>
            <p>I hear that some worthy Friends and Acquaintance look impatiently for the following Narratives, and complain that they are not sent; therefore let me beg the favour of you, to acquaint them with what I have written for my Excuse; and to shew them that besides the hindrance from the Necessity of my Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, I have been a gathering new Materials up and down all proper places; and so soon as I have put them in order, with the things I had prepared before I left <hi>England,</hi> they shall be transmitted. But being at this distance from the Press, I cannot send my Papers to it, as before, till all be finished, lest it should be stopt too long by contrary Winds; nor can I send any without first taking Copies, lest they should Miscarry, and I be put to a second Trouble of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and consulting Books: And also, I must now write all my self, having no Amanuensis here, so that it is no wonder if my Work be tedious.</p>
            <p>If you, and my other worthy Friends, shall think it worth the while to satisfie Strangers in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by making this more Publick, I will not be against it; provided you give your self the friendly trouble of correcting the grosser Faults, which may disgust nicer Palates.</p>
            <p>I will be careful not to abuse your Friendship, but I intend to presume a little upon it, and to give you the trouble of receiving all I send from hence,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105767:17"/>
which I do submit entirely to your just Correction, both as to Matter and Expression; if before they go to the Press, you will be at the Pains to read them, with a Pen in your Hand to sit them to your own Mind, I shall have less cause to fear the Censures of others.</p>
            <p>That I may at last deliver you from my tedious Company, I wish you all Happiness, and I will be always,</p>
