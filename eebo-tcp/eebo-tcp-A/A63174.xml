            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Life, when I lay in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a third Witneſs againſt me, and then I raked up every trifle: but if I had thought it Treaſon, I would have diſcovered it before. And as to that particular Buſineſs concerning Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> that <hi>Smith</hi> ſometime ſince did come to me, being my old Acquaintance, to ask my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his Affairs, and he had then an Affair of ſo great moment, that it was neceſſary to <hi>ask my Advice in it,</hi> which was to go to the Lords in the Tower. I asked him what to do? ſaith he, I can ſay enough againſt Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> to ſerve them, and take off his Evidence, and asked me if he ſhould do it. By no means, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> ſaid I. Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> afterwards told me, this <hi>Smith,</hi> and one <hi>Phillips</hi> were willing to tell ſome Stories or other of Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and I told her this very Story; ſaith ſhe, you being acquainted with him, it is poſſible you may do ſome good upon him, and ſaith ſhe, I had as lieve as ten Guineys, that you could do it.</p>

               <p>We ought to be very careful in theſe Concerns, elſe we may do a work this day, may make all the Kingdom rue it. It is a ſad thing that People of a vitious profligate Life, both before they came to Newgate, and all along in their Life time, ſhould be fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be VVitneſſes to take away the Life of a worm.

               <speaker>L.C.J.</speaker>
               <p>He made me believe as though he would flie, I believe he is. VVe will not hood-wink our ſelves againſt ſuch a Fellow as this, that is guilty of ſo notorious Crimes. A man of Modeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath been in the Pillory, would not look a Man in the Face.

               <stage>After about half an hours ſtay, Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> returned and brought his Pardon, which was read, and the word Fellony omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in ſtead of <hi>Utlagaria Qualiacunque pro Felloniis quibuſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi>

there was only inſerted, <hi>Omnia Maleſicia &amp; Utlagaria qualiacun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> which Omiſſion had made the Pardon Defective, it being my Lord Chief Juſtice his Opinion, that the word <hi>Utlagaria</hi> did only reach to <hi>Outlawries</hi> between Party and Party, by which his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was wholly laid aſide.</stage>
