         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(good Reader) eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, and yet is
in some places (the
more is the pitye)
wher iniquitie hath
gotten the vpper
hand, that the truth
findeth few friends,
and canne euill be
heard, especially the
truth of Gods holy Worde, but so odious it is to
mens eyes and eares, (suche is the nature thereof)
as any other thing else, (be it neuer so vayne, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
or abhominable) might be muche soner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and heard, than the truth of Religion, and
the more that such wickednesse te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to deface, or
ouerthrow, the truth of Gods holy worde, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was the same welcome &amp; the more ioyously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
and embraced. So as the truth receyuing
this open iniurie (&amp; though not suppressed by al,
yet oppressed by the most) was driuen therefore to
lye close, and secretly to walke with <hi>Nichodemus</hi> by
night for feare of Iewish Christians, and in caues,
dennes, and other vnknowne places (lyke as in
the tyme of former tirranny) to haue hir conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation

naturall operation to many, and wayting in the
meane season, the appointed tyme of hir delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce.
<pb facs="tcp:9650:3"/>
And if it so chaunced hir to be seene or
heard abrode (for the candell whelued vnder the
Busshell wil burne a hole throughe, and shewe it
selfe) then straight way must she so be scaled, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and prompted, by Pollicie who must be hir

            <p>For the which cause, the authour hereof called
<hi>Celius Secundus Curio</hi> an Italian, a man surely zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and godly learned, lamenting this great and
malicious kinde of blindenesse, as a thing moste
daungerous both for bodye and soule, thought
good and his bounden duetie, (to relieue thereby
the mindes, and consciences, of suche, as not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
but for want of due knowledge, went gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in by pathes at none dayes, and to confirme
suche other in the right path way of heauenlye
truth, as had tasted some little fruite of Gods holy
spirite) to write therefore this little worke, which
about XXV. yeares since, (or there vpon) he toke
in hande and set forth, what time <hi>Paule</hi> the thirde
of that name (a man of great worldely wisedome
and admiration with christen Princes, and a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
professour of that diuellishe knowledge of
Necromancie) sate &amp; occupied Caiphas (I should
say) <hi>Peter</hi> Chaire. And so the authour following
<pb facs="tcp:9650:3"/>
in some parte, the politique councel of Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
the Apostle, (who sayeth, So that Christ be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
any maner wayes, whether it be vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note>
or sincerely, he reioyceth therein) hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the same his labour vnto the world, vnder the
pleasaunt name of <hi>Pasquine</hi> that auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Romaine,
as a fit instrument to aduaunce Gods truth, who
for his same being acquaynted with all Princes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and affaires, and for his wonted mirth and
straunge newes, coulde the better spredde abroade
the same, and cause it to be more ioyefully recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and read, than if many great Potentates and
Princes had commended it to the worlde, with
their priuilege and authoritie. As to <hi>Pasquine,</hi> and
to tell thee what he is, shall not nowe be necessarie,
for I will not holde thee with so long a discourse:
if thou can not other wise learne of him, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
thee to the booke it selfe, where thou shall
finde him fully described.</p>
            <p>But nowe me thinketh I heare some nose wise
papist, make a very vnnecessarie obiection: what
sayeth he is <hi>Pasquine</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> nowe become a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
that was wont so to be talking alwayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our holy Father and his colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals:
to whome, it may right well be answered in
this sorte, as in that he is come from <hi>Rome</hi> hither
to preach, is to fulfill the saying of Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.</note> that no
Prophete is accepted in his owne country, and
therfore cannot be heard (no more was Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his owne country men the Iewes) which is
straunge, that C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ristes messanger, comming to
Christes Vicaire (if there be any suche on earth,)
shoulde be refused of audience, bringing a true
message, but much more is it, that for declaring
<pb facs="tcp:9650:4"/>
the same, (for their soule health and saluation) he
shoulde be in daunger. But to be banished his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
for saying as he is commaunded, passeth
all law of God and men, yea and <hi>ius gentium</hi> also.
And in that some will accompt him, suche one as
wil be alwayes talking at his pleasure, I will turne
suche ouer to the Poet <hi>Horace</hi> who sayeth, <hi>Ridentem
dicere verum, quid vetat?</hi> Why should not a Iester or a
mery fellow tel truth. And if that wil not serue to
stop their blasphemous mouthes, I will bring forth
Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who sayeth,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> If he himselfe or an Angell
preach any otherwise, than the Gospell which he
preached, let him be accursed, whereby he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that the message shoulde not be the better
welcome or heard, for the messangers sake, but
the messanger for the truth, and worthinesse of the
message he bringeth, (yea, if he were a Diuell)
ought to be beleued. To the matter it selfe, I shal
referre to thy direct iudgement (so thou spoile thy
selfe in the reading therof, of all malice and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
wherein thou shalt see, vnder the wittie and
pleasaunte inuention of <hi>Pasquines</hi> going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
purgatorie, and hell, the whole packe of the
Popes pedlary wares, is opened &amp; not set to sale,
bicause men shoulde buy therof, but rather to the
shewe and brought to the touchestone of Goddes
worde to be thereby tryed and seene what maner
stuffe it is: So as all men may see, howe the Romish
Apoticaries haue so conserued, confected, and
couloured, with the drugges &amp; other the fine deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of their subtile Sophistrie, all their whole pelfe
and trumperie, as meritorious Masses, fayned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
superstitious obseruances, hypocriticall
fastings, paynted holynesse, and Sodomiticall
<pb facs="tcp:9650:4"/>
chastitie, and that with their chauntings, pypings,
gaye glistering shewes and sightes, sweete smelles
and odours, (all deuised to feede and occupie the
outwarde senses of man, and to stuffe his head and
vnderstanding with the vaine gazing, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their counterfeit Religion) so as manye
that tooke themselues to be verye nycenosed, and
coulde as they thought iudge colours, were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in their folly, and toke <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curium
sublimatum,</hi> for good and wholesome Suger.
And how this broode of smoth smiered shauelings
haue the inuentions, and dreames, of their owne
ydle and drousie braynes, sette vp to themselues
a mortall God, that mitred Monarche of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who with power and tirannie, shoulde mayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
them in a perpetuall, and flourishing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and they for their part, euen from the seliest
hedge priest, or other most simple in degree vnder
them (being greased with the Popes Oyle) euen
to the proudest, and most princelie Prelate, euery
one in his kinde to labour, and apply themselues,
with tongue and pen, or rather with tooth and
nayle (if they doe not besides, vse any other more
violent weapons) to deuise, studie, serch and vse al
the fetches possibly how they may keepe all things
vpright, and cloute vp with stable straw, and such
paltry, the ruynes, breaches, and decayes, of this
their <hi>Chaos,</hi> or confused common wealth. Thou
shalt also see, as it were by an <hi>Antithesis</hi> or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
the sacred Scriptures, set against their vayne
and fantasticall toyes and inuentions, and the
same Scriptures so aptely applyed, and truely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged,
as can not be desired to be better or more
effectually done, to the purpose. And betwene the
<pb facs="tcp:9650:5"/>
serious and fruitefull allegation of the scriptures,
and the necessary detection of their chast life and
holynesse, thou shalt finde some things (and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
not fewe in number) that thoughe the same
be no meere nor malicious inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet can they
not be iudged to be Fables, but rather matters of
truth, bicause the worlde else hath in their seuerall
places, had the tryall and experience of the same.
And histories haue also in some parte set them
forth to the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the doers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But one thing (gentle Reader) thou wilt not a
little maruell at, that their spirituall weapons,
wherewith they defend their Romish kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(I meane their owne councels, and constitutions
herein alleaged) are so brought against them
selues, and so retourned home to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and ouerthrowe, that there remayneth
now, no more spirituall defence, or resistence, but
that they lay hande on the Temporall sworde, and
vse the violent argumentes offyre, sworde, and
halter, which howe muche they haue done, in this
Realme of late dayes, that very Rome it selfe hath
abhorred. I leaue to thy iudgement, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
children in the mothers wombe, and the
louing dogges with their masters haue witnessed
the same. Thou mayest chaunce to finde this
boke (beside that it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Italian tongue)
in the Latine also, which seemeth to haue beene
done, by the authour him selfe, what tyme he saw
his laboure so well to be lyked and allowed, as he
wrote the same in the latine tongue also, for the
better edifying and calling home of the sheepe
that went a straye, and the more assured confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in the truth of Gods worde. Yet bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:9650:5"/>
this Italian copie is the larger, wherevnto is
added the voyage to Hell (which the Latine booke
hath not) I haue therefore chosen, and followed
the same, and tourned it into our tongue as nowe
thou seest.</p>
            <p>There follow in the ende therof, certayne questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
put forth by <hi>Pasquine,</hi> to be disputed (but not as
<hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>adoxes</hi>) in the Councell holden in that holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dayes, <hi>Paule</hi> the thirde, at <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein he
scorneth priuily, the great and manifolde abuses
of the Churchmen, aswell of the proude Prelates,
as the single soled sir Iohns, the fat bellyed monks,
&amp; lying Fryers, their false allegations of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
their idlenesse, their pride, their voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
tiranny, hipocrisie, wyuelesse but not
womanlesse chastitie, and other their endlesse, and
abhominable doings, the which articles maye, (as
it were in a briefe) comprehende the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the booke afore going, and shewe forth
the spirituall fruites that spring of that Religion.
So as to conclude, gentle Reader, you may see, and
finde, that there is no matter of controuersie,
wherein the papistes differ from the true Church
of Christ, (and the heauenly doctrine taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and since by the Patriarches, Prophetes, and
Apostles) as in their purgatorie, their iustifying
workes, their corporall presence of Christ in the
Sacrament, their transubstantiacion, adoration,
&amp; al the rest of their new found learning, but that
the same all, and euery of them are quite defaced,
and ouerthrowen by the manifest worde of God.
Thou canst therefore desire no more to the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
and confirmation of thy conscience in the
truth, or otherwise to satisfie thy minde, with the
<pb facs="tcp:9650:6"/>
detection of popery, and the merie and pleasaunt
disposing of the matter: so as whether thy profite,
or pleasure shal be most, I know not, and therfore
will not take vpon me to iudge. This shall I one-desire
thee, to reade with iudgement, and lay aside
all affection and malice, (both which are partiall
Iudges,) and so to walke directly throughe the
whole worke, whereby thou mayest discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
the truth and falshode, to thy edifying and
comfort, so shal I think my labour &amp; trauaile thus
to translate it for thee, well bestowed, and shall
sende thee to the booke to heare what he
sayeth himselfe, from the which
I thought good with no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Preface to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
thee.</p>

            <l>IF he that wrights a worke at first, doth merit fame:</l>
            <l>I déeme him worthy of no lesse, that doth translate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same.</l>
            <l>For as the first (by toyle) doth vtter things vnknowne:</l>
            <l>The seconde doeth from forrein speach declare them in his (owne.</l>
            <l>The sequele sheweth a proufe, of skilfull Authour plaine,</l>
            <l>And of Translatour skilfull that to wright it toke such paine.</l>
            <l>If pleasure thou possesse, or profite thereby take:</l>
            <l>They haue the summe of their desire that pende it for thy sake.</l>
            <l>But though thou séeme to want of that thou wish at furst:</l>
            <l>Reade once againe with good aduise before thou iudge the wurst.</l>
            <l>Lay loue and hate aside, affection put to flight:</l>
            <l>So shalt thou iudge as Iustice wils, so shall thy dome be right.</l>
            <l>Remember <hi>Midas</hi> eares were framed lyke an asse,</l>
            <l>Bicause he sayde that <hi>Pan</hi> in skill <hi>Apollo</hi> farre did passe.</l>
            <l>So if thou shalt preferre some trifle more than truth:</l>
            <l>Thou shalt deserue (as <hi>Midas</hi> did) the Asse his eares forsouth.</l>
            <l>For learned was the man, that first the booke did frame:</l>
            <l>And learned he (I promise thée) that did translate the same.</l>
            <l>And learned is their worke, and honest too their fact,</l>
            <l>And honest men will honestly allowe eche honest act.</l>
            <l>But those that néedes will storme, and wot not well wherefore,</l>
            <l>Must néedes haue parte of that rewarde which is rehearst before:</l>
            <l>Which if thou will auoyde, as I would wish to shunne.</l>
            <l>Doe iudge with good aduised skill, and thus my tale is done.</l>

into this stone, &amp; when my houre was come, that
I should be transforned into this stone, bycause I had
bene such maner of man, and hauing a Frier at mine
eare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tempted me thereto, I bequeathed by my Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
somewhat for Masses to be sayd for my soule.
Mine heyres at a certaine tyme afterwarde, hauing
perceiued y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I was from Purgatory,<note place="margin">The opinion of Pythagoras was, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mans soule departed from his body, it en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred into the next body that it met, were it of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or beast.</note> (as they thought
after <hi>Pythagoras</hi> opinion) become thus a stone, and
séeing therefore, that I had no more nede of Masses,
they asked ofte tymes of the parishe Priest, howe long
those Masses shoulde continue, who aunswered, that
they muste yet still be sayde, bycause they knewe not,
whether I were in purgatory or in Paradise, they said
they woulde beleue the best, and that so many yeares
now being passed, and that Mayster <hi>Pasquine</hi> was a
good honest soule, and then being a drye bodye as he
was they could not beleue, that he could so long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the fire. The good Parson in this point put
them out of doubt: be it as be may (quoth he) we will
say our Masses, and we will haue your mony. And yet
mine heires alleaged that I was not in Purgatory,
but that I was become a stone, and that I did make
and write as I did before. Tushe (quoth he in the end)
that is no matter to me, these be my rentes. Thou
that art a Canonist, oughtest to knowe, that this is a
donation for the respect of death, made with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition,
<pb facs="tcp:9650:30"/>
that if <hi>Pasquine</hi> dye, the Priest should haue this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to say Masses for his soule, so long as till he come
out of Purgatory. For this donation is as it were
the vse of a profite limitted, with condition of a thing
to come. If this now that is in this condition can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be knowen, neyther by the dead mans heires, nor
by the priest, (for no deade man hath at any time come
backe againe hither) what nedeth it therefore, to giue

into purgatory. And this it is to hope the best. What
a crueltie is this of our shepeheards, who haue so euil
an hope of our saluation, that they rather beleue we
be stil in purgatory than in heauen: Alas this is euen
a token that they know before hand, that the doctrine
taught vs by them, is not able to bring vs to heauen.

haue a husband, &amp; would before haue had him, but that
the Aungell of the Lorde declared to hir that high and

And if thou wilt sée this more clerelye, loke that place

who shoulde be greatest in the kingdome of heauen.

the olde Testament, that infinite Patriarkes and

               <speaker>Marforius.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and I thought that for this cause they had bene
called confessours. For of this confession I think our

haue at any tyme bene so foolishe, that they thought
that an Oxe was God? and notwithstanding that
there was no maner of resemblaunce in the worlde,
betwene an Oxe and God, they conceyued (for al that)
God in their imagination, through the Image of that

this is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> subtile <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> of <hi>Thomas Aquine,</hi> that

&amp; therfore is there not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Apostles egall with

But concerning the true number of the Apostles,
know thou, that they are taken in two sortes. Apostle
is as much to say,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> as a messanger, Ambassadour, or
one that carieth glad tidings. And so Paule doth call
<hi>Epaphroditus</hi> an Apostle, whome the Philippians
haue sent vnto him. But proprely those twelue are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
Apostles,<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> whome Christ our king and God
sent in the beginning to beare his gospel through the
whole worlde. But speaking of Paule,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. Paule a true and faithefull Apostle.</note>
it is not to be

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9650:54"/>
Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> for euen as those twelue, (of which number <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>

<hi>Matthie,</hi> by diuine inspiration) were chosen
by Christ, being then mortall: euen so by the same
Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> being since immortal and glorious, was Paul
called to the office of the Apostleship. Wherefore the
Apostles were verely .xiij.<note place="margin">xiij Apostles and not xij.</note> and not .xij. except they wyll
take those twelue onely that were chosen by Christ, all
after one maner, and <hi>Matthie</hi> as chosen by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

               <p>I wyll tell

            <sp>
               <speaker>Marforius.</speaker>
               <p>That was well done, but then it behoued

               <speaker>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not inough that they haue followed him,<note place="margin">The order of Cardinalles more abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable than honorable.

               <p>But
bycause there hath not bene one honest man at any

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pasquine.</speaker>
               <p>Howe wilt thou that they should be honest, if in their

him?</p>

ouerthrowen, if thou wilt thinke, that neyther the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,

                  <hi>by the offering

But these mates calling their Masse a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

The which howe great an offence,<note place="margin">The great blasphemie of the Popishe Priestes.</note> howe great a

all godly men doe knowe, and not onely do they this

will séeme to be more rich than God, sith they say, that
they giue that, whiche they receyue, or rather that
they might receiue, if they beleued the holy scriptures.
But the matter is far otherwise, for they neyther giue
nor receyue nothing,<note place="margin">The Priestes say they giue Christe.</note> they giue not, for no man can
giue that he hath not, and that they haue not Christ, by

full of Gold and siluer in déede, which the Alchimistes
haue not. And to say more, in the heart of the Pallace
in a highe seate sate a Quéene, of a duskishe coloure,

               <speaker>Pasquine.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but the
cause is, that these Saintes doubt lest if there shoulde
be a counsell called in earth, there shoulde somewhat
be done in it, that might not wel please them: but in
their counsell,<note place="margin">The scope and end of their counsell.</note> there is no daunger at all for them, for

true in déede that in the olde tyme,<note place="margin">Why in olde tyme so many counsels were so easily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> counselles were

Moreouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word being saued by Christ, nedes must
it be that he which beleueth, haue a life without pain,
and he that beleueth in him is not iudged. But if he

the which can not be to him that beleueth. For
Saint Paule sayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that there is no condempnation
to him that beleueth in Iesus Christ. And Christ hym

sinned,<note place="margin">An obiection of the papistes</note> and his sinnes were forgiuen concerning the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pasquine.</speaker>
               <p>And I tell thée, that God eyther pardoneth
all or else nothing, for he that forgiueth the greater,
will not stricke to forgiue the lesser, it is a more matter
to forgiue the offence, than the punishment. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he forgiue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> offence,<note place="margin">To what ende we are left in troubles.</note> he reserueth not the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But to kéepe vs vnder, here in this world, and
to exercise vs in pacience, and to make vs knowe his
mighty power, he leaueth vs ofte tymes in troubles,
so doth he also those that haue not offended, as we sée
in Iob, and Ieremy, and many others. For as Saint
Paule sayeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> Tribulation bringeth forth Patience,
and patience bringeth forth proufe, proufe bringeth
forth hope, and hope is not confounded. And euen so
albeit God had forgiuen Dauid, both the offence and
the punishment,<note place="margin">Dauid an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> yet woulde he bring him lowe, and
try him, that the worlde might knowe, howe full of
fayth he was. The punishment therefore is not it,
that purgeth our sinnes, but faith, the which Saint
Paule sayeth, is the purging of sinnes. And so if they
will haue anye other purgatorie, than the bloude of
Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> it is none other, but to make his passion of
none effect,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.</note> and to saye that his workes are vnperfect.
This is plaine,<note place="margin">To affirme purgatorie is to denie Christes bloud.</note> that al the elect are members of Christ
and if they be his members, it followeth, that his
vertue, and the infinite merits of his passion be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vnto them, whereby they are assoyled from all
punishment,<note place="margin">Gala. 2.</note> and consequently from purgatorie. And
Saint Iohn sayeth.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> That they that beleue in Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:9650:94"/>
are the Sonnes of God, and heyres of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce

               <p>That of Saint Mathew, where Christ sayth. <hi>That the

tenne thousande Talents. &amp;c. And the Lorde vvas

               <p>This text is so cleare, that it is not
possible otherwise to be vnderstanded, than according
to the matter that Christ speaketh of. And if it were
possible to giue this place anye other interpretation,
yet is it most impossible to interprete it for Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.
Consider a little, wherefore Christ vseth thys si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude:
He sayth, <hi>Thou euill seruaunt, haue not I
forgiuen thee all the debt thou oughtest me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note>

haue had compassion on thy fellovv, and shovv mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

therefore hath none other meaning, but to exhorte vs
to forgiue one another, if we wil that god forgiue vs,
and meaneth nothing of Purgatory, nor of no suche
foolish toyes.</p>

open to thée the whole.<note place="margin">Psal. 17. 73. 90. 103.</note> But I will tell thée brieflye as
the tyme will serue. The Dragon as thou hast heard,
is the Diuell:<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> he is redde, through the bloud of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
for he was euer a murtherer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning.
The seauen heads he hath,<note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</note> are seauen sundry beasts,
whose nature they signifie. By y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> crowne &amp; Diademes,
are ment the Kings and Princes, that are the Diuels
ministers, to kil and persecute such as defende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> honor
and glorye of Iesus Christ: the number determinate,
signifieth the multitude: the taile signifieth his folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
and Ministers, through whose labour and dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
he draweth vnto him so many wicked persons.
<pb facs="tcp:9650:103"/>
The beast, that standeth by him, is (as I haue told thée)
the Pope,<note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beast.</note> his confiderate and good Minister. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
heades are seuen hilles of <hi>Rome,</hi> where his seate
is, the hornes and Crownes, are the Kings, and great
Lordes, that for his sake and respecte, persecute the
true seruaunts of Christ, that defende the Gospel. The
Leopardes skin signifieth his vnstedfastnesse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrancie,
his Beares féete and hys Lyons mouth,
signifieth his gredinesse, his rauening, and his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the power that he hath of the Dragon, meaneth
the force and efficacye of hys deceyuing, the seate sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
his kingdome, and domynion, the power he
gaue, betokeneth the vertue to worke wonders, and
great signes: that with these thrée thinges he maye
kepe the worlde drowned in darknesse. And euen as
Christ was sente from GOD into the worlde to saue
it,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> euen so was he sent from the Diuell to destroy it.<note place="margin">Antithesis.</note>
And as Chryst sytteth in the Throne of GOD in
heauen,<note place="margin">Apo. 4.</note> euen so sitteth he in the Throne of the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
in Hell. Those therfore, that worship the Pope, &amp;
take him so, as he will be taken, &amp; follow his wayes, &amp;
confesse him for Christes Uicar,<note place="margin">Who haue the beastes marke</note> &amp; wrap themselues in
his benefices, and for his sake, kill the defendours of
the Gospell: these are they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haue the beastes marke,
and that haue committed fornication with the whore,
and all these are with the Deuill. And if thou wilt be
sure, that it is as I tell thee, read the Apocalipse, and
especially the .xiij. and .xvii. Chapters, where thou shalt
finde that he sayeth playnely, that the seate of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall be in Rome,<note place="margin">Rome the seate of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</note> saying: That, that whore is
a great city, that in Saint Iohns time had the whole
dominion ouer the kings of the earth, the which can
be none other but Rome.</p>

that in certayne olde bookes, printed long before

               <p>Ye so he did,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.</note> but Saint Iohn
did more playnely prophecie, who sayth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he that hath
worshipped the beast, and receyued hys marke, the

be tormented with fyre and brimstone, euerlastingly.
Euen as on the other part he sayeth,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> that those that

be, that they also that leade them,<note place="margin">If the blind lead the blind both fall into the dytche.</note> goe thither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

that two contraries can not stande togither. Christ

            <p>60 Whether when the same Cardinall <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
saide in a certayne writing of his to the Princes
of the Empire, that he hoped that it woulde come to
passe that the Protestaunts woulde retorne to the lap
of the church of Rome, and they likewise in a wryting

that of al men they woulde neuer doe so: whether af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde

            <p>61 Whether any ought in these dayes to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
bicause the doctrine of the Gospel séemeth to bring
dissentions and alterations, sith that Christe saith,
that the same is a singuler token and most plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of his worde,<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> which is to sende the sword,
and not peace, and to set the sonne agaynst the father,
and the daughter against the mother.</p>
            <p>

that God woulde haue our forefathers to erre vntyll
this tyme, and to be without the true doctrine, for as
much as by the same reason it may be asked, why the
same God hath suffred <hi>Africa,</hi> and all <hi>Asia,</hi> to fall into
so horrible darknesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after they lost the lighte of the
Gospell and newe doctrine brought in. For it muste
be confessed, that all that remayned after the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospell was onely in <hi>Europa</hi> the thirde
and least parte of the worlde.</p>
            <p>63 Whether such as are in these dayes put to death
in many places, be verye heritiques in dede: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
they be suche, whether they ought to be putte to
death or no, for that Christ doth expresly commaund,
that we suffer the cockle to grow with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corne, &amp; not
to roote the same vp.</p>
            <p>64 Whether the decrées of the Fathers &amp; of the
Counselles ought to be referred and examined by the
prescript rule of the gospel,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> syth Paule so plainly said,
That other foundation than that was already ought
not to be layed, &amp; yet shoulde it come to passe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

some woode.</p>
            <p>65 Whether those solepmne and ordinarie dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions
of the <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> doe any thing profite to the
vnderstanding of the holy scripture, syth they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
idle questions of vayne things, crooked, more
than supercelestiall, crabbed, and Seraphicall, the
which neither they that speake, nor those that heare
them, do at any tyme vnderstande, and albeit they do
vnderstande them, yet are they neuer a deale the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:9650:115"/>66 Whether if the Pope woulde at any tyme
suffer in a generall counsell (if any shall hereafter be)
any one article to be pulled away from him, that then
it might not be truely saide &amp; affirmed, that he is not
the Churche, forasmuche as hitherto he standeth stiffe
in defence, that the Church can not erre.</p>
            <p>67 Whether the Church, that is to saye, a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion
of people may erre, forasmuche as it is propre

for that they allege, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

syth these many yeares they haue called theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles,
not to sette forthe Christes glory, but more &amp;
more to confirme and stablish their ryches and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
syth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the scripture telleth that in the latter times
should spring horrible errors.</p>
            <p>68 Whether in matters perteyning to faith and
our Saluation, any other thing ought to be comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
beside the gospell,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 24. 61.</note> syth Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that his
onely sonne should be heade and none other. And sithe
also that Christe commaundeth vs to beware of men
and of their doctrine.</p>
            <p>69 Whether syth we plainely sée into howe fowle
stincking abhominable errours we are fallen, synce
we lefte the prescript rule of the Gospell, and opened
the way to al mans traditions: we ought not to haue
great cause, seing so many mischieues and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

that such as haue bene against it &amp; withstoode it, may

            <p>71 Whether such as will séeme to fauour the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
thereby to be thought that they know much, and

may be compared to <hi>Herode</hi> who made more consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

            <p>72 Whether that saying of the Gospell who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his soule in this worlde, shall loose it. &amp;c. may not
aptly agrée with the fyne worldly wise heads of oure
tyme, who for the doctrine of the Gospell, will not for
any little suspicion therof receiue losse or displeasure

syth they haue both strongth and rychesse, wherewith
