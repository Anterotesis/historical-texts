            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y how much they of Capua were prone, and ill
aduiſed, to reuolt from the Romans vnto <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball,</hi>
after the battaile of Cannas, by ſo much
were they more obſtinatly beſieged, ſo that being
forced for want of timely ſuccours, to yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mercy of the two Roman Conſuls, <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi>
and <hi>Quintus Fuluius,</hi> they were in the end more cruelly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
than any other rebels. The which <hi>Vibius Virius</hi> (the
ringleader, and chiefe author of the ſaid rebellion) together
with ſeuen and twentie other Senators foreſeeing, they all poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
themſelues at a banquet: The reſt of them that yeelded,
were ſent to priſon, fiue and twentie to Cally, and eight &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to Theana. Where without any commandement from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7358:5"/>
Senat or people of Rome, and eſpecially without the conſent of
<hi>Claudius: Fuluius</hi> cauſed them all to be firſt ſcourged with
rods, and afterwards to be beheaded. Wherefore a doubt was
made whether he was more righteous or rigorous in his deed.
And therefore let vs imagine, that ſhortly after the reſt of the
Capuans accuſed him, ſaying thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>As it not ſufficient graue Senators, &amp; you bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
people, that <hi>Vibius</hi> and his aſſociats the
chiefe authors and cauſe of the ſaid rebellion,
did ſacrifice themſelues vnto <hi>Fuluius</hi> his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
but that you muſt further ad therunto theſe ſeuen
and fiftie miſerable Senators? Is it poſſible that they
were all culpable? No ſurely: for ſeeing that they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to the Romane clemencie, their conſcience was a
ſure teſtimony of their innocencie. But that could not
ſaue them from the furie of <hi>Fuluius,</hi> who to excerciſe his
crueltie, hath taken from the Senat &amp; people of Rome,
the meanes as well to ſhew their pittie as their power,
not conſidering that the worthieſt part of a victorie is
to ſubdue the iuſt deſire of reuenge. Wherefore deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all authoritie, &amp; chiefely that of his Colleague and
companion of his victorie, he rather deſired to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
cruell then mercifull, and neglecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb
which ſaith, That ſomtimes man ſheweth himſelf
a God vnto man, would rather verifie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, That
man is euen a woolfe vnto man. Surely our miſerie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be great, yet ſhould it haue bene more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if it had proceeded from the Senate, or people, for
then ſhould there haue bene ſome ſhew of Iuſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
vpon by many, where now is ſeene but a reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
cruelty, thought vpon by one alone, and executed
on the ſuddaine. And ſo much more is this deed exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7358:5"/>
in as much as ordinarily we ſee many conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be held, and that of many men, to pronounce
iudgement againſt one: but alas, almoſt al our Senators
haue bene condemned euen in a moment by one man
alone (if he ought ſo to be called) who hath ſhewed
himſelfe more cruell then any furious Lion or fierce
Tigre. For he not being ſatiſfied with the ſtripes and
death of thoſe which were ſent priſoners to Theana,
tooke yet further paines to make his iourney to Cally,
to torture and behead thoſe which were there alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned:
and he not being thorowly appeaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
did ad thervnto the miſerable death of <hi>Taurea Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus</hi>
a man euen beſides himſelfe, who although that
of his own accord he offered himſelfe to abide any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
yet were his torments aggrauated the more.
All theſe acts (O Romans) are moſt lamentable, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of great compaſſion amongſt men. But yet the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
contempt which this monſtrous man hath made of
your authoritie is moſt deteſtable: For as he was in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſecond execution at Callie, when the miſerable
ſoules were not yet all bound to the ſtakes, there came
(as it were by diuine grace, and your goodnes) letters
from the Praetor and people of Rome to ſtay their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
neuertheleſſe this man his rage alone, preuailed
more than did the clemencie of all the reſt of you. But
what is this man, who preſumeth to be more wiſe, and
taketh greater authoritie vpon him, then all the other
Romanes beſides? Surely if crueltie be wiſdome, and
preſumption carrie authoritie, hee hath reaſon? But if
humanity be decent for men, and to thinke no better of
himſelfe then others, be modeſtie, he hath done amiſſe?
for hee is worſe then a beaſt that thinketh himſelfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any other man. If it were lawfull, I would faine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7358:6"/>
know what moued him, that he could not ſo much as
ſtay this laſt cruell execution? Or what hurt might
haue happened vnto the Romans therby? of whom we
are the true (though diſobedient) children, ſince here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
we freely gaue our ſelues, &amp; all we poſſeſſed into
their hands. But if ſome amongſt vs, more ambitious
then the reſt, vpon hope to command the weaker ſort,
haue yeelded themſelues vnto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> was it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
that euen thoſe who were diſpleaſed therewithall
ſhould die ſo cruelly, without being admitted not ſo
much as to ſpeake for themſelues. Alas this crueltie is
too extreame, and ſo much the more in that it was done
againſt the intention of the Senat &amp; people of Rome.
But God graunt that vnder the colour of this horrible
deed, there be not ſome ſecret hidden, more pernicious
and hurtfull vnto the Romans then euer our rebellion
was. I know (beſides the difficultie thereof) how much
all true Romane hearts doe deteſt ſuch as do aſpire to
tyrannize ouer their owne countrey, yet I may ſay that
the deeds of <hi>Fuluius</hi> doe ſhew that he aimeth at that
marke, and it may be himſelfe ſuſpecteth that ſo much is
alreadie knowne by him; which was the only cauſe why
he was vnwilling that the Capuans ſhould be ſuffered

Wherevpon ſhe complained vnto the Earle, he fained to carrie

only ſhewed crueltie vnto all theſe aboue named, but
he hath further manifeſted his ingratitude vnto his

of this countrie, and accepting him for your ſonne in

But who is ſo ignorant that will not affirme that in this
action, froward fortune hath rather beene the cauſe of
the miſcheife happened vnto this woman, than the

or the deſteny of the infant. What meant ſhe to ſtay ſo

with ſome of her goſſips, and boaſting that the Prince
had bought her fruit, as night ouertooke her before ſhe
was aware: for the prattle of a woman is oftentimes
without meaſure. But were it that the Prince his fault
were farre more manifeſt and hainous then it is, yet is
the cauſe to be iudged by none but by the king only, or
by ſuch as ſhould by his Maieſtie be deputed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

ſhould be iudge of his child then any other, becauſe
either too exceeding loue, or too extreame rage, may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrule
him: for when he is angry with thoſe whome
he loueth, his anger proueth more vehement and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

iudgement ought to be pronounced without counſell
and due informations: But what proofes was brought
againſt our prince? Where are thoſe which were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7358:9"/>
to conſult vpon iudgement, or to giue aduice that

theſe two vertues linked together, a man may put

but rather praiſed for his pietie and loue towards them
and Common-wealth. And ſuch were the Numantines
accounted for ſlaying their children, rather then they
would leaue them for ſlaues: So was <hi>Virginius</hi> who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Torquatus, Poſthumius,</hi> and diuers others who put
their owne children to death onely for the zeale they
had vnto the obſeruation of militarie diſcipline: yet
for all that not any of all theſe haue beene iudged to be
cruell or worthy of blame, but on the contrarie haue
thereby gained immortall praiſe and glorie. Likewiſe
there is no doubt at all, but that the fathers kindneſſe
ought to exceed all other loue: following the example
of our maker, who leaueth not to exerciſe his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his iuſtice: and that it is ſo, he many times
puniſheth ſinnes both in this world, and in the world
to come: moreouer we muſt not thinke any father ſo
cruell to hurt his ſonne in the little finger without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the griefe thereof himſelfe in the middeſt of his
heart, and therefore it is a meere folly to teach fathers
how they ought to loue their children, ſince nature
who is the miſtreſſe of all humane creatures inſtructeth
them therein ſufficiently: and as it is moſt certain that
princes or ſuch as rule, are aboue all others bounden
to be vertuous, and that they are conſtituted as guides
and examples for all their ſubiects to follow, ſo can it
not alſo be denied, but that ſeueritie of iuſtice is more
requiſit in them then any of the other vertues, (if ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
may be feperated) and he which will well conſider
my deed without paſſion, ſhall find all the foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7358:10"/>
vertues therein to be obſerued. For firſt of all I
haue done iuſtice in putting him to death, who was
not onely the death of an innocent, or at the leaſt the
ſame that cauſed the mother to ſuffer her child to die,
but alſo ſuch a one who defrauded a poore woman of
part of her liuing, in that he paied her not for the ſame,
which ſhe brought to ſell for her reliefe. My prudence
was ſhewed in putting him to death without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the people, and in terrifieng all others from
offending, as alſo to take from euery malefactor all
hope to eſcape iuſt puniſhment for their miſdeeds. My
temperance I declared in cauſing the offender to die
by the ſhorteſt and ſecreteſt maner of death that I could
deuiſe, thereby ridding him from the ſhame to be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
vnto many. And my fortitude was manifeſt, in
that I was able to ouercome the deſire which I had to
pardon him both the ſame and all other offences. But
in the end conſidering that the firſt princes are bound
by their examples to ſtirre vp and prouoke their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
to execute iuſtice without partialitie, I haue for
that end ſacrificed my will, together with the life of my
beſt beloued ſonne, becauſe the euill cuſtomes of the
former princes are turned into lawes by thoſe which
ſucceed them, and thoſe which are good are quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
if they be not confirmed by verie memorable
examples. Therefore <hi>Saule</hi> did not amiſſe when hee
would haue put his ſonne <hi>Ionathas</hi> to death, ſeeing law
is to be adminiſtred vnto all alike: for where exception
of perſons is reſpected, there muſt needs corruption
of iuſtice follow, which marreth all, for nothing can be
permament which is corrupted. True it is that he was
my eldeſt ſonne, but being ſuch a one as he was, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought to ſucceed me, nor yet to liue any longer:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7358:10"/>
and accuſe me no more of crueltie, ſince to puniſh an
euill doer is a deed of mercie, for pittie without iuſtice
is follie or rather iniquitie; and the greater he is that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth,
the more ſeuere puniſhment he deſerueth: For
the poore wretch, or hee which is of baſe condition,
may excuſe himſelfe by his pouertie, by want of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
by ignorance, by his lewd education, and ſuch
other like reaſons both vaine and friuolous; but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of great perſonages is to bee attributed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to pride &amp; malice. Neither is one death more
ſhamefull then another, but only that death where the
partie is made a ſpectacle to the ſtanders by: for it is
not the death, but the offence that is ſhamefull. And
therefore in executing iuſtice I cannot be tearmed cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
vnto mine owne blood or my ſonne, nor vnto your
Prince, vnto the Kings daughter, neither vnto our
children: for he not being ſuch a one as hee ought to
be, was now no more to be regarded by any of vs, but
was no better then a thiefe, and a murtherer. Who is
then ſo mad as to be called a grandfather, father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
brother, or a ſubiect to ſo vild a man? Neither muſt
theſe be the meanes to begin thoſe good ſeruices that
ought to be done vnto the crowne of France, which
was inſtitituted and preſerued hetherto by vertue. It is a
vaine thing to goe about to perſuade fathers of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
or worthineſſe of their children, ſeeing that for the
moſt part they beleeue it more then is requiſite, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
doe excuſe their faults more then they ought; of
which ſort I confeſſe my ſelfe haue beene one, ſo long
as there was any hope of amendment. I aſſure you, that
a long time was my heart moſt greeuouſly perplexed,
before I could conſent vnto the puniſhment, &amp; death
of my ſonne. But omitting all other circumſtances I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7358:11"/>
will ſhew you the reaſons which moued me to put my
ſonne to death, for the ſonnes diſcredite, muſt needes
bee the fathers diſgrace, becauſe they doe alwaies coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
their children but too much: and therefore it was
not without cauſe that the Romanes (from whence all
good lawes haue their beginning) did giue vnto fathers
all power ouer the life and death of their children,
knowing that without moſt iuſt occaſion they would
neuer put them to death. No ſonne could be more dear
vnto me then mine eldeſt, but equitie commandeth me
to loue the Common wealth better; which in no ſort
can be regarded, when he which ruleth the ſame is not
vertuous, becauſe none therein ſhould be in ſafety if
the prince were vicious. My life and death is in the
mercie of the kings Maieſtie; but to die, I would not
haue failed to doe that which I haue done, being (as we
are) mortall, and death may only be delaied, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped.
Our life alſo is not to be meaſured by our years
but by our deeds: for he hath liued long inough who
is by good men deemed moſt worthie of long life, and
he cannot die too ſoone, who ſpendeth his life in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.
Wherefore it was no reaſon that my ſonne
ſhould haue liued any longer, and I would to God that
ſo his reproch might die with him, as I wiſh my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
may liue after me. Touching iudgement, he
which gouerneth the Commonwealth, muſt needs be
iudge in the ſame. Such were the Dictators or Conſuls
amongſt the Romanes, and ſuch at this day are kings
and princes. And <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith: Happie is that countrie
where Philoſophers are kings, and kings be Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers:
whereby it appeareth, that rulers ought to bee
iudges, as you your ſelues doe confeſſe, in ſaying that
the king ought to haue iudged my ſon: which indeed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7358:11"/>
had ben reaſonable, if his Maieſtie by his prerogatiue
had not giuen me free authority in matter of iuſtice; in
ſuch ſort then as I am ſubiect to the iudgement of the
king, is my ſonne ſubiect vnto mine, and I am not to
yeeld an account of my actions vnto any other then
vnto his Maieſtie: and eſpecially becauſe the witneſſe
of a father againſt his ſonne is more ſufficient then all
other teſtimonies, according to the reaſons aboue ſaid:
and ſauing my dutie vnto his roiall maieſtie, and this
noble aſſiſtance, this is moſt falſe which you obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, touching my ladie the Counteſſe; who hath
thought me worthie to bee her husband, and the king
accepting me for his ſon inlaw, I haue euermore loued
and honored: and ſo far am I from cauſing her to bee ill
accounted of, as with the price of my life I would ſeeke
to defend and increaſe her honour, which being ſo, it
may pleaſe his highnes not to ſuffer him to be vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
who hath ſpoken ſo ſlanderouſly as thou haſt

In ſaying that I thinke my ſelfe to be inferiour vnto
her, thou doeſt therein alſo ſhew thy ignorance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Senators, he ſaid: Firſt ſuch a one muſt be killed (who was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of great authoritie) name one amongſt you who may be thought
worthy to ſucceed in his place. Then the people began to looke
one vpon another, and there was not found any that was dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſufficient to take that charge vpon him. Wherefore they
began to accuſe <hi>Pacuuius</hi> of crueltie, and in the end they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsed
that there was not men enough to be found amongſt them
worthie to be Senators, and therefore they concluded to leaue
the Senate euen as it was. Wherevpon the Senators were both
deliuered, and confirmed in their former authoritie. Yet let vs
ſuppoſe, that it happened, that one amongſt the Senat (no leſse
enuious of <hi>Pacuuius</hi> his authoritie, then ioifull that he was
ſaued by his ſubtiltie) did long time after accuſe him at Rome,
affirming that hee onely induced the people vnto this ſedition,
and that his intention was not to ſaue, but rather to ſlay the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
and began his accuſation in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ndoubtedly ſuch as ſuffer a wicked or vicious
man to liue in a citie, doe either firſt or laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

How much more then ought they to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that ſuffer ſuch men to obtaine the gouernement of
the Commonwealth, and the honors only due to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and vertuous men, who for the moſt part doe
ſhun ſuch authorities, becauſe it is a hard matter to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
ſo waightie a charge well. For ſince the weakneſſe
of man is ſuch, as euen the wiſeſt doe miſtake bad
things for good, and good things for bad, vntill the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that which afterward happeneth doth make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
know their error: How can vitious or wicked men be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe any thing that is good? Surely honours are
the true touchſtone whereby the vertue or goodneſſe
of a man is knowne: for in authority vertuous men do
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7358:13"/>
manifeſt their goodneſſe, as wicked men do lay open
their badneſſe, as <hi>Ariſtides, Epaminundus, Licurgus,</hi> and
others in all their authority did ſhew that vertue was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible:
And <hi>Periander, Piſiſtratus, Liſander</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
declared, how much ambition preuaileth ouer
ſuch as are not perfectly vertuous, whoſe example <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuuius</hi>
was deſirous to imitate, for being born in Capua
a wicked man, and ſeeing that he was there in ſuch ſort
ſuffered to remaine, he durſt wel make claime vnto dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and obtaining the ſame did afterwards aſpire to
be tyrant. For by how much they which are vnworthie
of authoritie, and yet doe attaine there vnto, by ſo
much the more doth their inſolencie thereby increaſe;
and that in ſuch ſort, as they not only doe preſume the
ſame to be due vnto them, but alſo that there is no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
great inough for them, and therefore ſuch
oppreſſe euen thoſe who haue moſt fauoured them,
which truly is a iuſt puniſhment which the Gods ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vpon thoſe who fauour the wicked, that euen by
the ſame themſelues are oftentimes deſtroied. And ſo is
it iuſtly fallen vpon our Senators, who knowing the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this man, haue not only permitted him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the moſt principall honors, but alſo by their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
haue ſuffered him to tiranniſe ouer the Senate
and people, euen to the danger of the liues of the ſaid
Senators; being ſo audacious as to affirme vnto them,
that he only was able to defend them from being hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in peeces by the people: and afterwards by his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
put all their liues in danger of the peoples inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.
But what had it bene if the people had reſolued
to doe that which he counſelled them vnto? what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
had he that ſuch his folly ſhould haue come vnto
a good end? Truly that was euen the leaſt of his caro,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7358:13"/>
ſeeing that it could not happen amiſſe vnto him, for if
the people ſlew the Senat, he ſhould remaine the prince
of the people, and the matter falling out as it did, hee
ſhould remaine lord of the people and Senat together,
perſuading both the one and the other, that they were
highly bound vnto him: Whervnto the Senat was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to yeeld, conſidering the authoritie which by their
fault, he had gained amongſt the people: yet this had
beene a ſmall hurt if he had beene contented that but
onely himſelfe ſhould haue beene king, but his actions
declared that he would confirme the kingdome vnto
his poſteritie by the means of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> vnto whom he
not only brought his ſonne <hi>Perolla,</hi> but himſelf did ſtay
him from the killing of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and from the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the freedome of his countrie by this his moſt
noble act. Finally this noble yong man did very well
ſhew himſelfe to be the ſonne of a Roman matron, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that noble mind of his mother: How could hee
chuſe but be greeued at the heart ſeeing that by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
words (who rather ought to haue exhorted him
therevnto) his moſt couragious purpoſe was broken
from the which this hairebraine man in all vild actions
did not only diſſuade him, but alſo conſtrained him to
giue it ouer, affirming that if he would not bee ruled by
him, he would aduertiſe <hi>Hannibal</hi> thereof, yea &amp; would
couer him with his own bodie in ſuch ſort as he ſhould
not be hurt vnleſſe <hi>Pacuuius</hi> were ſlaine. Thus he alone
did corrupt the faithfull zeale which the child ought to
the Romans and his countrie. I paſſe ouer with ſilence,
how that hee was the cauſe that <hi>Decius Magius</hi> was ſo
euilly intreated by <hi>Hanniball</hi> in the preſence of all the
Citizens, and then afterwards clogged with chaines to
be carried to Carthage, if the gods had not ſuccoured
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7358:14"/>
him better then this honourable perſon, who had ſuch
credit with <hi>Hanniball,</hi> that at his banquet was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
man at the table, and his ſonne the third, and yet
did not once excuſe, but rather moſt greeuouſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
poore <hi>Magius</hi> to haue alwaies fauored the Roman
faction. Thus hath this vnhappy man betraied his
countrie foure times. Firſt when hee put the life of the
Senators to the diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people: ſecondly, when
he cauſed Capua to reuolt from the Romanes: thirdly
when he made an agreement with <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to enter into Capua: and fourthly, when hee
kept his ſonne from killing <hi>Hanniball.</hi> He will anſwere
that he alone neither cauſed Capua to reuolt, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<hi>Hanniball,</hi> I ſay he did, for vnder the colour of his
protecting the Senate, no man durſt gainſay him in any
thing, except <hi>Magius</hi> who was puniſhed therefore. If
thoſe who (without calling any ſtranger) doe by no
ſuch execrable meanes aſpire vnto tyrannie, are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly
puniſhed, What torment then may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to bee inflicted vpon this wicked man? Who not
content to haue vſurped the gouernement, and called
in a ſtranger for his defence, did alſo by threats corrupt
the good nature of his ſonne. Remember O you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

for many good turnes, which maketh a number
fearefull to employ themſelues either for the particular
good of any, or for the the publicke benefite of many.
But the noble minds leaue not for all that to doe their

to impair my reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more doth he increaſe
my renowne. For firſt he ſaith, that I haue obtained the
chiefeſt dignities in Capua, it is then a ſigne that either
I am vertuous, or els the reſt of the Citizens that haue
aduanced me to ſuch authoritie, are al vicious: for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one fauoreth his like, &amp; repugneth his contrary. You
ſay that I thinke my ſelfe a tyrant: Where do you find
that tirants do ſuccor or ſaue the life of ſuch as pretend
to be equall with them in power: can you denie that
by mine induſtrie the Senat was ſaued? Hath not the
effect made the ſame apparent? You ſay that I brought
them in daunger, hazarding their liues to the diſcretion
of the inconſtant people, how is he brought in danger
who alreadie by his owne fault is fallen thereinto? Do
you call it a hazarding, to ſaue mens liues? If you had
knowne any other meanes more expedient, you ought
therein to haue giuen your aduiſe? But that in extream
euils extraordinary meanes ought to be vſed: So I kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the euill proceeded aſwell from the ouergreat
preſumption of the Senat, as from the inſolencie of the
people, thought to find out the fitteſt remedie: for each
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7358:15"/>
partie, perceiuing his error framed himſelfe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Thinke you before I ſeemed to make it a queſtion
whether the Senators ſhould liue or die, that I had not
firſt gained the chiefeſt of their enemies, and that I did
not know the weakneſſe of the reſt? And as touching
this point of the yeelding to <hi>Hanniball,</hi> the authors of
his receiuing they did poiſon themſelues, which taketh
away the ſuſpition that anie other was the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
How could I then be able to reſiſt <hi>Hanniball</hi> more
then you and others? True it is that I was ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in his bancket at the table, but the ſame was rather a
ſigne that he did it to win me, then that I was ſuch a one
as you tearme me to be. For the ſubtile Barbarian, did
not embrace thoſe who did already fauor him, but ſuch
as he would draw vnto him: and the better to proue
that true, my ſonne whom he knew to bee a Roman in
heart, was the third man at his banquet, whom trulie I
confeſſe I did diſſuade from killing <hi>Hanniball,</hi> becauſe it
was a thing impoſſible, being alwaies armed, enuironed
with his gard, and chiefly becauſe he euermore ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my ſonne greatly: So that the beſt that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by his raſhneſſe, would be but the death of him &amp;
manie others, and it might be the vtter ſubuerſion and
ruin of Capua. What hurt then haue I done preſeruing
ſuch a one as is moſt affectioned vnto the Romans, and
alſo in ſauing the cittie which could not faile but fall
into their hands againe: for al violent things as was the
fortune of <hi>Hannibal</hi> are of ſo long continuance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their Periode, turne vpſide downe in a moment.
Therefore in ſuch a time more wiſdome conſiſteth in
diſſimulation, then in obſtinate boaſting, as appeared in
that of <hi>Magius,</hi> which was nothing profitable vnto any
man, and beſides it was not only hurtfull to himſelfe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7358:15"/>
but alſo <hi>Hanniball</hi> did thereby know the cowardlineſſe
of the whole Senat, and Citizens of Capua, ſince that
before their faces they ſuffered one of the nobleſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, to be bound and carried away vnto his
campe. It was then that they ſhould haue reſolued or
taken occaſion to haue run altogether vpon <hi>Hanniball,</hi>
and to haue maſſacred him, as my ſelfe and ſonne were
deſirous to doe, if we had ſeene any likelihood to haue
ben ſeconded by any: but there was then no ſhow of
ſuch courage in you, &amp; the more you accuſe me to haue
brought you in bondage, the more vnworthie are you
to be beleeued. Yet if it were ſo, why did you endure it?
you will ſay for feare of the people: why could not
you win or keepe the people in obedience, as well as I?
Surely becauſe your ambition, and pride was more
great to grieue them, then was your wiſdome or polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to gouerne them. You will impute me for fauoring
more the Plebeians then Patrician faction: ſo was the

as thinke to offend me, and not looke for requitall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;

had not bewitched my fathers vnderſtanding, he could
not chuſe but haue beene very deſirous to haue left his
principalitie to ſuch a ſonne of his owne, as had made
proofe of his skill in keeping, as alſo in augmenting the

aleſt vnto their people, whome they ſhould after their
edath leaue to be guided by ſuch a one as ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their laws and rights, and which ſhould defend
them from ſuch as would offend them: wherefore not
without reaſon did <hi>Pirrhus</hi> king of the Epirotes anſwer
his children (who asked him to which of them hee
would leaue his kingdome) that he would leaue it vnto
him that ſhould haue the ſharpeſt and beſt edged ſword
amongſt them al. This valiant king did very wel know,
that ſuch realmes where the king is not held for a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour,
are alwaies moleſted by their neighbours or by

whileſt the Macedonians were vnder <hi>Philip, Alexander,</hi>

they were alwaies in proſperitie: but after <hi>Perſeus</hi> was

Durſt you be ſo preſumptious to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the cauſe why your father did forbid you to goe

knowing your indiſcretion and wauering mind would
not truſt you with ſuch a ſecret matter: How manie

vnto yong men, which old men doe foreſee to be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt

in ſtore for you whom you haue offended in this war?
Or if he who euen by your aid is become more mightie
ſhall vſe the ſame his power to your preiudice? For ſo
did the Romans, who being ſuccoured by their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derats,
did firſt vanquiſh other nations, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſubdued thoſe their confederats likewiſe: what
do you know if your father foreſaw the ſame, or a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
danger? If we are bound to beleeue old men, how
much more then ought euery one to beleeue his father,
of whom (next to God) he holdeth his life and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
And therefore they are double in fault which do
not onlie giue no credit to their words, but alſo do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
their commandements as you haue done: for if
one way you ſhall lay the fault vnto your frailtie, which
hindered you from beleeuing the truth, and ſhall ſay it
is mans nature ſo to doe; Yet your diſobedience added

How manie are there that haue put their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

be ſeene by the Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine hiſtories:
As for example; <hi>Saule</hi> the firſt King of the Hebrewes,

after his death, in reſiſting his laſt Will and teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and to his great diſhonor accuſe him with want
of wit. For leſſe fault was <hi>Cham</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noe,</hi> not
onlie diſherited, but alſo curſed of his father for euer,
yea and his poſteritie after him, who could not do with
the faults of their father and grandfather. The Romans
had not the power ouer the life and death of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
So that but for ſuch men as you, that law at this
law had not beene inuented; for from the vniuſtice and
wickedneſſe of men, do good, holy, and righteous laws
proceed: Wherefore it is a true Prouerbe, that offences
beget laws, and afterwards thoſe laws doe diſcouer and
puniſh offences: for where no fault is, there law is not
requiſit; and where no law is, there can be no breach
thereof: Wherevpon S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, That the law onlie
made me know that to deſire is ſinne. Your father did
not prohibite you from the defence of your countrie,
or the church, therefore you need not make a queſtion
of that which he did not, but of that which hee did,
which was his diſſuading you from this war, and for
the ſame cauſe hee added threatnings vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
And notwithſtanding for all this, you
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7358:19"/>
would not obey him, but it may bee the great griefe
which your father tooke for this your obſtinacie hath
procured his death: and yet you ſay (although he hath
not wholly diſherited you) that he did you wrong to
giue the principalitie vnto him, whom he knew to bee
beſt able to keepe it: ſee how farre the loue of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exceedeth all the malice that the ſonne can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:
for notwithſtanding after this your fault, hee
thought vpon your profit more then you deſerued, and
therefore he had a deſire to leaue you wherewithall to
liue like a Prince, but not the power to looſe your ſelfe
and your people: Doe you thinke the good Prince did
not know, that in the warres vices are ſooner learned
then vertues? And that you were more inclined to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
then wiſedome? For how can he be a louer of
vertue, which deſpiſeth both his father &amp; his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements?
Moreouer hee knew very well that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
whoſe Prince is accuſtomed to the wars, is neuer in
peace; and not being in peace it cannot proſper. Alſo he
ſaid, that as count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be maintained, becauſe euerie alteration or change is
dangerous, and if there come any profit thereby, it is
not in their daies to bee expected who are then liuing.
Wherefore knowing that his predeceſſors and himſelfe
had more encreaſed and conſerued their gouernement
by wiſedome, equitie, and iuſtice, then by armes, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
nothing reaſonable vnto him, to leaue for ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
ſuch a one, who only ſeeking to be counted valiant,
would forſake all vertue, which takes her beginning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the feare of God; and he which feareth him, is another
manner of man to his father, then you haue beene to
yours. Now ſince your father had all theſe reaſons on
his part, can you ſay he was not a good protector both
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7358:19"/>
of his people, and alſo of you: Likewiſe he knew that
<hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> did more conſerue and increaſe Rome
by his religion and good lawes, then <hi>Romulus</hi> did in the
building thereof by his wars: the which to ſpeak truth,
are verie neceſſarie in euerie new gouernement; but
where the people doe honour their Prince, and he is in
loue and peace with his neighbours, there warlike men
are more dangerous then defenſiue, the which we may
ſee by the Romanes, who neuer were ouercome but by
their own proper forces, alſo the ſouldiors which were
in the citie were the deſtruction of the ſame. Therfore
thoſe princes do wel, who haue the means to ſend ſuch
people to exerciſe their furie in ſtrange countries, for
armes are alwaies hurtfull in a countrie, vnleſſe it be for
the defence thereof. You ſay that becauſe you haue
beene in the warres, your neighbours and ſtrangers
will ſtand in feare of you: better were it for you to bee
beloued of them: for euerie one deſireth their death,
of whom they ſtand in dread. I would haue followed
you to the wars my ſelfe, if you had gone thether by
commandement or conſent of your father, vnto whom
it was griefe enough to bee diſobeied by his ſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
encreaſing the ſame by the like offences of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew;
for if I had followed your courſe, I ſhould haue
thought that I might haue giuen him iuſt cauſe to think
me none of his ſubiect, much leſſe his kinſman. God
graunt that this your ingratitude, cauſed him not to
doubt whether you were his ſonne or not. Touching
<hi>Pirrhus,</hi> his anſwere was as wicked as the end of his
life was wretched. And <hi>Perſeus</hi> was ouerthrowne onlie
becauſe he truſted in his forces, prouoking by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption

haue Tribuns appointed them; as if at the length the
people knowing the confuſion of their weakeneſſe,
would not by the ſame meanes haue acknowledged
their fault: for without you they would haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
that the Senat executing right and iuſtice, (as it
doth) is inuincible, as depending onlie vpon the lawes,
and the gods. O Romans, know you not that the kings
haue honoured, and in a manner ſubmitted themſelues
vnto them? And ſo long as they held that courſe, they
were like vnto the gods in honour, and proſperitie: but
after that <hi>Tarquin</hi> the prowd, would haue put downe
the Senat, he himſelfe was exiled with perpetual ſhame,

who then knowing what was needful for them, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour

they doe make themſelues intollerable, which is to bee

with paſſion, and anger againſt the accuſed (as he did
very well manifeſt, ſending to ſeeke him with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,)
he diſpaired to find anie place reſerued to heare,
much leſſe to waigh his iuſt excuſes: was there no
meanes to ſend for him after a more modeſt order? It
ſeemeth no; becauſe they would find an occaſion to do
that which was done. If the commiſſion of <hi>Seruilius</hi>
was to ſlay him? There was no need to expect anie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
courſe of law. If his authoritie were but to fetch
him, he could not kill him, without being in verie great
fault, although <hi>Spurius</hi> had beene an offender? For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

if any one attaine vnto honor; and the third ſort more
worſe then all the reſt, doe thinke that to be loſt out of
their owne goods, which they cannot wreſt foorth of
the ſubſtance of another: wherefore ſuch people are
hurtfull to all men, and worſt of all to themſelues, for
they take as little pleaſure in that which they haue of
their owne, as in that which they haue not at all: ſo that
they poſſeſſing nothing but riches, doe neuer any good
but when they die: for then is their vnprofitable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſet at libertie, and the Commonwealth is freed
from their greedie deuourings. I paſſe ouer with ſilence
that ſome doe preſume, ſeeing <hi>Seruilius</hi> triumph thorow
the cittie, with his ſword all bloody in his hand, that he
had ſome particular malice againſt him, and the more
conſtantly is it affirmed, becauſe he might as well haue
taken him as ſlaine him: others doe ſay that this blocke
was throwne in his way, to confiſcate his goods, and
they ſay that if it had been otherwiſe, all the Senat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
had more cauſe to appeaſe the people, then <hi>Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
alone; for they knowing how he was by dutie
bounden, had no occaſion to ſtand in any doubt at all
of <hi>Spurius:</hi> but it is pittie when men will not only do no
good themſelues, but alſo perſecute thoſe which do it.
God graunt that this which the people ſpeake ſo raſhly
concerning the Senat, be not very true: but as touching
<hi>Seruilius</hi> he cannot denie, ſeeing that (beſides the boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
that is made thereof) there are ſtore of witneſſes,
that he hath killed <hi>Spurius,</hi> and not one will ſay that the
other made any reſiſtance, wherefore we demaund that
iuſtice may be executed vpon him who hath beene the
cauſe that the ſame was not done vpon <hi>Spurius,</hi> if he
were culpable, and if he were not, then we require it,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7358:31"/>

prooued by the confederats of <hi>Spurius:</hi> wherefore it
belongeth to you noble citizens, that are not bounden
vnto him, and which haue not ſold your libertie for a
morcell of bread: to you I ſay it belongeth to conſider
what I haue deſerued, hauing ſlaine him, who with the
helpe of a few faint hearted fooles would captiuate
your ſweet libertie: as for that which the Tribun ſaith
of the peoples mourning againſt the Senat, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
be not the inuenter thereof, yet it is a ſigne at the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7358:32"/>

for if there were no eares that delighted in hearing
ſlanderous ſpeeches, there would be few ſlanderous
tongues: but how could I bring him aliue, ſeeing the
people do yet ſo greatly affect him, becauſe time which
changeth all thinges, hath not as yet changed their
minds, but rather increaſed the ſame. If that be true
which the Tribun doth raſhly ſay againſt the Senat? A
man may eaſily tearme <hi>Spurius</hi> another manner of man
then you ſay he is, although the crime had beene leſſe
dangerous then it is: but when the matter concerneth
the preſeruation of our libertie (ſeeing there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

And as you ſay that the Dictator is not choſen, but in
great extremitie, his election doth ſufficiently witneſſe
the extremity wherein the Commonwealth remained:
true it is, that I told him, wherein he was accuſed, to the
end that if he were guiltleſſe, he might be leſſe afraid to
appeare before the Dictator, and being guiltie, haue the
better meanes to thinke vpon his excuſe; but he had no
deſire to take the benefit of my aduertiſement, but as
one alreadie condemned by his owne conſcience, he
endeuoured to flie away, for a true ſigne, that he is a
malefactor which diſtruſteth as much in himſelfe, as in
the iudges: if he had not beene faultie, why was he ſo
fearefull? Seeing that innocencie dooth alwaies aſſure
thoſe that imbrace her: but we may ſee by him, that
Tyrannie is like vnto a faire and pleaſant pallace, that is
high enough, but yet without ſtaires or ſteps to come
downe without breaking ones necke: euen ſo thoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7358:32"/>
which by pride and ambition thinke to attain vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and profit, doe for the moſt part meet with ſhame
and confuſion: he needed not to feare that he ſhould
not haue had time and place to excuſe himſelfe, ſeeing
that there was neuer anie Citizen condemned in
Rome, if his cauſe were but only doubtful: if his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
were good in diſtributing the corne, why did he
not come to declare the ſame vnto the Dictator? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if he had beene as innocent as he was culpable, I am
not in any ſort to be blamed, ſeeing the Dictator hath
not only allowed, but alſo publickely lauded my deed.
I liſt not therefore further to diſpute of his innocencie,
or his offence, but rather the accuſer that did accuſe
him: And it appertaineth vnto the Dictator to defend
me, hauing performed my charge according to his
commandements, ſeeing that euen when I had done it,
he allowed my fact to be good: and worthie for a

he hath alwaies ſeemed to abhorre the cruelties of his
father, who being put to death by my hands, the child
hath verie conſtantly ſhowne himſelfe to be more glad
for the benefit of the Commonwealth, then ſorrie for
the death of his father, and with a great contentment
hath he left off his gorgeous apparell, and his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
delicacie, to conforme himſelfe after my will, like

lords doe you deſire the death of an innocent, which
ſheweth himſelfe ſo affectioned towards you? And
ſuch a one as may one day do you good ſeruice? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe you not as well conſider the good which he

you ſay that he is the ſonne of a Tirant, why doe you
not as well ſay that he is her ſonne that ſlew the tirant:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7358:35"/>
If you wil not loue him for my ſake, at the leaſt let your

before he haue offended: let him liue a while, and if
he commit the leaſt offence in the world puniſh him
with death: loe then the gift which I doe craue for the

that all the interpretations or gloſes of the laws, ought
rather to tend vnto clemencie then vnto rigour; and
principally when the effect thereof tendeth vnto cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for this law which ſaith, that all the kinne and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

thoſe which haue aided and aſſiſted him to exerciſe his

wherein might this poor innocent haue offended, who

then remember my lords, that he is her ſon who hath
made the zeale of her countrie ſtriue and triumph ouer

I ſhould rid him from your companie, who had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
talke with him, but of temporall matters, that he
might wholie apply his mind vnto God, and therefore
he graunted vnto euerie thing which you demaunded;

I am not to be blamed, if I had a deſire to doe this laſt

ſhrieue) did alwaies inioine me to doe whatſoeuer my
father and mother commanded me, without exception
of anie thing: and if otherwiſe I did, I ſhould be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
thinke not then maiſter Parſon, that for reſpecting

Wherefore do you deſire that a fathers kindnes ſhould
be abuſed? Why doe you make the world to doubt
whether you be his ſonne, and my brother? That he is

I ſhould neuer haue imagined to procure his
death, and hauing not thought it, I had not ſpoken vnto
the other, who knowing him not, would not (after my
forbidding him) haue taken a new occaſion to kill him:
but who knoweth whether he hath ſlaine him at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of ſome other, and will not confeſſe it? Knowing
that if he did, yet he ſhould not eſcape vnpuniſhed. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie
he trulie confeſſeth, that I forbad him to proceed
anie further therein, and that afterwards I neuer ſpake
to him thereof: how can I then be guiltie? Seing that I
cannot be ſo, although I were the cauſe of the miſchief
as you ſay: for as much as mine intention was not ſo,
wherefore we muſt iudge, not according to the chance
or ſucceſſe of actions, but according to the meaning of
him that doth them: otherwiſe for the moſt part, when
the ſicke doe die, the Phiſitions ſhould be blamed: or
he who hauing an intent to kil a man, and ſhould lanch
his impoſtume ought to be praiſed, the which cannot
be, for when the intent is wicked, the fault is no leſſe
ſo long as it laſteth; but the wicked intent ceaſing, the
crime doth end together with it. Wherefore, if I did
amiſſe, in perſuading this man to kil mine enemie, I did
well in forbidding him to proceed no further in the
ſame. Touching this point, that whereas neither the
witneſſes, nor I haue aduertiſed the other; There are
manie men ſo bad to be dealt withall, that one cannot
aduertiſe them of anie thing, without daunger of great
reproch; ſo alſo was it not reaſonable to accuſe one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the iuſtice which had not as yet offended, alſo they
were no more then witneſſes, that I did forbid him to
hurt mine enemie, but yet they knew not what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
before betweene vs. Moreouer the remembrance
of the ſhort pleaſure of reuenge, and the euerlaſting
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7358:44"/>
continuance of the ioy of mercie, had made me repent
that euer I had a deſire of reuenge, wherefore I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
all vnto God, without ſeeking redreſſe either by iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
or anie other way. If then this miſfortune be fallen
vpon him for his ſinnes, or otherwiſe, I am not to bee
blamed, and there is no reaſon which may make me an
offender, ſeeing that al the foreſaid reaſons, mine inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,

the which I require to be iudged by the equall doome

that man was made for woman: in like ſort the words
of our God himſelfe doth witneſſe the ſame, when he

make him therefore an helpe; what libertie then hath
the woman to forſake her husband? Although it was
by the woman her prouocation that man ſinned, and

ſuch a wife as you ſhould be: Trulie a wife can giue no
greater token of her chaſtitie, then by ſhewing a perfect

deſired my loſſe and diſhonour, then to haue your
owne profit and honour ioined together with mine,
which had been but a ſmall matter, if all the Romanes
had not ben therewithall greatly hindered. The gods
forbid that I ſhould ſay, that you had intelligence with
the enemies, but I am very ſorrie that you giue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto many to ſuſpect the ſame, others to preſume as
much, and ſome conſtantly to beleeue it: for you being
verie well knowne to bee both valiant and noble, it
may be ſuppoſed, that without ſome particular reſpect
you would not haue ſuffered, not only the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
and your Collegue to be endangered, but alſo
you could hardlie haue indured the ſight of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
without an extreame deſire to fight with him. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<hi>Marcellus</hi> made manie Sallies and Skirmiſhes againſt
the mind of that great <hi>Fabius,</hi> but for all that, he neuer
left to aid him when need was; ſo that by the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Fabius,</hi> together with his zeale vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
they were named, he the buckler, and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
the ſword of the Romans; whereby it is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeene how happie and fruitfull the vnitie and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Collegues is, wherevnto I haue with all my
power alwaies exhorted you, yet was I neuerable to
obtaine this good at your hands, either for my ſelfe, or

his pride, which he would attribute vnto me: but it is
the common cuſtome of the wicked to ſlander others
with thoſe vices which they know to be in themſelues,
and they imagine that of neceſſitie others are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
vnto them: Whereupon they doe falſely affirm,
that they haue borne that reſpect vnto others, which
they themſelues doe maliciouſly look for. As touching
that which <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> did, he performed his dutie in
fighting with <hi>Varo,</hi> being thereunto required, as I would
haue done the like with you, if you had willed me, or at
the leaſt if I had knowne that the enemies were come:
the which you might haue aduertiſed me of by one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man or twain, without weakening your campe; but
I not knowing thereof, how could I helpe you? But
onely ſuſpitious of your meaning; I will not ſay that
I was in doubt that you had ſome intelligence with the
enemies, ſeeing that I cannot thinke ſo vild a part or ſo
great a Treaſon could euer enter in the heart of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
but I may well ſay that I had great reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
leaſt thoſe of the cittie perceiuing me goe vnto
your aid, might haue ſallied foorth, and charging vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
haue diſcomfited our whole armie, ſeeing that I
knew your ouerthrow euen as ſoone as I knew that the
enemies were come; and there was neuer any man of
ſound iudgement that would loſe the whole, when he
might ſaue the halfe, the which was ſo well conſidered
of our Senat, that after the ouerthrow of Cannas, <hi>Varo</hi>
was more praiſed for returning home, though flying,
then was <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> for dying in the place: moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it is a doubt whether he did well to fight againſt his
mind with <hi>Varo,</hi> ſeeing that it had ben better for him &amp;
for the Commonwealth to haue ben leſſe forward, or
at the leaſt more ſlow, for by that means al had not ben
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7358:50"/>
loſt, and it ſeemeth indeed that he condemned himſelf
to haue erred greatly, when he would rather die, then
accept the horſe which <hi>Lentulus</hi> did offer vnto him to
ſaue himſelfe: for it is a great raſhneſſe, to bring men
vnto the battaile without ſome great likelihood of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
the which I could not hope for, not knowing that
you ſhould fight ſo long vntill you were quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
and then was it too late to ſend you my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
alreadie amazed with a noueltie being as ſuddain
as it was vnfortunat and vnlooked for: for who would
euer thinke that you would haue ben ſo prowd, or raſh
as to begin the battaile without aduertiſing vs? Vs I
ſay that ſhould at the leaſt haue ben companions of
your danger, I will not ſay of your glorie, ſeeing the

as I am not ignorant why two Generals in an

he refuſed to be iudged by that new Preſident, ſaying:</p>

to <hi>Pilate,</hi> I will keepe me from that, if iuſtice haue

but rather with his dignitie and authoritie will alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
an ill opinion towards me, becauſe I haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from his iniuſtice? for if he did me wrong when I
might appeale from him, what will he now doe, if he
may abſolutely iudge me without contradiction? As
for me, I doe firmely beleeue, that with mine enemies
coyne he hath bought this authoritie, to the end that I
might haue no other meanes to eſcape his vniuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
I will not ſay that ſuch places of authoritie ought
not to be ſold, but I dare trulie auouch that there
ought great heed to be taken vpon whom they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
and ſo much the rather, becauſe being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the ſame during their life, they are the leſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to correction, and paying money therefore, more
ſubiect to corruption. O happie is the countrie where
the King maketh his abode, as at Paris and the places
thereabout, for there thoſe which deſerue authoritie
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7358:51"/>
obtaine them: for by the proofe of their capacitie, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and good ſeruices done vnto the Kings Maieſtie,
and to the Commonwealth, they are prouided of ſuch
eſtates as they deſerue, or rather thoſe places of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
are prouided for ſuch men as know how to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
them as they ought: but here where we are farre
from that princely light, all is ſubiect to corruption, and
they doe not beare office which doe beſt deſerue it, but
they which haue the moſt friends, and the greateſt
purſe: ſo this my partiall iudge hath in one day obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without any deſert at all the dignitie of a Preſident
by his monie. To auoid this corruption, in Italie, Spain,
Almaine, Flanders and other Prouinces, the iudges are
only but for a yeare: but after that the tearme is ended,
they are ſubiect to the like officers, or vnto the Cenſure
of other iudges: ſuch alſo was the cuſtome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
that ſo long time did flouriſh, and yet ſhould
haue flouriſhed, if <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla,</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> had not (with other good cuſtomes)
cauſed this likewiſe to bee neglected: for the Romane
Empire, which ſo many yeares before was famous, did
wholy decline, when offices were more eaſily obtained
by the wealthie then the vertuous; but ſo long as the
rich men did ſuffer themſelues to be gouerned and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the poore <hi>Fabricias,</hi> and ſuch others, no king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was more happie and proſperous then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Commonwealth. The Venetians haue flouriſhed
almoſt a thouſand and two hundred yeares, by the like
meanes, in making more eſtimation of ſuch Senators as
were vertuous, then of thoſe that were rich, who if
they haue not vertue ioined with their riches, do there
neuer obtaine anie dignitie: which is the cauſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them iuſtice is rightly adminiſtred, and that the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7358:52"/>
condemned doe neuer hope for anie redemption, or
fauour by appeales: but becauſe we are farre from the
preſence of the King, from his Counſell, and from the
moſt worthie chiefe Court, we in this our Prouince do
ſee the iudges ſo corrupt, or ſometimes ſo ignorant, that
of an hundred appealants two doe not returne rightly
iudged. It were reaſon therfore that this our iudge were
allowed ſome certaine time, to learne of the Lords
which haue of long time ben of this Parlement, before
he haue this authority to adiudge thoſe appealants
which haue appealed from himſelfe: truly I ſhould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be content to ſay that I haue appealed from him being
vniuſt, vnto himſelfe being become iuſt; but what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
haue I now thereof? Seeing that in authoritie
(which is indeed the touchſtone to trie men withal) the
moſt part of them doe wax worſe, and euen as the
waight of gold diminiſheth, being oftentimes rubbed
vpon the touchſtone, ſo doth the conſciences of ſuch as
are but ſlenderly indued with vertue decay, by often
changing of their dignities: for if men did know, or at
the leaſt would not diſſemble, how hard a thing it is,
to vſe the office of a iudge; there would be ſo few that
would couet to buy that place, as hardly ſhould there
bee any found that would bee deſirous to take ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
vpon them: Neuertheleſſe, this being not my
iudge, but mine aduerſarie, not content to haue adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me once, would condemne me againe. King <hi>Lewis</hi>
the twelfth, when one counſailed him to be reuenged
on thoſe, which in times paſt had offended him, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that it was not the part of the king of France, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
the wrongs which were done vnto the Duke of
Orleans; which ſurely were both the words of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and mild prince: but I find not any of theſe two
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7358:52"/>
parts in this new preſident: but rather on the contrary,
it ſeemeth that he hath made himſelfe preſident, to
cauſe thoſe to die whom he hath wronged, being but
an inferiour iudge, of whom I am one, and he which is
vnto him moſt odious. The old prouerb ſaith, That the
ignorance of the iudge is oftentimes the cauſe of the
calamititie of them that are accuſed: O happy world
wherein this Prouerbe was inuented! if then the iudges
did only offend through ignorance, although the ſame
be a fault great inough, what ſhall we alaſſe ſay then in
theſe daies? Wherein malice exceedeth ignorance,
and that for the moſt part they harbor both together?
Or that which is worſt of al (if it may be lawfull to ſpeak
the truth) that as the number of the skilfull encreaſeth,
ſo the number of the good decreaſeth, and when
that happeneth, there can no good bee hoped for
in the Common-wealth: for there is nothing more
dangerous in the world, then to haue ſuch a man in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that is wiſe and wicked both together: becauſe
that for euery purpoſe, they haue examples very readie
to prooue, and perſuade their wicked intentions to be
lawfull, like vnto this man, who by his monie is made
preſident: Wherefore I doe rather ſubmit my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

as would be corrupted, the which they cannot hope
for in thoſe that are iuſt, wherefore they are driuen into
deſpaire, knowing that no puniſhment can hurt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
man, as alſo that there ſhall not ſo much be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vpon them, as they doe deſerue, and ſo they vomit
out their poiſon againſt the righteous iudge: the which
they doe the more boldlie, becauſe they know wel that
for all their ſpeech he wil be neuer a whit the more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
vnto them, but without any ſtearnneſſe or malice wil
iudge them according to the laws, executing them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with mercie, then rigor; neither ſhall the wicked
be able to mooue his patience, for he which perceiueth
himſelfe to be blamed truly is angrie, and thinketh to
be reuenged: but on the contrarie, he that knoweth his
conſcience cleare, maketh no account of ſlaunderous
ſpeeches: or if he chance at the firſt brunt to be angrie,
he doth preſently bridle the ſame his anger by reaſon,
rather deſiring to remaine ſuch as he is, then by rage or
paſſion to become ſuch a one as in ttuth he ought not
to be. I am the ſame man which he affirmeth me to be;
ſo alſo is he nothing amended ſince I condemned him.
I did neuer beare him anie ill will, neither did he euer
giue me occaſion ſo to doe: but truly I haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him, but with leſſe rigor then his deſerts required,
or the lawes commanded: but why ſhould not I bee
odious vnto him whom I haue condemned to die?
Seeing that the Phiſitions and Chirurgions, who doe
employ themſelues to ſaue mens liues, are oftentimes
heartily lothed of them, when either they touch their
ſores, or will not ſuffer them to follow their noiſome
appetites, but do rather appoint them to take good and
and wholſome things: the child and the ſeruant, yea
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7358:54"/>
and the wife, doe for the moſt part hate the father, the
maſter, and the husband which chaſtiſe &amp; rebuke them;
how much more then doth the offender hate the iudge
which condemneth him? Seeing he wrongfully dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
him to be the cauſe of the ſhame and puniſhment
which he receiueth, although himſelfe be the occaſion
both of the one and the other euill. Whereas he ſaith,
that I haue bought my office to hurt him: there be
ſome other proofes then his tongue to verifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie;
It is likewiſe apparently ſeene, how he ſlandereth
the moſt part of iudges. It is a goodly matter indeed for
an offender to cenſure the deeds of iudges, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of equitie and iuſtice, as alſo to diſpute whether
offices may be ſold, and whether officers ought to be
yeerely choſen or not; you are brought hether to be
iudged, and you will iudge the iudges: all this ſerueth
you to no end, bethinke you if you can, how you may
cleare your ſelfe, and afterwards you may accuſe vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe that haue power to redreſſe it, and then there
will be greater credit giuen to your ſpeech: but now
you being condemned as an offender, no man that
knoweth what iuſtice is, will beleeue but that you ſpeak
of others, as you your ſelfe would doe, if you had their
authoritie: for the maner of thoſe that haue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences

moſt part of men are like vnto themſelues, wherefore
let vs come vnto the point concerning you and me: ſay
only, haue I proceeded againſt you otherwiſe then by

aswell vnto your excuſes, or iuſtifications, as vnto your

proceſſe? The counſellors were not they there, as they
are here in like ſort? Was it I that either did condemne
you, or that muſt againe condemne you? Are they not
your owne deeds? Bethinke you then to alleage other
reaſons to more purpoſe for your iuſtification, or to

all vnto the will of God, who by that meanes wil

How manie did march vnder <hi>Scipio,</hi> that would
not follow <hi>Lelius?</hi> Although they were both of one,

a treaſon ſo great? Not onelie againſt your
Prince and countrie: but againſt your ſelues,
and the profeſſion of armes? Saieng that you
are acquited of your oath, by the death of your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
Who is then your Generall? Is not the prince? Is
he dead? Or doth he euer die, but ſtrait another ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him? It is not you that were ſworne vnto the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
that dead is, but I, that was his Lieutenant, who
alwaies in his abſence repreſented his perſon: If I had
then this authoritie whileſt he liued, what a ieaſt were it
that I ſhould loſe it after his death? For when he was
abſent, your oath bound you to me. Wherefore hath
the Generall a Lieutenant? But onlie becauſe (himſelf
being ſubiect to wounds, ſickneſſe, and laſtly to death)
that he ſhould maintaine and keepe the ſouldiors in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?
You cannot denie, but that ſo long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
it was I to whom you were to yeeld an account of
your actions, but not for you to doubt of my authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
for proofe whereof, durſt you refuſe to follow me
in anie place where I would lead you? Or to denie to
doe whatſoeuer I would command you? Durſt you
once haue demanded whether that which I wold haue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7358:57"/>
you doe, was the pleaſure of the Generall? Would I
not haue puniſhed him with death, that ſhould haue
diſobeied me? Or had I not the power by martiall law
of my ſelfe to put anie diſobedient ſouldiour to death?
The Colonell, hath not he the like authoritie ouer the
captaines? And the captains ouer the others that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
vnder them, euen vnto the corporall, who hath
the ſame power ouer the priuat ſouldiour? What doe
you meane then to doubt of the authoritie of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall?
Conſider ſouldiors how you haue ſworne to
ſerue your prince, and follow your Enſigne; which is
meant ſo farre as you may bee allowed by the prince:
what will you then ſay? Seeing your Enſignes are yet
diſplaied, and your captaines willing to ſerue? Do you
not know that you are entred in their muſter-role, and
that you muſt march vnder them: They vnder the
Campmaiſters, the Campmaiſters vnder the Colonels,
the Colonels vnder the Generall or his Lieutenant,
and the Generall vnder the prince if he be there, if he
be not, then he repreſenteth his perſon? where is then
your vnderſtanding? Who hath bewitched or ſeduced
you, that you wil thus peruert order and military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline?
Is not this fellow a trim Orator, being no leſſe
ignorant then ill aduiſed: who thinking that he is the
ableſt and wiſeſt man amongſt the reſt, heapeth vpon
himſelfe alone, all the diſhonor and puniſhment of this
fault? he I ſaie that was worthie to die before hee was
borne, rather then he ſhould haue attempted to corrupt
ſo manie worthie and valiant men. The noble Romans
did ſundrie times commit the like faults, eſpeciallie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that great <hi>Scipio</hi> in Spaine, who alſo cauſed onelie
<hi>Albius Calenus, Atrius Vmbrius,</hi> and others the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the mutenie to be puniſhed as capital offenders:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7358:57"/>
and I doe aſſure you that in their deed, they offended
not ſo much as you, for they had beene vnpaied of a
long time, and it was certainlie thought, that <hi>Scipio</hi> their
Generall was dead, which was the cauſe that made the
ſouldiors not onelie to mutenie, but alſo manie citties
and Prouinces to reuolt, before they did mutenie.
Wherevpon <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaith, That when the authors
of the deed were puniſhed in the middeſt of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
there was not heard ſo much as one onlie grone,
ſeeing them beaten ſtarke naked with hollie wands, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vntill they were readie to giue vp the ghoſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
their heads to be ſtriken off being halfe dead.
Thoſe men did mutenie becauſe they did ſee that the
Prouinces did rebell, but you, hauing paſſed the worſt
of a dangerous enterpriſe, being vpon the point of a
victorie, the which your Generall (whom you ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
bemone) hath prepared for you with the price of his
life, would now giue it ouer. Is it poſſible that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which you owe vnto his memorie, and the ſhame
of your ſelues ſhould not be able to withhold you? the
greateſt loue that can be ſhewed vnto anie man that is
deceaſſed, is to immitate his deeds, and to obſerue his
precepts: and you will whollie eſtrange your ſelues
from them, which doth plainlie declare, that being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
of ſuch a Generall, God hath taken him awaie
from you: or rather he verie well knowing your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines
was not deſirous to liue anie longer. I know
not what els to ſay or thinke: what ſhould be become
of your ancient valor, and martiall reputation, which
was woont to haue more need of a bridle to hold you
backe, then ſpurs to prick you forward. I am aſhamed of
your ſhame, if it be true that you haue charged this loſt
man to make this diſcourſe? But I cannot beleeue it:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7358:58"/>
for the inſolencie is too great, ſo that it cannot proceed
from anie other but from himſelf, and ſo conſequentlie
none ought to beare the ſhame, and puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
but he: Neuertheleſſe, for the good opinion which
I haue of you, I doe put his life and death into your
hands: hauing ſo great confidence in your nobilitie,
that you will not indure a man ſo pernicious, to remain
anie longer amongſt you, but if you ſhall ſuffer him, it
will be your owne hurt more then ours, beſides the
ſhame and reproch which will continue for euer, yea,
and that after death: for there is no doubt but that the
Hiſtoriographers doe as well record the faults of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors,
as their valiant acts, which afterwards is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the cauſe, that their poſteritie doe fare the worſe
for it. Laſtlie, I haue told ſome part of the reaſons whie
you cannot, much leſſe ought not, to demaund that
which this wicked man hath proponed, without the
conſent of anie of you, except it be of ſome ſuch as are
like vnto himſelfe, which maie well be termed the ſcum
of the armie, for in ſuch aſſemblies there are ſome bad,
like as there is no corne without darnell, no wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lees, nor anie fire without ſmoake: or els if your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graciouſneſſe
be ſuch (as I can hardlie beleeue it is) that
manie are of that mind, but rather that it is the leſſer
number, and conſequentlie the worſer ſort of all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
I am of opinion, that ſuch kind of people are not
fit to be kept; for ſuch a riddance of them, will be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto the whole armie, becauſe a few well diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are more worth then a great number of thoſe that
are confuſed, diſobedient, and without order. Let them
come forth then which would be diſcharged, whileſt
the captains are here with their muſter roles, to the end
that at the ſame time alſo they maie be commended &amp;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7358:58"/>

                  <p>You muſt note, that when the Generals doe make

foretold vnto his brother, that if he

that there ſhould thereby happen a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe

               <p>THey truelie are in a miſerable caſe, who haue no

are partakers of ſuch miſcheife as therby doth happen,
as wee O righteous Iudges are, who not onlie for ſuch

inſolent perſons, as alſo that the reſt of our parentage
may be rid from the fear of this murtherous man, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the blood of his brethren. For it commonlie
falleth out, that ſuch blood thirſtie men as he is, cannot

by <hi>Abimilech</hi> the Hebrue, who ſlue ſeuentie of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;

and by <hi>Abſalon,</hi> who hauing cauſed his brother
<hi>Amon</hi> to be ſlaine, would haue done the like vnto his
father: what ſhall I ſay of <hi>Ioab,</hi> and others of the Iews?
Theſe are the vertues which a man learneth in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the warres, who being vſed to murther, finding no
enemies killeth his friends, and afterwards his kindred
and brethren as this hath done: ſo did <hi>Romulus</hi> cauſe
his brother to be ſlaine, and <hi>Alexander</hi> killed his foſter

Aſo <hi>Epaminundas</hi> the Thebane, <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> and
<hi>Aulus Poſthumius Tubero,</hi> being Romans, ſlew their ſons
(more worthy to liue then they) vnder the coulor of
obſeruing militarie diſcipline. The like did <hi>Brutus</hi> being

Mnenon</hi> King of Perſia. Likewiſe the great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
cauſed his ſonne and his brother in law to die,

ſuch a one this our brother (but vnworthie that name)
is and euer hath beene: whereby we doe plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that like as vertues are linked together, ſo doe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
follow one another: for from his youth he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed

of his brother whom he hath afterwards ſlaine, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the report of a woman: and what woman? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
a ſtranger: who being enamoured of a ſtranger,
and marrying with him, cared not to forſake her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and kindred to follow him hether, where (it may
be) perceiuing that ſhe was not ſufficiently made of to
her owne liking, and eſpecially of him who foreſaw the
miſchiefe that ſhould happen by her, did accuſe him
vnto her husband, knowing him to be as fooliſh, and
light of beliefe, as prone vnto anger and murther. How
manie are there that doe themſelues prouoke men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
adultrie; But when they ſee that they are refuſed by
them, they doe afterwards complaine that they would
haue forced them? The wife of <hi>Putiphar,</hi> of <hi>Theſeus,</hi>
and of others, doe verie well witneſſe the ſame: what
aſſurance haue we of the chaſtitie or goodneſſe of this
woman, that ſhe hath not done the like? Hardly may a
woman be forced which maketh anie reſiſtance; and if
at the leaſt ſhe want ſtrength to defend her ſelfe, ſhe
cannot lacke a tongue nor a ſhrill voice to crie out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing ſo incident vnto their ſex: but although ſhe
had ben forced indeed, was not the law ſufficient to
haue puniſhed the ſame? Should not we then haue ben
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7358:60"/>
as readie as we are now, to accuſe the offender? But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as truth ingendreth hatred, he hauing found
an occaſion (as he thought) to offer violence vnto his
brother, was in ſooth very loth to loſe the ſame: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then, O you iudges, if ſuch faults be not rigorouſly
puniſhed, that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being naturally giuen to reuenge,
and men ouer eaſie to beleeue them, will commit a
thouſand miſchiefes. Laſtly, it cannot be denied, but
that it is as great an iniuſtice to pardon an offender, as
to condemne an innocent, &amp; that euen as iuſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

a iuſt puniſhment of the malefactor: for that is called
reuenge, which is done wittingly, but that is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is inforced through a moſt iuſt cauſe of

ought to be done with a ſetled mind, without choler,

the cauſe thereof himſelfe, (not ſeeing any likelihood

the reſt ſhould be nothing worth at all; and you ought
not to ſay that a iuſt cauſe of diſdaine conſtraineth you

for were it not ſo, from whence could ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue

Moiſes, Ioſua,</hi> and a number of others becauſe they

Moreouer the multitude of thoſe which you alleage
that haue ſlain their kindred, maketh more for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,

that the moſt part of them had leſſe cauſe to doe the

monie, or deſire of vainglory draweth men vnto the

baptiſed the ſouldiors without forbidding them to vſe

wars is rather an occaſion of vertue then vice. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the report of my wife, this is not the firſt time that
women haue ben beleeued in the like caſe: wherefore
ſeeing neither you nor I haue or can find any reproch
in mine that may blemiſh her honor, ſhe is as well to be

kept the firſt: but why doe I ſpeake of keeping, ſeeing
the female ſex are ſo hardly to be kept. If you will not
giue me your daughter, let vs remaine friends, without
being kinsmen? For a true friendſhip is more woorth,
then a kindred, which is made by force or compulſion:
wherefore I would not in anie ſort violate the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

your daughters ſhame in marrying with her ſiſter, then
to be once ſuſpected to be the breaker of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
I cannot hinder your daughter to ſay what ſhe
thinks good, both to excuſe her ſhame, and to be made
a wife, but for all that I am not bound to beleeue her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my conſcience, nor to make amends for another

for although it were ſo, that I had gotten your daughter
with child (the which I denie, and ſhe can neuer proue)
doe you thinke that I would buy of her by marriage,
that which ſhe hath alreadie giuen me, becauſe ſhee
would haue her ſhare of the pleaſure? Or do you thinke
me ſo mad, that I would wed her, whom I ſhould euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more

the which although it be to be obſerued, yet is it not for

of the moſt part of the law is briefe, but it may be well
enlarged by the gloſes, and thoſe which tend more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

in fauour of them which are not faultie, in hurting of

As this would bee, to take away the dwelling

It is true alſo that the ſame part which you will pull

euen as you ſay, that this houſe fell vnto you both by

lower roome, and not the vpper: the law commandeth
not his part alone, but that his dwelling place ſhould be
raced downe, the which ought to take place, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his dwelling had ben hired, to warne thoſe that

that they know to be honeſt men: &amp; it was not in vain,
when a Citizen of Rome cauſing the ſale of his houſe
to be cried thorow the cittie, he made it to bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
that amongſt other good properties which was

In thinking to ſaue part of your abilitie, you would ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7358:65"/>
be thought that you haue committed the crime, &amp; that
he is innocent, becauſe the ſame is done as much for a
perpetuall memorie and reproch of the offence, as for
an example to others: and the law was ordained for the
ſtrong houſes no more then it was for thoſe that were
weake, whoſe loſſe will be a leſſe hurt vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Moreouer, where the greater number is,
there do ſuch faults happen the oftener, as alſo becauſe
the common people are leſſe afraid then the Noble, to

more to be feared, and eſpecially when it concerneth
the loſſe of honor, which is ſo hardlie to be gotten, but
being once loſt, ſildome or neuer may it be recouered.
The augmenting of the gloſes of the law cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound

or puniſh the wicked without anie reſpect at all: if you
haue nothing to doe with the fault of the offender, no

ſuſtaine for dwelling ſo neere vnto him, and you muſt
not ſay that this void place ſhall ſerue for a lurking hole
for theeues and ſuch wicked people as walke by night,
for ſo long as iuſtice ſhal be trulie adminiſtred, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

When a ſlaue is taken for an offence, if he ſaith his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

you allow not this reaſon, I did it to make the truth
knowne vnto others as wel as to me it is, that he is your

others? as this infant hurteth you and your credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
therefore if he be not your ſonne let him be ſold,
and if you haue begotten him, make his mother free.
Wherevpon doe you appeale? Becauſe I haue not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

when nothing was impoſſible vnto thoſe warriors ſo

of God, to fortune, to the ſinne of the people, Prince, or

then you mocking the Prince after the battaile is loſt,

But eſpecially in the warres, where there needeth but

(although hee die in his bed amongſt his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred)
yet ſhould his death be accounted odious. It is
not I then that am cauſe of his ſhame, but the murther
which he hath committed. I confeſſe indeed that he
neuer offended me, but rather iuſtice; ſo likewiſe I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him not to die, but to maintain equitie: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to doe it without disburſing of monie, I did
rather chuſe to pay it, then to leaue iuſtice vndone. I

I cannot tell whether your anceſtors were

that in lifting vp his fiſt, and gently letting it fall againe,
he fained to ſtrike his father, who in like ſort ſeemed as
though he were aggreeued therewith, but both the
one and the other did it to eſcape a worſer miſchiefe,
and to performe a greater good: neceſſitie in all doth
greatly excuſe humane weakeneſſe, and therefore the
Saguntines were not only excuſed, but exalted for ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

brother in leauing me at the Tyrants mercie did worſe
then he, who without hurting me, hath ſaued me. You
ſay that hee had no reſpect vnto the law, I know well
that the law is ſtrict, but the interpretation is large: if
one being mad chance to ſtrike another, he is not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
Neither yet is the little child which ſtriketh his
father condemned: For the mad man hath more need
of pittie then puniſhment, and is rather to bee holpen
then hurt; and the child hath neither ſtrength nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to offend: theſe two points in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie

endured a greater paine then I; if thoſe women who

Nor thoſe Prieſts, which through force or feare
haue brought the treaſures of the Temple vnto the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

my ſonne bee blamed who fained to ſtrike his father?

ſay that he hath not loſt his wits, which ſeeketh rather
to immitate the Tyrant his enemie, then his bondman?
Who hath at the leaſt ſhown more loue vnto him, then
he doth either to ſonne or daughter, ſeeing that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himſelfe like vnto the Tyrant. If the bondman
had lien with my ſiſter, I had cauſed him to be hanged
as well as the reſt, and now you your ſelfe would haue
him to lie with her: you ſay that it is by marriage, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that, for marriage is meant betwixt thoſe which are
worthie one of another, either in deed, or opinion:
Then ſeeing none beſides you, who are mad, of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that a ſlaue may be worthie to be your ſonne in
law, and my brother in law, it can bee no marriage: and
were it otherwiſe, I ſay that this mariage bringeth more
ſhame, then if ſhe were rauiſhed or abuſed by a Noble
man, for then at the leaſt the child which ſhould ſo bee
borne, ſhould be more worthie and be better reſpected
then the child of a bondman. Who would euer haue
thought that the Lord or Maiſter would haue ſuffered
his ſlaue further then the Tyrant would his friend? It
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7358:107"/>
may therefore verie well bee ſaid that whoſoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
ſuch marriages, is either a foole or a Tyrant, of
whom the one deſerueth death, and the other to loſe al
authoritie. O what a faire ſonne in law hath he choſen,
who hath nothing of anie worth in him, but that he
hath kept himſelfe from being hanged with the reſt of
his fellowes? Alaſſe my ſiſter ſhall then being vnder
the power of her father, loſe hir virginitie, which was
ſo carefully preſerued when ſhee was vnder the power
of the Tyrant, and he ſhall be thought worthie of ſuch
a marriage, which was not deemed worthie of the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.
Farre more happie are thoſe which were defloured,
for they neuertheleſſe doe now take ſuch other hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
as are worthy of them. It is a goodly matter whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the father maketh ſuch a match for his owne daughter
as the Tyrant did for thoſe of his enemies. Ah vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſiſter, who being vnder the tyrants power diddeſt
deſire thy father, and vnder thy fathers power, thou
deſireſt the Tyrant, who would yet defend thee from
this iniurie. Is this a ſmall reward for a bondman to ſee
all his fellowes on the gallows, yet himſelfe to bee free
from the like? you ſay that he hath not rauiſhed his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,
ſay likewiſe that he hath not ſlaine his maiſter, nor
vſed poyſon nor ſorcerie: doe you ſay that hee dooth a
good act that keepeth himſelf from crime for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment?
Our miſerie is as great now as the ſhame
which the other maids and wiues haue ſuffered during
the Tyrannie, for this is done during our freedome: the
others ſhame was in the abſence of their Parents, but
this is in the preſence of hers; the others ſhame was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
deflouring, but this here cannot be called conſtraint
but a voluntary conſent. It was not vertue that kept him
from doing as much as the others, but the feare to be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7358:107"/>
hanged with the others, hee knew very well that God
would not ſuffer ſo cruel a tyranny to indure, and when
the Citizens returned, the ſlaues ſhould bee puniſhed:
But why will you marrie your daughter to one ſo vild
and baſe, who hauing her in his power, both eſteemed,
and knew himſelfe to bee vnworthy of her? Wherein
onely he deſerueth ſome recompence, which may bee
done in giuing him freedome and meanes to liue, but
you muſt not giue him her, for whoſe ſake chiefly you
would reward him.</p>

into the chamber, not without good eſpiall before
hand of the Tyrants abſence. A valiant man no doubt,
who deſired not to find the Tyrant, but his wife, who
was not pricked with hate, but paſſioned with loue.
They which goe purpoſely to kill anie one doe arme
themſelues with courage and courtelax, and doe goe
thether where they thinke to find thoſe they meane to
kil. Euery noble act is begun with an intent, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by occaſion: for as oftentimes the vertuous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
are rewarded, although the ſucceſſe doe fall out
ſiniſterly, ſo are wicked enterpriſes not left vnpuniſhed,
although they ſucceed not according to the meaning
of the malefactor; and as vertue without effect loſeth
not her glorie, euen ſo likewiſe is that neuer allowed for
vertue, or worthie of reputation, which happeneth by
fortune, or chance. The wiſdome of our Senat, would
neuer haue appointed ſo great a reward for him that
ſhould ſlay the Tyrant, if they had thought the ſame
ſhould haue ben performed by ſo wicked a perſon, not
willingly, but by conſtraint, not by vertue, but by vice.
Neuer was there heard of ſuch a combat, for hee which
was counted the vildeſt caitife, did fight for the beſt &amp;
honeſteſt cauſe; the Tyrant fought to reuenge his owne
wrong, and his wiues reputation, and thou to maintain
thy lewd act and foule adulterie: ſo that it may truly bee
ſaid, that thou diddeſt murther a womans husband, and
fortune hath ſlaine the Tyrant, by whoſe death the
Commonwealth hath gained her freedome, although
he was not ſlaine for the ſame intention. It is a goodlie
matter to ſee thee come polluted with the kiſſes of an
adulterous minion, to demand the recompence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7358:113"/>
vnto a vertuous man; this honor ſhould bee
due vnto ſuch a one as had freely killed the Tyrant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therevnto prouoked by vertue; but not vnto thee,
who diddeſt it by chance or conſtraint, thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thine owne life: wherefore the ſame life which
thou haſt ſaued by this deed, is a recompence great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for thy deſert; or if thou wilt denie this, conſider
that firſt we muſt puniſh the vice, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the vertue: thou canſt not denie but that thou
diddeſt firſt commit adulterie before thou ſlueſt the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
firſt then ſuffer puniſhment for thy fault, and then
we will afterwards conſult whether thou deſerueſt that
reward which thou demandeſt. But aboue all things
remember this, that no good act is to be attempted by
miſchiefe, neither muſt vertue be attained vnto by vice.</p>

You muſt not examine what I carried into the Caſtle,
But what I tooke away thence; Likewiſe neuer aske
wherefore I went thether, but marke what I haue done

the hands were mine, the courage, counſell, danger,

Why may not that bee tearmed worſe then
adulterie which is done chieflie by the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

A wiſe man (no doubt) that drew his ſword, not

the Tyrant can no more break the marriages of others,
why ſhould mine be ſuffered to be broken. But who is
ignorant, that during the Tyrants life, the barren were
eſteemed moſt happie, becauſe they could not ſee their
children rauiſhed at the Tyrants pleaſure? True it is
that I haue borne no children for the Commonwealth,
but I dare affirm, that I am the cauſe that manie are and
ſhall be borne, and that henceforth there ſhall bee no
more taken from it. The Tyrant ſuſpected my husband
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7358:131"/>
his intention; becauſe either hee had diſcloſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or els his countenance or behauiour diſcouered
his pretence, but yet in anie ſort hee cannot complaine
of his wiues tatling, no not when ſhe was in her extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
torments, I had alwaies more reſpect vnto my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
that was abſent, then vnto the Tyrant who was
preſent, being more carefull of his health then fearefull
of mine own hurt. But who can expreſſe all the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that was made for inſtruments of crueltie (able i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to daunt the courages of many men) to terrifie
the conſtancie of a feminine heart, the whips tearing
my fleſh, the fire, the yron ſhoes, the whot egs vnder
mine armholes, the buskins, the treſtles, the pullies, the
cords, the napkin, water, oile, and the hangmen: yet all
theſe together could neuer draw one onely word from
me to the preiudice of my husband, but prouing by
liuely reaſons, the contrarie of all that was of me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
I was the cauſe of his deliuerance: wherefore
doth he vaunt that he hath ſlaine the Tyrant, ſeeing the
ſame was more eaſie for him to accompliſh, then for me
to indure ſo manie torments; for I haue ſuffered what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
ancient cruelty was able to inuent, &amp; that which
this preſent age might poſſiblie ad thervnto: what ſhall
I further ſay, but that the hangmen were wearie and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the Tyrant himſelfe was tormented at my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Hauing then bought with ſuch exceeding pains,
life, honour, glorie, and riches for this ingratefull man,
why would he put me away, to take a richer wife? For
one more noble he cannot haue, if that be true nobilitie
which proceedeth from vertue. O how plainely doth it
appeare by him, that abundance engendereth auarice,
which is the root of all vice, and enemie to all vertue, as
he doth very well declare: for when he was more poor,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7358:131"/>
and leſſe wealthie, then had he more pittie, and leſſe
wickedneſſe. But what is this fellow that would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
nature a law, and appoint the times wherein a
woman ſhould conceiue? Muſt hee be like vnto God?
Doth he not yet know that he is worſe then a beaſt that
would be better then a man? Muſt he be ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious?

haſt thou euer wanted anie thing? Or didſt thou feare
that thou ſhouldeſt want? What haddeſt thou then to
doe with theſe riches? But who knoweth not that the
moſt women are ſooner ouercome with couetouſneſſe
then loue? Diddeſt thou not know alſo that continency

If he were ſo glad to find her chaſt, why did hee ſolicite
her to bee immodeſt? It is a great follie for anie man to
ſeeke for that which he would not find: Who may not
ſay or thinke that this our age is void of all ſhame?
Seeing that a ſtranger witneſſeth the chaſtitie of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

that feareth not to be thought an adultereſte, wil neuer
be aſhamed to be one indeed; for opinion gouerneth

would not be one good woman: for ſhame ſerueth as a
bridle to the immodeſt, and as a guide vnto the chaſt.
What will bee ſaid, if all the world will affirme with me
that thou art diſhoneſt, Except one man onely, and he
but a ſtranger, which ſaith thou art chaſt? wherefore the
praiſe which hee giueth thee, and the falſe teſtimonie

but that he ſaid thus vnto them, Beware of Treaſon: Who at
their returne, vpon theſe words of the ſonne, accuſed his father
to haue betraied him, ſaying:</p>
               <p>OVr Emperor hath ſuffered a ſhamefull death, and
the traitor hath receiued monie for the reward of
his Treaſon? We haue ſeen this ſame man more
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7358:143"/>
ſad to ſee his ſonne pronounced Emperour, then ſorrie
to behold him taken of his enemies. How was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that thou couldeſt returne alone, being old and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerladen
with monie, ſeeing they did take the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror?
Thou haſt receiued more monie then thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
well hide: but that is no great wonder, ſeeing that
in one perſon thou haſt ſold both a ſonne and an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
together; Who ſaid vnto vs, Beware of Treaſon, but
alaſſe he ſaid it too late. Trulie if the enemies had not
giuen thee this gold, they would haue taken it from
thee as well as from others. This ſentence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
(being readie to die) was ſhort, and euen for ſhame
verie hardly vttered, ſeeing that thereby he accuſed his
father. Why diddeſt thou eſcape leauing thy ſonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
thee, who was borne to be an Emperour? Surelie
for no other cauſe but that hee hindered thee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one. His proceeding againſt his father by lot and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue
voices was done to no other end, but onelie
thereby modeſtlie to ſhew that from henceforth hee
would neither truſt thee with the gouernement of the
Commonwealth, neither yet ought the ſame truſt thee
to gouerne it. Our Embaſſadors carried gold thether to
redeeme our Emperor, and his father brought gold he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which hee receiued for ſelling him vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
How happeneth it that thou art not dead, or at
the leaſt without motion, and as it were crucified with
thy ſonne? why diddeſt thou return ſo ſpeedilie, ſeeing
he was aliue and did yet ſpeake? Certainlie his ſpeech
bewraied the Treaſon, but his ſilence indeuoring to
conceale the ſame, did better decipher the Traitor, that
would not once ſtay the comming of the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
nor yet returne with them againe. This good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
although hee were crucified, yet left not to bee
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7358:143"/>
carefull for the Commonwealth. And therefore he ſaid
take you heed of Treaſon: Behold how he could not
conceale the Treaſon; but like a child hee would not
name the traitor. Thou wilt ſay that compaſſion vrged
thee to depart ſo quicklie. We would know, ſeeing thou
couldeſt not haue him aliue, why thou diddeſt not at
the leaſt redeeme him when hee was dead? For neuer
was anie enemie ſo cruell but that he would be moued
with a fathers teares, and ſo great a ſumme of gold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
This word, Take heed of Treaſon, ſignifieth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
leaſt anie without the priuitie of your towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards
doe come foorth of your cittie, or without the
knowledge of the Commonwealth doe goe vnto the

of the enemies loden with gold: Nothing of this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
in all mens iudgement thou haſt done al this, thou
wenteſt forth of the cittie, thou haſt ben in the enemies
campe, thou art returned thence loden with gold, the

forth of the citty without leaue of the kings
or the licence of the Senat, ſhould bee guilty of Treaſon and bee

angrie, or rather becauſe loue and rule can neuer abide anie

Wherewithal the Senat being diſpleaſed, accuſed <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
for killing not onely his brother, but alſo their King, And
thus they ſay:</p>
               <p>WHat good lucke or happineſſe may wee hope to
reape of our Commonwealth or cittie, ſeeing that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7358:147"/>
in the beginning thereof, not onlie one twinne brother
hath preſumed to kill the other, but alſo the King hath
murthered the King. If one hand ſhould cut off the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one foot tread vpon the other, one eie darken
the other, and finallie if all the members would ſeeke to
hinder each other, what benefit or helpe may be hoped
for of the bodie? As the man which hath but one eie is
alwaies in danger to be ſtarke blind, or as he which hath
but one hand, the leaſt hurt which the other hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
maketh the man altogether impotent, euen ſo
wee thought our ſelues happie to bee free from the like
danger hauing two kings, to the end that if the one
were ſicke, the other might gouerne and aid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
thoſe dangers which the one might incur
for want of foreſight, the other might preuent by his
forecaſt, the one being abroad, the other was in the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and being not onelie brethren but twinnes, wee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that they ſhould be inuincible, but alaſſe the one
hath ouerthrowne the other. What puniſhment then
dooth not hee deſerue, which hath depriued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of ſo great a hope? Who knoweth not that
kings are the true guides of the people, and how good
or bad ſoeuer they be, the moſt part will follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?
Vnhappie then are thoſe Commonwealths
where the kings are wicked, and eſpeciallie when their
chiefeſt fault is crueltie, which in them is moſt odious:
therefore hath nature framed the drone being king of
the bees without a ſting, or at the leaſt if he haue one, he
vſeth it not: if crueltie then be ſo vnſeemely for kings,
how much more is it for ſuch as are the firſt kings, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they doe inſtruct and embolden all their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
to follow their ſteps; for mans frailtie is more
prone to follow the bad then the good: doe wee not
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7358:148"/>
know that ſharpe lawes are made not to deſtroy Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
much leſſe Kings, but onlie to bridle the vicious,
and by keeping them in aw to aſſure the vertuous; the
text of the law is ſtrict, but the gloſe is ample, &amp; ought
alwaies to tend rather vnto clemencie then crueltie.
What would you ſay if a man (ouercome with a iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
care of his countrie) ſhould goe forth of the cittie
without leaue to doe ſome exploit for the benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
Ought he to die? Are not the lawes made for the
profit and ſafetie of the Commonwealth? Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
to what end the King leaped ouer, was it to goe
ſeeke the enemies? No, but rather thereby ſecretly to
ſhew, that as he could leape foorth of the cittie at one
iumpe, ſo might the enemies as eaſilie paſſe our ſuch
low wals; wherefore as hee would neither flatter the
workemen, ſo without gaining their ill will, hee would
prouoke them to be more diligent in their labour, and
for the ſame purpoſe he indeuoured to pleaſe both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; alſo the aſſiſtants in ſhewing the agilitie of his bodie:
O how worthie of commendation is that man which
ioineth profit with pleaſure, as he did! but wee may ſay
that he in ſteed of receiuing honour by the people for
his reward, obtained cruell death at his brothers hands
for his recompence. Seeing the law was by the Senat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
why were not they acquainted with his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that ſo his integritie might haue ben made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt?
For that which a king doth cannot bee ſaid to bee
done without leaue, ſo that the people be not hurt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
for in euery lawful act he may take leaue by his own
authoritie, wherfore you haue no other excuſe, but that
the onlie ambition to raigne alone, incited you to kill
your brother, murther our King, &amp; hurt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
whereby it appeareth that the greedie deſire to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7358:148"/>
rule is void of all pittie or remorſe: if we ſay that hee
which parteth from his friend parteth from himſelfe,
what may be ſaid of him that hath by death ſundred his
brother from him? Which at one inſtant was concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with him, who hath remained in his mothers
wombe vntill his procreation with him, who was caſt
forth vnto the beaſts, &amp; foſtered vp together with him,
who hath holpen him to build this citie, to appoint the
Senat, and was created King with him; what iudge wil
bee then ſo ignorant which will not ſay that you ought
to die with him? And that you doe wrongfullie vſurpe
the time wherein you doe liue longer then hee. Giue
rightfull doome then, O you Senators, to the end that
he which hath killed his brother without your conſent,
may no longer tyranniſe ouer the Commonwealth.</p>

wherefore <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid well vnto his diſciples,
that demanded of him where he would be buried: lay
me (ſaid he) vpon the earth, for the ſame it ſelfe will in

vnto vs that liue, then vnto the dead man: if the worſt

you able to accuſe him, ſaue onlie that his great miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
made him to imagine that hee could no way end

conſidering that which is denied vnto him, I cannot

then he that is dead, and wanteth a ſepulchre? Is it to

the dead vpon the land to be buried, thoſe which

their bodie, dooth burie their bones conuerting them
into aſhes; others are intombed in the bellies of fiſhes,
and of other land beaſtes. As it is the office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats
to perſecute murtherers, ſo likewiſe ought they to
pittie the murthered. If you ſay that hee which killeth

Wherevpon it chanced in Orleans,
that a poor woman which got her liuing

with carrying of fagots about the cittie

foure yeares, and a ſonne about one yeare old, with the which
children ſhe was left a widdow by her husband. So that ſhee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
being forced to ſhift the little child, ſhe ſaid vnto him
as the most part of mothers and nources vſe to ſay, that if hee
piſſed his clothes any more, ſhe would cut off his prick; the which
the little girle hearing many times, ſhee forgot it not: but one
day when her mother was gone vnto the wood, ſhe began to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaddle
her brother, and ſeeing that hee had piſſed his clothes,
ſhe tooke a knife and cut off his yard, wherewith he loſt ſo much
bloud that he died, afterwards ſhee told her mother at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
home what ſhe had done, who ſeeing her child dead, ſhee
was ſo ſurpriſed with anger, that ſhe tooke vp a little ſtoole, and
ſtrooke ſo great a blow therewithall vpon the girles head, that
ſhe preſently died. For the which ſhe was caried to priſon, &amp; hir
husbands brother ſuing her to death, accuſed her ſaying:</p>

of a little girle, but alſo becauſe ſhee had oftentimes
ſpoken fondly, and threatned the child fooliſhly: did
ſhe not know that whatſoeuer was ill to bee done, was
not good to be ſpoken, vpon what occaſion or intent
ſoeuer it be? And that as euery word that is ſpoken, is
eaſily imprinted in the yoong and tender hearts of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
children, ſo will they like apes imitate all that they
ſee, and as children, doe whatſoeuer they heare ſpoken:
why then did ſhe ſay before this child anie thing which
ſhould not be done? And chiefly a matter ſo dangerous
and ſo vnfitting? Did ſhe not know that children (as
being humane creatures, and ſubiect naturally vnto vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
doe keepe and remember the bad ſooner then the
good? And eſpecially the females, as being more vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

or at the leaſt by their occaſion there doe not happen
ſome other greater miſchances. If ſhe haue liued ſo

the ſame, ſhe is likewiſe worthy of death
for not doing the ſame. Of what thing ought a mother
to be more tender and charie, then of her child? Why
then could ſhee ſuffer the one to die by her negligence,
and heaping miſchiefe vpon miſchiefe, murther the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

deed to ſee a ſonne execute his father that thereby hee
might haue his owne life ſaued, a greater cruelty would
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7358:157"/>
it be for the father to kill the ſonne? Wherefore O you

but can you blame a child if to ſaue the prime time of
his youth, he doe not ſpare the withered age of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe yeares are not manie, and they miſerable?
For to ſay the truth, age is an incurable maladie; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

be my deſtruction: if you haue anie children, conſider
then what our miſerie is? And if you haue none, learn
of thoſe which haue them, what the affection of fathers
towards their children is? And then may you know
that the extremitie of the choice which we haue beene

as are wicked and malefactors, for as to afflict the good

excelling all others of his time, who hauing
made wonderfull experiences of his art (for no

liue man, that he might perfectly know the motion of the heart,
wherevpon hee made diuers and ſundrie requeſts vnto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat

but he could neuer obtaine the ſame at their hands, for the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians
are by nature not only pittifull, but alſo ſomewhat ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſticious.
But theſe refuſals did but the more encreaſe the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of this Chirurgion: for to ſay the truth, euery haulty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are in that like vnto women, who doe for the moſt part couet
after that which they are forbidden to touch. So that hee being
ſtill in this rauing or rather longing, there came vnto his doore
a poore ſouldiour, very well proportioned and of a ſound bodie,
comming newly from the wars, and demanded his almes of the
Chirurgion, who cauſed him to come in, and cheriſhed him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
ſome three daies after his owne fantaſie, afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

him aliue, he ſaw that in him which he ſo greatly deſired,
but as no murther can euer remaine vndiſcloſed long, ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that one of his confederats was taken for ſome other
crime, and being vpon the racke, he amongſt other matters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
the murther which he, his companions, and the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
had committed wherevpon they were all taken, and the
Chirurgion confeſsed the fact, ſaying:</p>
               <p>TRue it is moſt iuſt Iudge, and you worthie Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
that I haue ben the death of one man to ſaue

the liues of an infinit number of others, not onelie by
the cures which I hope to performe during my life, but
by that which I will leaue behind mee in writing after
my death: wherefore it may bee ſaid that hauing made
an experience ſo notable and profitable, I haue done
worthilie, but hauing killed a guiltles man I haue done
wickedly. I confeſſe it, and would confeſſe to haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
more hainouſlie, if I had not more then once

haue beene allowed to make this triall vpon ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
malefactor, the which I was neuer permitted
to doe: ſome one may anſwere, muſt you therefore kill
an innocent? Or doe that by your owne authoritie,
which a whole Senate would neuer allow? Doe you
thinke that your authoritie alone is greater, or your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
more then all theirs together? God forbid wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
lords, that I ſhould euer preſume anie ſuch matter;
but I dare &amp; that trulie affirme that it is lawfull for Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions
to doe many things which is not decent to be
allowed by the Senators: nay, they would abhorre to
heare it but mentioned; what a thing were it if at all

muſt bee cut off, to ſaue the reſt of the bodie, that

verie odious vnto the Senators, being vnskilfull
of the profit of that art: therefore all things which are

be any further reuealed, which for a good intent &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7358:160"/>
the innocencie of him vpon whom this trial hath
ben made, there is no proofe nor any certainty thereof,
but rather manie preſumptions to the contrarie: for
firſt he had a bad countenance, hee came from the wars
which is a place wherevnto one goeth to no other end
but to kill, or to be killed, he left his captain in the midſt
of his wars, without either leaue or paſport from him,
which is a manifeſt proofe that hee was attainted of
ſome notable crime, or els is worthie ſo to be for flying
from the field, or not performing ſuch duties as ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
are ſworne to obſerue; for none ought to bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnto anie thing without doing his indeuor to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the ſame; He was poor and oppreſſed with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
wherefore I may ſay that his death hath ſaued their
liues whom it may bee hee would haue robbed by the
high waies: for commonly thoſe which are idelly
brought vp in the wars, doe neuer deſire to gaine their
liuing by an honeſt trade or exerciſe, ſo that in the end
they become fit to furniſh the gallows. If then his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
haue induced mee and mooued my mind vnto his

within a ſhort time after as hee went together with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

why wilt not thou ſubmit thy ſelfe vnto her choice,

thee with mine eies and my teares, ſeeing then
that by two ſeuerall meanes thou wert refuſed, and that
no bodie agreed that thou ſhouldeſt haue her, how
canſt thou denie that thou tookeſt her by force? Alas, I
doe leſſe grieue at my loſſe by ſea, then I am ſorrie for

the ſhip could not arriue without wracking, ſo as not in

was twiſe caſt away by the loſſe of my daughter, euen
when I was wet, and being aſtoniſhed with the ſea, and

that I haue taken her againſt her will, nor againſt thy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
for by the lawes ſilence is a conſent; concerning
thy teares, I tooke them for a good token, beleeuing
that they proceeded for ioy, not only that thou haddeſt
eſcaped drowning, but to ſee that in ſo great miſerie I
did not yet diſdaine to be thy ſonne in law, as alſo that
thou wert ioiful to behold my conſtancie in louing thy

of ſadneſſe, but ſometimes tokens of ioy, and eſpecially
when they are accompanied with ſilence, for ſorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth
a man to ſpeake, and ioy prouoketh ſilence. As

that my ſheepeheards made that fire for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
without thinking to hurt anie man thereby.
And for the marriage it was ſolemnized as commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie
as the place could afford. And it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at, if one who hath long time loued moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentlie,

minute a month; and fearing to loſe the good ſo
much of them deſired, they can hardlie beleeue that
which they both ſee and touch. I will willinglie ſubmit
my ſelfe to the law, but I will not that thou ſhouldeſt
haue the credit to compel me in anie ſort. Thou haſt no
cauſe to complaine of thy ſhipwracke, ſeeing that from
the ſame two holie actions haue proceeded, that is to
ſay, hoſpitalitie, and mariage, I offered thee the one, and
intreated thee for the other. Thou art deceiued if thou
thinkeſt that I will loue thee or thy daughter anie whit
the more, my life hauing ben once in your power, the
loue which I doe beare vnto her is great inough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing that all the warlike men of Greece haue
done you this honour, aboue ſo manie other
noble and worthie men, to chuſe you onlie for

and periured man ſo wickedlie betray them? Doe
you not yet know that the gods wil neuer permit a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſo great and manifeſt to be hidden, and eſpeciallie
when they themſelues are intereſſed therein? Know
you not that <hi>Diana</hi> requireth your daughter for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7358:168"/>
it may be to puniſh your ambition, or to chaſtiſe
the pride of your wife, or rather to extirpate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the ſame your daughter? Trulie I beleeue
if none of all theſe three reaſons doe prouoke the chaſt
Goddeſſe vnto iuſt puniſhment, yet all theſe three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
doe ſtir her vp vnto a iuſt reuenge; iuſt I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the gods doe neuer anie thing vniuſtlie: but
who knoweth if the goddeſſe (foreſeeing the future laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiouſneſſe
of your daughter) be determined to haue
her before ſhe be ſtained, or els that ſhe deſireth to haue
an vnſpotted virgine to be offered vp vnto her, that ſhe
might be the more fauorable vnto vs, and make vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
ouer the rauiſher of the chaſtitie of <hi>Helena;</hi> for
whoſe defence you and all the nobilitie of Greece were
bounden, before ſhe did chuſe me for her lord and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
and yet whileſt I was abſent, you ſuffered her to
be rauiſhed &amp; caried away, which maketh me to thinke
that the Goddeſſe being diſpleaſed with you, is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to haue the ſame fault purged in the preſence of all
the Grecians, by the death of your daughter. Finallie,
the iudgements of the gods are ſecret, but when their
wils are manifeſt, they ought to be accompliſhed. The
goddeſſe requireth <hi>Iphiginia,</hi> you haue promiſed her,
we doe looke for her, therefore we ought to haue her;
eſpeciallie ſeeing all the skill that man hath is notable
to prolong her life one onlie minute againſt the will of
the gods: and although you might ſaue her, yet ought
you not to preferre her life either before ſo manie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Grecians, or before the honour of all Greece. But
why ſhould all the reſt of <hi>Priams</hi> ſonnes, or anie other
Barbarian feare to enterpriſe anie thing againſt vs, If it
ſhal be reported that for to ſaue, or thinking to prolong
a maidens life, the whole armie of the Grecians aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7358:169"/>
together at ſuch an infinit charge and with ſo great
trauel ſhould of it ſelf be ſo ſuddainlie diſſolued. What
ambition can be then more great, then to vſurpe the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a Generall, and not to performe the dutie therof?
And what Treaſon is more manifeſt, then to goe about
to defraud all Greece of the honour obtained by the
blood of our anceſtors? If it was thought a ſtrange
matter that <hi>Vliſſes</hi> fained himſelf mad becauſe he would
not goe vnto the warres, and if for the ſame cauſe the
parents of <hi>Achilles</hi> were diſpiſed hauing concealed him
in the habite of a woman? What ſhall wee ſay of you,
who would not onlie deceiue our armie of one or two
men, but would (if our ſelues wee will not giue it ouer)
that all of vs ſhould bee ſwallowed vp in the waues of
the ſea? Doe you not conſider that the greatneſſe of
your charge bindeth you to bee more couragious and
righteous, then all the reſt? Who then will iudge you
to be ſuch a one, if you repugne againſt the will of the
gods? If you contrarie the deſire of al men? and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anie ſhame at all, performe not your promiſe? If it
be ſo, I dare ſay the Grecians are vnhappie in chuſing
ſuch a Generall, and you an vnhappie Generall ſeeing
that by your default the Grecians ſhal loſe their ancient
reputation. You may ſay that a fathers loue is great; I
agree therevnto, ſo ought ſuch as are higheſt in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(as you would be) condiſcend vnto great things, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie
when as reaſon requireth: conſider then for
whom you doe giue your daughter, it is for the honour
of your brother to recouer your ſiſter in law, for beautie
the onlie paragon of all the world. It is to be reuenged
of our enemies for the ſafetie of our countrie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the ancient valor of our nation, to winne vnto
your ſelfe an immortall glorie, and that which is more
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7358:169"/>
then all the reſt, to fulfill the good pleaſure of the gods:

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as you are bound) to obey their diuine power,

laſciuiouſneſſe, nor your owne negligence; wherevnto
neither the Grecians, I, nor my daughter are in no ſort
bound. For you needed not to haue receiued <hi>Paris,</hi> the
ſonne of a barbarous king into your houſe, much leſſe
to entertaine him there a long time, and leaſt of all to
leaue him at your departure all alone with your wife:
Do you not know that it is verie dangerous to leaue fire
and flax together? Are you ſuch a foole that you know
not how yoong men are laſciuious, and women light?
But who knoweth not that ambition and luſt reſpect no

beautie, which not onlie inflamed you, but all Greece
was as able to ſet a yoong Barbarian on fire, who was

ſaue onlie the word of an old man, who either do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
or it may be would haue this honour, that at his

the gods deſire the beſt things for ſacrifice, for that is
meant onlie by brute beaſts, but as for humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

tendeth vnto that which is good, and the other vnto
that which is bad. If <hi>Diana</hi> require her death, ſhee may

giue that the ſeas ſhall bee calme by the death of my

although he would ſo doe, is thoſe few years which an
old man may liue to bee compared vnto the youth of a
Princeſſe, who by her progenie will be able to illuſtrate
all the world? To kill our owne children is not the way
to combate <hi>Priam</hi> and the reſt of the Barbarians: I wil
not faile in anie ſort from the dutie of a good Generall,

that will I not giue no more then you your ſelfe would

no way culpable of the forced or voluntarie adulterie
of her aunt. The ſame reaſon which commandeth mee
to be couragious, doth alſo forbid me to be cruell: but
what crueltie can be more vild then to kill an innocent
virgin? And how much more execrable is it, for a man
to kill his owne daughter? I did at the firſt promiſe her,

miſerable? Wherein hee hath ſhewed himſelfe much

and reward and puniſhment are the true pillers of the

that the zeale of the Commonwealth can induce anie

his ſiſter was excuſable for ſaying that which ſhe

that are neere vnto you: wherfore although we ſhould
not allow that which the <hi>Fabij</hi> haue done, yet may it
bee a queſtion whether they haue done amiſſe or no in
reſiſting the common enemies of all Italie, ſeeing that
an hundred yeares ſince, your anceſtors leauing their
naturall countrie, came firſt and occupied the countrie
of the Taurins, afterwards that of the Inſubrians, then
the limits of Tuſcane, and now without anie reaſon
you would vſurpe the territories of the Cluſians, the

they haue had that afterwards you would haue beene
good friends, or peaceable neighbours vnto them; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that you are of opinion being ſtrong men, al things

aſſuring you that wee are ſufficient to puniſh or chaſtiſe

if you ſhew your ſelues (as in effect you haue begun) to

them anie hurt at your inſtance. But what madneſſe
dooth incite you to come in ſuch ſort againſt vs? You
know well that if we had ben minded to ſend aid vnto
the Cluſians, we would not haue ſent three men onlie.
Wherefore we thinking you had ben our friends, did
ſend to intreat you not to hurt the Cluſians, but doing
contrarie to our requeſt, the Embaſſadors thought you
had ben our enemies, and ſo conſequentlie that they
were bound to aid the Cluſians. When you haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
your armie from vs, wee will diſpute whether
they did well or ill: But ſo long as you talke thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
wee may ſay that you haue no deſire to haue vs
your friends. Of a truth they fought againſt our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
yet neuer imagine you that for al the ſame, we wil

As for the anger of the gods, it ſtretcheth not to

that maketh mention thereof, it is a token that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I haue done is no crime, for there is ſome law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for euerie fault: for as lawes are made for the

of pittie then puniſhment? Nay who knowes not that
loue hath alwaies his abiding in the nobleſt hearts, and
compelleth the moſt obſtinat to follow him? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
the diſtance of places is not able to ſeperate that
true loue which of long time hath ben imprinted in the
hearts of louers, for as he that doth loue feruentlie doth
ſildome or neuer forget it, ſo ought youth to bee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for doing but their kind: for that which in matters
of loue is lawfull for yoong men to doe, is vnlawfull for
old men to deſire; Wherfore it may be ſaid, that as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
is it for a yoong man to be without loue, as it is
for an old man to be in loue: and the more worthie the
thing beloued is, the more vehement is our deſire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
therfore the deſert of her who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I loue, hath brought
me to this extremitie: to counterfait a ſex inferior vnto
mine, the which I would for no other thing haue done,
but hereby it appeareth, that the louer liueth in the
thing beloued, and that he is dead in himſelfe; ſo that I
was conſtrained to find out this inuention, to approch
vnto her in whom I liue: for water farre of, doth neuer
quench fire hard at hand: the planets doe chieflie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
vs to loue, therefore doth <hi>Venus</hi> ſhew her ſelfe to be
more ſtrong then <hi>Mars:</hi> and that which is more, no
other law then that of nature can be giuen vnto louers:
for it ſeemeth that loue is a diuine and humane eſſence
all in one ſubiect, wherby it happeneth, that true louers
are moſt apt to ſuſtaine great trauailes, for loue is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

was I inforced to become ſuch as my miſtris was. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
being conſtrained by all theſe aboueſaid reaſons, I
am more then excuſable, for of all the parts in a mans
bodie, the heart is the nobleſt, and the nobleſt part of
the heart is loue: therfore it may be verie well affirmed,
that he which knoweth not how to loue well, hath a
bad heart. To conclude, it muſt be conſidered for what
intent vowes are made, as for mee I made mine to the
intent that I might bee neere vnto my beſt beloued; in
ſeeking to depriue me of this intention my vow ſhould
be broken, and if it be ſo, I will make no other: but you
cannot ſay that it is all one vow, ſeeing that there is
great difference betweene the obeying of a man, &amp; the
ſeruing of a woman, &amp; religious men ought to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and to haue ſuch other perfections whereof I am
not capable; whereas amongſt religious women obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
onlie with humility is ſufficient, for which cauſe
I will not make anie other vow then that which I haue
made: but as I ſaid at the firſt, I ſubmit my ſelfe to bee

being as thou art vnworthie of ſo great a fauour: but I
intended by this meanes to manifeſt by your owne
tongue your wicked intention, to the end that you
might bee worthilie puniſhed therefore, and neuer ſay
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7358:183"/>
that if no law mention of the like fault as yours is, that
therefore you ſhould remaine vnpuniſhed, for it may
be there was neuer ſuch a curſed deed heard of before,
or the lawmakers thinking that ſuch a fact could neuer
bee committed made no mention thereof: as <hi>Licurgus</hi>
made no law againſt ſuch as murthered their Parents,
imagining that none could bee ſo wicked as to commit
ſuch a crime, therefore would he not mention ſuch a
deteſtable deed: but doe you thinke that for all that the
Lacedemonions would haue left to puniſh thoſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſlie
which ſhould haue committed the ſame, &amp; that
they would not haue inflicted a puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as rigorous
as the fact was rare? No doubt they would: for when
offences are execrable, the puniſhments muſt bee the
more extreame, to ſtop altogether the paſſage vnto ſuch
vices; and eſpeciallie in ſuch a caſe where the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not publicke, it were moſt expedient that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
ſhould be ſecret, but the more ſeuere, that the
ſame being knowne of few men, the crime might bee
leſſe manifeſt, and the terror of the puniſhment more
great. For ſo during the Conſulſhip of <hi>Terentius Varo,
Lucius Cantilius</hi> Chancelor to the Biſhops hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
adulterie with <hi>Florania</hi> a Veſtall Nunne, was (in
the place called Comicia, the gates being locked vp) ſo
beaten with rods by the biſhop, that hee died with the
blowes; which ought to ſerue as well for an example as
a law vnto this fellow, whoſe fault is more foule. What
puniſhment then ſhall be ſufficient for your adulterie?
Whereof you ſeeme chieflie to boaſt and to approoue
the ſame by your reaſons no leſſe friuolous then dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
by the which it ſhould ſeeme (by your ſaying)
that inceſts and adulteries ought not to bee blamed,
prouided that thereby the generation of mankind bee
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:7358:183"/>
encreaſed: alaſſe, how more happie were it that neither
you nor ſhe had euer been borne, then that you ſhould
be the occaſion of ſuch a ſcandale, ſeeing that it were
better that he which ſcandalizeth the leaſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
were throwne into the ſea with a milſtone about
his necke; What doe you call loue? A vild carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence,
As much, or more common vnto brute
beaſts, then vnto reaſonable men, who cannot vſe it
lawfullie, but onelie in marriage, to the end to bring
forth children: Wherefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth verie well
ſay, That Whoredome is ſurely one of the greateſt ſins
and moſt hurtfull vnto man, ſeeing that euerie other ſin
is without him, and whoredome conſumeth both his
bodie and his ſoule, making him the one halfe of an
harlot, when he is created for no other cauſe but to bee
the Temple and dwelling place of God. Why doe you
not ſay then in ſteed of your leaſings, that an harlot is a
hell, wherein God ſuffereth thoſe which forget him to
bee drowned, and that filthineſſe is the reward for the
infidelitie of men? O wicked wretch, how dareſt thou
then looke vp into heauen, or behold the earth, the one
being the ſeat, the other the footſtoole of God? Whom
becauſe thou doeſt forget, thou art vnworthie of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
If whoredome committed with profane women
be deteſtable, what ſhall wee ſay of adulterie with ſuch
as are religious, who are conſecrated to God? Seeing
that the Romanes, when as yet they were ignorant of
the truth, did burie their Veſtall Nunnes quick, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
themſelues to be defiled? You ſay wel, That louers
are blind of vnderſtanding; ſee then the cauſe why
thoſe are to be puniſhed which ſuffer themſelues to fall
into ſuch blindneſſe, that proceedeth of nothing but
idleneſſe &amp; gluttonie which prouoketh luxuritie: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7358:184"/>
ought you to haue ſhunned theſe two vices, but
you might haue eſcaped the third, the which as you
haue ſought it, ſo are you fallen into it. Surelie, all men
are tempted, and the greateſt temptation, is not to be
tempted at all, becauſe then we forget to be men, but
vertue appeareth in the reſiſting againſt temptation,
which you hauing neglected, you haue not only temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but defiled the ſpouſe of Chriſt: What fire or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may expiate ſo vild and abominable wickednes?
And ſurelie you haue refuſed (as one that is vnworthy)
to doe pennance in religion, hauing firſt defiled the
ſame, making the holie vow thereof to ſerue for a cloke
vnto your filthineſſe. Let then the bull of <hi>Perillus</hi> be put

ſo be you the firſt that muſt bee puniſhed more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſlie

your adulterie (the like whereof was neuer heard) is the

foorth few men which are well affected to the Spaniſh
nation: who to ſay the truth, being worthie men, are

doe attribute vnto their pride, which is the chiefeſt
cauſe why they doe for the moſt part hate them: wee
will not be inquiſitiue whether heretofore <hi>Don Ferrand</hi>
hath been the cauſe of the death of a number of other
Spaniards, but we may well ſay that he hath made thoſe

death that might be imagined, without anie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Counſell, or conſent of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as if men were nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

that he did not ſee what paines was taken in Spaine to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7358:185"/>
aſſemble ſuch a number of ſouldiors together, what ſtir
there was to embarke them, how hardlie they croſſed
the ſeas, and what time was ſpent in diſciplining them
for the warres, all which things was not done without
great charge and expence vnto the Emperour, and the
daunger of their owne perſons; and they were no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
deliuered ouer to <hi>Don Ferrand,</hi> thorowlie furniſhed
and readie for the warres (as if they had ſprung forth of
the earth in one night, like vnto Muſhromes) but that
he did preſentlie thruſt them not onlie into all the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
dangers that might be, when as manie times there
was no great occaſion: but alſo becauſe he would be
reuenged for the faults of ſome few of them, he hath
done them all vnto the cruelleſt death that he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.
But wee would demaund of him how it could be
poſſible that they ſhould be all culpable, and whether
they were all authors of ſedition? For that is not onelie
hard, but impoſſible: had it not beene better then for
him to haue puniſhed the authors, that therby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
might haue beene terrified or chaſtiſed, and the
good cheriſhed and maintained? Or if he would needs
haue had them to die, could hee not haue ſent them
forth vpon the foe? Where reuenging their death, they
might at the leaſt haue weakened his forces. We read
indeed how the Romans tithed their mutined ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and vſed other like puniſhments, but it was neuer
ſeen or heard that they put them all to death; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
in Spaine vnder the conduct of Scipio, where
there was not onelie a mutenie, but alſo <hi>Vmbrius Atrius,</hi>
and <hi>Calemus Albius</hi> tooke vpon them the authoritie of
Conſuls by the agreement and at the inſtance of the
ſouldiours, yet were none puniſhed but the authors
of the deed, and the reſt were paied, emploied, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7358:186"/>
allowed for good ſouldiours, not becauſe the Romans
had not as good meanes to ſend other ſouldiours from
Rome into Spaine (and better then wee haue now to
ſend out of Spaine into Italie) but this was the reaſon:
the Generall was a Romane, and he not hating the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was onlie contented to puniſh a few of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
&amp; by the ſeueritie of that exemplarie puniſhment,
to terrifie and feare the reſt: for it is verie certaine, that
thoſe which are threatened doe liue better then thoſe
which are puniſhed, for the puniſhment being done,
the feare is paſt, and oftentimes it engendereth ſuch a
malice, as maketh them to commit farre greater faults
then the firſt; as (it may be) the effect ſhall bee ſeene by
thoſe which by ſome meanes may chance to eſcape
from thoſe Iſlands: doe but imagine if there had but a
few ben puniſhed, what dutifull men thoſe which had
ben pardoned would haue prooued, to ſhew that they
were worthie of pardon, and to cauſe their paſſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to be forgotten? But yet if all this could not haue
moued him to ſpare them, yet ſhould hee haue done it
becauſe it is ſo difficult a matter to draw verie often
manie men foorth of Spaine, where there is no great
ſtore, as alſo for the great treaſure that is needfull to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
and conduct them, which is alwaies a great charge
both vnto the countrie and the people: but what care
haue the Italians thereof, being borne farre from Spain,
and naturall enemies to our nation becauſe they are
more valiant then anie other? for which cauſe as I haue
ſaid alreadie the Italians call them prowd, as if a great
fire could be without ſome ſmoak. And conſequently it
may appeare that although ſome Italians doe ſerue <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
yet are they neuertheleſſe mortall enemies to the
Spaniards: for they being indeed as prowd as they are
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7358:186"/>
cruell, cannot abide this worthie and valiant nation: for
proofe whereof, what crueltie (ioined with pride) was
there euer more great then this of <hi>Don Ferrand,</hi> who
hath not at the leaſt ſpared thoſe, who would haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
their liues for the ſafetie &amp; defence of his? But
he hath likewiſe cauſed the innocent to periſh together
with the offender; he doth plainlie ſhew that he (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the example of <hi>Nero</hi>) would deſire that al Spain
had but one head, that he might cut it off at one blow:
therefore muſt wee for an example preuent by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuch minds no leſſe dangerous then diueliſh, to
the end that other ſtrangers being captains in the wars,
may hereafter conſider, that oftentimes ſuch a number

of all Chriſtendome. I paſſe ouer the cauſes that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
doe moſt commonlie giue vnto their ſouldiours
to mutenie, one whiles becauſe they are not paied as
well as they, and otherwhiles when they detaine the
beſt part of their contributions and other booties that
ought to bee giuen vnto them; remembring not that
the ſouldiours doe with the price of their blood often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
buy thoſe victories, whereof the Generals reape
the honour and profite; neither will acknowledge
how by their malice, ambition, and auarice, the victory
is oftentimes foreſlowed, or vtterly loſt, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the detriment of the profit, honor, and life of the
poore ſouldiors: and therefore to conclude, I ſay that
they are right captaines who doe attaine therevnto by
degrees, and by their valor, and thoſe will beware how
they commit anie ſuch cruelties like vnto this which

ſeruice, and that only by his own commandement,
who hath many times praiſed, &amp; alwaies allowed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
I haue done; ſo that to iudge me indiſcreet were
as much to taxe his Maieſtie as me: and he that would

thoſe which are ſo deſirous to be my Iudges, were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
or placed in their authoritie by the doome of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
I ſhould thinke my ſelfe happie to bee iudged by them,
although I am not bounden to render vnto them anie
account of my military actions, and eſpeciallie becauſe
the deed which I haue done was allowed by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who
onlie might haue puniſhed me if the fact had been vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt:
but his Maieſtie doth verie well know that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is lawfull to doe a little harme, to ſhun thereby
a greater hurt: and I will further ſay, that if long before
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7358:187"/>
this time ſuch ſouldiors as did mutenie had been puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
very ſeuerely, I ſhould not now haue ben inforced
to execute this puniſhment, more notable then any that
heretofore hath beene performed. And although I am
not bound to iuſtifie my ſelfe for that deed, before the
Counſell of Spaine, yet will I not let to ſhew that I am
not ſo faultie, as they doe thinke me to be, for if I were,
<hi>Caeſar</hi> is ſo iuſt as I ſhould not be free from puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
for firſt of all the lords of the Counſell ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what they be that accuſe me, whether they be not
ſome of the parties, and their parents, or friends, who
doe as well ſhew their ignorance as their impudencie,
when they affirme that they were as good ſeruitors to
<hi>Caeſar</hi> as I, and that the Generall could not bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſouldiours, as if they themſelues being amuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
were not compelled to make a Generall amongſt
them. I know verie well that a number would willingly
command, yet there are but a few which know how to
doe it, neither can anie perrorme that place, but ſuch as
haue firſt learned how to obey. Whereof I may vaunt,
if <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould haue appointed the meaneſt of thoſe
whom I haue puniſhed to be my General, I would haue
had ſuch reſpect &amp; ben ſo dutifull vnto him as I ought,
beleeuing that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would neuer haue authoriſed him
without deſert: neither was I euer ſo preſumptuous as
to truſt more vnto my birth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto true vertue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well that <hi>Caeſar</hi> fauoureth none but the vertuous.
Likewiſe, I learned both how to obey, and alſo what
was militarie diſcipline before that euer I commanded,
and neuer doubt that the noble are more-ſeuere in
commanding, then are the comminaltie, for none is
more prowd then hee which of a baſe groome becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
a gentleman. God grant the Counſell be not full
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7358:188"/>
of ſuch men, and that they bee not ſuch as are more
vicious then curious of the reputation of their houſes.
I will not argue whether <hi>Hanniball</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi> did well,
but I may truly ſay that <hi>Marius,</hi> as one ignoble, made
the way for <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ouerthrow (as you ſay)
the Romane Commonwealth: for hee and <hi>Silla</hi> were
examples vnto the two aboue rehearſed. It is well
knowne that <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla</hi> did by little and little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto places of dignitie, being but meanly borne,
yet ceaſſed they not to be exceeding prowd, hurtfull, &amp;
odious vnto their countrie. And a little before them
<hi>Terentius Varo</hi> who being the ſonne of a butcher, did
by degrees attaine vnto the place of Conſull, had not
he I pray you ben likely by his raſhneſſe to haue cauſed
the ouerthrow of Rome, if <hi>Hanniball</hi> after the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture
at Cannas had purſued the victorie? Neither was
it <hi>Hanniball</hi> that cauſed the ruine of Carthage, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Senators, being no leſſe ſeuere then ambitious
and cruell, who did crucifie their Generals if the wars
proſpered not according to their minds; which was the
cauſe that after the battaile againſt <hi>Scipio</hi> was loſt, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
could not abide in ſafetie in the cittie, the which (it
may bee) hee had conſerued, if the Senators had beene
like vnto thoſe of Rome, who were alwaies mild, whoſe
example all counſellors of eſtate ought to follow; and
they would no doubt bee like vnto them if they did all
know ſo well as the Senat of Rome, thoſe occaſions
which are offered in the warres, to enforce a man to do
ſuch things as are vnuſuall. Moreouer, it cannot be ſaid,
that I (hauing ben brought vp amongſt Spaniards, and
receiuing from them all fauour and ſincere friendſhip)
ſhould be ill affected towards them: but I may rather
ſay that their courage ought to bee ſhewed againſt their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7358:188"/>
enemies, and not againſt the Emperour, who is euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Barbarous Almaines, called the father of
ſouldiours: you are apt to rehearſe what I haue done,
but you tell not the cauſe wherefore. It is ſufficient for
the Chirurgion to proue vnto his patient why he doth
ſometimes cut off or canteriſe a member; ſo haue I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> that the mutiners ought to bee ſuppreſſed,
for feare leaſt they ſhould animate others to commit
the like Treaſon. Neither haue I cauſed them to die,
witneſſe a number that are eſcaped thence, &amp; amongſt
others foure, who did each of them beſtow a bullet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me in my lodging, but they could not touch mee
therewith, whom I haue not only pardoned for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
iniurie done vnto me, but alſo I haue further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their liues: whereby it is eaſily known that I am no
enemy to the Nation. Furthermore, it was not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to leaue them vnto the enemies mercy, becauſe that
would haue but fortified them, and weakened the glory
and courage of the nation. Neither yet is it fit to hurt
thoſe ſecretly whom one intendeth to puniſh or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe
for the terrifieng of others. As for the Romans, the
number of their amutined ſouldiours in Spaine was
great, therfore they could not vſe extremitie for feare of
loſing the reſt of the armie, and ſo conſequently all that
which the Romans held in Spaine, for many of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
there were already reuolted. Moreouer, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſouldiors were not accuſtomed to rebell ſo often
as the Spaniards, and at that time eſpecially they had
not done it if they had not ſuppoſed their Conſull <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
to be dead; and peraduenture that was the firſt
time, for ſuch was their modeſtie before that time, and
a long while after the ouerthrow of Cannas, as they
(knowing the neceſſity of their Commonwealth) the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7358:189"/>
moſt part of the ſouldiors refuſed to take pay, and they
called thoſe mercenaries which tooke the ſame, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that the good ſouldiour ought to bee as well par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the aduerſitie, as proſperity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
but thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I left in the Iſle was but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of men, the beſt of whom were dead before in the
warres: ſo as the remainder were more fit to loſe thoſe
fortreſſes where they ſhould be left in Gariſon, then to
keepe them, and both to corrupt the good ſouldiors by
their example, and alſo to cauſe a whole army to mute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
As for the wrong which therein I haue done vnto
Spain, a man may ſee (ſetting the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apart) what
ſouldiors doe come from thence, for the beſt are ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
the others are vagabonds, and cutpurſes, ſuch as
were the relickes of the beadles whip, or els ſuch as had
left their eares behind them as a pawne of their hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie;
and generally ſuch, as al theeues, or verie little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
So that to ſend ſouldiours forth of Spaine is rather
to purge and amend it then anie way to impaire it; for
there can neuer bee ſo manie of the aboueſaid men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from thence, but that the priſons are alwaies ſeene
full, and the citties are not empty of them. And you
muſt not affirm that they were not all faultie, ſeeing
that in ſuch an offence, the conſenter is as worthy to be
puniſhed as the inuenter: for they which would not be
of that faction, might ſecretly withdraw themſelues
from them, as they know well how to doe when they
flie from an aſſault or from ſome other dangerous skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
and eſpecially when their company is appointed
to ſome toileſome Gariſon, the which is then all cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſſembled vnder the coulour of being Spaniards;
Whereas ſuch faults amongſt the Almaines are moſt
grieuouſly puniſhed: but it ſeemeth that a man ſhould
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7358:189"/>
not preſume to touch the Spaniards, as if they were the
only (becauſe the lateſt) Chriſtians. Let them then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
their mutenies, who are the cauſe therof by detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their pay as you affirme, as for me, I know <hi>Caeſars</hi>
liberality can inrich me, therefore I haue nothing to do
to trouble my ſelfe with a gain no leſſe vild then vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diſhoneſt: &amp; it ſufficeth me, that the noble and
honourable men of Spaine doe know how well I loue
their nation: for I make as little account of the ſlander
of wicked men, as I would willinglie haue the praiſe of
the good, for euery one commendeth ſuch as himſelfe
is: and that which is more, I will not refuſe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch of the Counſell as haue commaunded in

I appeale vnto the others aforeſaid. During which

               <p>GOd graunt that my deuination be not true, yet
who will not beleeue, that ſome great alteration

are not only permitted to accuſed the Noble Matrons,
but alſo are ſuffered to iudge them according to their
owne fancie; ſaying (and that in the preſence of the

you will not be accounted faultie? But what would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
then if it were ſo, (as all this wicked generation of
ſlaues haue their priuate meetings and conference to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
that they had perſuaded our ſlaues to put ſome
poyſon ſecretly into our diſtillations, ſeeing that there
muſt be ſome time to performe the ſame? In drinking
the ſame, ſhould not we therby loſe both life and honor
together? And if it ſhould otherwiſe happen, that the
water did vs no hurt at al, what could this miſcheeuous
wretch loſe, ſeeing that not ſo much as her life is her
owne, but at the will and diſcretion of him or her that
hath bought her? And yet neuertheleſſe, we ſhould not
let to be the ſpectacle and by-word of the people. For
the deſire of a vild ſlaue, our innocencie ſhall be alwaies
ſuſpected, and that chiefly amongſt the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

two Noble Matrones to appeare in iudgement at the

what may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in a woman except her good

that although poyſon be diſtilled, yet can it not bee
any crime; No more then it is a fault to forge a ſword,
to make a bow and arrows, or to ſpin a halter? all which
may more eaſily be the inſtruments of death then poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
But ſhew mee what law forbiddeth the making or

each of you liſt or draw vp your legs in ſuch ſort, as I may ſay
that I haue ſeene you hanged: and afterwards ſetting your feet
downe againe vpon the table, you may vntie the towels, and ſay
that my oath is accompliſhed, but another time bee better adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The priſoners did the Earles commandement, who ſeeing
them well faſtened to the towels, threw the table to the ground,
and leauing them in that ſort hanged, he ſhut the hall dore,
where, at the laſt they were ſtrangled of themſelues: but their
kinsfolke accuſed the Earle before his Soueraigne Lord the
French King, ſaying:</p>

to haue right of your vaſſall our Earle;
who conuerteth Iuſtice into crueltie, and eſpeciallie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his gentlemen, who for their vertue and valor
are odious vnto him, the which hate ſpringeth of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe, but onlie of a feare which he hath, that they
will not alwaies endure his cruelties. For cruell men are
naturallie cowards, and conſequentlie ſubiect to feare,
which proceedeth from the ſting of their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that doth ſecretlie and continuallie accuſe them:
now how ſarre vnbeſeeming cowardiſe and feare, is for
the nature of a French man, the taking of Rome, and
winning of ſo manie Prouinces, as well in Italie, as in
Greece, Spaine, and other countries doe witneſſe; and
the rather, becauſe this warlike Nation could neuer be
ſubdued by the Romans, nor by anie others, had it not
ben for Ciuile diſcention amongſt themſelues. So that

and chiefeſt of all he which ruſeth, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hardie nor couragious, degene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of that Nation, and ſo conſequentlie maketh
himſelfe vnworthie, as being vild and abiect, the which
may be ſeene by our Earle (if he may be ſo called that is
an enemie of Nobilitie:) for what act can be more vild
in a great lord then to vſurpe and take vpon him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the hangmans office, and with his owne hands to
hang the gentlemen of his train for a light fault, which
may rather be called a tricke of youth? In Spain a man
ſhall verie hardlie find one amongſt the theeues in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which would promiſe to be a hangman fiue years,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7358:193"/>
to ſaue his life: Nay, in euerie countrie there are none
of that office but ſuch as are murtherers or theeues.
How odious then ought that office to bee vnto a free
man; but more vnto a Nobleman, and moſt of all vnto
a Prince of a countrie? who ought to be a ſpectacle vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all men, and a true patern of Nobilitie? And ſo much
the more odious is this fact, becauſe thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
hangmen, doe execute none but ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
but theſe men were hanged before they were
condemned; If our Earle will not affirme, that hee was
both accuſer, Iudge, and hangman altogether: and that
which was worſt of all, hee put them to death without
confeſſion, not ſuffering them to haue onely ſo much
leiſure as to vnburden their conſciences, but euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the coulor of ſauing them, he hath ſlain them. <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
was accuſed of the Romane Cenſors, becauſe
he being Praetor in Gaule, cauſed a malefactor to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
before him whileſt he was at ſupper, and our
Earle thinketh that hee hath not done amiſſe to hang
three Gentlemen betwixt his ſupper and his bed time,
a thing far differing from the clemencie required in a
lord ſo great; for euery lord that ruleth a country ought
to take example by the Princes of the bees, who either
haue no ſting at all, or if they haue anie, yet do they not
vſe it. Finally (if it pleaſe your Maieſty) we are not alone
wronged by this fact, for your Maieſtie hath loſt foure
ſeruants, who if need had beene, would not onlie haue
imploied their wealth and their liues for your ſeruice,
but alſo might haue induced many others to doe the
like: for a valiant Gentleman draweth mens hearts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him. The Commonwealth doth loſe therby, loſing
thoſe who either for your Maieſties ſeruice, or the
countries ſafetie, might haue ben conducters or leaders
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7358:194"/>
to the reſt. Moreouer, by ſuch liberal and noble perſons
diuers men doe gaine their liuing, and others increaſe
their wealth, but alaſſe all this notwithſtanding they are
dead, not by right, but by the Earles rigor, who was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
leaſt Iuſtice ſhould haue ben done vnto them: but
who would not tremble in hearing it onelie repeated,
that an Earles hall hath ſerued for a priſon, his table for
a ladder, the beame for a gibbet, and he for a hangman?
And yet the ſame is happened, and hee himſelfe dooth
boaſt therof, for ſuch is the cuſtome of thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
him, that of vice they make vertue, which is the
greateſt miſchiefe that can happen in a Prouince, and
chiefly when the ſame commeth from the Prince. Had
it not ben moſt reaſonable firſt to haue known whether
the fault was committed, and what was the cauſe, with
the reſt of the circumſtances therof? And then to haue
proceeded lawfully and rightlie againſt the offenders?
But it ſeemed that the Earle was afraid that hee ſhould
not haue found neither ſergeant, priſon, Iudge, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ladder, halters, nor gallowes to execute theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen:
for which cauſe he deſired that all theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
miſchiefes ſhould bee found in his hall and in his
perſon. A man may ſay that I ſpeake with ſmall reſpect
vnto my lord, but we proteſt, that from henceforth we
will neuer ſo account him, and if wee cannot obtaine
from the King the hoped remedie of our due reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we make a vow that we, our children, parents, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,

I will only ſay that they being in that ſort put to death,
their ingrateful kindred towards me haue receiued leſſe
diſhonour thereby, then if they had beene made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſpectacle to the people. Likewiſe, the nobilitie of
Flanders are become ſo inſolent, as they ſtand in no aw
at all of Iuſtice, wherefore this Iuſtice no leſſe ſuddaine
then iuſt, will make them to bethinke themſelues twice,
before they will commit the like offence againe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
you were reſolued to ſaue them either by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or otherwiſe; therefore I deſired to take away all
occaſion to ad vnto their death, not onlie yours, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
other mens deſtructions, for he may be tearmed wiſe
and vertuous, which by one ſmal miſchiefe can eſchew
farre greater miſchances: but he that dooth neuer ſo
great good vnto the ingratefull, receiueth nothing but
hate and reproch for his reward: euen ſo hath it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to me herein. If you who ſay that you are noble,
did know what nobilitie is, and wherein it conſiſteth,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7358:195"/>
you would ſay that theſe robbers were no Gentlemen,
ſeeing that gentilitie cannot be grounded but only vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vertue, and as thereby the baſe borne attaine to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
euen ſo he which continueth not therein, loſeth
that nobilitie which his father hath left him, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that hee ſhould bee vertuous: for nothing is more
pernicious in a Commonwealth then he who dooth
falſelie vſurpe the title of Nobility. I do demand of you
whether the ſonne of a good muſition may inherit his
fathers cunning &amp; renoume, chieflie to be a good mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
without learning and thorowly exerciſing of
muſicke? It ſeemeth not, if then in an art of ſo ſmall
conſequence a man cannot attaine vnto the fame or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
of his father, without he be the ſame in effect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it ſhould not preiudice the Commonwealth in
any ſort; how then can they inherit nobility, who make
no proofe therof by vertue, by the which our anceſtors
haue gained it? If nobility came but by deſcent, it
would be no leſſe weake, then of ſmall continuance,
conſidering the multitude of thoſe that die in the wars;
but vertue which doth thereby nobilitate others, doth
ſtill maintain the ſame. I haue then cauſed theſe villains
to die ſecretly for the reſpect I had vnto their kindred,
who deſired to remaine noble in following vertue, for
thoſe which doe ſwarue from it, a man may rightly ſay
that nobility doth end in them, and they which follow
it cannot chuſe but be noble indeed: the which <hi>Cicero</hi>
knew very well how to applie when <hi>Claudius</hi> ſaid vnto
him that he was no gentleman; Truly (ſaid he) in me
doth the nobilitie of my race begin to bud, as in you
the gentrie of your ſtocke is alreadie blaſted. And ſince
that I being ſo exceedingly bound vnto vertue, as God
hath made me by birth more noble and greater then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7358:195"/>
other of my countrie, I haue done but my dutie in
executing good, ſpeedie, and ſhort Iuſtice: for Iuſtice
ſurely is not the leaſt kind of vertue, and not to execute
Iuſtice were cruelty, wherefore I am not cruell, much
leſſe a coward, neither doe they ſpeake the truth which
doe ſay that I am an enemie to gentlemen, or that I fear
them, but I am indeed an enemie to the vicious, and I
fear leaſt they ſhould hurt the good, or that they ſhould
be corrupted by them: now haue I been their executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or hangman as you affirme, but they themſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their deſerts haue ben the butchers of their
owne liues; and were it otherwiſe, yet is he rather a
hangman which robbeth or killeth an honeſt man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is he which executeth malefactors. This Spaniſh pittie
proceedeth of no other cauſe, but onely for that they
would not execute thoſe which are of their profeſſion,
yet to betray or murther good men they are nothing
ſcrupulous. The Prince of a countrie cannot ſhew anie
better example then in performing Iuſtice, the which I
haue done: And know you that the Iudges are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
but where the Prince is not preſent: for proofe
whereof, <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe iudged cauſes, yet no other
but the King can iudge me. As for <hi>Flaminius,</hi> he put a
condemned man to death vpon pleaſure, onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
an harlot, but I haue executed foure to obſerue Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
But for any ſeruice that they might haue done for
the King, a man may as well ſay the like of all other
theeues: for ſuch people can eaſilie aſſemble a great
number of ſuch worthleſſe &amp; lewd fellows as they are.
Likewiſe, it is not a ſmall miſchiefe that prodigalitie is
wrongfully held for liberalitie, as if the prodigall did
not commit a thouſand miſchiefes, to get wherewith to
performe their follies, as theſe foure did, who by their
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7358:196"/>
prodigality became theeues. Wherefore it may be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that they and ſuch as would maintaine them, are
thoſe that eſteeme vice to be vertue, and villaines to be
Gentlemen. As for the ſmall reſpect that you haue vſed
in ſlandering me, it is therein that I may ſhew my cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
for it is true Magnanimitie to pardon great
faults, eſpecially when none is offended therby, by on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he which pardoneth the ſame, as I doe not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
you, but alſo doe further beſeech the King not to
puniſh you, becauſe it may bee at your owne choice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to remaine in your countrie or to forſake the ſame;
not for that I care for ſuch ſubiects as you are which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
me to be their lord, but becauſe I would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

ſhould be beleeued concerning the dead; But it may
pleaſe the Kings Maieſtie to bee better informed vpon
this matter, if it ſhall not like his highneſſe to credite
thoſe informations as are moſt true, which I doe here

euery man might be aſſured of his owne; but ſince
deceit hath taken place, neuer wonder if obligations
are made more rigorous &amp; ſtrict then they were wont,
ſeeing that although the bonds are made neuer ſo
ſtrong, yet can no man be very certaine that he ſhal not
be a loſer. It ſeemeth at the firſt ſight, that it is a thing no
leſſe ſtrange then cruel, to bind a man to pay a pound of
the fleſh of his bodie, for want of money: Surely, in
that it is a thing not vſuall, it appeareth to be ſomewhat
the more admirable, but there are diuers others that are
more cruell, which becauſe they are in vſe ſeeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
terrible at all: as to bind al the bodie vnto a moſt
lothſome priſon, or vnto an intollerable ſlauerie, where
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7358:197"/>
not only the whole bodie but alſo al the ſences and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

&amp; euen amongſt Chriſtians it hath ben ſeene, that

in the Roman Commonwealth, ſo famous for laws and

with torments the free Cittizens: How manie of
them (do you thinke) would haue thought themſelues
happie, if for a ſmall debt they might haue ben excuſed
with the paiment of a pound of their fleſh? Who ought
then to maruile if a Iew requireth ſo ſmall a thing of
a Chriſtian, to diſcharge him of a good round ſumme?
A man may aske why I would not rather take ſiluer of
this man, then his fleſh: I might alleage many reaſons,
for I might ſay that none but my ſelfe can tell what
the breach of his promiſe hath coſt me, and what I haue
thereby paied for want of money vnto my creditors, of
that which I haue loſt in my credit: for the miſerie or
thoſe men which eſteeme their reputation, is ſo great,
that oftentimes they had rather indure any thing ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

they would not be both ſhamed and harmed. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
I doe freely confeſſe, that I had rather loſe a

cracked: I might alſo ſay that I haue need of this fleſh
to cure a friend of mine of a certaine maladie, which is
otherwiſe incurable, or that I would haue it to terrifie
thereby the Chriſtians for euer abuſing the Iewes anie
more hereafter: but I will onelie ſay, that by his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he oweth it me. It is lawfull to kill a ſouldior if he
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:7358:197"/>
come vnto the warres but an houre too late, and alſo to
hang a theefe though he ſteale neuer ſo little: is it then
ſuch a great matter to cauſe ſuch a one to pay a pound
of his fleſh, that hath broken his promiſe manie times,
or that putteth another in danger to loſe both credit &amp;
reputation, yea and it may be life and al for greife? were
it not better for him to loſe that which I demand, then
his ſoule, alreadie bound by his faith? Neither am I to
take that which he oweth me, but he is to deliuer it me:
And eſpeciallie becauſe no man knoweth better then
he where the ſame may be ſpared to the leaſt hurt of his

thereby happen to loſe his life: what a matter were it
then, if I ſhould cut of his priuie members, ſuppoſing
that the ſame would altogether weigh a iuſt pound? Or
els his head, ſhould I be ſuffered to cut it off, although
it were with the danger of mine owne life? I beleeue I
ſhould not; becauſe there were as little reaſon therein,
as there could be in the amends wherevnto I ſhould be

               <p>O Immortall gods, O heauen, O earth, and you other
Elements, O you planets and ſtarres, true witneſſes
of my iuſt ſorrow, and you men partakers of this great
miſchiefe, (if it had not ben diſcouered) giue eare vnto
the words, which vnto my great griefe I am conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to vtter. Who would euer haue thought that anie
of the Grecian princes had had ſo vild a heart as that
he would for gold ſeeke to betray his companions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their allies and ſubiects? but alaſſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the expectation of all, the ſame is entred into the
heart of one onlie. O gods, our conſeruors, I render vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you immortall thanks, for bringing me (in a manner
againſt my will) vnto theſe warres, ſeeing that I muſt
be your inſtrument to ſaue all this armie, pretending to
performe a moſt iuſt cauſe, and yet neuertheleſſe betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by one of the princes thereof. It is not ſaid in vain,
that thoſe which ſerue the gods, doe by their grace ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
wiſdome, and become familiar with them; euen
ſo I, who from my youth haue beene ſo happie as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,

this recompence therefore, as that my heart dooth

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7358:200"/>
therefore I was in doubt to come vnto this warre,
ſeeing that I did as it were perceiue that all the armie
ſhould be in danger to bee loſt by Treaſon: but it hath
pleaſed the gods to make me the meanes to diſcloſe the
traitor; but muſt I tel who it is? Yes ſurely, for our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
weale is to be preferred before all friendſhip, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,

my ſelfe did know therof, I would not only accuſe him,
but I would alſo caſt the firſt ſtone at him to ſtone him
to death, as well for my countries ſafetie as for becauſe
he had in ſuch ſort ſtained our ſtock: neuertheleſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

the reward of this my ſeruice, that he whom I ſhall tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
name may ſerue for an euerlaſting example of the
Grecians clemencie by ſauing his life, the which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
great princes is nothing ſo much eſteemed as
honour: for the remembrance of his fault will be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
ſeuere inough, and the granting vnto him his
life, will inforce him to employ the ſame to achieue
ſome notable act, thereby to extinguiſh the memorie of
his paſſed lault, ſo that your pittie ſhall bring you a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
frute, that is to ſay, profit, and glorie. Grant then my
requeſt O you Grecians, whereof I am not vnworthie,
conſidering the maniefold good ſeruices which I haue
done for you, by the which I doe coniure you, as alſo
by thoſe which I may hereafter performe, if you doe
bind me by this gracious fauour which I doe intreat of
you. Alaſſe, I perceiue you are all ſilent, but I know not
whether it is becauſe you are aſtoniſhed at the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the matter, or els (which the gods forbid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
none of you wil condiſcend vnto the interceſſion
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7358:200"/>
which I make for him whom you doe not yet know?
If you will not whollie graunt my requeſt herein, yet at
the leaſt aſſure me that the chaſtiſement ſhall not bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to the crime, but that the rigor of law ſhall be mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
by lenitie. You make no anſwer at all, Grecians,
wherefore I feare me leaſt this danger wil draw you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ouer great rigor: ſurely the fault is great, but in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
the ſame your mercie ſhall bee the more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
for it is a common thing to pardon ſmal offences,
and it behooueth thoſe that are noble and great men to
pardon thoſe faults as are of great importance ſuch as
this is; Truſt me, if you continue your ſilence anie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
you will prouoke me alſo to hold my peace, for as I
would be glad to ſaue the whole armie, ſo would I bee
ſorrie to cauſe the death of anie of the princes. But I
plainlie perceiue that I muſt take your ſilence as a token
of your conſent, and ſo conſequentlie that the zeale of
the Commonwealth and the ſafetie of all you, ought to
be preferred before the aſſurance which I require: mark
then my words well without paſſion, which I feare to
bee too true: It is ſo that ſome of our ſecret friends
which are in Troy (whom I would not credite, if I did
not thorow lie know their integritie) haue aſſured mee
that <hi>Palamedes</hi> during theſe ordinarie skirmiſhes, hath
vnder the coulor of fighting with the enemies, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with them to burne the Grecian Nauie, to the end
that the armie being void of all ſuccours or hope, ſhold
he laid open for the enemy, and to bring the ſame to
paſſe, he hath receaued great ſummes of gold from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
It behooueth you therefore (O you Grecians) to make
diligent ſearch, and to be thorowly informed whether
the accuſation be true, or that the Troians haue fained
the ſame onlie of ſet purpoſe, to weaken our forces by
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7358:201"/>
the loſſe of a man ſo famous, or to ſet vs at diſcord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or whether <hi>Palamedes</hi> haue taken this gold for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as for to deminiſh their ſtore by ſo much
or els to worke ſome other ſtratagem therby. I thought
it good to declare this openly in the preſence of al men,
to the end that ſome aſſuaging the rage of the reſt, you
might altogether with one mind endeuor to ſift out the
truth of the deed, of the which labour <hi>Palamedes</hi> might
eaſe you by confeſſing the matter, and for what intent
he hath receiued this coine, if hee will not haue vs to
ſearch his ſhip, or els where, for the ſaid gold, the which
being once found without his confeſſion, would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
increaſe his crime. Wherefore aduiſe him in the way
of friendſhip not to imagine that the ſame can be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from <hi>Argos,</hi> which ſignifieth no other thing then
the eies of the multitude, who doe ſee manie things,
which are ſuppoſed to be verie ſecret. O how miſerable
are thoſe that perſeuere in miſchiefe, becauſe they are
perſuaded the ſame ſhall neuer be manifeſt! For euen
when they thinke they are moſt ſafeſt, then oftentimes
either they themſelues, or els thoſe in whom they put
moſt confidence, doe bewray them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſuch ſort, as ouer
late repentance and ſuddaine puniſhment doe both fall
vpon them at once. But this is the miſchiefe, that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
perſuadeth thoſe which follow the ſame, that all
things how wicked ſoeuer they be, are lawfull, and that
abundance doth nothing but increaſe auarice, which of
it ſelfe is inſatiable. Doe you then <hi>Palamedes</hi> ſhew your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſelfe to be free from theſe vices, and in ſhewing by effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
reaſons that your intent was ſound, you may free
vs from this ſuſpition, conſidering that if you do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
the Grecians are no leſſe readie to puniſh obſtinate

enioying the benefit thereof, the ſouldior is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the ſame, and the Dictator alone would haue
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:7358:204"/>

as if the glory of the maſter of the horſe did not increaſe

ſuch was the magnanimitie of this great Roman,

that by their fault the ſouldiour will no more obey the
Centurion, nor the Centurion the martiall Tribune,
nor the Tribune the Legat, nor the Legat the Conſull

which you would now make, you ſhould haue thought
vpon before the Commonwealth had ben ſcandalized
by your oaths, and then you ſhould haue giuen thoſe
good counſels, which now are as farre out of ſeaſon as
they are in vain, for you are not to preſcribe what courſe
we are to vſe with you, no more then wee are bound to
tell you wherefore we haue cauſed you to ſweare ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
but we may tell you (and that trulie) how hee that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:7358:211"/>
had yeelded vnto the oath of the other might very well
haue eſcaped the extremity of the crime, but yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of both would haue ben alwaies doubtfull, ſo
that it were much better to know the truth if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
if not, it may be ſaid at the leaſt, that the fault is not
in vs. And this is the difference that we make between
iuſtice and crueltie, That the offender being known, he
may be puniſhed, and the innocent honoured. You ſay
that the one may chance to ſuffer for the other, you
know the remedy, we cannot iudge you by your owne
mouths: it is impoſſible to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one for the reſpect
of the other, without great offence to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
ſeeing that you both ſtill remaine alwaies ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and your linage thereby mightely wronged.
Since then you haue ſhewed your ſelues more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men
in the beginning, doe not ſhew your ſelues leſſe then
women in the end. We counſell you ſo to doe for the
good of the countrie, and for your owne credit. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles,
it is in the choice of the ſoueraign iudges to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
your offence, but not to reſtore your former repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
for ſo long as the truth ſhall be doubtfull, you
ſhall be both twaine ſuſpected, yea and eſteemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to liue amongſt honeſt men.</p>

religiouſlie to maintaine the obſeruation of diuine
things, and the faith of humane confederacie: &amp; when

ſhall I then be able to defend my fact? Surely either by

two meanes to defend my ſelfe, becauſe I had the ſaid

haue had one whiles with the Carthaginians, another
while with the Gaules, and continuallie either with the
one or the other haue greatlie troubled vs, as thou haſt
likewiſe done in this warre of Macedon: For very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely
were it for vs (who haue vndertaken armes for
the libertie of Greece) to confederate our ſelues with a
tyrant: and with what tyrant? Surely with ſuch a one
as is the moſt cruell &amp; moſt inhuman monſter towards
his owne ſubiects that euer was. It behooued vs in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to free all Greece, to ſet Lacedemon alſo into her
ancient freedome (although thou haddeſt neuer taken
<hi>Argos</hi> by deceit) &amp; to reſtore her vnto her laws: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at this preſent (like a good follower of <hi>Licurgus</hi>) thou
haſt made mention. Now will we take heed ſince <hi>Philip</hi>
hath withdrawne his Garriſons from <hi>Iaſsa</hi> and <hi>Bargilles,</hi>
leaſt we ſhould ſuffer to be troden vnder thy feet, two
famous citties, Argos and Lacedemon, heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the two lights and beauties of Greece: which
it we ſhould leaue in bondage, it would blemiſh our
title of freeing Greece. Thou wilt ſay that the Argians
were partakers with <hi>Philip:</hi> wee will not burthen thee
that thou waſt therefore angrie with them, and tookeſt
vpon thee ſuch a quarell for our ſakes. We are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed that of that innouation there were but two
or three perſons at the moſt culpable, as alſo how that
they were the onlie men that receiued thee &amp; thy ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
into their caſtle, wherein ſurely nothing at all
was done by common Counſell. Wee know how the
Theſſalians, Phocians, and Locrenſes, did by common
conſent take <hi>Philip</hi> his part, neuertheleſſe wee did leaue
them free, hauing ſet all the reſt of Greece at libertie.
What then doeſt thou thinke wee ſhould doe with the
Argiues, who are moſt innocent, as concerning their
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:7358:212"/>
common Counſell? Thou ſaieſt that thou art condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for deliuering of captiues &amp; deuiding of the lands
vnto the poore (which ſurely are no ſmall faults) but
what is that, or what are they to be compared to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
miſchiefes committed euerie day one after another
by thee and thine? Let a free Counſell bee aſſembled
in Argos, or Lacedemon, if thou takeſt pleaſure to hear
the truth of the offences of thy moſt prowd gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But now ſetting apart thy ancienteſt faults: how
manie murthers I pray thee hath that ſon in law of thine
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> committed of late in Argos, &amp; that as it were
before mine owne eies? and how manie ſlaughters haſt
thou thy ſelfe acted, I being euen hard vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Lacedemon? Moreouer, thoſe whom thou too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
whileſt they were parlying, thou didſt openlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
before all the Cittizens that thou wouldeſt keepe
them in ſafetie: Bring them therefore bound as they
were, to the end that their miſerable parents may know
them to be liuing, whom they haue bewailed for dead:
but thou wilt ſay, let vs grant that all theſe things be ſo,
What haue you Romans to doe therewith? Wilt thou
ſay thus vnto the Grecians friends? That ſeeke to free
Greece? Who to doe the ſame, haue paſſed the ſeas?
And haue made warre both by land and by ſea? Thou
wilt ſay, Yet haue I not offended you, nor broken our
league, neither violated the confederacie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nation. How often wilt thou haue me to prooue
vnto thy face that thou haſt violated the ſame? I will
not vſe manie words, but brieflie will I ſet downe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing: Tell me then I pray thee how manie waies
friendſhip may be broken? Surely by theſe two, that is
to ſay. If thou vſeſt my friends like enemies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioineſt
thy ſelfe with my foes: Whether of theſe two
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:7358:213"/>
things haſt thou not done? Seeing that firſt thou too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
Meſſena by force and armes, which was ioined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs with the ſame conditions of peace as Lacedemon
was, and receiued into our friendſhip; and yet thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our friend and Colleague, tookeſt a cittie that was
friend and vnited in league with vs: and with <hi>Philip</hi> our
enemie, thou not onelie kepteſt companie, but alſo by
the ſufferance of the gods thou madeſt aliance with
him by the meanes of <hi>Philocles</hi> his Lieutenant, and he
making wars vpon vs in that ſort, thou didſt both trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the ſeas about Malea with thy ſhips of war, and alſo
tookeſt and ſleweſt far more Romane Cittizens then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Philip</hi> did: and vnto the ſhips which brought victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
vnto our armie, the riuer of Macedon was more ſafe
then was the promontarie of Malea. Ceaſſe therefore
henceforth to brag of the obſeruing of thy faith, and
the performing of thy friendſhip inuiolable,
and leaue off all ciuill maner of ſpeech,
ſpeak plainly like a tyrant, &amp; as an
enemy ought to ſpeake.</p>
