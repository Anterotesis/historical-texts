         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Daughter,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd the other Morning, when being awakened out of my firſt Morning-ſleep, (for you know our <hi>Concerns are moſt in the Night-watches;)</hi> I heard one of the <hi>ragged Regiment,</hi> or a Bookſeller in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> bawling out, <hi>Madam Cellier</hi>'s <hi>Vindication, &amp;c.</hi> I then immediately concluded to have it, coſt what it would; ay, and read it too: though I have but two uſual Books for my <hi>Library</hi> which have layen in the <hi>Dining-room-window</hi> theſe 30 years untoucht by me, or by any of my Children; yet I was now reſolved to make an Addition to 'um.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97944:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And now having read it over in a full Aſſembly of my <hi>Children,</hi> (for I have ſome that are <hi>Plaguy Jades</hi> at <hi>State Politicks,</hi> and <hi>Sham Plots;</hi> but to ſay truth, 'tis only to get an honourable and a handſom <hi>Livelyhood,</hi> or ſupply the <hi>Defects of a weak Husband,</hi> or ſo:) I muſt needs tell you, I did admire which way 'twas poſſible you ſhould arrive to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious knowledge in the <hi>Intrigues of Plots and Treaſons, and ſuch like Matters:</hi> Surely I have known you many years, and I never thought you ſuch a <hi>parlous Woman;</hi> well, the World is well amended with you. But how, in the Name of <hi>Aretine,</hi> came you to light upon ſuch a <hi>Don Quixot</hi> as <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> to carry on the <hi>honourable Deſigns</hi> which you were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in? Surely had you conſulted the <hi>Weſtminſter Augury,</hi> you would have been better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but in that caſe it ſeems you did not, and ſo you brought your ſelf into a very dangerous Condition. Yet now I think on't, 'tis well you did meet with ſuch a perſon, for had he not been an <hi>abominable over-grown Rogue,</hi> for all your <hi>Vindication,</hi> I am afraid the Juſtice of the <hi>Law</hi> would have ſent you after thoſe <hi>Innocont Babes,</hi> that were Sledg'd up <hi>Holborn-hill</hi> not long ſince, for the <hi>Teſtimony of your Holy Church.</hi> And thanks to the Clerk that drew up the <hi>Parden,</hi> for omitting the <hi>moſt material Facts he had been guilty of;</hi> or truly <hi>Daughter,</hi> you could not have eſcaped as I think. For when I conſider how firſt you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the <hi>Concern,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that perſwaded you thereto, and what Advances you made therein; I declare to you, I cannot ſee over-much <hi>Innocence</hi> in you, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded deal of <hi>Impudence.</hi> Pray Forſooth good <hi>Madam,</hi> where was your <hi>Modeſty</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> as if he had been your Companion? And if <hi>Suſan</hi> would have ſpoke all, where was your Modeſty, or at leaſt what might you do, when your Husband was at <hi>Church in a Chamber with a man alone?</hi> Why, truly we muſt give you our Judgment, that <hi>Deep Myſteries of State muſt be ſecret,</hi> and <hi>private Refreſhments muſt be kept for the Eye of the World.</hi> You know I am a Woman of Experience, and can gueſs ſhrewdly in ſuch <hi>Affairs.</hi> But pray <hi>Daughter</hi> tell me, what perſwaded you to leave your <hi>honourable Calling</hi> off, for theſe Political <hi>Concerns;</hi> ſurely you have a deſire after Glory, and to be eſteemed one of the <hi>Eldeſt Daughters of the Whore of Babylon.</hi> Alas! what was S. <hi>Coleman</hi> or S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</hi> to you, <hi>Madam,</hi> meer Children in <hi>Politicks;</hi> you have not only been as deep in the Mire as ever <hi>they were,</hi> but you have <hi>vanquiſht all that riſe up againſt you.</hi> No doubt but ere now, our Siſters of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have heard of your Fame, and are ſinging there <hi>Io Paeans,</hi> for Joy that they have got ſo valiant a <hi>She-Champion</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Great Harlot.</hi> Well, <hi>Daughter</hi> go on and proſper, for I account if the <hi>Romiſh Cauſe</hi> takes, we ſhall have a more fixed and eſtabliſht <hi>Trade</hi> than ever we had; though the truth is, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not complain of late years, ſince <hi>Juſtices of Peace</hi> inſtead of puniſhing <hi>Offenders</hi> in our way, are <hi>Sinners themſelves</hi> in the ſame —. However, we are liable to the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo we ſhall not, when we have Licenſe and Tolleration to follow our Profeſſion with quietneſs, and without any diſturbance. But then again I conſider, as to the <hi>Point of your Religion,</hi> 'tis the beſt in the World for us, for we can <hi>Whore</hi> and <hi>whore</hi> again, and <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>feſs,</hi> and obtain <hi>Pardon,</hi> and be <hi>pardoned</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, and go out of the World after a whole life of <hi>ſinning,</hi> as <hi>Innocent as Children unborn.</hi> So that I ſay, 'tis much to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that you are driving on ſuch a <hi>Deſign,</hi> though for my part 'tis all one to me what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> goes up, I am old, and hope to live and die <hi>honeſtly in my Calling.</hi> One thing <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> I am reſolved on, never to concern my ſelf with <hi>State Matters,</hi> as you have done, and am afraid was much out of <hi>your way:</hi> You have an <hi>honeſt Calling,</hi> and though I ſay it, a <hi>very ancient one,</hi> and was of great eſteem in all Ages of the World; I admire who <hi>bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you</hi> to this <hi>Trade of Sham-plotting?</hi> It could not be my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>S—</hi> nor his Servants, for he is too wiſe, and his Servants too wary ſure, to concern themſelves in ſuch <hi>Afairs;</hi> we have had <hi>Experience</hi> enough of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> and Introth he hath lived to a fair Age, if a <hi>Newgate</hi> Bird and a <hi>Midwife</hi> ſhall out-wit him at <hi>Politicks.</hi> I proteſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Daughter,</hi> I am afraid you have taken in a Club of S. <hi>Omers Saints</hi> to help you out at <hi>this dead lift:</hi> For to ſay truth. I believe you loſt abundance of <hi>Reputation</hi> by being in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and Try'd for your Life; and conſequently your <hi>Trade,</hi> and that is able to vex any Woman in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially one of your <hi>lofty Spirit.</hi> But I would fain know, <hi>Daughter,</hi> why you parted with you Money ſo freely to Capt. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> in getting him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97944:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of Priſon, and Cloathing him; was it to get in your Husbands debts only or no, or was it for ſome other private <hi>Intrigues?</hi> truly I am afraid ſo. And ſo would I have all Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French-men</hi> ſerved, that know not how to get in their own Debts, without employing <hi>Felons,</hi> and <hi>ſuch ſort of men</hi> to do it. I hope in the next <hi>Edition</hi> of your <hi>Book,</hi> we ſhall have <hi>a true account of it,</hi> for I am not ſatisfied, that that was the only reaſon of your kindneſs to him.</p>
            <p>And then again, I proteſt I am not ſatisfied (nor any of my Children, who are hugely concerned for you) that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſhould contrive a <hi>Plot</hi> againſt the <hi>preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at this time when your Friends are ſo hard at work to do it; ſurely they will not joyn hand in hand with you; their Principles are Diametrically Oppoſite, and beſides, they have got nothing by former Practices of that Nature, which yet were contrived and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the <hi>Cunning-men</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> as my Old Friend and Son <hi>Harry Martin</hi> has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in private told me in thoſe daies, and though I ſay it, he was able to judge as well as the beſt of 'um all.</p>
            <p>Now methinks its ſtrange, that this great <hi>Meal-Tub-Plot</hi> ſhould have ſo few heads and hands concerned in it, and after all the Conſultations you and your Friend <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had about it, you ſhould diſcover no more; truly <hi>Daughter,</hi> I ſhould be glad (and ſo would a great many more) to have the whole truth out, of the ſeveral <hi>Conferences</hi> with the Lord <hi>P.</hi> and ſome other your great acquaintances: that would be worth the while, but you will not be ſo Candid. 'Twould ſatisfie abundance of People that cannot find in their Hearts to believe all you have Writ, nor indeed hardly any part of it. Well! I find Company coming in, and muſt conclude with ſome Grave and Motherly advice. <hi>Beware what you do, and repent what you have done, lest Capt. Richardſon gets you into his Clutches again.</hi> For I am afraid, you will find my Lord <hi>S.</hi> and his Servants, Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prannce,</hi> and a great many more Subſtantial Evidences will come againſt you for the Political lies you have told in your Book; And for endeavouring to Invalidate the Kings Evidence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting your <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> as a thing of no conſequence. And yet in Charity to you as of the weaker <hi>Sex,</hi> I believe ſome <hi>Wilde</hi> Houſe Chaplains have foiſted in a great many things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your <hi>Narrative,</hi> that you were not the Author of your ſelf. But let it paſs: I pity you with all my heart, and I make it my earneſt requeſt, you would mind only your <hi>Lawfull and Honourable calling,</hi> and getting in your Husbands Debts, and be uſefull to all good Men, in an honeſt and civil way: and don't trouble your ſelf any farther with <hi>Plotters,</hi> and <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Treaſons.</hi> I have a kindneſs for you, and what further I have to ſay (for Trading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to come in apace) I will tell you, if you will Oblige me with your Company, at my Houſe at any time, and will have a Bottle of <hi>Rheniſh</hi> or two at your Service.</p>

            <p>Well, but this <hi>learned Gentlewoman,</hi> for ſo ſhe would ſeem to be by her <hi>Similes,</hi> had many reflections and imaginations crept into her Head, as ſhe ſaies in her <hi>Paper,</hi> but theſe were <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Maggots,</hi> which trouble her <hi>Brain,</hi> and ſet her again to Writing, and would make you believe her whole Book was made up of <hi>Irrefragable Truths:</hi> but worthy <hi>Madam,</hi> it will not do, for all the World believes, nay your ſelves know, whoſe <hi>Nodles</hi> Compoſed it, that 'tis made up of nothing almoſt but <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>untruths,</hi> and is indeed from the beginning to the end a <hi>Grand Libel,</hi> endeavouring to beſpatter and belie a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> and therefore may well be confuted with that one Word, not <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Celliers</hi> thou lieſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lady</hi> is deſparately angry at the <hi>Title of Captain</hi> given to <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> but methinks he is not ſo fond of it, and may as well deſerve it as ſhe of the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Madam,</hi> which affects her much: But if it be his <hi>Fortitude</hi> of <hi>Suffering</hi> that makes him deſerving of the <hi>Title,</hi> perhaps e're long you may alſo be worthy of that of <hi>Madam:</hi> in the mean time <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> is too good for you, for the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word <hi>Goody</hi> or <hi>Goodwife Celliers</hi> may ſerve your turn, though you give a Dove and an Anchor with a Rope for your <hi>Arms.</hi> Though now <hi>Captain</hi> be a Name too good for <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> he has often enough been <hi>intitled</hi> ſo by your ſelf when time was, and had he ſtuck cloſe to you and your <hi>Intrigues,</hi> he ſhould have been a <hi>Colonel</hi> at leaſt before this, and all his <hi>Blew Stigma's</hi> been forgot.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Living Captain</hi> be the <hi>Object</hi> of your <hi>Spleen,</hi> yet the <hi>Dead Captain</hi> might lie quiet in his Grave, and it becomes not a Woman of your profeſſion to wear <hi>Long Nailes,</hi> to ſcratch the Dead out of their <hi>Tombs,</hi> and to abuſe their <hi>Names,</hi> which the very Heathen abhorred. But <hi>Madam Celliers</hi> is one that neither fears God nor Man, for ſhe defies all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Captain Richardſon</hi> himſelf. Have a care, <hi>Madam,</hi> you come not within his <hi>Inchanted Caſtle</hi> again, leſt you want a <hi>Knight Errant</hi> to releaſe you, for he is a <hi>Fell Gyant</hi> as you have made him.</p>
            <p>It is but juſt and requiſite the <hi>Jeſuitical Crew</hi> ſhould ſtick cloſe to this <hi>Mother-Midnight,</hi> for they will never be able to find again ſo laborious and Skilfull a Woman; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was choſe out to bring the <hi>Plot to Bed</hi> of its <hi>Twins:</hi> but the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> proving Monſtrous, ſhe miſcarried in the delivery of the <hi>Latter,</hi> and ſmothered it in the <hi>Meal Tub.</hi> The next Work ſhe is to do, being ſo very <hi>Dexterous,</hi> will be to bring the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon to Bed of her Litter;</hi> and had ſhe been alive in the time of <hi>Pope Joan,</hi> ſhe had not ſo publickly miſcarried in her <hi>Proceſſion.</hi> It is therefore but fitting that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this Memorable <hi>Madam,</hi> be preſerved, which that it may be, we have endervour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here among the reſt to make known her <hi>Worth and excellent Parts,</hi> which has imployed ſo many Pens, that after Ages will admire the <hi>Monſter.</hi>
