            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Wou'd not have you ſurpriz'd with this Addreſs, though I gave you no warning of it. The Buiſineſs of this Epiſtle is more Vindication than Complement; and when we are to tell our Grievances 'tis moſt natural to betake our ſelves to a Friend. 'Twas thought perhaps that this unfortunate Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring having been ſtifled on the <hi>Stage,</hi> ſhou'd have been buried in Oblivion; and ſo it might have happened had it drawn its Being from me Alone, but it ſtill retains the immortal Spirit of its firſt-Father, and will ſurvive in Print, though forbid to tread the <hi>Stage.</hi> They that have not ſeen it Acted, by its being ſilenc't, muſt ſuſpect me to have Compil'd a Diſloyal or Reflecting <hi>Play.</hi> But how far diſtant this was from my Deſign and Conduct in the Story will appear to him that reads with half an Eye. To form any Reſemblance between the Times here written of, and the Preſent, had been unpardonable Preſumption in Me. If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiters conceive any ſuch Notion I am not accountable for That. I fell upon the new-modelling of this Tragedy, (as I had juſt before done on the <hi>Hiſtory of King Lear</hi>) charm'd with the many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I diſcover'd in it, which I knew wou'd become the <hi>Stage;</hi> with as little deſign of Satyr on preſent Tranſactions, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> himſelf that wrote this Story before this Age began. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the poſture of Affairs in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Reign, how diſſolute then the Age, and how corrupt the Court; a Seaſon that beheld <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Infamy</hi> preferr'd to <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Pow'r,</hi> exercis'd in Oppreſſing, Learning and Merit; but why a Hiſtory of thoſe Times ſhou'd be ſuppreſt as a Libel upon Ours, is paſt my

His <hi>Duke of York</hi> after all his buiſy pretended Loyalty, is found falſe to his Kinſman and Sovereign, and joyn'd with the <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.</hi> His King <hi>Richard</hi> Himſelf is painted in the worſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Hiſtory. Diſſolute, Unadviſeable, devoted to Eaſe and Luxury. You find old <hi>Gaunt</hi> ſpeaking of him in this Language</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—Then there are found</l>
               <l>Laſcivious Meeters, to whoſe Venom ſound</l>
               <l>The open Ear of Youth do's always Liſten.</l>
               <l>Where doth the World thruſt forth a Vanity,</l>
               <l>(So it be New, there's no reſpect how Vile)</l>
               <l>That is not quickly buzz'd into his Ear?</l>
               <l>That all too late comes Counſel to be heard.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>without the leaſt palliating of his Miſcarriages, which I have done in the new Draft, with ſuch words as Theſe.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Your Sycophants bred from your Child-hood with you,</l>
               <l>Have ſuch Advantage had to work upon you,</l>
               <l>That ſcarce your Failings can be call'd your Faults.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>His Reply in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to the blunt honeſt Adviſer runs thus.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And Thou a Lunatick Lean-witted-fool, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>Now by my Seat's right Royal Majeſty,</l>
               <l>Wer't Thou not Brother to great Edward's Son.</l>
               <l>The Tongue that runs thus roundly in thy Head</l>
               <l>Shou'd run thy Head from thy unreverent Shoulders.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>On the contrary (though I have made him expreſs ſome Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) yet he is neither enrag'd with the good Advice, nor deaf to it. He anſwers Thus—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—Gentle Unkle;</l>
               <l>Excuſe the Sally's of my Youthfull Blood.</l>
               <l>We ſhall not be unmindfull to redreſs</l>
               <l>(However difficult) our States Corruptions,</l>
               <l>And purge the Vanities that crowd our Court.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105894:4"/>I have every where given him the Language of an Active, Pru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent Prince. Preferring the Good of his Subjects to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Pleaſure. On his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Expedition, you find him thus be ſpeak his Queen—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Though never vacant Swain in ſilent Bow'rs</l>
               <l>Cou'd boaſt a Paſſion ſo ſincere as Mine,</l>
               <l>Yet where the Int'reſt of the Subject calls</l>
               <l>We wave the deareſt Tranſports of our Love,</l>
               <l>Flying from Beauties Arms to rugged War, &amp;c.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Nor cou'd it ſuffice me to make him ſpeak like a King (who as Mr. <hi>Rhymer</hi> ſays in his <hi>Tragedies of the laſt Age conſidered,</hi> are always in Poëtry preſum'd Heroes) but to <hi>Act ſo too,</hi> viz. with <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Reſolute enough our <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> (copying the Hiſtory) has made him, for concerning his ſeizing old <hi>Gaunt's</hi> Revennues, he tells the wiſe Diſwaders,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Say what ye will, we ſeize into our Hands</l>
               <l>His Plate, his Goods, his Money and his Lands.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But where was the Juſtice of this Action? This Paſſage I confeſs was ſo material a Part of the Chronicle (being the very Baſis of <hi>Bullingbrook's</hi> Uſurpation) that I cou'd not in this new Model ſo far tranſgreſs Truth as to make no mention of it; yet for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Heroe I ſuppoſe the foreſaid Revennues to be <hi>Borrow'd</hi> onely for the preſent Exigence, not <hi>Extorted.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Be Heav'n our Judge, we mean him fair,</l>
               <l>And ſhortly will with Intereſt reſtore</l>

            </lg>
            <p>My Deſign was to engage the pitty of the Audience for him in his Diſtreſſes, which I cou'd never have compaſs'd had I not before ſhewn him a Wiſe, Active and Juſt Prince.

            <p>with much more villifying Talk; but I wou'd not allow even Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Conſpirators thus to beſpatter the Perſon whom I deſign'd to place in the Love and Compaſſion of the Audience. Ev'n this very Scene (as I have manag'd it) though it ſhew the Confederates to be Villains, yet it flings no Aſperſion on my Prince.</p>
            <p>Further, to Vindicate ev'n his <hi>Magnanimity</hi> in Regard of his Reſigning the Crown, I have on purpoſe inſerted an intirely new Scene between him and his Queen, wherein his Conduct is ſufficiently excus'd by the Malignancy of his Fortune, which argues indeed Extremity of Diſtreſs, but Nothing of Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>After this account it will be askt why this Play ſhou'd be ſuppreſt, firſt in its own Name, and after in Diſguiſe? All that I can anſwer to this, is, That it was <hi>Silenc'd on the Third Day.</hi> I confeſs, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it wou'd have found Protection from whence it receiv'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; and ſo queſtionleſs it wou'd, cou'd I have obtain'd my Petition to have it perus'd and dealt with according as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents Deſerv'd, but a poſitive Doom of Suppreſſion <hi>without Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> was all that I cou'd procure.</p>
            <p>The Arbitrary Courtiers of the Reign here written, ſcarcely did more Violence to the Subjects of their Time, then I have done to <hi>Truth,</hi> in diſguiſing their foul Practices. Take ev'n the <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and Hiſtory, you will find him Diſſolute, Careleſs, and Unadviſable: peruſe my Picture of him and you will ſay, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> did of <hi>Hector,</hi> (though the Figure there was alter'd for the Worſe and here for the Better) <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> And likewiſe for his chief Miniſters of State, I have laid Vertues to their Charge of which they were not Guilty. Every Scene is full of Reſpect to Majeſty and the dignity of Courts, not one alter'd Page but what breaths Loyalty, yet had this Play the hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to receive its Prohibition from Court.</p>
            <p>For the two days in which it was Acted, the Change of the Scene, Names of Perſons, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a great Diſadvantage: many things were by this means render'd obſcure and incoherent that in their native Dreſs had appear'd not only proper but gracefull. I call'd my Perſons <hi>Sicilians</hi> but might as well have made 'em Inhabitants
<pb facs="tcp:105894:5"/>
of the <hi>Iſle of Pines,</hi> or, World in the <hi>Moon,</hi> for whom an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are like to have ſmall Concern. Yet I took care from the Beginning to adorn my Prince with ſuch heroick Vertues, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made his diſtreſt Scenes of force to draw Tears from the Spectators; which, how much more touching they would have been had the Scene been laid at Home, let the Reader judge. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Comedy I judg'd neceſſary to help off the heavineſs of the Tale, which Deſign, Sir, you will not only Pardon, but Approve. I have heard you commend this Method in Stage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>writing, though leſs agreeable to ſtricktneſs of Rule; and I find your Choice confirm'd by our <hi>Laureat's</hi> laſt Piece, who confeſſes himſelf to have broken a Rule for the Pleaſure of Variety. <note n="*" place="margin">Epſt.

               <hi>The Audience</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are grown weary of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Scenes, and I dare propheſie that few Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies (except thoſe in Verſe) ſhall ſucceed in this Age if they are not lightned with a courſe of Mirth.</hi>
