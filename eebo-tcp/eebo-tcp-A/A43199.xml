            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY small Endeavours of serving the Publick have met with such repeated Encouragements in Your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Family, that I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently waited for a proper Occasion to express my Dutiful Acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>Custom, <hi>MY LORD,</hi> has at all Times justified Dedications, chiefly, perhaps, because Fortune seldom puts it in the Power of a Writer to shew his Gratitude to the Supporters of Learning any
<pb facs="tcp:55246:3"/>
other way: Nevertheless I think it an unpardonable Rudeness in an Author, boldly to obtrude a Book to a Person, that can reap either Pleasure or Benefit by it; and therefore I have delay'd so long to wait upon Your <hi>LORD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP,</hi> till the Usefulness of the Present might, in some measure, attone for the Trouble of the Address.</p>
            <p>History, <hi>My LORD,</hi> of all Sciences is that which is the most suitable to all Persons; and which best answers the two main Ends of our Studies, <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> But it deserves in a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner the Application of those of Your Rank and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for History is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about the Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:55246:3"/>
of the Illustrious, and since there is a sort of Collateral Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity between Great Men of all Times and Places, it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to be acquainted with one another.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Variety of Great Events and Revolutions, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Laws, Religions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, which History presents to our Sight, cannot but yield a very diverting and entertaining Prospect; and the Account it gives us of the several Characters of Men, and of the chief Springs and Motives of their Actions, together with the Good and Bad Examples it sets before us, will certainly go a great way towards the making a Wise and a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55246:4"/>'Tis true, <hi>MY LORD,</hi> that if Examples suffice to form a Great Man, Your <hi>LORDSHIP</hi> has no occasion to fetch 'em from abroad; You will find in Your Noble Father alone, a perfect Pattern of Military and Political Virtues: By Him Your <hi>LORDSHIP</hi> may learn to be both a Soldier and a Statesman; Great at the Head of an Army; Great in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, but still Greater in a wise Retirement; in a Word, to be like <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Field, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-house and the Closet.</p>

               </gap>) is more or less necessary, as it does conduce in a higher or lower degree to the making Men useful and beneficial to others, and easy and happy in themselves both here and hereafter. That Knowledge, which has the greatest Tendency to these Ends, is certainly the most necessary, and preferable to all other kinds of Knowledge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. Thus, for Instance, <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as they tend chiefly to promote the Welfare and Happiness both of private Persons and of publick Communities, the Knowledge of them is the most necessary of any others; but yet it does not follow, that all other Knowledge is unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. Therefore we must crave leave to dissent from Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> who in his <hi>Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life with relation to Learning,</hi> has endeavour'd, by a <hi>Metaph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>train of Thought, to prove, That some sorts of Knowledge are Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, but others Contingent; among the latter of which he ranks <hi>Histo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, tho' we bear all due Respect and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to that good and learned Author, yet we must frankly own, That we disapprove of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in this Matter; since it can be made appear by Good and Solid (tho' not Metaphisical) Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, That <hi>History</hi> is as necessary in an inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the <hi>Conduct of Human Life,</hi> as <hi>Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty, Morality,</hi> &amp;c. are in a higher degree necessary to the same End. The usefulness of this kind of Knowledge, I mean of <hi>History,</hi> is so great to All,
<pb facs="tcp:55246:5"/>
who are design'd for publick Employments either in Church or State, and to all those who would read and know Men as well as Books, that this very Consideration makes it highly necessary to such But we might advance our Position still farther, and prove that this kind of Knowledge is in some measure useful and beneficial, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently necessary to Men of the meanest C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pacities, and of the lowest Size. For tho' it be true, as the forementioned Author says,
<q>That it does not much concern us when a Bird drop'd his Feather last on the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains;</q>
yet we presume he will own, That the Knowledge of the various Revolutions that have happen'd to the greatest Monarchies; of the Vicissitudes of Fortune that have attended the greatest Princes; of the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Success of Good, and the infamous Ends of bad Men; of the Signal Providence of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being that has manifested it self in all these Things, with the like, (to the Knowledge of all which we arrive by the Accounts of <hi>History</hi>) is of nearer and greater Concernment to us, than that Triff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng <hi>Simile</hi> to which he ventures to compare it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>History</hi> is or might be very useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the meanest Persons, appears from the Love they have and the Attention they give to the reading of the Fabulous Histories of <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson,</hi> of <hi>Cassandra,</hi> of <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Parismenos,</hi> &amp;c. For it may be very reasonably inferr'd, That if such Romances and Fables, if an old Wive's Tale told with an Air of Probability and Truth in a Chimney corner, have such strange Effects upon the Minds of the Vulgar as we see them have, then certainly the true Accounts of the Actions and Lives of the Ancients, coming in with the joint Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of several <hi>Historians,</hi> must needs have as
<pb facs="tcp:55246:5"/>
great if not greater Effects on the Minds of these Persons. This is not meer Conjecture, but Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact; for we will instance in one History, and that is, the Account <hi>Iosephus</hi> has given of the Destruction of the <hi>Iews.</hi> This small part of his History being translated into our Language, is much in the Hands of the very meanest Persons; and by common Experience we find that they are as much affected with the Relations thereof, as they are with any of the pretty Fictions of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance and Poety; and 'tis certain that true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is likely to make better Impressions even on the Minds of these Men, than any Fable or Tale whatever.</p>
            <p>More might be said to demonstrate the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Necessity os <hi>History,</hi> and that it is a very necessary part of <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Learning:</hi> But so much is said upon this Topick in the First Chapter of the Second Part of this System, that we refer our Reader thither.</p>
            <p>Having said thus much in General, we think it proper to give the Reader an Account of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in particular; and then to shew how great a use may be made of this short System we have drawn of <hi>Vniversal History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are very sensible that there are several Tracts of this Nature in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and some in our own Tongue; but whether they are so accurate and exact, or whether they take in so much as this short Treatise does, we must leave to the Judicious and Candid to determine. In the general we must own, That notwithstanding the Care and Pains we have been at in Compiling this <hi>System,</hi> there may be several Faults and Slips there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but we hope they are only such as an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, good Nature will be inclin'd to pardon. And truly it can never be expected that any Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:55246:6"/>
of this kind should be perfect and correct, till such time as <hi>Historians</hi>: (out of whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings such a Collection must be taken) are better agreed among themselves as to the <hi>Chronological</hi> as well as the <hi>Historical</hi> part of what they relate.</p>

                  <item>In the First Part we have treated of <hi>Chronology,</hi> as being a necessary Preparation for the useful Reading of <hi>History.</hi> Therein we have given you the General Definitions, laid down the Grounds and Rules of the Art, taken Notice of the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof, and of the various Opinions of Authors concerning the Time of our Saviours Birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterwards we have set down the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Aera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this means the Reader is instructed and inform'd at what time any memorable Action happen'd, and when such or such a Hero signaliz'd himself in the World, who were his Cotemporaries, and what the rest of the World were doing at the same time. We need not enlarge upon the Usefulness of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,</hi> since every Body knows that for want of an exac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Knowledge therein ancient <hi>Historians</hi> were much in the Dark, and often confounded Persons and Things; whilst our modern Writers being guided by a clearer Insight into the Series of Times, are more exact, clear and distinct in their Relations both of Matters of Fact, and of the Agents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein.</item>
                  <item>The Second Part is an <hi>Introduction to History,</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ein the Benefits thereof are prov'd to be so great and so many, that we hope none who impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially considers the Weight of them, will deny the Knowledg of <hi>History</hi> to be absolutely necessary for

                  <item>The 3d Part treats of the <hi>ancient Monarchies,</hi> which preceded our Saviour's time. And herein we have been as exact as the Brevity of such a <hi>Volume</hi> could possibly admit. We have consulted Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> Dr. <hi>Howel, Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>avius, Calvisius,</hi> and other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Authors; and from them have drawn our <hi>Historical</hi> Collection of the Actions, Kings, Hero's, and great Commanders of these Times: And as to the <hi>Chronology</hi> we have confin'd our selves to the Tables of <hi>Helvicus</hi> and our Country-man Mr. <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> for which we have given our Reasons in the Treatise it self. And here we must own, That we are indebted to Mr. <hi>Vallemont,</hi> a French Author, for the Scheme of the whole; out of whose Tract, Entituled, <hi>Les Elements de l' Histoire,</hi> we have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated several Chapters of the First, all the Second, and the Fifth Chapter of the Third Part.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is, in short, the Summary of the ensuing Treatise; the bare representing whereof we may reasonably suppose to be a sufficient Argument of its Usefulness to all judicious and unprejudic'd Minds.</p>
            <p>As for those Gentlemen who have already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used the voluminous Tracts of the <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and other <hi>Historians,</hi> 'tis hop'd that even they will be very well pleas'd to see at one View what has cost them so much Pains and Time to run over. We find Travellers, who have been several Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, very much delighted when they come home, to see in a single Map the Draught of all those Countries, through which they have travell'd. And must it not needs create as great a Pleasure and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb facs="tcp:55246:7"/>
in the Minds of such as have read over <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus, Livy, Thucidides,</hi> and the rest, to see the Hero's and Actions of those <hi>Historians</hi> drawn to the Life in <hi>Miniature,</hi> and represented as it were in the narrow Compass of a single Table?</p>
            <p>Whether it will be so diverting to those who are already vers'd in <hi>History</hi> or no, we cannot so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily determine; but yet we are in great hopes it will prove very Beneficial to such as hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to acquaint themselves with what has pass'd in former Ages. To these, our <hi>System</hi> will serve as an <hi>Introduction,</hi> to guide them and give them some Light in the very darkest pieces of Antiquity. The taste here given them of the great Use and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of studying <hi>History,</hi> may prove a great means of exciting them to a farther Enquiry after what is more largely related by the whole Tribe of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Like the <hi>Iewish</hi> Spies we have presented you with the rich Fruits of History: but hope we have not like them rais'd an evil Report upon the <hi>promis'd Land,</hi> but rather encourag'd you by this Prospect to a further Progress towards, and to an entire Conquest of it.</p>
            <p>We need not inform the Learned Men who have the Care and Tuition of young Persons committed to them, how useful such a Piece as this may prove to such of their Pupils, as are advanc'd to some degree of Learning in their Schools. They must needs perceive that nothing can be more advantageous to one, who is design'd for an University, and who they are willing should make some Figure in the World, than to be throughly accquainted with <hi>History.</hi> And they will at the same time see the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of allowing him such a Guide as this, unless they would have him in a confus'd Darkness march by himself through all the intricate Mazes of Antiquity. We desire they would but peruse this Book, with the same Candor and Impartiality, as they would have other Men do their Works; and then we modestly presume that we shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our End, and that this <hi>System</hi> will prove useful in in its kind.</p>

               <head>PART I. CHRONOLOGY.</head>
               <p>THE Eternity of the World, although it be taught by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by some of our modern Smatterers in Philosophy, is a Falshood so palpable, that tho' we were not taught by Divine Revelation, our own Reason would easily convince us, That it is but within a certain number of Years that an ineffably Wise, Eternal and Omnipotent Being, hath drawn out of Nothing, by the powerful virtue of his Almighty Word, not only our Terrestrial World, with all its Inhabitants, but even the Heavens and all the Parts of the infinite Universe, wherein Nature displays an innumerable variety of wonderful Objects and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Operations.</p>
               <p>'Tis needless for our Reason to examine what moved God Almighty to make Spiritual and Corporeal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, since he had liv'd Alone and Self-sufficient, (to use
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55246:11"/>
                  <hi>Tertullians</hi>'s Words) during a whole Eternity. The least circumstance of the Creation is an Abyss that will make us giddy, if we look down too fixedly into it. And those Libertines who oppose the Truth which Faith bids us revere, can never be able to frame a System of the Universe, either so plausible or comfortable as that which the Christian Religion proposes to us: For after all their Devices, these impious Sophists are oblig'd to attribute to the visible and corporeal World, that Eternity which they deny to that Supream God whom they are loath to acknowledge, and whose Power is so sensibly conspicuous in all that Heaven and Earth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our View.</p>
               <p>But to omit all the many other Arguments that are justly brought to prove the Verity of the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Earth according to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Account of it, we shall use but one, <hi>viz.</hi> The Infancy of all Arts and Sciences; for if there had been Men from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we ought to suppose they were endu'd with the same Capacities as all the Men (generally speaking) for the last 5000 Years have had: And if so, 'tis the highest pitch of Madness to believe, that they should lie in an eternal Sleep with respect to their nearest and tenderest Concerns, without ever minding what might conduce to make their Lives either longer or more happy, and neglect to exercise their Faculties in improving (what would be so useful to them) Arts and Sciences; I say, can it be believ'd that Men should not as well have made the best use of their Wits before <hi>Adam,</hi> as after? But it was not done; for we are fully inform'd in the History of Inventions and the Progress of Arts, and can deduce 'em all from that time, and are also sensible that there are many yet to be learnt; for though this and the last Age have furnish'd the World with many useful Discoveries and Inventions, such as the Mariner's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, Printing, Artillery, Telescopes, Microscopes, a New World as large as the Old, and abundance of Curiosities in Anatomy, Chymistry, Natural Philosophy and the Mathematicks; yet it is just Matter of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to see Physick, an Art of such great Concern to us, so rude and unpolish'd; or, to speak without Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, so rash and dangerous as it still is; whereas if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55246:11"/>
there had been an Eternal Generation of Men, so great a Progress had been made in all other Arts, that they had before now been at Leisure to have studied this somewhat more minutely, as of late Days (other Works being dispatch'd) they have begun to do: And it is not to be doubted but the succeeding Ages will be as much better experienc'd in this Art than we are, as we are in that and many others than our Predecessors were; at least, if the succeeding Years be as productive of great Genius's as these latter ones have been. And if the Academies setled for the Improvement of Arts have still, for some considerable length of Time, such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors as we see now adays at the Heads of them, those Learned Societies will undoubtedly transmit to After-Ages, such Discoveries in Natural Philosophy, Physick and Mathematicks, as may enable them to draw more ready Helps for the Preservation of Health and the Conveniences of Life, than we can now pretend to.</p>
               <p>These are sensible and pregnant Proofs that not only the Earth is not Eternal, but also that it cannot be very ancient; for besides what we have mentioned, there are many other visible Signs of its Infancy, which any Man of ordinary Capacity and Judgment will be sensible of, if he does never so little attend to them.</p>
               <p>But it is not so easy to know how many Years are elaps'd since the Worlds Creation, or the exact Time when those great Events have happen'd, which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence or the Passions of Men have in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages of the World given Birth to: There must be an Art to teach this, and that Art is called Chronology, from the two Greek Words <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>An AGE or CENTURY is the Space of a hundred Years, or a hundred Solar Revolutions.</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55246:12"/>LUSTRUM is the Space of five Years. This Word is seldom us'd, unless in Poetry.</p>
                  <p>OLYMPIAD is the Space of four Years, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> reckon'd from one Celebration of the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> Games to another. The first <hi>Olympiad</hi> begun the Year of the World 3174. 776 Years before the Christian <hi>Aera</hi> or Birth of Christ. <hi>Olympiads</hi> were the <hi>Epocha</hi>'s of the <hi>Grecians</hi>; their Name is derived from the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, instituted by <hi>Iphitus</hi> to the Honour of <hi>Hercules.</hi> They were celebrated every fifth Year about the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Solstice or the 19th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> at a Town of <hi>Elis</hi> in the <hi>Peleponesus</hi> (now the <hi>Morea</hi>) called <hi>Olympia.</hi> Some are of Opinion, That <hi>Iphitus</hi> was not the Instituter, but only the Restorer of those Games, after they had been neglected and laid aside for some time.</p>
                  <p>However, after he had once fixed them, they were since solemnized, without Interruption, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of every fifth Year. The ancientest and most esteemed of those Exercises was the <hi>Race,</hi> to which <hi>Wrestling</hi> was afterwards added; and because the <hi>Athletes</hi> did Wrestle naked, neither the Laws nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency did suffer Women to be there Spectators. The Prize given to the Victor, was a Garland of Laurel. <hi>Corebus,</hi> a Cook, according to <hi>Atheneus,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Price of the Race, at the first <hi>Olympiad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>EPOCHA is a fixed Point, or a certain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Time in History, made use of in <hi>Chronology</hi> to begin to compute Years, and which is generally grounded upon some great and signal Event.</p>
                  <p>AERA is the same Thing with <hi>Epocha,</hi> since it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies also a fixed and determined Point among Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to begin to reckon Years. The Word <hi>Aera</hi> comes from the Latin <hi>Aes,</hi> because they used to mark Years with little Copper Studs. Perhaps it has its Original from the Ignorance of some Amanuenses, who, finding these Letters A.E.R.A. <hi>Annus erat Regni Augusti,</hi> did make but one Word of them, <hi>Aera.</hi> Some are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That this Word was introduced by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had drawn it from a Tribute which the Emperor <hi>Augustus</hi> had made them liable to; so that <hi>Aera</hi> must come from <hi>Aere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55246:12"/>We have, at present, two different <hi>Christian Aera</hi>'s. The first is the <hi>Vulgar Aera,</hi> whose Author is <hi>Dionysius,</hi> sirnam'd <hi>Exiguus,</hi> a Learned Monk that flourish'd about the beginning of the Sixth Century, who, out of respect to our Saviour's Birth, thought it fit that Christians should begin to reckon their Years from the coming of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> His Design was approv'd of and follow'd. And hence it is that we use this Form in publick Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Writings, <hi>In the Year of our Lord,</hi> or <hi>The Year of our Redemption,</hi> 1698. But this <hi>Dionysius,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he was a Man of Learning and Integrity, has committed a Mistake of four Years; for 'tis certain, That our Vulgar <hi>Aera</hi> is so much short of the Birth of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Christian Aera</hi> is the <hi>true</hi> one, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins four Years before the <hi>Vulgar</hi>; so that this present Year, instead of 1698. we ought to reckon 1702. from the Birth of our Saviour. But although this last be the true <hi>Aera,</hi> we shall nevertheless follow that of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> only to comply with common Usage. But lest we lead any Body into an Error, instead of saying, for Example, this present Year from the Birth of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> 1698. which is false by four Years, we shall say of the <hi>Vulgar Aera,</hi> 1698. and then all is right; provided we take this along with us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the first Year of the <hi>Vulgar Aera</hi> begins at the fifth of our Saviour. We shall observe all along the same Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon a like Occasion.</p>
                  <p>There are three sorts of <hi>Epocha</hi>'s. The First is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;</hi> the Second <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> and the Third <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Politick.</hi>

For after all, if you tell young People, and even those that are come to Man's Estate, That the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Period</hi> begins 765 Years before the World, you'll amaze them to that degree, that tho' you tell them afterwards, That this is but a Supposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will have much ado to bring them back again to themselves. Now this Period was invented to no other purpose, than to square by it all the other <hi>Epocha</hi>'s, and reconcile, if possible, Chronologers one to another; and therefore it does not concern those who have only a Mind to learn History, and whom it were unjust to engage in minute Punctilio's of <hi>Chronology,</hi> which have been ever look'd upon as Thorns very difficult and troublesome to handle.</p>

                  <p>ALtho' Chronologers do very much disagree in their Opinions, yet there is an Art and certain Rules for the placing in order, the Succession of Times and <hi>Epocha</hi>'s; and this Marshalling of Events which we observe in their Books, is always grounded upon some Reason or other. They have all the same Guides; but because every Man follows them after his own way, it is not to be wondered if the Minds of Men, being so different in their Nature, seldom agree upon the same Subject.</p>
                  <p>The Certainty of <hi>Chronology</hi> depends upon three Principles.</p>
                  <p>The First is the Testimony of Writers or Authors.</p>
                  <p>The Second is grounded upon Astronomical Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and particularly upon the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon.</p>
                  <p>The Third is taken out of certain <hi>Epocha</hi>'s so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and evident in History, that it never came into any Man's Thoughts to call them in question.</p>

                     <p>How would that Man be look'd upon in the World, that should dare to maintain, That <hi>Xerxes</hi> never came into <hi>Greece</hi>; That <hi>Rome</hi> was not taken by the <hi>Gauls</hi>; and, That <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was not stabb'd in the Senate-house? <hi>Altho' I have not seen</hi> Rome <hi>with my own Eyes,</hi> says S. <hi>Augustin, and never was at</hi> Constantinople; <hi>yet, upon the Credit of those that speak of it, I hold it for as

                     <p>Nor are the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Accounts of Time more to be credited; for by reason of an Emulation between them and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> for Antiquity, they have had recourse to extravagant Fables, and tell us, That the Gods and Demy Gods reigned in <hi>Aegypt</hi> 34201 Years, before that Empire fell into the Hands of Men; and the Accounts they give since that time are altogether uncertain and imperfect; for notwithstanding the Care that they are said to have taken in preserving their History, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by inscribing it on Pillars, and maintaining

                     <p>The <hi>Chinese</hi> Chronology is still less to be regarded; for not only are their Histories dated many Ages before the Creation and full of incredible Stories and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances; as for Instance, 'Tis related that a certain <hi>Hauzu,</hi> who liv'd in the time of <hi>Confucius,</hi> lay four-score Years in his Mothers Womb; but also their own Chronologers differ in their Accounts, for <hi>Su-ma-quam</hi> a famous Annalist of <hi>China,</hi> who lived about the Year, 1066. of the <hi>Vulgar Aera,</hi> does not make their Empire so ancient as the rest of the Historians of that Nation; for whereas they make it begin at <hi>Folci, Su-ma-quam</hi> places it above 250 Years lower, and maintains that <hi>Hoam-ti</hi> was their first King.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore though the Science of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> has been so famous in the World, and the Wisdom of the <hi>Chinese</hi> be so much talk'd of now adays, their Chronology at least ought not to bear any great Authority among us; and much less ought the Sacred History of the Bible to be sacrificed to it.</p>
                     <p>Tho' the Chronology of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Bible be by some prefer'd before the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> yet 'tis utterly irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable with the Antiquities of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>: and <hi>Egyptians</hi>; the former only carrying the Times higher by 1500 Years than the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Account, whereas the latter pretend the World to be Forty thousand Years older. And whatever Esteem the Chronology of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> may have among some Men, either because 'tis made use of in the Martyrology of the Church, or because <hi>Baronius</hi> is pleased to follow it; yet 'tis certain that the Church does not prefer it to that of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, which it looks upon to be most Authentick; and a great many Men famous for their Piety as well as Learning, are of the same Opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55246:16"/>'Tis true the Chronology of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> is in the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology, but it does not from thence follow that it ought to have the Preference. The Reason of its being there, is because the Church had always an Esteem for what was Ancient; and her greatest Care being to preserve the more solid Goods, such as are the Articles of Faith, the Points of Morality, and the Rules of Discipline, she did not much regard these Trifles of Chronology, but left them to be discussed by her Learned Disputants; provided they manag'd them with that admirable Temper so conspicuous in S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who says with relation to these Matters, <hi>Eligo tantam Ignorantiam confiteri, quam falsam Scientiam profiteri</hi>; i. e. <hi>I had rather own my Ignorance in these Things, than pretend to a false Knowledge.</hi>

The Records of Antiquity, as well Sacred as Prophane, leave us too much in the Dark to pretend to it. There will be still insuperable Difficulties, and we shall meet with a thousand Instances, wherein it will be impossible for us to know whether we be in the Right or no.

                     <p n="1">I. The vast difference there is about Chronology betwixt the Bible of the <hi>Septuagints</hi> and our <hi>Vulgar,</hi> causes such a Perplexity that a Man does not know which way to get out of it. The <hi>Greek</hi> Bible reckons 1500 Years more than the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Bibles, from the Creation of the World to the Birth of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>; and the Misfortune is that one cannot tell on which side the Error lies. Some accuse the <hi>Greek</hi> Bible of extending the Times too far. Others maintain, That the <hi>Iews</hi> have contracted them too much, and that their Corruption of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, has occasioned the same Mistakes in the <hi>Latin</hi> Version. This Dispute is the more troublesome, as it is a hard Matter to decide
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55246:17"/>
it. One Thing however is certain, which is, That S. <hi>Augustine</hi> lays the Fault upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Bible, or rather upon those that first Transcrib'd it from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of <hi>Ptolemus Philadelphus,</hi> who, as he pretends, have introduced 1500 Years too many in the Lives of the Patriarchs. <hi>De Civit. Dei, Lib.</hi> 15. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. But every Body is not of S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Opinion: And the Author of <hi>The Antiquity of Times restored</hi> (with a great many more) has very different Thoughts, and speaks quite another way of the <hi>Greek</hi> Bible. So difficult it is to know which Side to be for in this Dispute.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is very difficult to compute the Chronology of the Bible exactly, by reason that in the Succession of the Judges of the People of God and the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> the Scripture makes no difference between a growing and a compleat Year; whereas it is not to be imagin'd that a Patriarch, a Judge, or a King, did live just 900, 100, or 60 Years, without any odd Months and Days. Wherefore, as <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> wisely observes, it is impossible exactly to determine the Times of the Patriarchs and Kings. [<hi>Ad Autol. Lib.</hi> 3.] There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chronologers are obliged to suppose a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Years of the Pedigrees of the Bible are always fully expired and compleat. Now if these Years be but just begun, and a Man reckons them for whole and compleat ones, he will stretch out and lengthen the Times; but on the contrary, if the Holy Writers have omitted the odd Months and Days of growing Years, 'tis most certain that we shall shorten and contract the Times, if we keep precisely to the computation of the Bible. Therefore, in Matters of Chronology, we must of necessity be satisfied with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures and Probabilities upon a thousand Occasions: We must persuade our selves once for all, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the Antiquity of the World, but within a few Years more or less; and ought to look upon all the Projects of restoring the Antiquity of Times to a nice Exactness and Precision, as foolish and chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The different Names which the <hi>Assyrians, Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Persians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> have given to the same Prince, have not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> contributed to confound the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55246:17"/>
ancient Chronology. <hi>Three or four Princes have born the Name of</hi> Assuerus, (says the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in his Discourse upon History) <hi>altho' they had others besides. If a Man was not told that</hi> Nabucodonosor, Nabucodrosor <hi>and</hi> Nabocolasser, <hi>are but the same Name, or the Name of the same Man, he could hardly believe it.</hi> Sargon <hi>is the same with</hi> Sennacherib; Ozias <hi>with</hi> Azarias; <hi>and</hi> Zedechias <hi>with</hi> Mathanias; Joachos <hi>was also c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lled</hi> Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; Asaraddon, <hi>which is indifferently pronounced,</hi> Esar haddon, <hi>or</hi> Asor-haddan, <hi>is called</hi> Asenaphar <hi>by the</hi> Cutheans; <hi>and, through an unaccountable Diversity,</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapulus <hi>is called</hi> Tonos Comoleros <hi>by the</hi> Greeks. Those different Names of the same Person, differently pronounced by several Nations according to the various Idioms of their Speech, must needs cause a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and Disorder in Things and Persons. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is so great in the Succession of the Kings of <hi>Assyria,</hi> that it is impossible for a Man ever to be truly satisfied about it.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. We have few Memorials left of the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the World, an infinite number of Books being quite lost. If <hi>Herodotus</hi> wrote the History of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> according to his Promise, it never was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have writ very late; and those that have, did not understand the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, and were often miserably ignorant of the Antiquities of <hi>Iudea.</hi> We may say the same of the <hi>Latin</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who being little skill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, and much less perhaps in the Affairs of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> have undoubtedly writ a great many Things at a venture and very ill digested. The generality of them have studied to please by the Politeness and Delicacy of their Writings, and curious and strange Stories, and have neglected the Times of the Events they speak of, which has cast a great Mist upon History.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The <hi>Aera</hi>'s and Years being different almost in every Nation, has occasion'd a great Disorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in Chronology. The <hi>Grecians</hi> computed the Time from the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> from' the Foundation of their City. More than that, some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had no <hi>Epocha</hi> at all, and have bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55246:18"/>
but late of using them; and among the rest, 'twas only about the Year, 532. that the Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reckon their Years from the Birth of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>The same difference is observable in Years as in <hi>Aera</hi>'s: In some Countries they made use of the <hi>Lunar</hi> Year of 354 Days, and in others of the <hi>Solar</hi> of 365 Days, and about six hours. Altho' we suppose the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians to have regarded this difference of Years, yet they could not avoid to make some Mistakes in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology; for besides, that People were then ignorant of the true Motion of the Sun and Moon, with which we are not perhaps throughly acquainted now adays, (let Posterity be the Judge) 'tis certain that among the Republicks of <hi>Greece,</hi> tho' never so well governed and regulated, they did not agree about the beginning of the <hi>Lunar</hi> Year. One begun it precisely at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Sun and Moon: Another two Days after, that is, when the New Moon began to be seen, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And others began their Year at the Full Moon.</p>
                     <p>The several Nations of the World have been no less divided about the Season where the Year should began. The <hi>Hebrews, Chaldeans, Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> begin it with the <hi>Autumn</hi> or Fall of the Leaf; the <hi>Grecians</hi> towards the Summer Solstice, and the <hi>Romans</hi> about the Winter's. The <hi>Mahometans,</hi> just at the <hi>Equinox,</hi> in the Spring; the <hi>Indian Gentiles</hi> the First Day of <hi>March</hi>; and the <hi>Arabians</hi> at the time of the Sun's entering the Sign of <hi>Leo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All these Things have thrown <hi>Chronology</hi> into so great an Obscurity, that it is not in the Power of the greatest Skill in the World to pierce through all the dark Mists which that variety of <hi>Aera</hi>'s and Years has cast over the Face of History. Therefore</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Varro</hi> most wisely calls <hi>uncertain, obscure</hi> and <hi>fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> the generality of those Events related by Historians to have happen'd before the <hi>Olympiads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</hi> says positively, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. That there is nothing certain in all that the History mentions concerning the Transactions before the War of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55246:18"/>
                        <hi>Macrobius</hi> assures us, That we must not expect any Certainty in <hi>Roman</hi> Histories, when they relate any thing that happen'd 260 Years before the Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi>; and that concerning those Times, Writers are rather Tellers of Fables than Historians.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Iustin</hi> the Martyr, <hi>in Paraenetico,</hi> maintains, That there is nothing constantly true in <hi>Greek</hi> Histories before the <hi>Olympiads</hi>; and that we have no Account left, either by the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to inform us of what happen'd in those remote Ages.</p>
                     <p>I have dwelt so long upon this Subject, in order to shew that in point of ancient Chronology, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Accounts we find in the Holy Scripture, since we can expect nothing concerning the first Times from Prophane Historians. And here we must take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Wisdom of Providence, which has so well ordered Things, that we have Light enough to make a firm Concatenation of the Succession of Times; for where Prophane History fails us in the first three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years of the World, we have the Chronology of the Bible to guide us: And when afterwards we find the Accounts of Time more obscure in the Holy Scriptures, we meet, in Requital, with more Light in the Writings of Prophane Authors. And there begins the Time which <hi>Varro</hi> calls <hi>Historical,</hi> because since the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> the Truth of Things begins to be conspicuous in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. So that before that Time we must enlighten Prophane History by the help of the Sacred; and not pretend to correct the Chronology of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible and our <hi>Vulgar</hi>; by the Antiquities of the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chinese,</hi> which is a plain and visible over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the Order of Things, and no better than to give a blind Guide to one that sees well.</p>
                     <p>By all I have said, I do not mean to confute the Book of <hi>The Antiquity of Times restored</hi>; my only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is to caution young People, for whom particularly I write, against a certain Spirit of Curiosity which has been predominant among us for some Years past, and whose stirring Character is too apt to remove those Bounds which we ought to preserve with great Veneration. As for the rest, I both honour and esteem the Merit of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55246:19"/>
Author, and I am very far from having any Thoughts to offend him.</p>

                     <p>FRom what I have said about the uncertainty of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, some perhaps will be apt to think, That the Doctrin of Times does not deserve our Application, and that we must take out of History as much as we can, without troubling our selves with a nice Marshal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Events according to the Order and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Ages, since, after all, this Order is very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uncertain. I know very well that there are those who will give their <hi>Sceptism</hi> a free Scope upon this Matter; and if their Opinion could prevail, ancient History would be in little or no Esteem. But it is not fit to depend upon the Judgment of those who never studied Things but superficially, and whose Merit wholly consists in a pragmatical, peremptory way of delivering their Opinions: For if there be doubtful and obscure Things in Chronology, there are also those that are undeniably certain and evident.</p>
                     <p>There are two Books in the World, both Divine ones, from whence <hi>Chronology</hi> draws its Certainty. The first is the Book of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> where we find the Years of the Patriarchs, Judges, Kings and Princes, of the People of God, whereby we are able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine within a small Matter the Antiquity of the World, and link almost together the whole Succession of Times, except some few Breaks and Interruptions, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Silence of the Scripture, and which we shall mark in the following Article. But where the <hi>Scripture</hi> fails us, Prophane History comes in to our Help, so that we can precisely tell how long that Silence has lasted.</p>
                     <p>The other Book (which is our second sure Ground for Chronology) is that of <hi>Nature</hi>; this, as well as the first, is the Work of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This Book, by furnishing us with the Motions and Aspects of the Sun and Moon, and other Planets, and above all the Eclipses, which are so rightly called the <hi>publick, celestial and infallible Characters of Times,</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55246:19"/>
gives certain and demonstrable Arguments to Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, of the Times wherein a vast number of the most signal Events of History did happen. For an Eclipse either of the Sun or Moon is such a characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical and identical Mark of a Year, that it is easy to distinguish it among an infinite number of others, which makes Eclipses to be look'd upon as the most assured Grounds of Chronology. Certainly nothing can so well characterize the Year of a Battle, of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a City, or the Death of a Prince, as an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipse that happens the same Day, or some Days before or after: Since by means of Astronomical Tables it is found, that an Eclipse seen upon such or such a Day, ought necessarily to have happened in such and such a Year. This method is grounded upon Mathematical Demonstrations; which is as much as if I had said, That it is so certain and evident that Human Reason can never revolt against it.</p>
                     <p>By this it appears that in Point of Chronology a Man cannot be an exact Critick, if he be ignorant of the use of Astronomical Tables for the Calculation of Eclipses.</p>
                     <p>Setting aside that this Computation of Eclipses is one of the greatest and most wonderful Effects of the Reach of Human Understanding, and that there is an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Satisfaction in foretelling an Eclipse, together with its Greatness and Duration, fifty, nay even a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years before it happens, methinks the great use they are of in <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Chronology</hi> is sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>Astronomy</hi> to us; by whose Help we arrive at the Pleasure of calculating them to a very nice Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. And therefore we must conclude that none but the dull and ignorant Despisers of all good Literature, can entertain an Indifference for so fine and important a Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Now since the Certainty which Eclipses give to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is infallible, we must account our selves happy for the care Historians have taken to mention so great a number of them. 'Tis true their Diligence, as to this Matter, is particularly owing to the foolish Error of the ancient Heathens, who look'd upon these Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena as Presages of the Death of some great Person, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55246:20"/>
of the Fall of an Empire. However<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Historians have mark'd the Days wherein Eclipses did happen, they have left at the same time assured Signs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to know the Years of the Events which fell out about the same Time.</p>
                     <p>This is the Reason why the Eclipses mentioned by Historians, have been so carefully collected by skilful Chronologers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Calvisius</hi> makes his <hi>Chronology</hi> depend upon 127 Eclipses of the Moon, and 144 of the Sun, which he assures us he has calculated himself.</p>
                     <p>Thus by an Eclipse of the Sun, mentioned by <hi>Iustin,</hi> [<hi>Lib.</hi> 22. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.] which happen'd when <hi>Agathocles,</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was crossing the Sea, to go over into <hi>Africa</hi> against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> it is found by an Astronomical Calculation, That this was in the Year of the World, 3634. and 316 Years before the Vulgar <hi>Aera,</hi> on the Fifteenth of <hi>August.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The great Conjunction of the two superior Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whereby these two Stars, having run through all the four Trigons, meet again, according to <hi>Kepler,</hi> at the end of 800 Years, in the same degree of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> would be also one of the most excellent Methods to distinguish and characterize the Times, if Historians had taken notice of those rare and unfrequent Aspects.</p>
                     <p>Archbishop <hi>Vsher</hi> tells us, That in the Year of the World, 3998. two Years before the Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, there was a great Conjunction of those Planets, such as never happens but once in 800 Years.</p>
                     <p>There have been but Eight of these great Conjunctions since the Creation of the World, as one may see by Astronomical Calculations. The last of them happen'd in the beginning of this Century, in the Month of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1603.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All the Aspects of the Planets, which happen but seldom, might serve also for natural Characters to mark the Times.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But among these natural Characters, some are called <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Artificial,</hi> because invented by Men: Such as the <hi>Solar</hi> and <hi>Lunar Cycles,</hi> the <hi>Roman Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Easter,</hi> the <hi>Leap-year:</hi> Among the <hi>Iews,</hi> the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55246:20"/>
                        <hi>Iubilees,</hi> and <hi>Sabbatical Years</hi>; and among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, <hi>the Combats and publick Games,</hi> such as the <hi>Olympick,</hi> which were always celebrated in a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Time.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Vncertainty Chronologers are at concerning the Year wherein our Saviour was born.</head>
                  <p>'TIS matter of Surprize, that the Professors of Christianity should have lived so long without knowing precisely how many Years are elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed since the Birth of the Saviour of the World: And it cannot be denied but that this Ignorance is very shameful to Christians, whom it so nearly concerns to know all that belongs to the Mysterious Incarnation of the Son of God. 'Tis true, that some time since People have begun to be sensible that the <hi>Christian Aera</hi> was too short, and that it wanted about two or three Years to begin with the Birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ: They have also found out, at last, that it wants four compleat Years to reach the Birth of our Saviour; but this Knowledge is come but very late.</p>
                  <p>They have followed that Error for near 1200 Years, without being sensible of it; and now that we are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently acquainted with it, we cannot but follow it on still; since we cannot mend it without making a great many Changes in the Date of Affairs, both Ecclesiastical and Civil. Which would occasion a greater Trouble and Disorder, than did in the last Age, the cutting off ten Days for the Correction of the Kalendar.</p>
                  <p>We are fallen into that Error by following upon Trust <hi>Dionysius Exiguus,</hi> an Abbot, who in the Year, 532. began first, among Christians, to make an <hi>Epoch</hi> of the Birth of our Saviour, and compute the Years from that Time, in order to make Chronology altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian. It seems this learned Man was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exact in his Computation, tho' it were at that time not over difficult, since he lived in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the VI. Century, when they did not want Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and Memorials to settle and regulate that Chronology.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55246:22"/>But tho' there have been great Difficulties in finding out the true number of Years, that have follow'd the Birth of our Saviour, yet there are infinitely greater in computing the Years that have gone before it. In that, great space of so many Years, it is not possible for a, Man not to go astray, in some Place or other: That<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Way is so long, so dark, so little beaten through by Historians, especially that part of it where the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the World lie, that it would be a kind of Miracle if no Body should mistake it, and all Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers go Hand in Hand together.</p>
                  <p>The same Reasons which prove the Holy Scripture, and the remaining Monuments of ancient History, to be insufficient to make a clear and firm Concatenation of the Succession of Times, do also evince by a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, That we cannot justly determine the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Year of the coming of the Messiah. Therefore we must not wonder to see Chronologers so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided upon this Matter. This Confusion goes so far, that it is become a Proverb to say, <hi>They agree no more than Chronologers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, this Misunderstanding does not proceed from a Desire of contradicting others, and setting up a Party in the learned World, tho' the generality of Men be extream fond of the Reputation of a new System; but this War, the most obstinate and irreconcilable that ever was, springs from the very Nature of the Thing it self, which will ever be full of insuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frederick Gusman,</hi> in a Letter to the Elector Palatine, reckons up 40 different Opinions about the Year of the World wherein our Saviour was born.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvisius</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> very learned in Chronology, tells us, That he could scarce find two Authors who agreed upon that Matter. <hi>De Annis Mundi,</hi> cap. 27. p. 160.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maestlinus,</hi> who had spent all his Life-time in the Study of the Mathematicks and Chronology, assures us, That he had met with 132 Opinions intirely different in that respect.</p>
                  <p>As imperfect as the Doctrin of the Times may seem here to be, yet it has merited the Application of the most refined and discerning Wits; and a vast number of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55246:22"/>
Men, illustrious in the Arts and Sciences, have made it their particular Study. We must not be discouraged by the Difficulties we are to encounter, since the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and indefatigable Labour of those great Men, born to surmount the hardest Obstacles, has already cleared and made plain an infinite number of Facts, which were dark and intricate a hundred Years ago. Their Discoveries will undoubtedly be carried on further; but in the mean time we must advertize those, who have a Mind to enter upon this sort of Study, of what they must look for, and what they will really find in Chronology: First, That they may not think that there is an equal Degree of Certainty in every Thing; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That they do not expect the same Evidence as in the Mathematicks.</p>
                  <p>Among the Chronologers that disagree about the Year of the World of the coming of the Messiah, I have chosen those that I thought the most considerable, whose Computation you have in the following Table: Where you may observe, that of all those Authors none reckons more than 7000 Years, nor less than 3700.</p>

There was in the first Ages of the Church an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tradition, That the World was to last but 6000 Years; which popular Opinion is said to be originally derived from <hi>Eliah</hi>'s House. But however, 'tis certain that this Tradition was grounded upon Rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonance and Agreeableness: The chief of which was, That God had made the World in Six Days, and rested the Seventh. To this they added, That according to the Words of the 89th <hi>Psalm,</hi> v. 4. <hi>A thousand Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord are like one Day</hi>; and therefore that there were 6000 Years appointed for the Labours of this Life, after which time the Saints would enjoy a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath with God; that is, rest for ever with him. They allowed 2000 Years before the Law, 2000 Years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, at the end of which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come, and whose Reign was to last 2000 Years more. Finally they said, That if the World did not endure all that Time, 'twould be because the Sins of Men should grow to such a height, that God could no longer bear with them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the 6000 Years of the World are the Six Days of the Week before God; and the eternal Sabbath of the Saints, in the Repose of Glory, will be the Seventh.

                  <p>
                     <hi>This difference among Authors concerning the Time of our Saviour's Birth, proceeds chiefly from a Mistake of the Year of the World that</hi> Abraham <hi>was born in; for the old Opinion was, That he was the eldest Son of</hi> Terah, <hi>and born in the</hi> 70<hi>th Year of his Father's Age; but more exact Chronologists, particularly Archbishop</hi> Usher, <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Raleigh <hi>and Dr.</hi> Howell <hi>say, That he was not the eldest Son, but born after his two Brethren</hi> Nahor <hi>and</hi> Haran, <hi>and in the</hi> 130<hi>th Year of his Father's Age, which makes a difference of</hi> 60 <hi>Years. Now the time from</hi> Abraham <hi>downward is calculated right enough; but by
reason of this difference of</hi> 60 <hi>Years in his time, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from the Creation</hi> (<hi>which was</hi> 1948 or 2008 <hi>Years before the Birth of</hi> Abraham) <hi>must necessarily be different also, when apply'd to the Years of other</hi> Aera's. <hi>If the old Account be follow'd, which places</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Birth in the</hi> 70<hi>th Year of his Father, and in the</hi> 1948<hi>th of the World, then the Year of our Saviour's Birth will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55246:27"/>
fall in with the</hi> 3948<hi>th of the World; but if the other Computation take place, it will be found to be in the</hi> 4008<hi>th Year of the World, which is</hi> 60 <hi>Years more. Wherefore our Author's Supputation of</hi> 4000 <hi>Years falls in pretty well with this, and may justly enough be follow'd: But inasmuch as this Account is modern and not made by the generality of Chronologers, we have not chosen to follow it in this Work, complying rather with</hi> Helvicus <hi>and</hi> Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; <hi>which being the latest, both of good Esteem in the World, and the only two general Chronologies in English, will to be sure be applied to by our Reader, when he desires more particular Information than this small Volume can admit of, but he will be puzzled to find what he wants if the</hi> Aera's <hi>do not agree: And then it is but adding</hi> 60 <hi>to the Year of the World, and you have the other Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also. 'Tis for this Reason that we have ventur'd to Recede from our Author, and make the Accounts all along to comply with</hi> Helvicus <hi>and</hi> Tallent; <hi>except only, that for the sake of a round Number we have follow'd Mr.</hi> Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>and suppos'd</hi> 3950 <hi>Years from the Creation to our Saviour, which being but two Years more than</hi> Helvicus, <hi>can breed no great difference.</hi>

If he had been serious in his Accounts of the <hi>Scythians, Egyptians,</hi> and several other Nations, we should be obliged to call him the <hi>Father of Lies and Fables,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> honours with the Title of the <hi>Father of History.</hi> But tho' we should be forc'd to give Credit to those Relations which carry so few Characters of Truth with them, we would not therefore be much the better for it, since <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s History reaching no higher than <hi>Giges</hi> King of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> who lived about the Year of the World, 3238. and 712 Years before the Vulgar <hi>Aera,</hi> he leaves us at a Loss and in the Dark for about 3300 Years, of which he gives no Account. What we find in <hi>Berosus, Manetho, Metasthenes, Philo</hi> and <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> is still very uncertain; and there's a great deal of Reason to doubt whither there ever were Kings that bore the Names which those Authors give them. And indeed we meet no where, in all the Old Testament, with the Name of any of those Kings of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> so much celebrated by Prophane Historians; whereas we often meet with those of the Princes of the <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, Ammonites, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria,</hi> and others less considerable, that have been either the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or Allies of the <hi>Iews.</hi> We must not expect more Light from other Historians: <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> begins his History at the Siege of <hi>Troy: Trogus Pompeius</hi> ascends no higher than <hi>Ninus</hi>; and who shall instruct us of what has happened before those Times?</p>
                     <p>Christian Religion, into whose Hands the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are deposited, can alone, by the Light she draws from them, connect the first Times into a continued and uninterrupted Succession from the beginning of the World, to the Return from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity: And then as we find more Obscurity in the Accounts of Time in the Holy Scripture, we find, in requital, more Light in the Writings of Prophane Authors. However we must observe, That the Bible serves only to regulate Sacred Chronology, and gives us little or no Account concerning the History of the Nations of the Earth.</p>

                     <head>§. <hi>3.</hi> The Third Division of the Times, into Four Parts, according to the Poets.</head>
                     <p>SInce ancient Poets were Historians, Philosophers, Divines, and Masters in all sorts of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to the first Men, we must not altogether reject what they have left us, tho' intermix'd with abundance of Fables and idle Stories.</p>
                     <p>They divided all the Times into Four Ages: The First was the <hi>Golden Age</hi>; the Second the <hi>Age of Silver</hi>; the Third the <hi>Age of Brass</hi>; and the Fourth <hi>The Iron Age.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>The Golden Age,</hi> so much celebrated in their Writings, the Poets ascrib'd to <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Reign; during which the Prolifick Earth spontaneously produc'd the many good Things, which she now bestows only on the laborious Cultivater. Then <hi>Ianus</hi> gave Peace to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; <hi>Astrea,</hi> i. e. <hi>Iustice</hi> reigned in this lower World, and all Men had every Thing in Common, and lived in perfect Amity together. They tell us, That this Age lasted till <hi>Saturn</hi> was expelled his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>From this Description it is easy to understand, that this Fable does properly suit with that Age which our first Parents past in the Terrestrial Paradice; and that <hi>Adam</hi> turned out of this delicious Place, whereof he was Master, is most certainly the same with <hi>Saturn,</hi> so famous in the Heathenish Poets, who represent him as an Exile from Heaven, wandering up and down the Earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>The Age of Silver</hi> is attributed to <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Reign, whom <hi>Virgil</hi> charges with furnishing Serpents with Poison, and sending Wolves and other fierce Creatures to annoy Mankind. At that time the Earth yielded nothing but proportionably to the Care and Labour of the Husbandman. We may extend this Age as far as the Time when Tyrants arose among Men, who, out
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55246:30"/>
of an ambitious Thirst after Power, oppressed the rest by Violence and Injustice. This Age of Silver ends with the Time when <hi>Nimrod, Cham</hi>'s Grandson, made himself powerful, built <hi>Babylon,</hi> and laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> towards the Year of the World, 1718. and 62 Years after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</p>
                     <p>Thus far the People of God lived happy, as one may see by the Patriarchs of those Times: But their Condition was extreamly chang'd afterwards, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>The Age of Brass</hi> begins with the Time when furious Men, possessed by an unjust Passion for Power and Authority, began to domineer over others. Such a one was <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who was the first that fell foul upon his Neighbours, and endeavoured to destroy them by so cruel and bloody Wars, that there's Reason to doubt whether there be in Nature a greater Enemy to Man, than Man himself. In this Age happen'd the War, taking and burning of <hi>Troy</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the Year of the World, 2767. and 1183 Years before the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>Aera.</hi> The Poets close this <hi>Age of Brass</hi> with the Time when there were no more Hero's, or, as they call them, Demi-gods.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>Age of Brass</hi> the People of God suffered more than they had done before: <hi>Abraham</hi> had great Wars to maintain, and afterwards the <hi>Israelites</hi> were oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under the Domination of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent great Slavery in the Times of the Judges.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Iron Age</hi> begins with the First <hi>Olympiad</hi>; that is, the Year of the World, 3174. And indeed towards that time <hi>Hesiod</hi> begun to complain that it was so. <hi>Ovid,</hi> in the Description he makes of it, says, That all manner of Crimes begun then to reign; that Shame and Justice fled away, instead of which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Impudence, Violence, Imposture, and Murder; and that whereas Men were formerly contented with those Riches which Nature yielded on the Superficies of the Earth, they begun then to rack her Bowels, and dig the Gold and Silver she concealed there, which may be called the fatal Cause of all the Disorders and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

                     <p>THe Time of Man's Life being divided by some into Seven Ages, <hi>Chronologers</hi> have thought fit, by a sort of Analogy, to divide likewise all the Times of the World into Seven different Ages.

                     <argument>
                        <p>This <hi>Epocha</hi> reaches as far as the Peace given to the Church by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and lasts 312 Years.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Time which GOD had determin'd to diffuse the Blessings of his Mercies upon Mankind, and give a Saviour to the World, being come, the Holy Ghost formed in the Virgin's Womb, the Body of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Child, who was to reconcile the Plenitude of the Godhead, with the Meanness and Subjection of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. God Almighty, in order to bring the blessed Virgin from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> her ordinary Abode, to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> where the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be born according to the Prophets; orders it so, that the Emperor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> issued out a Proclamation, to cause all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of his Empire to be Registred in their Birth-place. Therefore <hi>Mary</hi> went to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> with <hi>Ioseph</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was of that Place, and of <hi>David</hi>'s Family; and because all the Inns were full, and no Lodging to be had any where, they were oblig'd to take up with a Stable, where the blessed Virgin, in a cold Night, brought forth our Lord and Saviour, and laid him in a Manger. That Night, which Christians shall celebrate during all Ages, has given us the Sun of Righteousness, the Light of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Glory of the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> This Birth, so dear and precious to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, happen'd on the 25th of <hi>December,</hi> in the Year of the World, 3950.</p>
                     <p>JESUS CHRIST is circumcised Eight Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Birth, on the Kalends of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; that is, the First of that Month.</p>
                     <p>JESUS CHRIST is worshipp'd by the wise Men, offer'd at the Temple; and afterwards carried into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

                        <hi>Herod</hi> puts the innocent Children to Death. He dies a miserable Death a little while after; the Kingdom divided by <hi>Augustus</hi> between <hi>Archilaus, Herod Antipas,</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> our Saviour being 2 Years old.</p>

                     <head>EPOCHA XII. <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> or the Establishment of the New Empire. 800.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>This <hi>Epocha</hi> goes to the taking of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and thereby the Downfal of the Eastern Empire; and lasts <hi>653</hi> Years.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CHarles</hi> the Great, call'd in French <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> was one of the greatest Princes that has been. He was Couragious, Learned, and Eminent by a great many Virtues. He favoured very much Men of Learning, having declared himself Patron to them as well as to the Holy See; for he took no less Care of the Church, than he did of his Kingdom. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> III. who in 795. had succeeded <hi>Adrian,</hi> was very much abused by his Enemies; which <hi>Charlemaign</hi> sensibly resenting, came to <hi>Rome</hi> to punish the Authors of it. The Pope, out of a grateful Acknowledgment for the many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which both this King, his Father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, had done the Holy See, crowned him on <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-day,</hi> in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and saluted him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. Thus the 800th Year of JESUS CHRIST gave a New Emperor to the West.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>This <hi>Epocha</hi> is continued as far as the Year, <hi>1660.</hi> wherein King <hi>Charles</hi> being Restor'd, the ancient Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government of <hi>England</hi> was re-establish'd.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT must be confess'd that this Epocha begins not so happily as those that have gone before it, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as almost every one of them commenc'd from some great Action whereby the Almighty bestow'd some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit upon his People; this alas! begins with a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable state of the Christian World, and shews us the expulsion of the true Religion out of <hi>Greece</hi> and its Neighbouring Provinces, by the entrance of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Cruelty into <hi>Europe,</hi> after it had ravag'd almost all <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> But it must be acknowledg'd, that the Divine Providence was just in this Punishment of those unworthy Christians, who by intruding Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies first, caused Schisms and continual Feuds in the Church; and afterwards by Superstition, profain'd their most Holy Religion; and yet by bitter Persecution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd the Holy Professors of true Christianity, that in those Ages oppos'd themselves to the innovated Idolatry and Superstition.</p>
                     <p>We might justly enough call the last Epocha Dark and Illitarate, as we must Name this that follows the Enlightned and Learned Age of Christianity; for the Northern <hi>Barbarians</hi> that over-run <hi>Europe</hi> in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries, had so effectually swept away all s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of the several Benefits of History.</head>
                  <p>IT is altogether unnecessary to say any thing in Commendation of History, since it is sufficiently known how great Advantages that Study has always brought to such as have been destin'd to great Employments: But at the same time I think my self obliged to set forth some of the Benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to lay down a few <hi>Rules</hi> to be observed by those that would make a right use of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. History informs us of Things past, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we should know no more of, than we do of those to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55246:59"/>
come. 'Tis true, Prophecy dives into Matters before they are parted from their Causes, and which perhaps are not effected till after a long space of Years; yet, however strong Men's Inclinations may run that way, it must still be own'd, that we are not able to give any tolerable Account of Futurity, and that it is God alone who has formed the Chain of Causes, that can know what Effects they will produce. Moreover, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy commonly teaches us is so very obscure, that it seems not to care to be understood, till the Things it treats of are come to pass: When on the contrary, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story may be easily comprehended by us, as containing Matters handled down from our Fore-fathers to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and which we are commanded by the Law of God to make Search into. <hi>Enquire of your Father, and he'll inform you: Consult your Ancestors, and they'll instruct you</hi>: Deut. 32.7.</p>
                  <p>Also we could never have the least Insight into Times past were it not for Historians, who have all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the most memorable Actions happening in their Time, and preserv'd the most precious Thoughts of our Ancestors, which would otherwise have been devour'd by Time, that never makes any difference betwixt what is past, and what to come. Wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously terms History, <hi>The Record of Time; The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth; The Life of Memory; The Mistress of Life</hi>; and, <hi>The Courier of Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Word, History gives a Being and Existence to what without it would be stifled in the Birth; nay, it communicates a kind of Immortality to all famous Men, whose Actions made 'em to be so much valued while they liv'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. History is the most excellent and most entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diversion that a Man can possibly have, since it may be said particularly thereof, what was spoken in general by a very learned Man, of all sorts of Books, <hi>viz. That they were easy and disinteressed Masters, which might be consulted at all Times; and on all Occasions, without Fear either of Raillery, Anger or Satyr.

                  <p n="3">III. Those that are defign'd for great Employs have more need of History than any others, for they thereby lay a Foundation in their Youth, which proves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very serviceable to them, however they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd either in Church or State, and which otherwise could not be effected but by a great number of Years.</p>
                  <p>It was this Consideration that mov'd the Emperor <hi>Basilius</hi> to recommend so earnestly the reading of History to his Son and Successor <hi>Leo</hi> the Philosopher, when he says, <hi>Neglect nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Son, to make the History of the Ancients familiar to you, since you may there gain with Pleasure and without Difficulty, what has cost others so much Care and Labour. The Art of Government so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly capricious and tedious, which could otherwise be attained to only by a long Experience and tiresome Custom, is taught by History with all the Ease imaginable. There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ou may meet both Virtues and Vices in their proper Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as likewise observe the various Conditions of Humane Life, together with the parpetual Instability and Vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Things of this World, as also the Establishment, Revolutions and Fall of Empires. In a word, you may there observe how Virtue goes seldom unrewarded, nor Vice unpunished, and that therefore it is the surest way to Glory and Honour to be Innocent and Iust; and to abhor Vice, which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>The great Character History bestows on good Men, and the Ignominy it casts on the Bad, with that Severity which neither spares the Crown nor the Mitre, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Motives to inspire the Love of Virtue, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>orrence of Vice, <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> says very well, <hi>That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not one of the least Benefits of History, that Vice is always therein represented Infamous; for thereby great Men are deterr'd from evil Courses, for fear of the Iustice of an impartial Historian.</hi> Let a Prince be never so great a Libertine, he will always have regard to his Reputation, even at a time when he has the greatest Contempt for Virtue. The Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55246:60"/>
immoderately cruel and voluptuous, would no doubt have been yet more Vicious, had not he dreaded the Account his Historian would have given of him; wherefore you see him retire at length from the Eye of the World, and hide himself where he thought to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from an Impartial Pen. Can there then be a Study more useful to Mankind, especially to Princes, than where they find treasured up all manner of Rules for their Conduct?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Selymus</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> did not acquire that great Reputation which almost obscur'd the Memory of his Predecessors, who treated History with the greatest Contempt, but by causing <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Commentaries to be Translated into his Language; for thereby he became so true an observer of the Conduct of that great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that in a short time he Conquer'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Lesser <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Also <hi>Caesar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did not arrive to that pitch of Glory and Honour that we find he did, but through a violent Emulation which he conceiv'd at reading of the Life of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; insomuch that he could not refrain from Tears, when he consider'd that he had done little at an Age when that mighty Conqueror had subdu'd so many Kingdoms. Yet, however great might be <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Ambition, it is certain that he had form'd his design of Conquering the World, upon reading of the Actions of <hi>Achilles</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> and whom he chose all along for his Model. But not to go out of <hi>France,</hi> who does not know that the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. laid the Basis of that prudent and politick Management, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards render'd him one of the greatest Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> upon the Life of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. written by <hi>Philip de Comines?</hi> Nothing has so great Influence over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as the Impressions receiv'd from the Examples of great Men, for we are naturally apt to believe, thro a good Opinion we have of our selves, that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing any thing that has been done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat like this, the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> speaks of History in his excellent Discourse address'd to the <hi>Dauphin. For,</hi> says he, <hi>tho' History were of no use to other Men, yet ought Princes however to read it, since
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55246:60"/>
there is no better way to bring them acquainted with the Power of Passions and Interests, as also with the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ce of Time, and of good and bad Councils. Histories are made up of nothing but Actions, all which seem chiefly to be compil'd for the Vse and Imitation of great Men: If Experience be necessary to acquire that P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>udence which makes them Govern well, there can be nothing more assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to them, than to joyn Examples of Times past to the Experience of Times present. Whereas Princes now adays scarce ever care to be convinc'd of any Error, but at the Expence of their Subjects or their own Honour, when by the help of History they might form an infallible Iudgm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt without running any hazard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. History has those Charms, that it has recovered its Readers from the most dangerous Sicknesses, nay even when the Art of Medicine has been at loss for a Remedy. Examples of which we have in two Kings, of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily, Alphonsus</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> both whose Maladies were so charm'd by reading <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Curtius,</hi> that they were restor'd to their Health when they had been given over by all their Physicians.</p>
                  <p>'Tis also reported, That <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly stil'd the Father of Letters, was recover'd from a very dangerous Illness, by the Relation of a Passage out of the History of the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> III. which was as follows. This Emperor having reduced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious City of <hi>Veinsberg,</hi> commanded it to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely destroy'd, and moreover ordered that its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants should be all made Prisoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except the Women only. Whereupon these Women made their humble Suit to the Emperor, that they might save at least what they were able to carry away; which being granted, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> was infinitely surpriz'd to see them march out with their Husbands and Children on their Backs, and mov'd to so much Compassion thereby, that he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately pardoned the whole City. It was to this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> ow'd his Life, which made <hi>Bodin</hi> to cry out, <hi>Quanquam Historia salutare est Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentum?</hi> [Method. ad Histor. Proemio, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. History is of that known Benefit in discovering the Truth of the Christian Religion, that without the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55246:61"/>
Assistance of it and Philosophy, we could never be able to oppose the Atheists and <hi>Pirrhenians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What we borrow from Philosophy to defend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with, is very considerable and solid; for thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through a Contemplation of the Universe, we come to the knowledge of a Sovereign Being which Created and Governs it, and likewise are sufficiently convinc'd, that this great Work cannot possibly be Eternal.</p>
                  <p>In a word, The just and due Order of all things of this World, produces such a Beauty and Harmony, as could not proceed but from the great Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Almighty. A Philosopher demanding one Day of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who liv'd in the Deserts of <hi>Appi, How he could apply himself to the Contemplation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without the assistance of Books?</hi> The Holy Hermit answer'd, <hi>This vast Globe</hi> (meaning the World) <hi>serves me instead of a Library; and the Creatures therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, are as so many legible Characters, whereby I can discover the Omnipotence of God, and which by consequence easily disposes me to a Meditation on his Grandeur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being inspir'd with the same Thought, said, <hi>That the World was a large Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> written by the Hand of God; consisting only of three Leaves, which were the Heavens, Earth, and Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A long time before which <hi>David</hi> teaches us, <hi>That the Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> Psalm 18. which no doubt made <hi>Tertullian</hi> observe <hi>that God first laid open the Book of Nature to dispose Men for receiving the divine Writ, being willing that they should become Disciples of Nature, before they were so of Grace. Praemisit Deus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam Magistram, submissurus &amp; Prophetiam, quo faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius credat Prophetiae Discipulus Naturae.</hi> Tertul. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrect. Carnis.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who was as famous for his Learning as his Piety, declar'd often to his Friends, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress which he had made in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, proceeded from Prayer and Meditation, to which he apply'd himself in the Fields and Forests, and where he had no other guides but Oaks and Beeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those Philosophers also, who were most deeply ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with the shades of Paganism, have term'd the World <hi>A Cabinet of Contemplation, wherein were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55246:61"/>
all the Curiosities and Riches of Nature, which had been so prudently rang'd and order'd by the Sovereign Wisdom.</hi> Naturae Musaeum.</p>
                  <p>We need therefore only open our Eyes to discover the Wonders of Nature govern'd by an Almighty Hand; and when I affirm that Philosophy is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that the World is not Eternal, I do not mean only that of the Schools, but also that of Nature, which is the Portion of all Men. This Philosophy wherein we only make use of our common Sense and Reason, helps us to comprehend the Truth of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by a serious Reflection on Nature. It is that which inspires us when we say to our selves,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The World cannot be Eternal, because it has sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Proofs of its varying every Day. Mountains les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and Valleys rise, and Rivers roul their Dregs into the Sea, where they frequently form dry Land. The Sea likewise changes its Shores; all which would have been no doubt establish'd and fix'd, had the World been from all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whence proceeds the Motion of so many different Parts? Who has order'd the Sun to make his alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Courses through both the Hemispheres, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion Seasons by his Declension and Propinquity? Certainly this Motion does not proceed from its Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er which cannot be consider'd but as finite, divisible, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable and susceptible only of Motion from an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Why is this Matter, of which the World is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, capable of Motion without which it must have tended altogether to a Chaos? How comes it to pass that the smaller Bodies of this Matter are rather mov'd to one side than the other? Why, if all mov'd with an equal Rapidity, are they not always follow'd by one another without falling into those infinite Spaces where the Atheist throws them? And seeing the greater Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do not all follow the same Track, nor move with the same Force; as for Example, the Planets turn from West to East, and the other Stars on the contrary from East to West; let any Body tell us who it is that hath determin'd and assign'd these different Motions, as well as the Quickness or Rapidity of one, and the great
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55246:62"/>
Slowness of the other. The Moon passes through the Zodiack in a Month, whereas <hi>Mercury</hi> takes up 87 Days to perform that Journey, and <hi>Venus</hi> about 224 the Sun, or the Earth rather, 365 Days; <hi>Mars</hi> twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Why are some of these Bodies plac'd above and others beneath? And how comes it to pass that thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. II. Rules to be observed in writing History.</head>
                  <p>HIstory being a true Narration for Benefit of Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, interwoven with many memorable Events either of Peace or War, ought to be attempted without Rules and Art. An Historian is not to be guided impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely by his Genius, how great soever it be: And the manner after which we commonly judge of History sufficiently shews that of all Works of the Mind, none require so great Attention and so exact a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless the Rules I here set down, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for those that shall write History for the future, but only for Youth that shall read what is already written. Their Judgments must be elevated and plac'd as it were above the Authors they peruse, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may not servilely rely upon them, and believe whatever they have written to be unquestionable. On the other side it is a Fault in our Imaginations to slight the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, for Wit has ever been the Growth of all Age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and all Countries; yet at the same time it will be acknowledg'd no less a Weakness to look upon what they have left us as Miracles. We ought to treat our Ancestors neither with Submission nor Contempt, but with a just Enquiry into their Perfections and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.</p>
                  <p>As the Rules I am about to give are not of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the Publick being wholly Indebted for them to the ingenious Translator of <hi>Salust,</hi> so I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all pretence to any Merit thereby, it having been only my Business to translate the learned Preface of that judicious Critick.</p>
                  <p>History consists of two Parts,
<list>
                        <item>I. Narration, which is the Body of it, and whose Business is to relate impartially all remarkable Actions of this Life. And</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55246:63"/>II. Political Reflections, which are its Soul, and which are to be imitated upon all Occasions.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Narration ought to be Brief and Concise, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Orations, History and Epick Poetry, because a Reader there does not care to hear that which he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready comprehended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> has made a very false Judgment of <hi>Salust</hi> when he stiles him, <hi>Omnium Scriptorum Numerossimum</hi>; and in my Judgment the two <hi>Seneca's, Quintilian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Gillius, Macrobius, Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> &amp;c. have given a much better Account of him.</p>
                  <p>Three Things contribute to Brevity of Style, 1. Genius. 2. Art. And 3. Language.</p>
                  <p>First, A strong and lively Genius is requir'd that may go through with a Work, and surmount all vulgar Eyes; the Tokens of which are to have Thoughts and Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where Truth and Novelty are join'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salust</hi> was naturally bent to Brevity; and <hi>Cicero,</hi> on the contrary, to Copiousness, which is necessary to be known, since that for want of such Reflection, many learned Men have taken false Measures. Some, that Nature design'd to resemble <hi>Salust</hi> in his way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, have nevertheless made it their Endeavours to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Cicero</hi>; and others, that were born to follow <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> have presum'd to imitate <hi>Salust</hi>; so that by these means both have done violence to their Genius, and lost that easy genuine Air without which it is impossible either to move or please. Yet it is absolutely necessary that an Author who enclines towards the Genius of <hi>Cicero,</hi> should read <hi>Salust,</hi> to prevent his Style from running out; and on the contrary those that come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Salust,</hi> should have recourse to <hi>Cicero,</hi> when their Style is like to be broken and too concise.</p>
                  <p>To produce a compleat Work, two Things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Exact Composition. And 2. Careful Revisal. That is to say, neither to compose with Negligence nor correct with Precipitation, but in both to have a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Regard to Art.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:55246:64"/>2. Art in the Composition prevents making use of any Thing either foreign to the purpose, or unprofitable; tho' Art be oftentimes tyranniz'd over by an Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong Genius, yet Correction always revenges its Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and brings a too exhuberant Genius to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Whilst a Man is Composing, he may give a loose to his Genius; but when he comes to Revise, he must have his Eyes full of Severity. At the time of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eflection, Art is busied in paring off Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, retrenching Excursions, and enlivening Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Flatnesses.</p>
                  <p>There is a sort of Brevity which proceeds from Chance, Whimsy, and Dryness or Weakness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Genius; but this we cannot commend; for Brevity ought only to be the Product of Knowledge, Reflection or Judgment.</p>
                  <p>A Writer therefore must beware of too great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint as a Slavery, and too great a Freedom as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Historical Narration</hi> nevertheless will admit of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing more Circumstances than <hi>Oratorial,</hi> because among all the Circumstances of an Action, an Orator only makes use of those which are for his purpose: Nay, he has moreover a liberty of feigning them, where he supposes they may be understood.</p>
                  <p>Historical or speaking Pictures.</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of Pictures: One Dumb, as Draughts and Sculptures of all kinds; and the other Speaking, as</p>
                  <p>History, Poetry, and Oratory.</p>
                  <p>Three Things contribute to render these speaking Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures agreeable;
<list>
                        <item>1. They must be done after the Life.</item>
                        <item>2. They must denote the Persons by the Parts of them that are most necessary to be known. And</item>
                        <item>3. They must always have chief Regard to that Action which best becomes the Person they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55246:64"/>Heroes, Harangues or Speeches.</p>
                  <p>They may be abridged and made conformable to the Style of the History, which they are made use of in, as <hi>Salust</hi> most commonly has done.</p>
                  <p>Three Duties of an Historian,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ribe Things. 2. To represent Actions. And 3. To relate Discourses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Style or Language is to be considered, either as to 1. The Action. 2. The Ornaments. Or 3. Its Purity.</p>
                  <p>Relating to Action, it is 1. Sublime. 2. Indifferent. And 3. Low or Humble.</p>
                  <p>In regard of Ornaments, the first place is given to</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Indifferent. 2. The Sublime. And 3. The Low or Humble.</p>
                  <p>In regard of Purity, the chief Rank is bestowed on The Low or Humble Style.</p>
                  <p>This last Style is what an Historian ought to make use of, being least warm, and consequently more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, since a Mind that it is not embarassed with any Passion, is more capable of adorning its Discourse; for that long Calm which reigns throughout the whole Course of History, would infallibly tire instead of pleasing us, if it were not sometimes quickned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by a briskness of Style and variety of Figures. But at the same time others say of History,
<q>
                        <l>O nari Res ipsa negat, Contenta Doceri.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>An eloquent Oration, like a Race or a Combat, has an Influence over its Auditor suitable to the force it bears; when, on the contrary, History rather resembles a calm Walk, or to say better, a long Voyage, where if its Reader does not meet with either Pleasure or Profit in the Way, he soon grows weary and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied.</p>
                  <p>An Historian is obliged to set Truth in its best Light, which is an hard Task and requires no common Capacity.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55246:65"/>II. <hi>Politick Reflections</hi> are to be always practis'd, for what good will reading do a Man if he makes no use of it? To effect this, a Reader must neither be sway'd by ridiculous Niceties nor metaphysical Whimsies, both which have commonly little or nothing in them.</p>
                  <p>He must not be one of those over-curious Politicians who often lose their Way while they seek too many Roads, and who change all their Paths into Labyrinths, by stuffing their Heads with Chimerical Notions, and preferring the false Lustre of Imagination, to the true Light of Reason. He must view things as they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paint them as they seem; and in fine, judge of them according to the Draught he has made of them. He must likewise know something of the Heart of Man, and therefore make no slight enquiry into its Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>Politick Reflections may be of benefit to Posterity which often require the same Observations; for Humane Affairs have all their Turns and Forms, and commonly come about to the same Point where they first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>Politicks must be Just, Noble, Candid and Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rous; yet tho' they have all these Qualifications the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> will nevertheless require no ordinary Management to make them agreeable in History, where they ought to be rang'd with a great deal of Precaution and Prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But above all, Politick Reflections are to be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Rules of Justice and Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Three ways of making Politicks go down in History.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By way of Relation; as, <hi>Too great Credulity was fatal to such a Prince.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. By way of Proposition; as, <hi>Credulity is always Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to such as give themselves up too much to it.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. By way of Rule or Maxim; as, <hi>Men ought to avoid being too Credulous for fear of incurring, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards which always attend that Folly.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The first of these is most conformable to the business of History, as being less Dogmatical and more Instructive; for Political and Moral Instruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on ought always to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55246:65"/>
very humble in History; yet, when Princes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, Generals and Magistrates are introduc'd, they are too keep up their several Characters. But when the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian himself speaks, his Style is to be only Simple and Narrative.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What the Historian ought farther to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in relation to Politicks.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He ought to make his Politicks keep pace with his Narration. And</item>
                     <item>2. That they be inseperable, and that one be made to proceed from the other.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>He that shall observe these Rules, will never fail to please, altho' oftentimes Declaimers seem more eloquent than Orat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs, and Sophists more knowing than Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
                  <p>As to the rest, a Reader is to be instructed without being digsusted and cloy'd. It is necessary only to shew him the Way, without leading him always by the Hand. It is sufficient to give him a View, without obliging him to thrust his Nose upon a Thing. And finally, the best way to make any Man learn what is either excellent or useful, were to persuade him that he must needs know it already, whereby he might avoid the Scandal of Ignorance, and you the Imputation of Vanity.</p>
                  <p>Partiality, how well soever managed, will ever be prejudicial to History, and therefore that Rock ought principally to be avoided; which may easily be, by help of a little Justice or Knowledge. <hi>Non probandi sunt Historici qui se suamque Gentem semper in Capitolis locant; Exteros vero &amp; Hostes suos semper Vituperant.</hi> Eusebius.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have furnish'd Historians with excellent Rules, and which ought to be seriously perused before any attempt the reading of History, because thereby an Authors Merit may be scan'd and trac'd, both when he has either follow'd or neglected the Precepts of Art. And whereas most are tickled by an unmerciful Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism on other Mens Works, these Rules will guide them rather to the finding out of new Charms in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians.</p>

                  <head>CHAP III. The manner of studying History. Of the Four Ancient Monarchies; and of the different kinds of Political Government.</head>
                  <p>ALthough several Dishes be requir'd to make up a great Feast, yet it is certain there would be nothing more disagreeable than to serve them up in Disorder. So it is not sufficient to have heap'd up a great many Histories, unless a Man be able to know which he should choose first, to proceed methodically in a Study of so vast Extent.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The first Thing which ought to be observ'd to read History methodically, would be to begin with the easiest, and proceed to the more difficult by degrees. This Method, which we have already so heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, is what Geometricians call <hi>Analysis.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot but admire that <hi>Bodin,</hi> who compos'd his <hi>Method for reading History</hi> about the Year 1566. that is, at a time when no Body ever dreamt of <hi>Geometry's</hi> proving a Help to other Studies, should be so well acquainted with the great Importance of it, even long before <hi>Descartes.</hi> He required an <hi>Analysis</hi> to be first perused by the young Student of Universal History. <hi>Vt igitur plena sit &amp; facilis Historiarum Scientia, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio adhibeatur praestans illa docendarum Artium</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra <hi>quae dicitur</hi> Analysis. He farther adds, That an <hi>Analysis</hi> is the most excellent Method that can be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, since that by dividing and sub-dividing a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into different parts, it soon leads to a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the whole.</p>
                  <p>So that to comply with the Observations of <hi>Bodin,</hi> one must necessarily begin with the reading of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who presents us only with simple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ideas and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions, which we may the easier comprehend, and where we may find every thing rang'd according
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55246:66"/>
to order of time, being a Chronological Account of Events, which we commonly term <hi>The Thread of History</hi>; without which we might soon be at a loss in the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of so many Ages that have been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World.</p>
                  <p>It would likewise be absolutely necessary never to read any of these Abridgments before we are well vers'd in Chronological Tables, such as <hi>Lipsius</hi> would have made, or such as we have spoken of before. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable how great assistance this would prove in the study of History. Events would then soon place themselves in the Conception, and follow that Order in our Memories which we have read them in: When without this Method we confound our selves, and being once put into this disorder, we rarely or never get free of it. Which made <hi>Bodin</hi> boldly affirm, <hi>That it was impossible for any body to comprehend the particular System of any M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The same Rule must be observ'd in reading the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular History of any Country, where special regard must be had to the Chronology of its Kings, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, Progress, and several Changes which have hapned in that Government, after the manner as we have hereafter express'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Analysis,</hi> which ought to be so strictly followed in reading of Universal History, is no less to be observ'd in the Study of any peculiar History. We must begin with that Historian first who comprehends all in few Words; next proceed to a more copious Author; and at length we may undertake those that have omitted nothing which might render their History compleat.</p>
                  <p>The like Method is to be follow'd in reading parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular History, which is to begin with some very plain and easie Abridgment. <hi>Bodin</hi> would have the Study of the <hi>Roman</hi> History to be begun by <hi>Sextus Rufus,</hi> who in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Epitome of <hi>Florus,</hi> next <hi>Eutropius,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Livy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Method of <hi>Bodin</hi> is not to be found fault with; yet that which I am about to lay down is unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more beneficial; for when I would speak of any Monarchy, I immediately look after the several Changes which have happen'd in its Government, whereof I pitch upon the most Remarkable to serve me as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Epochas</hi> to describe that Monarchy under. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, When I have a mind to give an Idea of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, I divide it into Seven different Estates, which serve as so many Ages: Then I pursue it from its very Origine or Rise, through all its various Changes, and at lengh bring it to its Catastrophe to perish in <hi>Germany,</hi> where it scarce now retains the shadow of what it has formerly been. Before we read any <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Historian, it is absolutely necessary we should be throughly acquainted with all these Seven Alterations which that Empire has undergon.

                  <p>I must own I have not had the like success in my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of any of the Monarchies; but still I have this to say, That I have endeavour'd to make none bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

out of their Histories, the Nature of their Governments, or the several Families that have Reign'd.</p>
                  <p>After being thus prepossess'd with these plain and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Ideas, we proceed to read History with the greatest Pleasure and Satisfaction imaginable; for then we can easily digest all the Circumstances of Time, Place, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That our Memories may never want assistance, we should always have a Map of the Country before us when we read any History, which may not improperly be call'd <hi>Local Memory.</hi> We have already seen how useful a Chronological Table is; and here we may be satisfied that a Geographical Map is much more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. The elder <hi>Vossius</hi> said very well in the beginning of his Chronological Dissertations, <hi>That Chronology and Geography, were two inseparable Sisters, and the two Eyes of History, without which she must inevitably be either Blind or very Obscure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I were oblig'd to give the Preference to one of these two, It should be to Geography. <hi>Boden</hi> says, That if any thing be requir'd to prepare a Man for reading History, it must be Geography: <hi>Vt si Ars ulla Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico necessaria sit, profecto Geographia summe necessaria Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur.</hi> Cap. 2. pag. 21.</p>
                  <p>When one is throughly acquainted with the Time and Place, when and where Matters have been transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is almost impossible to forget them; when the other Circumstances of History do not make the like lively Impressions.</p>
                  <p>What I have hitherto laid down for a Method in reading History, would not be alone sufficient if any extraordinary Progress were intended. What I have still to add, is the last part of our Method; which is to Collect all the Maxims and Examples by way of common Place.</p>
                  <p>What I take to be a Master-stroke in the Art of reading History, is to range under different Titles the most considerable Passages which we meet with. This is the great Secret, and whereby we may dive in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We may thereby benefit by all that the Ancients either did or said, as by the greatness of their Designs, their Pathetical Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and noble Actions; for all human Affairs may be reduc'd to these three Heads, which are either to Think, to Say, and to Do.

                  </p>
                  <p>Each of these Books may be sub-divided into divers Chapters, so that one might be allotted for the Designs that relate to Politicks and the Government of States; the other for such as relate to Discipline and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Manners; and the Third for those that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain particularly to the Affairs of War.</p>
                  <p>As to Expressions, they are of several kinds, and which ought all to have a particular Place assign'd them.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Actions may be sub-divided into Virtues and Vices, as they are to be found in <hi>Ethicks.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bodin</hi> imploys all the 7th Chapter of his Method to refute those that make the Four Empires of the <hi>Assyrians, Persians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> to succeed immediately to each other, and who likewise pretend that those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies were figured to us by the Four Beasts, and the Statue compos'd of Four Metals, spoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and which they also affirm are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the World.

                     <p>Father <hi>M.

                     <p>The Image which <hi>Nebuchodonosor</hi> saw in a Dream, did not foretel the Four pretended Monarchies, seeing that <hi>David,</hi> who expounded this Dream, says, That the first should be the Empire of <hi>Nebuchodonosor,</hi> whose Reign would be the most Glorious, for that afterwards the others would decrease by little and little till they came to be of small Note.

                     <p>There was formerly a sort of imaginary <hi>Theocracy</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> during the time that <hi>Medon</hi> and <hi>Nileus,</hi> Sons of <hi>Codrus,</hi> disputed that Government between them; for the <hi>Athenians</hi> having suffered much by that War, would by no means afterwards admit a King among them, and therefore declared <hi>Iupiter</hi> sole King of the People of <hi>Athens.</hi> It was about the same time that the <hi>Iews</hi> requested a King of God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Divisions of History.</head>
                  <p>THERE are great Disputes among the Schools how to divide History; but we do not think fit to be engag'd in either of their Quarrels, looking upon them as frivolous and of no consequence; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with affirming</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Iustus Lipsius,</hi> [Epist. 61. Cent. Miscel.] who divides History into <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>fabulous</hi> or <hi>Poetical</hi> History, is not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, inasmuch as Poetical Fictions and Relations have nothing in the least to do in what we call History. <hi>Aristotle, de re Poetica,</hi> says, That History differs from Poetry, in that the former relates Things as they truly are or have been; and on the contrary, the latter only represents what they might or ought to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bodin</hi> is not to be imitated in placing natural History, which properly appertains to Physick, among the <hi>Species</hi> of History.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That <hi>Keckerman,</hi> who examin'd so nicely into these foregoing great Men, instead of reforming them, falls of a sudden into Grammatical Trifles and Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Punctilio's, which will be regarded no more by Men of sound Sense than his tedious Divisions and Sub-divisions of History, in which it is impossible to follow him without quickly losing Sight of him. We have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55246:71"/>
endeavoured to take a more direct Course, which is by dividing History into
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi> And</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Civil.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ecclesiastical History informs us of what has hapned in the State of Religion. And</p>
                  <p>Civil History gives an Account of Occurrences in the Civil State. This Division is founded upon the admirable Theology of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his Method of dividing the Holy Books and all the History of the Church. He says, That there have always been two Cities in the World, which are the City of God, and the City of the World, and which are remark'd in these two Brothers, <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> whereof <hi>Abel</hi> is the Image of the Citizens of God, and <hi>Cain</hi> of those of the World; the former the Younger, the latter the Elder; because Man did not become a Citizen of Heaven, but through Grace, when he was born a Citizen of the World. [<hi>St. Austin in Psal.</hi> 61. <hi>de Civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Thus all History consists only in representing to us the different Events and Passages which have ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in these two opposite Cities.</p>
                  <p>The History which treats of the City of God has been ever carefully preserved in the World, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into the Church of the <hi>Iews</hi>; and the Church of the Christians, of the New Testament. The Christian Church may be sub-divided into several Particulars; as the Churches of every Patriarchate, Kingdom, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Diocess, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The History which treats of the City of the World is the Civil, which may be divided into the Histories of the Monarchies and Republicks that have been before our Saviour Christ, and the History of the Monarchies and Republicks that have come after him. Every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and every Republick compose many particular Histories.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>To be convinced of the Necessity of thus dividing History, in relation both to the Church and to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, we are to remember that Maxim which says, <hi>That we must never wander out of the Road in this Study:</hi> As also, that the principal Design of God Almighty, in the Creation of the World, was the Foundation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Sanctification of his Church; likewise, that the World subsists by no other Means but by those of the Church; and moreover, that whatever is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and admirable either in the Establishment or Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Empires, is chiefly occasion'd by the Church.</p>
                  <p>If this be so, it is necessary of course to have Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Matters keep pace with those of Monarchies, and not to separate the History of the City of God, from that of the City of the World. This the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> speaks admirably well of in his Treatise of Universal History. <hi>These Monarchies</hi> (says he) <hi>have for the most part a necessary connection with the History of the People of God, for God made use of the</hi> Assyrians <hi>and</hi> Babylonians <hi>to chastize his People; of the</hi> Persians <hi>to re-establish them; of</hi> Alexander <hi>and his first Successors to Protect them; of the famous</hi> Antiochus <hi>and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to keep them Employ'd; and of the</hi> Romans <hi>to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them against the Kings of</hi> Syria, <hi>who were then ready to destroy them. Vnder the</hi> Romans <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to the coming of Iesus Christ, whom, when they

God, who had then determin'd to gather together a new People from all parts of the Earth, first rang'd them under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, which afterwards prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d the principal means to encrease the course of the Gospel. Tho' this same</hi> Roman <hi>Empire persecuted this new People for above</hi> 300 <hi>Years, yet that Persecution serv'd only t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Christian Faith, and to make it shine the brighter by the Fortitude and Patience of its Professors. But at length this Empire, finding it had to deal with something more invincible than it self, was forc'd to yield, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into its Bosom that very Church, which before it had so long and so cruelly persecuted; whence it follow'd that those Emperors did all that lay in their Power to make that Church Vniversally acknowledg'd, which Iesus Christ had founded; and</hi> Rome <hi>became thenceforward Metropolis of the Spiritual Empire. Also when the time was come that the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Power, which had vainly boasted it self of Eternity, was to undergo the Fate of other Empires,</hi> Rome, <hi>tho' become a Prey to</hi> Barbarians, <hi>yet preserv'd its ancient Grandeur by means of Religion; for those Nations, who had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd the</hi> Romans, <hi>having by little and little softned their Manners by the observation of Christian Piety, their Kings thought none of their Titles so glorious, as that of being Protectors of the Christian Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus the Empires of the World have been serviceable to Religion, and have preserv'd the People of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that same God which had caus'd his Prophets to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the divers Conditions of his People, made them also Prophecy of the Succession of Empires. You are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with those places where</hi> Nebuchodonosor <hi>was mark'd out to Punish the Pride of the People, especially of the</hi> Jews, <hi>who approv'd themselves so ungrateful towards their Creator. You have also (no doubt) observ'd</hi> Cyrus <hi>nam'd</hi> 200 <hi>Years before his Birth, to re-establish the People of God, and to chastize the Arrogance of</hi> Babylon. <hi>The destruction of</hi> Nineveh <hi>likewise was not foretold with less certainty.</hi> Daniel <hi>in his wonderful Visions has briefly, but fully represented to us the</hi> Babylonish <hi>Empire, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that of the</hi> Medes, Persians <hi>and</hi> Greeks.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55246:72"/>
                     <hi>The Blasphemies and Persecutions of</hi> Antiochus, <hi>were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Prophesied of, as well as the miraculous Victories the People of God gain'd over that cruel Tyrant. In these Prophets you may find all these famous Monarchies come to nothing by little and little, and the new Empire of Iesus Christ to be so expresly Characteriz'd, that there is no reason to doubt of its being meant, as by Name, of the Kingdom of the most High; the Kingdom of the Son of Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being Pronounc'd to be a Kingdom that should subsist even in the midst of the Ruin of all others and to which alone Eternity was promised.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God therefore, who made use of so many different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Chastize, Employ, Enlarge or Protect his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, having a mind to be known for the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, discover'd the great Secret to his Prophets, and caus'd them to foretel it before he put it in Execution. Whereupon these Empires, being made Partners with the Designs of God, their Fate has been foretold by the same Oracles of the Holy Spirit, which Prophesied of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the faithful People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing demonstrates better the necessary Relation between Sacred and Profane History, than this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Discourse of the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> where we may observe the proceedings of God in the Revolution of Empires, and by what means the Almighty Wisdom brings his Ends about, even in those Matters where we think either our Prudence or Policy has had the larger share. I would gladly have all Youth learn by Heart as much, at least, of this admirable Discourse, as we have just mention'd; for thereby they may be able to unravel (if I may so say) all the Intrigues betwixt God and Man, and discover the first Principles of all Affairs which History has handed down to us. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Historians have always fill'd us with confus'd Ideas; but the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> has demonstrated the Hand of God to have set all the Springs of Causes at work, and that for the peculiar end of Preserving and Sanctifying his People. Men, misguided by their Passions, think all must be related in History that contributes to satisfy either their Avarice or Ambition; but they are deceiv'd, for like Children they only see the Wheels of the Movements, without being able to guess at the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55246:73"/>
and Causes of them. The Sanctification of the Church, is the secret Spring of all that has hapned most considerable in the World from its Creation; and the Fall and Rise of Empires is the Mechanism of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>Altho' we cannot always discover what share God has had in certain Affairs, yet it must never be deny'd that he has had any. Who could ever have imagin'd that the Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which we commonly look upon as an effect of the great Wisdom and Valour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> should have ever contributed towards the publication of the Gospel, and the glory of the Church?</p>
                  <p>In a word, there might have been only one History, which should have been that of the City of God, where Empires and Dominions might have been brought in as so many Incidents and Episodes, which have only collateral Relation to the History of the Church. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, as the Devil will always have a share in humane Affairs; and that S. <hi>Austin,</hi> together with the Holy Scriptures, attribute to him a Power over the Kingdoms of the World; we divide History into <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> for the Affairs of the Church, and into <hi>Civil</hi> for the Affairs of Empires and Republicks. We make no use of the Word <hi>Profane,</hi> as being improper for the History of Christian Kingdoms, whose Kings are the Protectors and Cherishers of the Church.</p>
                  <p>This I presume may be sufficient to justify my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this Division of History, to that of all others which have treated on the same Subject.</p>

                     <p>THE History of the <hi>Iews</hi> is contain'd in the Books of the Old Testament, which is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any Christian that it is unquestionable, and will never admit of any Doubt. Yet it is not to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to quote any Fathers hereupon, or to shew what
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55246:73"/>
they have advanc'd, in their Disputes against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, to prove the Truth and Divinity of the Bible, those Matters being to be met with in the Books of such Doctors as have writ upon that Subject.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, as it is chiefly at <hi>Genesis</hi> that the Deists and Atheists level their Criticisms, it would not be amiss to say something in vindication of that Holy Book, and the rather, because the History therein contain'd being once establish'd, all the other parts of Religion necessarily follow on course.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then it is certain that <hi>Moses</hi> was Author of the Book of <hi>Genesis. Nay more positive</hi> [says <hi>du Pin</hi> in the first Tome of his History of Ecclesiastical Writers, speaking of this Book] <hi>than that either</hi> Homer <hi>was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the</hi> Iliads <hi>and</hi> Odysses, <hi>or</hi> Herodotus <hi>or</hi> Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides <hi>of those Histories that are ascrib'd to them. The Holy Bible</hi> (continues he afterwards) <hi>teaches me that</hi> Moses <hi>was Author of the</hi> Pentateuch. Thus are the Five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> call'd, of which <hi>Genesis</hi> is the First. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> (proceeds <hi>Dupin</hi>) <hi>and the Apostles have assur'd me as much; ancient Authors concur in the same Opinion, and all other People agree with them,</hi> &amp;c. We may find in the same Book a number of Witnesses to evince this Truth, of which some were <hi>Iews,</hi> others <hi>Christians</hi> and others <hi>Pagans</hi>; all which positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that <hi>Moses</hi> writ the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> and all the rest of the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Moses,</hi> without dispute, was a much more ancient Writer than any of those Authors who have acquir'd so great Reputation in the World, and procur'd <hi>Greece</hi> the Title of <hi>The Mother of Sciences and Arts</hi>; for he liv'd near 500 Years before <hi>Homer,</hi> 800 before the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Thales,</hi> who writ the first concerning <hi>Nature</hi>; 900 before <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and above 1100 before either <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who have been the most ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated and chief Masters of all the Wisdom of <hi>Greece.</hi> [<hi>Preface to the French Translation of</hi> Genesis.]</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is true that <hi>Moses</hi> writ the History of the Creation a long time after it; since that he writ <hi>Genesis,</hi> it may be, about the Year of the World 2550.

through the Spirit of God which revealed them to him, it will not be hard to believe, that he was also Inspired with those that were past and before his Days.</p>
                     <p>This History also may be very well establish'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any recourse to Revelation; for it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Moses</hi> might have said to those of his Time, <hi>I am resolved to write of the Transactions from the beginning of the World to this Day; and of which, I believe, no Body can be better inform'd than my self; for</hi> Amram <hi>my Father has often said to me, Son, I will relate to you all the History of the World down even to us, according as I have learnt it from</hi> Levi <hi>my Grandfather, who had what he told me from</hi> Isaac <hi>his Grandfather, with whom he liv'd</hi> 33 <hi>Years.</hi> And as for what relates to <hi>Isaac,</hi> he might have heard all what he told <hi>Levi</hi> from <hi>Sem,</hi> with whom he liv'd also 50 Years.

And you ought likewise to believe me, when I acquaint you about the Creation of the World, and of all what relates to</hi> Adam, <hi>since I liv'd near</hi> 100 <hi>Years with</hi> Methusalem, <hi>my Great Grandfather, who learnt all these Matters from</hi> Adam <hi>himself, with whom he liv'd</hi> 243 <hi>Years.</hi> So that between <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> there are but two Persons, <hi>Mathusalem</hi> and <hi>Sem</hi>; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> his Father, there is only one more, who is <hi>Levi.</hi> Insomuch that to speak plainly, without having Recourse to Supernatural Proofs, never any History deserv'd greater Credit than that of <hi>Genesis.</hi>

                     <p>It is not my Design here to confute the several Objections which the Enemies both of the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Religion have rais'd against the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and other Books of the Bible.

This Author, tho' born a <hi>Iew,</hi> falls nevertheless very severely upon Judaism, without shewing at the same time any great kindness for Christianity. So that we may reasonably infer, That his Design was to abolish all Religion, particularly the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> and establish Atheism and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinism, leaving every Body to their liberty of believing what they pleas'd, providing at the same time they prov'd no Disturbance to the Common-wealth.

                           <p n="16">XVI. The <hi>Second Epistle to Timothy,</hi> writ from <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was Prisoner there the second time, about the Year of Christ 65. and 32 Years after Christ's Passion, and a little before his own Martyrdom. It contains excellent Instructions for those that God has entrusted with the communicating of his Gospel.</p>
                           <p n="17">XVII. His <hi>Epistle to Titus</hi> seems to have been written from <hi>Macedon,</hi> towards the Year of Christ 64. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having chosen <hi>Titus</hi> to be Bishop of the Island of <hi>Crete,</hi>

This <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> was a Person of great Account in a City of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> had converted to the Faith. <hi>Onesimus</hi> was his Slave, and fled from him to visit St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he knew to be his Master's Friend; whereupon St. <hi>Paul</hi> converted, baptized, and sent him back to <hi>Philemon</hi> with his Recommendation in this Epistle.</p>
                           <p n="19">XIX. <hi>The Epistle to the Hebrews</hi> was thought to have been writ by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but some have question'd it. His Design seems to have been the same that he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed when he writ to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi>; for in a word, these Three Epistles appear to have had but one End, which was to prove that true Justice did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Law, but that it is Jesus Christ that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows it on us, through Faith and Inspiration.</p>
                           <p n="20">XX. <hi>The General Epistle of St. Iames.</hi> It is term'd <hi>General,</hi> by reason of its being addrest to all the <hi>Faithful,</hi> wheresoever dispers'd.

                           <p n="21">XXI. <hi>The First Epistle of St. Peter</hi> was principally design'd for the <hi>Iews,</hi> whose Apostle he properly was, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> He writ it from <hi>Rome,</hi> which he couches under the Name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a little before his Death. This Epistle consists throughout of Morality, and which ought to be look'd upon as an Abridgment of a Christian and Pious Life, of which it contains chiefly the Rules and Instructions.</p>
                           <p n="22">XXII. <hi>The Second Epistle of St. Peter</hi> was writ a very little while before the Martyrdom which hapned about the Year of Christ 66. after having been foretold it from Heaven by a Vision, as he himself relates. This Epistle differs from the former, which only tended to advise the Faithful to live a holy and virtuous Life: But in this Second Epistle he admonishes them withal, against the Illusions of false Teachers; by which he means, as it is thought, the Followers of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> which he decries and contends with by many solid and pathetick Expressions.</p>

Neither the Time when, nor Place where it was written, is known.

                           <p n="26">XXVI. <hi>The General Epistle of St. Iude,</hi> call'd also <hi>Thadeus,</hi> was written after the Death of the greater part of the Apostles, to exhort Believers to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves stedfastly to the Doctrin of Jesus Christ, which they had preached to them. He therein falls upon the Followers of <hi>Simon</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> who, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with a barren Faith and without good Works, introduc'd into the Church a sort of Libertinism and corrupted Morals.</p>
                           <p n="25">XXV. <hi>The Apocalypse, or Revelations of St. Iohn,</hi> was written in the Isle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> where this Apostle was confin'd by the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> about the Year of Christ 94. and Two before he writ his Gospel. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> acknowledges this Book is very hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, because there are very few clear Things in it which might serve to enlighten the Obscure; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless there are some plain and profitable Instructions to be met with in several Places, and chiefly in the 2d and 3d Chapters, which might be term'd the Gospel of Christ risen from the Dead, by reason of many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins therein mentioned which Christ pronounced after his Resurrection, and which the Evangelists had omitted.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55246:82"/>Thus you have a Catalogue, and an Account of all the Sacred Books. Therein are contain'd the Precepts of Eternal Life: And as they are to be ranked among the number of Fools that contend with Reason, and such among Hereticks as dispute and oppose the Christian Doctrins; <hi>So,</hi> says St. <hi>Austin, are those always to be rang'd with Infidels, who reject the Holy Scriptures. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra rationem nemo Sobrius: Contra Scripturam nemo Christianus: Contra Ecclesiam nemo Pacificus senserit.</hi> [Lib. 4. de Trinit. cap. 6.] By the Truth and Piety of these admirable Books the Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture subsists, and it is a kind of Impiety to call any of its Authors in question.</p>
                           <p>But nevertheless we are not bound to have the same Veneration for the other Ecclesiastick Writers. Such only as have been immediately Inspir'd by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty are to be look'd upon as Infallible, and those alone are they which have been acknowledg'd by the Canon of the Holy Scriptures. As for other Authors, however Holy they might be, yet we do not rely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly upon what they have writ, but are ready to allow that they have often been deceiv'd and nay consequently deceive us. In the first part of this Book, Page 10. I have inserted some Rules which might serve to resolve any doubts met with in the ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But these we are by no means to make use of in relation to the Canonical Writings; we must always acquiesce in them whatever difficulties we meet with, and adore with Simplicity what may there seem Strange and Incredible to us. But, as I said before, we may take more Liberty with other Authors, and Condemn or Applaud 'em as we see good. Otherwise we should Sacrifice our Reason to their Authority, which we are only oblig'd to do to the Eternal Word of God.</p>

                     <p>THO' we ought to have an implicit Belief, through a kind of religious Slavery, in whatever the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture relates; yet need we not allow the same

Credit to Men who have all their natural Failings, and write only by a fallible Assistance of their Reason. As Men therefore were never free from Mistakes and Errors, and as they might very well fall into false Opinions, either through Ignorance, want of due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination or just Reasoning; so their Hearts also might probably be byass'd by the Prospects of Ambition or Interest, and consequently they be seduc'd either into Flattery or Insincerity.

                     <p>The <hi>Scythians</hi> were wont to burn all the Histories that came to their Hands; nay, they never spar'd any, <hi>Because</hi> (said they) <hi>the Booksellers among the</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans, <hi>had their Shops always so crouded with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Exploits of their own Country, that they left no room for those of other Nations, who perhaps might have perform'd Actions as worthy of Applause. And where they hapned to have any, it was perhaps some Treatise wherein their Neighbours we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e look'd upon with the greatest Scorn and Contempt.</hi> Most Historians have been prepossess'd with an Opinion of their own Country, and neglect of due Esteem for the Merits of others; whence it comes to pass, that we have no History but what is either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect or Partial, and consequently no true Account of those Transactions that have from time to time hapned in the World.</p>
                     <p>We must observe that the most warlike Nations have ever been the least encouragers of Letters. The Muses always prefer'd a Wreath of Olive, to a Crown of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: They seek Solitude and Quiet, and are frighted at the noise of Arms: 'Tis the Murmurings of a Purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brook, and the gentle Ruffling of a Western wind, that encourage and delight them. Sciences and Arts have never flourish'd, but in those States whose Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was Establish'd and Power dreaded. <hi>Egypt</hi> soon quitted its Learning, when the War began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its Confines. <hi>Greece</hi> equally encreas'd in Knowledge and Conquests; and when <hi>Rome</hi> became Mistress of the World, she saw the Muses from all parts fly for Shelter under her Wings. Before that Time the <hi>Romans</hi> were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55246:83"/>
more zealous of doing well, than either speaking or writing so; and took more care to be the Subject of a Panegyrick, than to Pen it.</p>
                     <p>There are some Pleasant People in the World, who would persuade us, that Learning lessens Courage, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> (say they) <hi>the</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans <hi>were never esteem'd so great Soldiers, as when they had no Arts nor Sciences among them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phocion,</hi> one of the wisest and best Men that <hi>Athens</hi> ever bred, whilst he govern'd that State, being tyr'd out with the repeated Importunities of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they might make War, when he knew they understood but very little of the Matter; He said to them, <hi>Were you to contend with your Enemies with Words, they would never be able to withstand you, because you talk better; but whereas Arms can only decide your Differences, they will as surely be too hard for you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> on the contrary, being less Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, were much better Soldiers; for tho' they spoke ill, yet they fought well; their Hands were more ready than their Tongues, and they always gave six blows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they utter'd two words. Hence we have the Style we call <hi>Laconique</hi> or <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> which is a Concise, but Emphatical manner of speaking and writing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have an Account of their Actions, not from themselves, but their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding all this, there is no Reason to accuse the Muses of ruining Kingdoms. There have ever been People in the World, both Learn'd and War-like at a time; and in this Age, we have Heroes that ought to give way to nothing, either to the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> and who likewise reconcile the Study of Letters with the Practice of Arms. It were better therefore to say, That Kingdoms and Empires have all their destin'd Periods, and that they Perish through the same necessity with the Hero and the Scholar.</p>
                     <p>But however it be, this is most certain, that War-like Nations have seldom or never writ their own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, and much less those of other Nations. We know little or nothing of the <hi>Celtae</hi> or <hi>Gauls</hi>; and are not much better acquainted with the Customs of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55246:84"/>
                        <hi>Arabs,</hi> their Priests, and other Persons which they set the most value upon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Historians were their <hi>Magi,</hi> being the most considerable among them, either for their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or the Station they held in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who yielded to no other Nation for Insight into all manner of Arts and Sciences, entrusted their Priests altogether with the Conservation of their History, as likewise their Publick Memoirs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd whatever related either to Policy, Physick, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks or Religion. It is from these Priests that <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> had his History, as he owns in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book. Nay, tho' <hi>Athens</hi> abounded with all sorts of Learned Men; yet the most celebrated in <hi>Greece,</hi> Travel'd to <hi>Egypt</hi> meerly to consult these Priests. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Plato, Pythagoras, Eudoxus</hi> and <hi>Democrates</hi> had that Knowledge from <hi>Egypt,</hi> with which they afterwards surpriz'd the Learned World. <hi>Cicero</hi> owns ingenuously in his Fifth Book, <hi>de Finibus,</hi> that <hi>Plato</hi> went into <hi>Egypt</hi> on purpose to learn from those Priests, the Knowledge of Heavenly Matters. And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did more; for he not only Travel'd over all <hi>Egypt,</hi> but also went into <hi>Persia</hi> to consult the <hi>Magi,</hi> about that sort of Learning which was peculiar to them, they being, beyond any other Nation, vers'd in the Knowledge of Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is plain, That the <hi>Egyptain</hi> Priests, and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Magi,</hi> gave themselves chiefly up to History.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> were not so careful in this Respect; they permitted any to write who had an inclination to do it, whence it follow'd, that their History was abominably vitiated by this Liberty; and they became a Proverb by the many Lies they stufft their Relations with,
<q>
                           <l>— Et quicquid <hi>Graecia</hi> Mendax,</l>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But herein the <hi>Romans</hi> were much wiser, for they did not allow every Body to compile their Histories: The Pontiffs who had the care of Divine Worship, and the Ceremonial part of their Religion, had likewise the Charge of making their Annals; wherein they were
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55246:84"/>
to take notice of the most famous Occurrences in their State from Year to Year, This <hi>Cicero</hi> acquaints us with, when he says, <hi>Erat Historia nihil aliud nisi An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalium confectio, cui rei Memoriae Publicae causa ab initio rerum humanarum usque ad Publ. Mutium Pontificem Maximum, res omnes singulorum Annorum mandabat li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Pontifex Maximus.</hi> Lib. 2. de Orat.</p>
                     <p>These Annals also were very plain. They contain'd no more than a Summary Account of Matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into many Particulars. It was the Genius of the antient <hi>Romans</hi> to affect Plainness. They were more intent upon deserving Praise, than hearing it; and they never complimented one Man with what was only due to the whole Place. A Glimpse of this primitive Simplicity may appear in their <hi>Fasti Consulares,</hi> which was scarce any more than a downright Catalogue of the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls.</p>
                     <p>These Reasons which we have given to doubt of the Truth of History, ought not nevertheless to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish in us all sort of Belief, for what Historians have written. There are Rules before prescrib'd to direct us in antient History, which are the very Quintescence of Criticism; that is, whatever good Sense or a sound Judgment could invent, to precaution a heedless Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, against either the Ignorance, Negligence or Insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of a Writer. Into how many Errors would a Man fall, if he had not some sort of regard to these Rules? But since it is absolutely necessary for every body to be acquainted with the worth of an Historian before they read him; I shall proceed to draw some faint Sketches of those that have been most famous in the World; since it is my Intention here to be exact, but not tedious.</p>

                  <p>THE History of the Church under the Law, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd among the sacred Writers, which we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to question as we have said before; yet whatever Esteem we may have for these Historians, we are by no means forbid to make use of our Reason when we read 'em, but are allow'd to Condemn or Approve 'em as we think fit.</p>
                  <p>Over and above the Books of the Bible, which treat of the old <hi>Iewish</hi> Church; we have also the Writings of <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> both which we shall say something of, by reason of the excellency of their Works.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Philo</hi> was a <hi>Iew</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who liv'd under the reign of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> and who was Head of an Embassy which the <hi>Iews</hi> dispatch'd to that Emperor. Amongst other Things, he writ the life of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as also a Relation of his Embassy to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he did not succeed, <hi>Caligula</hi> being extreamly offended that the <hi>Iews</hi> had refus'd to have his Statue in their Synagogue. This Author is altogether <hi>Platonick,</hi> for he imitates so exactly <hi>Plato</hi>'s Style, that he has been term'd by some, <hi>The Iewish Plato <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> aut Plato Philonem, aut Philo Platonem imitatur.</hi> In his Book, he explains the Bible allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically. He is Eloquent and very Diffusive, and his Moral comes very near that of the Christians.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Iosephus,</hi> surnam'd <hi>Flavius</hi> on account of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Vespatian,</hi> was a <hi>Iew</hi> of the sacerdotal Race of the <hi>Asmonians.</hi> He was born in the 37th Year of our Saviour, and dy'd in the 93d.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55246:85"/>
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> He has likewise written his own life, two excellent Tracts against <hi>Appion</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and one concerning the Martyrdom of the <hi>Maccabees. Photius</hi> says that <hi>Iosephus</hi> writ Nicely, that he knew how to charm his Readers, and that he has all along judiciously embelish'd his History with florid Descriptions, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Harangues. St. <hi>Ierom</hi> calls him the <hi>Titus Livius</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi>; and <hi>Erasmus</hi> says, That his History of the Death of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> is a Masterpiece of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

It is therefore that they fall upon this great Person with so much Gall and Fury. They particularly accuse him of being deceiv'd in counting the Consuls from the Emperor</hi> Tiberius <hi>to</hi> Dioclesian; <hi>but they might be answer'd, that he was not deceiv'd only by depending on the Authority of</hi> Eusebius; <hi>he reckon'd the Consulship of</hi> Junius Brutus <hi>an Olympiad sooner than he ought: That the multitude of Consuls, amounting to</hi> 25. <hi>made in one Day, caus'd a great Confusion among Historians, and that in a Word, the Faults of</hi> Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus <hi>are for the most part to be imputed to his Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>He likewise writ a History of the <hi>Goths,</hi> in XII Books, of which we have reason to regret the Loss; and whereof we have now remaining only what <hi>Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> has preserv'd, and which is to be found among the Works of <hi>Cassiodorus.

                     <p>I do not pretend here to have given an exact Account of Ecclesiastical Writers; but I have nevertheless made it my business, to follow those Catalogues that have been left us by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and Father <hi>Labbe,</hi> under the Title of <hi>Index Historicorum Ecclesiasticorum.</hi> Also I may well have fail'd in ranging them in that due Order, which true Chronology would require; yet I have chiefly follow'd <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> except in <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun</hi>'s Life, whom this Cardinal and <hi>Vossius</hi> make to be famous about the Year 1220. when he flourish'd about the Year 1120. which is an Error of full a hundred Years.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of the most considerable both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors of Civil History.</head>
                  <p>BY the little I have said concerning each Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writer, it may sufficiently appear, that the major part of Church-Authors have either wanted Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Sincerity to relate things as they ought; yet at the same time however great their Incapacity or want of Integrity might be, it will be as readily own'd, that their Faults have been nothing in respect of those of the Civil Historians. Among these you shall every where meet with the Violation of these two grand Maxims, which an Historian ought chiefly to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to, which are, <hi>Never to tell a Lie, Nor conceal a Truth.</hi> If History were to be written only by honest Men, it is certain that it would never stray from these essential Rules. This Caution was once observ'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> insomuch that the care of History was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment, and entrusted only to great and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pens. But at length with the <hi>Caesars,</hi> Luxury and Flattery got the upper Hand, and then we saw that Function, which was look'd upon before as Sacred and August, Usurp'd by Persons of neither Birth nor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Suetonius,</hi> after <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> observes that the first mean Person that had the boldness to meddle with History, was one <hi>Otacilius,</hi> who from a Porter, by means of his great Parts came to be Tutor to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> the Great, as likewise that before him there were none that offer'd at writing History, but those that were most considerable in the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>If I were allow'd here to Speak my Mind, I should affirm that what has contributed most towards the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of History, is the Complaisance that some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Writers have had to publish Princes Lives whilst they Liv'd, or soon after their Deaths. Such Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Fruit which ought to ripen a long while before it is serv'd up to the Table: For in Truth a Historian
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55246:98"/>
neither writes as he would nor he ought, of a Prince that is living; because there are few Princes that would suffer themselves to be represented as they live, Truth in this Case being not proper to be Spoken: But it is certain that an Historian is oblig'd to Publish both the good and bad Actions of the Person he writes of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being byass'd either by Love or Hatred, Hope or Fear. The Holy Bible mentions as well the Idolatry as the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as his Repentance for so doing; but this is what ought not to be expected from an Historian that writes his Masters Life while he lives, and much less where it is written in his Court, as several have been. But what would you say of a Hireling that writes for a Pension, would not he, think you, soon forsake his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an Historian, for that of an Orator, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of compiling a History make a Panegyrick or Apology? In a Word, What can be expected from a mercenary Pen? Truth has never been Traded with, but Flattery has always been Sold, for most Authors have Idols to which they Sacrifice Truth. Some Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, as well Ancient as Modern, are not to be Read without the greatest Indignation; because where they promise a History, they produce a Panegyrick. <hi>Procopius</hi> is continually upon the Elogium of <hi>Belisarius. Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea</hi> is in a Rapture when he speaks of <hi>Constantine,</hi> whom he frequently brings in without any Connection. <hi>Epinar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> can never suffer his <hi>Charlemagne</hi> out of his Sight. And <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> is fulsome when he mentions his <hi>Como di Medici.</hi> A Writer never so little gratify'd immediately soars a pitch beyond him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; his Prince must appear Charming in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and consequently be the Delight of Mankind, for because he has had reason to conceive a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, he imagins every Body else must do the like. Thus Mens Minds are mov'd altogether by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> falls foul of <hi>Callias</hi> for a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, since because he had receiv'd Favours from <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles,</hi> he would pretend to justify his Actions, when on the contrary <hi>Timeus,</hi> who was banish'd <hi>Sicily</hi> by that Prince, condemns him in every thing, and is as fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile in Invectives as <hi>Callias</hi> was in Apologies. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55246:98"/>
being Oblig'd, had Notions quite contrary to the former, who was Angry, yet they both saw the same thing after a different manner. All this ought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that Corruption has as many ways into the Heart of Man, as there are Untruths to be met with in History.</p>
                  <p>After all, I would not have an Historian so very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid as never to allow any thing to his Country, his Prince or Friends; but to determine how far such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ought to go, is the difficulty, and which I should not care to give my Opinion about, till I had well consider'd of it.</p>
                  <p>As we complain of the small Sincerity of Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it would not be at all convenient to Flatter them in the Draughts we are about to make of them, for we are always to treat them with the same Liberty, as we would have them take in writing Publick Affairs. As near as we can, we ought to Paint them to the Life, and Speak of their Works with the greatest Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity. It is of great Importance to know who speaks to us, and what we are to expect from him.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: Having given the Reader an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the most considerable Ecclesiastical Historians, together wherein we have also included the principal of those that have written General Histories; we shall now proceed to an Account of the ancient Greek and Roman ones. Wherein we shall besides a short Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Life and Writings of the Author, give a Character of him from approv'd Criticks.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Herodotus</hi> is the most ancient of all the <hi>Greek</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, who have any Writings extant; and therefore <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> Styles him, <hi>The Father of History, and Prince of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians.</hi> Nevertheless, <hi>Pherecides, Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Miletum, Hecates, Xanthus</hi> of <hi>Lydia, Charan</hi> of <hi>Lampsacus, Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanicus</hi> and several others, have been said by <hi>Vossius,</hi> to have written before him, but their Works have been long since lost. <hi>Herodotus</hi> was born 4 Years before <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition into <hi>Greece,</hi> and 5 Years after the Battle of <hi>Marathon,</hi> which was fought in the third
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55246:99"/>
Year of the LXXII. Olympiad. He was Native of <hi>Halicarnassus,</hi> a City of <hi>Dorida,</hi> which was one of the Provinces of <hi>Asia Minor</hi>; and flourish'd from about the Year 3500 to the beginning of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War, which happen'd in 3519.</p>
                     <p>The History we have of his, is divided into IX Books, which bear the Names of the Nine Muses, (given them, as 'tis suppos'd, by some learn'd Persons on account of the Elegancy of his Style) and contains a compleat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Barbarian</hi> Antiquities, from the time where the Holy Scripture fails us, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the Time of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> The Dialect he wrote in, is altogether <hi>Ionick,</hi> wherein he came so near <hi>Homer,</hi> that <hi>Longinus</hi> in his Treatise of <hi>Sublime,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, That <hi>Herodotus,</hi> alone, has so perfectly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated this Prince of Poets, that he deserves the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. It was in <hi>Samos,</hi> that <hi>Herodotus</hi> learnt the <hi>Ionick</hi> Dialect, and where he Compos'd his History before he retir'd with an <hi>Athenian</hi> Colony to <hi>Thuries,</hi> a City of that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which the ancient Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy calls, <hi>Magna Graecia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Herodotus (says Father <hi>Rapin,</hi> in his <hi>Instructions for History</hi>) <hi>is the first who has given a reasonable form to History, and his Merit consists in having Chalk'd out a Path to those that were to follow him. His Style is Pure, Smooth, Fluent, Agreeable and Elegant, and</hi> Athens <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commended the Charms of his Discourse. His Subject was both sublime and vast, for it comprehended the People, Kingdoms and Empires of all</hi> Europe <hi>and</hi> Asia. <hi>Yet is he not every where over-exact, because he took in too much Matter; but still I find him of Sincerity more than ordinary, since he treats of the</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Barbarians, <hi>those of his Country and Strangers, without the least show of Partiality. I am of Opinion, that</hi> Plutarch <hi>was too severe upon him, when he term'd him a Partial Historian; but this Reflection is not to be wondred at, since</hi> Herodotus <hi>had spoken so freely of his Country of</hi> Boeotia: <hi>Rapin</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses <hi>Herodotus</hi> of straying sometimes too far from his Subject. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>an Historian is easily exposed to Ramble, when he leaves his Subject, and then can never command himself, if his Capacity be not extraordinary: So</hi> Herodotus <hi>frequently leaves his Matter to amuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55246:99"/>
with tedious Digressions, which are for the most part forc'd and unnatural; wherein, 'tis true, he follows the example of</hi> Homer, <hi>who was justly reckon'd the greatest Master of Method, but without the same success; for tho' that Author often times takes a Flight, yet it always tends to the Perfection of his Work, without ever straying from it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is certain, says <hi>M. de la Moth le Vayer,</hi> That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity has left us nothing more Instructive or Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, than the Nine Muses of <hi>Herodotus.</hi> They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend (according to <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Halicarnassus,</hi> his just Computation,) what hapned memorable in the World, during the space of 240 Years; that is, from the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Empire, to that of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> being the time when our Historian wrote. The Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in his Universal History, terms <hi>Herodotus</hi> the Great Historian.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vossius de Historicis Graecis,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. 3. says, That <hi>Herodotus</hi> design'd to have written the History of the <hi>Assyrians</hi>; wherein he was to treat of the Kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but that he believ'd that Work was never Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, because <hi>Herodotus</hi> was prevented finishing it by his Death. Yet we may read <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Hist. Animal. Cap.</hi> 18. that <hi>Aristotle</hi> accus'd <hi>Herodotus</hi> of advancing an Untruth against Natural History, when he affirm'd that an Eagle drank at the Siege of <hi>Nineveh</hi>; for it is certain, that those Birds which have hook'd Claws never drink. Now this Passage which <hi>Aristotle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <hi>Herodotus</hi> for, is not to be found in his Work of the Nine Muses, and therefore must have been in his History of the <hi>Assyrians, Nineveh</hi> having been the Capital City of <hi>Assyria,</hi> which may give a reasonable conjecture that he had written that History; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, the Ancients have made no manner of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vossius</hi> does not believe that the Life of <hi>Homer,</hi> found at the end of <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s History, belong'd to him, as some would have it, and the Reason he gives, seems to carry Authority along with it. <hi>For</hi> (says he) Herodotus <hi>in his</hi> Euterpe, <hi>places the Birth of</hi> Homer <hi>above</hi> 200 <hi>Years more backward than the Author of his Life has done.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Herodotus</hi> dy'd at <hi>Thuries,</hi> whither he had voluntarily banish'd himself to be the more intent on his Studies and the Composing of his History.</p>
                     <p n="2">II <hi>Thucydides</hi> was of illustrious Parentage. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That his Grand-father Marry'd the Daughter of a King of <hi>Thrace</hi>; but what is more certain, is, That he himself was a Citizen of <hi>Athens.</hi> He was a young Student in one of the most famous Colleges of <hi>Greece,</hi> at the same time that <hi>Herodotus</hi> read his History. With this Work he was infinitely Charm'd, and could not help shewing so much Jealousie of the Author, as if he had despair'd of ever performing the like, which <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> perceiving, immediately Prophesied that he would be a great Man; and moreover told his Father, That he was happy to have a Son at this Age, who had so great a Sense of Fame and Glory.</p>
                     <p>His History was design'd to have contain'd all the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponesian</hi> War, being that between the States of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> which lasted full 27 Years, but he dy'd while he was about the 21st Year of it: <hi>Theopompus</hi> supply'd the 6 other Years. This History of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> is divided into VIII Books.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> professes a great esteem for <hi>Thucydides,</hi> his manner of Writing; when he Styles him, <hi>Authorem subtilem, Acutum, Brevem, Sententiis, magis quam ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis abundantem.</hi> Lib. 2. de Oratoria.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Rapin</hi> likewise, in his Instructions for History, affords this Author great Commendation, for he says the same thing of his Style as <hi>Cicero</hi> had done before him. <hi>The Style of</hi> Thucydides (says he) <hi>is more Noble and Lofty, than that of</hi> Herodotus; <hi>yet at the same time, it fails of being so Natural and Easie. In some places it has those harshnesses, which render it Obscure, and it is every where more Luxuriant than the Style of</hi> Herodotus. Thucydides (says the same Author in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place) <hi>has Fire, Force and Grandeur; every thing in his Writings keeps up its self, and nothing Languishes and Grovels. It is in this that he excells</hi> Herodotus, <hi>who frequently loses himself and grows too diffusive, where he gives too great a loose to his Genius. Longinus</hi> observes that <hi>Thucydides</hi> sometimes confounds the most regular Methods, the better to surprize by a disorder,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55246:100"/>
and to change his Narration the oftner. He also, sometimes, relates Things past as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and this to have the advantage of describing an Action, which moves a Reader more, as likewise ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him more Attentive.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucian</hi> finds fault with this Author's description of the Plague of <hi>Athens,</hi> in the second Book of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and this perhaps, with reason enough, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Prudent he may be allow'd in other places, yet there he has run out a little too much.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucian</hi> says also, that <hi>Thucydides</hi> has succeeded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other Historians in his Harangues; for what he puts in the Mouths of the principal Actors in his History, viz. <hi>Pericles, Nicias, Alcibiades, Archidamus,</hi> sometimes a whole Nation together, are adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vossius</hi> says, after <hi>Lucian,</hi> that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> copy'd <hi>Thucydides</hi>'s History eight times with his own Hand, and likewise, that the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. always carry'd a <hi>French</hi> Translation of him about him where-ever he went.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> says farther, That <hi>Thucydid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is nothing almost to be desir'd more in either of them, unless it be, that the former were more Natural, and the latter more Sincere. <hi>Thucydides</hi> has establish'd his Reputation with so pure Ideas, that he deserves to be Credited in all Ages. It is hard to meet with one of this Author's excellent Temper; who tho' he had been extreamly wrong'd by the Tyrant <hi>Pericles,</hi> yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prais'd him as often as he found occasion, and did frequent Justice to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> tho' they had Banish'd him their Common-wealth. He was a Man not at all guided by Passion, and who propos'd only, in what he writ, to content the Judgment of Posterity, by always speaking the Truth. In a word, <hi>Thucydides</hi> was exact in all that he writ, and faithful and disinteressed in all

he said; and tho' he sometimes seems Austere and Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Photius</hi> says, that as <hi>Herodotus</hi> is to be imitated by those that have a mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It begins where <hi>Thucydides</hi> ended; for <hi>Xenophon</hi> brings <hi>Alcibiades</hi> home again, when <hi>Thucydides</hi> left him just as he was thinking of his Retreat.</p>
                     <p>This Author also writes the History of the Ten thousand <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were before suppos'd to have been lost in <hi>Persia,</hi> but which he brings back again in safety to their own Country. <hi>Xenophon</hi> herein, was bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:55246:101"/>His Life of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is a Book abounding every where with excellent Morality and surprizing Politicks; but still it is thought he had drawn that Prince not as he was really, but rather as he ought to have been.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Xenophon</hi> has all along writ with a great deal of Art. His Style is <hi>Attick,</hi> which occasion'd him to have the Name of the <hi>Bee,</hi> or the <hi>Athenian Muse. Quintilian</hi> says, that it seems to him, that the Graces were very lavish of their Favours throughout <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s whole Works.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Rapin</hi> says, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> had the Skill to make that Pleasant which had few or no Charms in it self. Also, that nothing is more Coherent, Sweet and Flourishing, than his manner of Writing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hermoneges</hi> takes notice of an admirable Model for a tender, kind and passionate Narration, in the Death of <hi>Penthea</hi> Queen of <hi>Susa,</hi> related in the Seventh Book of <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s <hi>Cyrus. This</hi> (says <hi>Rapin</hi>) <hi>is one of the most engaging Passages in all</hi> Xenophon. <hi>Every thing there is related after an engaging Manner.</hi> He adds else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, That the Picture ought to be according to the Original, in which <hi>Xenophon</hi> has been extreamly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for in his Delineation of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he has given you only a Hero in Imagination, when he ought to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Natural one in all respects. <hi>Xenophon</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to imitate <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who keeps within the bounds of his Subject, and who is more Methodical than <hi>Herodotus.</hi> If <hi>Xenophon</hi> wanders never so little, as he has done in the Fifth Book of his History of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the Adventure of <hi>Penthea</hi>; yet this very wandering has some sort of Connection with the Body of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, <hi>Penthea</hi> having been taken by <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his defeat of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Abradates</hi> her Husband thereby brought over to <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Party, and became one of the Commanders of his Army. In truth, I should not care for being responsible for several others of this Author's Digressions, which have not always much relation to the Subject he treats of. It must be out of Respect to Religion, and the Gods who are so frequently brought in throughout <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s Works, that what he says is credited. <hi>Xenophon</hi> is pure in his Language, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and pleasing in his Composition. He has a ready

Wit, a copious Fancy, a sound Judgment, a clear Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and a neat way of turning his Thoughts, but yet he has little or nothing of Great or Sublime in him.

                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Polybius</hi> was of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> a City of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and Son to <hi>Licartas</hi>; Head of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> that is, of the most powerful Republick in all <hi>Greece.</hi> His History comprehends XL Books, of which we have only the Five first remaining, together with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Twelve others that follow. <hi>Marcus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is suspected to have been Author of this Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who was so great a stickler for the <hi>Roman</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <hi>Brutus,</hi> who had no kindness for <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Works, was yet a Passionate Admirer of <hi>Polybius</hi>'s History, which might probably occasion him to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge it for his private use, to instruct and comfort him, especially towards his latter Days, when he had so great need of it.</p>
                     <p>This History contain'd all that was remarkable in the World, from the beginning of the <hi>Punick</hi> War, to the end of that which determin'd all Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Rome</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> by the entire Name of the Monarchy of the latter. This includes the space of 53 Years. <hi>Polybius</hi> gives his History the Title of <hi>Vniversal,</hi> because he did not only treat of the Affairs of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were then concern'd one way or other almost with all Nations, but also writ concerning different Interests of the Kings of <hi>Sicily, Egypt, Pontus, Cappadocia, Macedon, Persia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Polybius</hi>'s Credit be it spoken, no Historian e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took more care, or better measures than he not to relate Matters unfaithfully. He Travell'd on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to survey those Countries he was to write of,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55246:102"/>
and pass'd over the <hi>Alps</hi> with some part of <hi>France,</hi> by reason that he intended to give an Account of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s Expedition into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us see what Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> says of him: <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> (says he) is more Grave than <hi>Thucydides,</hi> he does not so often introduce <hi>Scipio</hi> speaking, altho' he had a kind of right to do it, having all along waited upon him in his Wars. <hi>Polybius</hi> has frequent Digressions upon Politicks, the Art of War, and the Laws of History, which do not seem very necessary: <hi>Polybius</hi> is a greater Libertine than <hi>Xenophon.</hi> He treats of the Opinions, the People of those Days had of their Gods and Hell, as Fables, and did all he could to Explode them.</p>
                     <p>In short, it is not to be doubted, but that <hi>Polybius</hi> was an Atheist, having little or no kindness even for that very Religion which he profess'd. Observe how he talks at the latter end of his Sixth Book. <hi>If</hi> (says he) <hi>a Republick were to consist only of Wise and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men, what would become of those fabulous Notions of Gods and Devils? But as there is no State without bad Government and ill Actions, Religion must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be made use of to instill a Panick fear of another World, and consequently to deter by pronouncing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Punishments. This the Antients have so prudently Establish'd, that it is now look'd upon as Impious and Rash to question it. Causabon</hi> undertakes this Author's Defence, and endeavours to prove that he was not the Man he was reported to have been. But after what we have just related to him, no Body can imagine that <hi>Causabon</hi> succeeded in his Design. <hi>Polybius</hi> flourish'd about the Year of the World, 3828.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> was Native of <hi>Agyrium.</hi> He wrote his History at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and of the Emperor <hi>Augustus.</hi> And because he would be sure to Pen it with the greater exactness, before he set about it, he Travell'd through the greatest part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> with incredible Hazards and Fatigue. He gives his History the Title of <hi>Bibliotheca Historica,</hi> by reason that he had therein collected according to the Order of Time, all that the other Historians, as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosus, Theopompus, Ephorus, Philistes, Callisthenes, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi>
                        <pb n="186" facs="tcp:55246:103"/>
and several more great Authors had written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; but the Misfortune is, that not only these famous Historians Writings are lost, but all the greater part of <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>; for of 40 Books, whereof his History consisted, there are only 15 now remaining. What a prodigious Loss is this! All the Gold of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosi</hi> would not be sufficient to reward the Person that should recover these admirable Writings. <hi>Vtinam,</hi> (says <hi>Vossius</hi>) <hi>nobile adeo opus integrum nobis pervenisset.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe le Vayer,</hi> upon this occasion has these Words, <hi>I declare I would willingly go to the end of the World, were I but certain of finding this great Treasure, and I cannot but envy Posterity, the bare probability of recovering those precious Works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is what <hi>Diodorus</hi>'s History contain'd, according to what he says himself of it in his Preface. <hi>Our Six first Books,</hi> (says he) <hi>comprehend all that hapned before the War of</hi> Troy, <hi>together with many fabulous Matters here and there interspers'd. Of these the three former relate the Antiquity of the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>and the three latter contain those of the</hi> Greeks. <hi>The eleven others which follow these, include all that hapned remarkable in the World from the Destruction of</hi> Troy, <hi>to the Death of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great. Lastly, the other Twenty three extend to the Conquests of</hi> Julius Caesar, <hi>over the</hi> Gauls, <hi>when he made the Brittish Ocean the Northern Borders of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire.</hi>

                     <p>The Stile of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> is that which we term <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>; and <hi>Photius</hi> is of the same Opinion, when he says that <hi>Diodorus</hi>'s manner of Writing is very clear, and not in the least affected: That it is not too much after the <hi>Attick</hi> fashion, nor too full of Old Words, and that in a word, it is very consistent with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>

He came to <hi>Rome</hi> a little while after <hi>Augustus</hi> had ended the Civil Wars, where he lived for 22 Years; during which time, he collected all he thought necessary to assist him in his design of writing a History. He owns that over and above the <hi>Memoirs,</hi> which the most famous <hi>Romans</hi> then furnish'd him with, he was not a little beholden to the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation he had with the meaner Citizens.</p>
                     <p>His History contain'd in all 22 Books, to which he gave the Title of <hi>The Roman Antiquities,</hi> but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have now only the Eleven first remaining, which end when the <hi>Consuls</hi> first began to Govern, which happen'd in the Year after the Founding of <hi>Rome,</hi> 312. The whole Work extended to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Punick</hi> War, in the Year of the Founding of <hi>Rome,</hi> 488.</p>

                        <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus</hi> himself, made an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own History, but which <hi>Epitome</hi> never reach'd down to us; yet we should have no reason to regret the loss of the Abridgment, were we but in possession of the Original. The loss of this great Work is so much the greater, in that this Author was reputed the most exact in his Chronology of all other Historians. <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes, That we have no Author remaining, who kept good Order in the placing of his Years: And what is more to be admir'd, is that <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Halicarnassaeus,</hi> altho' he was a Stranger at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet has writ better of the <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities than any of the <hi>Latin</hi> Historians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Le Vayer,</hi> cannot forgive this Author for his Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in believing all the frivolous Stories he relates, which have not the least resemblance of truth in them. It plainly appears, (says he) that he was impos'd upon by all the Old Women of his time, whose Chimney-corner Tales he reported for Miracles. Few Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians can escape sometimes telling <hi>Rhodomontades,</hi> which nevertheless have an Air of greatness in them, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55246:104"/>
envigorates their Writings; but this Author suffer'd himself to be so wholly carry'd away by them, that he never car'd to distinguish between Probable and Improbable. Thus he makes <hi>Clelia</hi> that illustrious <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Maid, who had been given in Hostage to King <hi>Porsenna,</hi> to escape, and to swim through the <hi>Tyber</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where she had only ask'd leave to Bath in it. But <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> mounts her on Horseback, and makes her escape that way, which is the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the two; for can it be believ'd, that a timerous Girl, who was apprehensive of the least danger, would undertake to swim through a River, when there was no occasion for it, the Peace being then almost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded? But yet it must be acknowledg'd, that there is something Great, <hi>Heroick</hi> and Wonderful, in a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Lady's throwing her self into a River like a Mad body.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> says, That the Exhortation <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Halicarnassaeus</hi> puts into the mouth of <hi>Brutus,</hi> to stir up the <hi>Roman</hi> People to revenge the Death of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia,</hi> and the Harangue which he makes for <hi>Valerius,</hi> about the most proper form of Government, are both too long and tedious. That <hi>Photius</hi> extremely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Digression in his VII Book, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the Tyranny of <hi>Aristodemus.</hi> That <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus</hi> in his <hi>Roman Antiquities</hi> shews a great deal of Sense, Knowledge, and Reasoning.

                     </p>
                     <p>Of all this great number of Books, we have at this Day but the least part remaining, which are those of the <hi>Punick, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Parthian</hi> Wars, those against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> together with the Civil Wars and those of <hi>Illyrium</hi>; for as to those against the <hi>Celtae</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> we have only a few Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments left.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Photius</hi> calls <hi>Appian</hi> an Impartial Author, but which some will not allow, accusing him of flattering the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> to whom he always gives the Advantage in a Battle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> says he is a very Novice in History, and that he has stollen what is best in him, calling him <hi>Alienorum Laborum Fucum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rapin,</hi> says he, was a Copyer of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> that treated on the same Subject, which occasion'd his Stile to be as various as the Books from whence he stole. He has taken from <hi>Plutarch</hi> what he thought <hi>Fine.</hi> Yet after all, his Works are not so much to be despis'd, for they contain great Matter of Learning.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> appears in this Rank, on no other account than that he has wrote the Lives and History of the Philosophers; for if we should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to mention none but such as had compil'd a Body of History, we must have retrench'd <hi>Plutarch,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55246:105"/>
Diogenes Laertius,</hi> and several others that follow, they having written only some particular Histories.</p>
                     <p>To tell precisely the time and place of this Author's Birth is difficult. There is a great deal of reason to believe he was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> by reason that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends that Country so extreamly, for he says, <hi>Greece is as well the Mother of Philosophy as of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vossius</hi> says, <hi>Laertius</hi> liv'd under <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> or little after. It is that <hi>Arria,</hi> to whom <hi>Diogenes</hi> Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his Lives of the Philosophers, that was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Gallen,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>de 'Theriaca.</hi> She was much esteem'd by the Emperors, <hi>because she lov'd Learning, and adher'd to the Philosophy of</hi> Plato.</p>
                     <p>But for <hi>Laertius,</hi> he sufficiently shews he was of the Sect of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as may appear by several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in his Book. He is accus'd of treating often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Matters he did not understand.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. <hi>Philostrates</hi> was of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> or as some will have it, of <hi>Tir</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> so that the place of his Birth is uncertain. He liv'd under the Reign of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Severus,</hi> and at the Command of the Empress <hi>Iulia,</hi> compos'd the History of <hi>Apollonius Thianaeus</hi> in VIII Books. In the Life of this famous Magician, there are a great many incredible things; and altho' <hi>Philostrates</hi> in his Preface has profess'd to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the best Memoirs, yet is he suspected to have had very erroneous Guides. He makes his <hi>Apollonius</hi> work as many Miracles as one <hi>Hierocles</hi> did, who compar'd him to <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> confutes in a Treatise written on purpose. <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> speaking of <hi>Philostrates,</hi> says, That he has corrected <hi>Homer</hi>'s Fables with much greater of his own. <hi>Magna Homeri Mendacia majoribus Mendacijs corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two or three more Authors of this Name, which we must not confound with the Author of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi>'s Life.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> was of <hi>Nice,</hi> a City of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> His Father <hi>Apronianus</hi> was <hi>Proconsul</hi> of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> when as <hi>Adrian</hi> came to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> also himself had had several considerable Employments
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55246:106"/>
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, particularly had twice the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Consulship conferr'd upon him; by which it is plain, that he had all the necessary Qualifications to write the History of his Time; since he spoke of things whereof he had been Eye-witness, and as one that had had a share in the Government of the State.</p>
                     <p>His History consisted LXXX Books, divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to VIII Decads, of which we have only the least part transmitted to us. The Five and thirtieth Book is the first of those we have left; and we have but summary Abstracts of the preceding Thirty four, and an Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Twenty last made by <hi>Xiphilinus,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He had begun his History with the arrival of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and pursued it down to <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> and the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Severus</hi> his Successor: 'Twas under this last Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that he Published his History, which he had undertaken by the Command of <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> and the impulse of his Genius; for <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> boasts of a Spirit that directed him, and who had done him many a good turn. And indeed, it looks very strange, that a Foreigner rich and powerful shou'd live easie, and keep up his great Credit in <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Reigns of <hi>Commodus, Caracalla, Macrinus,</hi> and <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,</hi> who took a particular delight in putting to Death the best of Men. However, if what he related in his 72d Book about his Familiar be false, yet we must acknowledge the admirable Prudence and wise Conduct of that great Man, in the most difficult Times for Merit and Virtue.</p>
                     <p>There's one thing very unaccountable in <hi>Dion Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s History, which is his Satyrical Invectives against <hi>Cicero, Brutus</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> whom he charges with the most enormous Crimes. I shall not mention any of them, because they rather deserve to be blotted out of his Writings, than any stress to be laid upon them: And 'tis upon that score, that <hi>Vossius</hi> charges this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian with Malice or want of Judgment; <hi>Omnino haec aut insignem judicij defectum, aut malam mentem arguunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:55246:106"/>At last, <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> through the inspiration of his Genius left <hi>Rome,</hi> and returned to his Birth-place, to avoid the ambush that the Pretorian Soldiers had laid for him. <hi>He retired to</hi> Nice, says Mr. <hi>de la Mothe le Vayer, towards the latter end of his Life, to pass there in quiet the remaining part of it, in which he did like those Animals, which are said always to come and die in their Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Rapin</hi> gives us this Judgment upon him:
<q>Thus the long Discourse which <hi>Dion</hi> makes in the 56th Book of his History, in Commendation of Marriage and Celibacy, is not very much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The Speeches of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Moecenas</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>; the first of which advises him to quit the Empire, and the others to keep it, are both admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> but they are so long, that they make up the whole 52d Book. <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> has lost his Credit with most Men, by the extraordinary Things he relates without Judgment: For instead of following the Truth, he runs into improbabilities, as when in the 66th Book of his History he tells you, That <hi>Vespasian</hi> restored a Blind Man to his Sight, by Spitting on his Eyes.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">XII. <hi>Herodian</hi> was originally a Grammarian of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> as well as his Father <hi>Apollonius,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Discolos,</hi> or <hi>difficult.</hi> He spent the best part of his Life at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Court of the Emperors, where he had an opportunity to inform himself with the curious Nicety observable in his Books, of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fine things not to be met with any where else.</p>
                     <p>His History is divided into VIII Books, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Series of Seventy Years; that is, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Emperors that have succeeded one another, from <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, to the Young <hi>Gordianus</hi> Son to the first.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Herodian,</hi> are the first that have acquainted us with the <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceremonies, which the <hi>Romans</hi> us'd in the Funeral Honours paid to the Ashes of the Emperors, and all that was practis'd at their Consecration, and <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> that is, as their being rank'd amongst the Gods. <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> gives us a very curious
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55246:107"/>
Description of the Funeral Pomp of the Emperor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> which is one of the finest Pieces in all his Works; and he does not forget to tell us with what dexterity they made the Eagle fly from the top of the Funeral Pile, from whence that <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Bird seem'd to carry up to Heaven the Emperor's Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herodian,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> describes very finely the Funeral Rites perform'd to the Ashes of the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> which his Sons had brought from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Vessel of Alabaster: He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us how they were received with Adoration by the Senate and all the People, and carried in an Urn by the Consuls to the Temple, where the Sacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the Emperors were deposited, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things deserve to be seen in the Original, to which therefore we refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Photius</hi> speaking of the Merit of <hi>Herodian</hi>'s History, does not stick to say, that if we attend to all the Parts requisite in an Historian, there are few Authors that ought to be preferr'd before him.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Zozimus,</hi> who flourish'd under the Reign of the Young <hi>Theodosius,</hi> has compos'd a History divided into VI Books. The 1st gives a summary Account of the Lives of the Emperors from <hi>Augustus</hi> to <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> but we want something of it. <hi>Photius</hi> pretends that <hi>Zozimus</hi> made bold with the History of the <hi>Cesar</hi>'s, written by <hi>Eunapius</hi>; how far this Charge is true, we cannot well determine, because we want <hi>Eunapius</hi>'s Work. <hi>Vossius</hi> relates that there was a Report in his Time, that the Manuscript of <hi>Eunapius</hi>'s History was in the Library of <hi>Venice:</hi> However, the Five other Books of <hi>Zozimus</hi> are much larger and more exact, particularly when he comes to the Times of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> the Great, and his two Sons <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> because he then speaks of what he has seen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self He descends as far as the second Siege, which <hi>Alaric</hi> laid to <hi>Rome,</hi> and speaks of the occasion of his falling out with <hi>Honorius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Photius</hi> says, That <hi>Zozimus</hi> snarls and barks like a Dog at Christians; and it cannot be denied, but that this Pagan Author had an implacable hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the professors of Christianity, which has made
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55246:107"/>
him guilty of Injustice upon some occasions. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the other Christian Emperors were not altogether free from great Crimes, and upon that score ought not to be spared by an Historian, especially that does not forget their Virtues; yet it is certain, that the hatred he had for Religion, has given him a singular Complacency in inveighing against the Vices of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and other Christian Emperors. 'Tis also out of the same Spirit that he charges the Christian Religion with all the Miseries that befell the <hi>Romans</hi>; and ascribes the decline of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to the Contempt they had for the old Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Worship of those Gods, under whose protection <hi>Rome</hi> had flourished for 1200 Years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leunclavius,</hi> a Learned <hi>German</hi> Apologizes for <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus,</hi> and says, That it is no wonder for a Pagan to speak ill of the Christian Religion: However, there is an excess of Heat and Animosity in his Writings, which transgresses the Laws of History, and therefore can never be justified.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. <hi>Procopius</hi> was of <hi>Caesaria</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> from whence he came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the time of the Emperor <hi>Anastasius.</hi> He was both a Rhetorician and Lawyer, and came afterwards to be Secretary to <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius,</hi> whose Actions he has celebrated. His History contains VIII Books; the two first which treat of the <hi>Persian</hi> War, have been Abridged by <hi>Photius,</hi> in his Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liotheca. The two following speak of the War of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the four last describe the Wars of the <hi>Goths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides these VIII Books, there's still a Ninth, which has made a great deal of Noise in the World; it is Entituled <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is, <hi>Inedita, Things not Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi>; This is a most bitter and abusive Satyr against the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> and the Empress <hi>Theodora</hi>; and these August Persons are no less defamed in these <hi>Anecdotes,</hi> than they are commended in <hi>Procopius</hi>'s History. If they are both of the same Author, <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> deserves to be branded with the Character of a base contemptible Wretch, since he could <hi>blow Hot and Cold,</hi> as we say, in the same Breath.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55246:108"/>
however, with saying, That after all, those <hi>Anecdotes,</hi> were perhaps never written by <hi>Procopius,</hi> because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of the Learned, the <hi>Greek</hi> of that Work differs very much from that of the VIII Books of his History. This deserves some Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and teaches us not to be too rash in condemning any Body.</p>
                     <p>There is still another Work of <hi>Procopius,</hi> which is a Treatise, or rather a History of the Edifices which <hi>Iustinian</hi> raised with a royal Magnificence. <hi>Evagrius</hi> tells us, That he had made it his business to repair and build up again anew 150 Towns.
<q>
                           <hi>Rapin,</hi> says <hi>Procopius,</hi> in his secret History, is very exact in things of no importance, and forgets to give us the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of what is most material. <hi>Iosephus, Appian, Dion Cassius, Procopius,</hi> are great Speakers, as well as <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides</hi> and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who had taken this humour of haranguing out of <hi>Homer. Procopius</hi> draws the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Theodora</hi> by her Amours. <hi>Procopius</hi> discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Emperor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and the Empress <hi>Theodora</hi> follows his Passion and corrupts Truth. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> is exact in his Accounts, because he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <hi>Belisarius</hi> in the Wars, and was a witness of his great Actions; but he is too dry in his History of <hi>Persia,</hi> which looks more like a Journal than a History. He gratified his Passion by writing his secret History, but he hearkned to his Moderation by suppressing it; for they Publish'd after his Death, what he had taken care to conceal during his Life: wherein he is not altogether inexcusable.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Agathias</hi> tells us himself in his Preface, that he was of <hi>Murina,</hi> a Town in <hi>Asia,</hi> (which he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes from another of the same name in <hi>Thrace,</hi>) and followed the Law at <hi>Smirna.</hi> His History, which contains five Books, was undertaken by the Advice of a certain <hi>Eutichianus,</hi> first Secretary of State, who, without doubt, furnished him with curious Pieces, and important Memoirs, without which he could not have so well succeeded in it as he has done. He begins his History, where that of <hi>Procopius</hi> ends, that is, at the Death of the Emperor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> or under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Iustin</hi> II. Mr. <hi>de la Mothe le Vayer</hi> says, That
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55246:108"/>
among several very remarkable things which are found in the five Books of <hi>Agathias</hi>'s History, we must take a particular notice not only of what he says concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the succession of the Oriental Monarchies towards the end of the Second; but principally what he adds in the Fourth, about the succession of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> from that <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who wrested the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from the hands of the <hi>Parthians</hi> who had usurp'd it. For besides the exactness and industry of <hi>Agathias,</hi> in handling this Subject, the authority of one <hi>Sergius,</hi> (who procured from the Annalists and Library-keepers of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> what this Author reports), car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a great weight along with it.</p>

Books of the <hi>Gallick</hi> Wars, are for the most part an Account of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Actions, and he seldom mentions any thing but what he hath been an Eye-witness of: We may say the same of the three Books of the Civil War against <hi>Pompey,</hi> which are certainly <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what some have said to the contrary.</p>

                        <q>Monsieur <hi>Rapin,</hi> says <hi>Xenophon,</hi> has a soft delicate way of Writing: His Discourse, which is like a pure and clear Stream, has no Parallel in all the Writings of the Ancients, except <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Stile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ever writ with greater Purity in <hi>Latin.</hi> The Observation of a modern Critick, who finds a difference of Stile in the Books of the Civil War, which he pretends not to be written with the same Purity as the Wars in <hi>Gallia,</hi> is a squeamish Niceness which I cannot but wonder at; for my part I must freely own, that my Taste is too gross to be sensible of it, and therefore I am of <hi>Suetonius</hi>'s Opinion, who puts no difference between them: I am charm'd with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and Simplicity of that Author, and find no Body that ever writ with so much clearness. Thus <hi>Caesar,</hi> as plain as he is, has something more noble in the plainness and simplicity of his Discourse, than <hi>Tacitus</hi> in all the Pomp and Stateliness of his Expressions: And we meet sometimes with a <hi>Negligence</hi> in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, better than all the <hi>Accuracy</hi> and Exactness of the Moderns. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Narrative is admirable by its
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55246:109"/>
Purity and Eloquence, but it is not lively enough, and wants a little of that Force which he used to desire in <hi>Terence.</hi> One cannot be said to write Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story who barely relates the Actions of Men, without speaking of their Motives; but he is rather like a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Just as <hi>Caesar,</hi> who relates simply his Marches and Incampments, without acquainting us with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of them. All his Narration is too plain and naked; however, it may be said for him, that he only writes Memoirs. <hi>Caesar</hi> has an Extream intirely opposite to <hi>Tacitus:</hi> In him you find but a plain, naked Stile, without Tropes and Figures. and destitute of all manner of Ornament. Nothing is so tedious as a Description too nice and minute; which Faults <hi>Caesar</hi> runs into in his Commentaries, when he describes his Warlike Machines. It seems as if that great Captain, whose Reputation in the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Science is so well establish'd, had also a Mind to gain that of a good Ingineer: There is in that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Air of Affectation unworthy of so great a Man. In point of Harangues, <hi>Polibius</hi> is more discreet than <hi>Demosthenes</hi>; but <hi>Caesar</hi> is more cautious still, for he seldom makes any of those Speeches, because they do not consist with the Truth of History, and chuses ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to write bare Memoirs, that his Discourse may be more plain. <hi>Caesar</hi> has been the greatest Master of Expression that ever was. Pedants are in the right when they admire the inimitable Purity of his Stile, but I admire more his good Sense; for never did any Man write with so much Discretion, and he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only Author in whom we find no Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. He speaks of himself as an indifferent Person, and is ever constant in the wise Character he has taken upon him. 'Tis true, he is not a perfect Historian, but then 'tis certain also that he is an admirable Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to write History, 'Tis a great Honour for that incomparable Author, that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. have made it their Business to translate part of his <hi>Gallick</hi> Wars.</q>

It appears by what we have left of him, that he had composed the History of the <hi>Greek</hi> Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that of the Latin Captains and Historians, with several other Works, which have all been lost We have nothing left of him but the Lives of the most illustrious Generals, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> which <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> has endeavour'd to steal from him. For 'tis reported that <hi>Probus,</hi> to get some Reputation with the Emperor <hi>Theodosius,</hi> having found this Work which was quite forgot, published it as composed by him; but in process of time the Cheat was found out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vossius</hi> says, That <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> seems to have writ a Body of History, or a sort of Chronicle which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the <hi>uncertain, fabulous,</hi> and <hi>historical Times,</hi> and grounds his Conjecture upon the Testimony of some ancient Writers. But however, we have nothing left, but the Grief of having lost them. <hi>Vossius</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to justify <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> of the Theft they charge upon him, by saying, That <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> such as we have it now, is perhaps but an Abridgment of some greater Work of that Author, made by <hi>Aemilius Probus.</hi> The Latin of <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> is very fine, and therefore <hi>Vossius</hi> calls him <hi>Iulian</hi>'s <hi>Aevi Scriptorum.</hi>

                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Sallust</hi> was born in a Town of <hi>Abrusia,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> a Year after the Birth of <hi>Catullus</hi> at <hi>Verona,</hi> and died 4 Years before the Battle of <hi>Actium.</hi> He was Tribune of the People the same Year that <hi>Clodius</hi> was killed by <hi>Milo,</hi> which is also the same that <hi>Pompey</hi> was Consul, for several Months, without a Collegue, <hi>Sallust</hi> never did any thing for his Reputation in the honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which he was raised; he was all along a Slave to his Pleasures, and having squander'd away his Estate, he was obliged, to maintain his Extravagancies and Debaucheries, to commit a thousand Robberies,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55246:110"/>
in the Dignities which <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Favour conferr'd upon him. He obtained the Government of <hi>Numidia,</hi> which he ransack'd to that degree, that being return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> he purchas'd there a magnificent House and fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, which to this Day are called <hi>Sallust</hi>'s <hi>Gardens,</hi> and a fine Country-house besides. We have observed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, That an ill Man ought not to be suffered to meddle with History, because it is impossible but that his Work shall have some Tincture of his Morals. Nevertheless it has fared quite otherwise with <hi>Sallust,</hi> who is certainly a good Historian, tho' a bad Man; and what is still more particular in him, is, That he inveighs most bitterly against those Vices of which he was himself guilty.</p>
                     <p>We have but some Fragments of the principal Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Sallust,</hi> which began with the Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi>; but Antiquity has transmitted to us two of his Pieces whole and intire, <hi>viz. Catiline</hi>'s <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> and the <hi>War against Iugurtha.</hi> His Works are incomparable without Dispute, and are generally esteemed by all the Learned. His Stile is severe and short, which makes him sometimes obscure. Wherefore <hi>Quintilian</hi> advises Youth to spend more time upon <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> than <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust.</hi> For, after all, it is a very hard Matter to avoid Obscurity, when one endeavours to be so concise; and unless a Man can pretend to the great Talents which <hi>Sallust</hi> had, he'll never be able to be like him, both short and intelligible.</p>
                     <p>There are some Pieces of inestimable Value in <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust. Spartian</hi> calls that a <hi>Divine</hi> Oration which is in the beginning of the <hi>Iugurthine</hi> War, and which <hi>Sallust</hi> puts in the Mouth of <hi>Micipsa,</hi> then ready to die, to exhort his Sons to be united. This is the same which, as <hi>Spartian</hi> relates, the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> sent to his eldest Son, towards the latter end of his Life, which is no small Credit for <hi>Sallust.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let us hear Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> speak.
<q>
                           <hi>Sallust</hi> is great and sublime in his way of Writing, which makes <hi>Quintilian</hi> compare him to <hi>Thucidides.</hi> But the Question is, Whether <hi>Sallust</hi>'s Stile, as stiff as it is, is not better and more proper for History, and gives not more Weight and Force to the Discourse? Has it not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55246:111"/>
also its Beauties? <hi>Sallust</hi>'s Character is to be exact and concise; he is principally to be commended for the sweetness and rapidity of his Discourse, which animates him, and gives him so much Life. <hi>Sallust</hi>'s description of the Place where <hi>Iugurtha</hi> was defeated by <hi>Metellus,</hi> serves to acquaint us the better with the Fight. We see by it the Fortitude of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as well as the Experience of the King of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi> in taking all the Advantages of the Ground; and the whole Account of the Fight is better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the Image of the Place which the Historian sets before our Eyes. The Description of <hi>Africa,</hi> in <hi>Sallust</hi>'s War of <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> is too minute and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: He should not have said so much to make the Bounds of the Kingdom of <hi>Atherbal</hi> and <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> then in question. What need was there to describe all that vast Country, and to distinguish the particular Manners of so many different Nations? <hi>Trogus</hi> charges <hi>Sallust</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> (and not without a great deal of Reason) with a wanton and immoderate Excess of Harangues in their Histories. And indeed all those Speeches we put in the Mouths of great Men, carry with them an Air of Falshood; for from what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs can a Man pretend to have fetch'd them? And besides, a Warrior never speaks like an Orator. Therefore Harangues are Supposititious, as well as that which <hi>Sallust</hi> makes <hi>Catiline</hi> speak to the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, which probably was secret and extemporary. Most of <hi>Sallust</hi>'s Harangues are always admirable, but never to the purpose: Nothing can be finer than <hi>Marius</hi>'s Speech; it is the soundest Piece of Morality in the World, concerning a noble Birth; every thing there is reasonable, and Antiquity cannot boast of many Discourses, where one may find so forcible Persuasions to Virtue; but that is out of its proper Place: And the Air with which he makes <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> give their Opinions in the Senate, himself (as great as he is) is little proportion'd to the rest of the History. We ought to make the Picture of none but important Persons, wherein <hi>Sallust</hi> is faulty; for he gives us the Picture of <hi>Sempronius,</hi> who is but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concerned in the Conjuration of <hi>Catiline.</hi>
                           <pb n="203" facs="tcp:55246:111"/>
                           <hi>Sallust,</hi> with all his Simplicity, is too prolix when he inveighs against the Corruption and loose Manners of his Time; he is always angry with his Country, and always discontented with the Government: He gives us too ill an Opinion of the Commonwealth, by his Invectives and Reflections upon the Luxury of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus nothing can be more eloquent than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Condition <hi>Rome</hi> was in, when <hi>Catiline</hi> took the Resolution of making himself Master of it: And when that admirable Author represents the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, corrupted by Luxury and Avarice, and sinking under the Weight of its own Greatness, he uses the most exquisite and eloquent Expressions that can be met with in any History. 'Tis in those Images that a Man of Skill has an opportunity to shew it; and the Historians of the first Rate are full of those fine Strokes. <hi>Sallust</hi>'s Preambles, which are great Speeches, full of Sense and manly Eloquence, seem to me to carry with them an Air of Affectation: They are generally Common Places that have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the History. Perhaps this Author had some <hi>Pieces of Reserve,</hi> which he employed upon occasion, as <hi>Cicero</hi> us'd to do: That Method may be good for an Orator, who speaks often in Publick; but such Precaution is not allowable in an Historian, who is supposed to be Master of himself and of his time. Among the Latins, <hi>Sallust</hi> has a noble Expression, a true Wit, and an admirable Judgment. No Person ever imitated so well the judicious, exact and severe Stile of <hi>Thucidides:</hi> He is sometimes stiff in his Expressions, but he never flags; his Conciseness makes him now and then obscure, his Manners are always true, and he gives Weight to all what he says. His Sentiments are always fine, although his Morals were bad: For he continually declaims against Vice, and always speaks well of Virtue. I find him a little too morose and peevish with his own Country, and too censorious upon his Neighbour; but take him all together he is a very great Man.</q>

                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> was of <hi>Padua,</hi> and not of <hi>Apona,</hi> as some have imagined: Soon after he was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he got into the intimacy of all the great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55246:112"/>
of that Capital of the World, which gave him an opportunity to take all the necessary Instructions for the Composition of his History, which he Published un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Augustus.</hi> He wrote one part of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other at <hi>Naples,</hi> where he sometimes retired to Study, and give himself up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his great Work. His History reached from the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Drusus</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and contained 140 or 142 Books: But we have but 35 of them left, and those too by an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Misfortune, do not follow one another. The second Decad is wanting: We have only the first, third and fourth with about a half of the fifth. As for what we want, we must be contented with the Epitome or Abridgment which <hi>Florus</hi> has made of it; if so be that we can see without indignation, a small imperfect Copy, which has in some measure robb'd us of so great and compleat an Original. For Abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are generally charged as necessary to the loss of the Books which they Abridge. Men are naturally lazy, and are glad to meet with Epitomes to save themselves the trouble of reading great Volumes. Thus the loss of <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> is laid upon <hi>Iustin,</hi> and that of <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> upon <hi>Xiphiliuus,</hi> because they have Epitomiz'd them.</p>
                     <p>There are a world of Learned Men that cry up to the Skies, the Merit of <hi>Livy</hi>'s History: <hi>Vossius,</hi> who relates all that has been said in his Commendation, gives us in four words a fine Panegyrick upon that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; <hi>Nothing,</hi> (says he) <hi>can be greater or richer than this Writer. Nihil hoe Scriptore est grandius atque uberius.</hi> We have remark'd somewhere in this Book, that <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> recovered of a very dangerous Fit of Sickness, by the reading of <hi>Titus Livius:</hi> But we have forgot one particular, which does no less honour to that Author, which is, That this great King as an acknowledgment of his Recovery, demanded of the City of <hi>Padua,</hi> the Bone of the Arms wherewith that famous Historian had writ his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story; and having obtained his Requests, this Wise Prince caused that Bone to be transported to <hi>Naples,</hi> where he received it like a precious Relick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:55246:112"/>However, in the very Age he lived, <hi>Asinius Pollio</hi> found fault with something in him, which he calls <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavinity.</hi> This <hi>Patavinity</hi> was a Country way of writing, such as North-Country Men and others will have with respect to the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, unless they live a considerable time in <hi>London,</hi> or either of the Universities. These was, says <hi>Quintilian,</hi> in <hi>Livy,</hi> a Country way of Writing, that betray'd his Birth at <hi>Padua,</hi> and some Expressions which could never pass upon the Courtiers, and Politest Men in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some think it strange the <hi>Livy,</hi> who was a Man of Wit, should relate so many populous Reports, which he did not believe at all himself, as he always seems to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inuate. His History is full of Prodigies: Now an Ox has spoken; another time, a Mule has ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and then again, Men and Women, Cocks and Hens have changed their Sex. There rains nothing but Stones, Flesh, Chalk, Blood and Milk. The Statues of the Gods are said to have spoke, wept or sweated Blood. In short, adds Mr. <hi>de la Mothe la Vayer,</hi> how many Apparitions of Phantoms do we not find in him? How many Armies ready to engage in the Air? How many Lakes and Rivers of Blood?</p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> speaks thus of him:
<q>The Nobleness of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Expression ravishes my Soul into extasy; 'tis about Two thousand Years since that Historian commands a respectful intention from all Nations, by his Awful and Majestick way of speaking, which has been the admiration of all Ages. To speak the Truth, nothing satisfies my Mind so well as his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable choice of Words, always proportioned to his Sentiments, and his excellent manner of Expressiing the Sentiments, always conformable to the things he speaks of. In short, he has hit best of any Man upon that sort of Stile, which <hi>Cicero</hi> advises to Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: And it is by that great Pattern, that <hi>Buchanan, Mariana, Paulus Aemilius, Paulus Iovius,</hi> (and all those that have outlived the Times they flourish'd in,) have squared their way of writing History. <hi>Livy</hi> has a very engaging way of telling a Story, which is his admirable Skill of mixing little things with great ones; because great things by themselves are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55246:113"/>
fatiguing, and require great attentions, whereas little ones are pleasant, and unbend ones Mind: According to the same method he varies his Adventures, makes sad things succeed those that are pleasant, and mixes very discreetly the shining with the Dark, that he may keep up the Reader's attention by that agreeable Variety. The most perfect Pattern we find in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, of a great Action related with all the heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enforcing Circumstances, is the March of <hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> described in the 31st Book of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Annals. This, in my Opinion, is the most finished Piece in all his History, and we meet with few things of that strength in all Antiquity. Never was a greater Design framed by a more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Soul: And never was any thing Executed with more Boldness or Resolution. The Question was how to come out of <hi>Africa,</hi> go through all <hi>Spain</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> surmount the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> cross the <hi>Rhine,</hi> a River so broad, and so rapid near its Mouth, and whose Banks were thick set with so many Enemies; open ones self a Way through the ragged <hi>Alps,</hi> a thing never attempted before; March continually over Precipices; dispute the Ground at every step with a People that lay in Ambush in a continued <hi>Defile,</hi> and that too among the Snow, the Ice, the Rain, and the Torrents; brave the Storms and Thunders; wage War against Heaven and Earth, and all the Elements; draw after one an Army of a Hundred thousand Men of different Nations, and all dissatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Captain, whose Courage they cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Fear seizes the Soldiers Hearts, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> alone remains in an unconcern'd Tranquility; the Danger that surrounds him on every side casts all the Army into Consternation, while his great Soul is still composed and serene. All things are described with the most dreadful Circumstances: The Image of the Danger is expressed in every word, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any thing in History either more finished, or touched with deeper Colours, and greater or bolder Strokes. <hi>Quintilian</hi> declares that of all Historians, <hi>Livy</hi> has signalized himself most by these render and delicate ways, wherewith he has touched the softest
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55246:113"/>
motions of the Soul: The Rape of the <hi>Sabinae,</hi> and the tenderness they exprest to disarm both the <hi>Romans</hi> their Husbands, and the <hi>Sabins</hi> their Fathers: <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi>'s Death, and her Body exposed to publick view, to stir up the People to Rebellion against the <hi>Tarquins; Vetturia</hi> prostrate at her Son <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s Feet, to avert the Siege of <hi>Rome</hi> which he intended. <hi>Virginia</hi> Stabb'd by her own Father; the Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>Rome</hi> was under after the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> and a thousand such other Strokes touched in his History, in the tenderest and most delicate manner, and with the most pathetick Expressions imaginable, are fine instances of it. And 'tis principally in this Author, that we ought to study the way of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Passions as they ought to be touch'd in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: For he never animates it but where a Heat is requisite. The Description of the Place where <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> attack'd <hi>Minutius,</hi> in the 22d Book of <hi>Livy</hi>'s Annals, is a Passage extreamly well touch'd. <hi>Livy</hi> speaking of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> who was so handsom in her Husband's Eye, without mentioning her Face, does only describe her Virtue, and gives us in four Words the greatest Idea we can frame of an honest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: <hi>Lucretiam nocte sera non in convivio, luxuque, sed deditam lanae, inter Ancillas sedentem inveniun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>. Livy</hi> goes on his way, without stopping any where; he tells you what he knows about the things he speaks of, and leaves the Reader at liberty to make what Reflections he thinks fit, without preventing him by his own: And if he does, 'tis but seldom, and then too in few Words, but Noble and Great; as when he relates the Crime and Punishment of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> who had ravished <hi>Virginia.</hi> The only Model we ought to propose to our imitation in point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions is <hi>Livy,</hi> when he steps out of the <hi>Roman</hi> History to speak his Thoughts about the success which <hi>Alexander</hi> might have had, if he had bent his Arms against <hi>Italy.</hi> He is very cautious in speaking his Opinion, and that too without labouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Minds of People by a studied excuse. His Reasoning upon that Subject is very curious, and not at all out of its place. There are Beauties that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55246:114"/>
consist only in a turn of Eloquence or Wit. They are very surprizing, and look wonderfully well when artfully placed. Here are some Examples out of <hi>Livy. Porsenna,</hi> King of <hi>Clusium,</hi> besieges <hi>Rome. Caius Mutius</hi> deeply touched with the Danger his Country is in by so pressing a Siege, goes into <hi>Porsenna</hi>'s Camp, and kills the King's Secretary, whom he mistakes for the King himself, who stood then just by him. The King Commands burning Coals to be brought to force him by the Torment of Fire, to own his Accomplices: This Couragious Youth, without any manner of Concern, puts his Hand into the Fire, and lets it burn to the last, without so much as turning Pale upon the Matter, and thus bespeaks the King; <hi>See what a Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing Life is to those who have true Glory in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</hi> These Words spoken with Resolution, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently change the face of things. The Murderer as odious and abominable as he is, casts the beholders into Wonder and Amazement: They look upon him with respect, and send him back with Commendation, at the same time that they were preparing the most exquisite Torments for his Punishment. 'Tis only one <hi>Word</hi> that occasions this sudden change, and this <hi>Word</hi> well placed is a very great Ornament in a Narration. Thus <hi>Fabius</hi> having retaken <hi>Tarentum, Hannibal</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Vanquished, spoke these fine Words, which savoured still of the Conqueror praising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to praise his Enemy: <hi>The</hi> Romans, said he, <hi>have also at last their</hi> Hannibal: This is a very proud way of being humble. These Strokes are very frequent in that Historian; and indeed, nothing can give a greater Idea either of these we make thus speak when they do it well, or of him that makes them speak when he does it to the purpose. <hi>Livy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades more by his sound Morals, than great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: For through the various Intrigues, Interests, Passions, and other Disorders which he describes, he gives a glimpse of an honest Mind, which proclaims a better Man than Historian. We see in them the inmost recesses of the Heart, of those he describes the very bottom of his own; and among the false
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55246:114"/>
Lights he discovers in their Conduct, he is never out himself. He judges well of all, for his Soul is as Upright, as his Wit is True. <hi>Livy</hi> is the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd of all Historians, for he has all the great Parts requisite to write History; a fine, clear Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; a noble Expression; a true Judgment; an admirable Eloquence. He has none but great Ideas in his Mind; he fills his Readers Imagination by what he says; by that means he affects the Heart and moves the Soul: He has the greatest Genius for History, and is one of the greatest Masters of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that ever liv'd. I don't understand what <hi>Asinius Pollio</hi> means by reproaching him with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try way, savouring of <hi>Padua,</hi> which he calls <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi> His great Talent is to make People feel what he says, by ingaging those that read him in his own Sentiments, by inspiring them with his Hopes and Fears, and giving them all his Passions, by his admirable Art of setting the most secret Springs of the Heart a going.</q>

                     <p>I hope the Reader will easily excuse me for dwelling so long upon <hi>Livy</hi>'s History: He is the great Master of this Art, and deserves to be well known; and since no Man can give us a better account of him than Monsieur <hi>Rapin,</hi> I thought it proper to give you this long Abstract.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> was nobly born, as he proves from those of his Name, that had born the greatest Employments in the Army. And he had himself been in the Wars with great Honour and Reputation. He had been Tribune of the Soldiers, and had Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd through the Provinces of <hi>Thracia, Macedon, Achaia, Asia Minor,</hi> and on both the Banks of the <hi>Euxin</hi> Sea; so that both by his Employments and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, he had great advantages to write History. The two Books that remain of History, (for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his Works are lost,) begin about the Sixth Year of the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and are dedicated to <hi>Marcus Vinicius</hi> Consul, who had Marry'd <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:55246:115"/>His Style is pure, clear, elegant, and such as is thought worthy of the best Age of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: There are in his History some particulars not to be found any where else. Never did any Man know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he, how to blame and how to commend; yet, in some Peoples Opinion, he goes a little too far in the Praises he gives to the House of <hi>Caesar Augustus.</hi> But how can a Man avoid that Fault, when he writes his History before the Eyes of the reigning Family? Therefore I easily forgive him the excessive Praises he gives to <hi>Tiberius</hi>; but really he is guilty of too gross Flattery, when he bestow'd so much Incense upon <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus,</hi> his Favourite, whom he endeavours to make pass for the honestest Man that <hi>Rome</hi> ever saw.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> is very exact in setting down the Times of the Events he speaks of; he describes the Original of several Cities; he makes the Eulogy of those that have been famous in the Wars, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the State, or in the Sciences; in short, there's a great deal to be learnt from that Author.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Father <hi>Rapin</hi> speaks thus: <hi>Paterculus</hi> and <hi>Florus</hi> are florid, genteel, delicate and agreeable in their mean way of Writing. Let <hi>Paterculus</hi> be pretty, trim and genteel in the Character he has pitch'd upon; but let <hi>Livy</hi> be great and serious, because small Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have need of Ornament to shew themselves, whereas the great ones need no Addition to their natural Graces. We must always speak within bounds; let an Historian never diminish or exaggerate Things, either as <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who casts his Venom upon every Thing, or <hi>Paterculus,</hi> who makes every Thing look gay and pleasant.</q>

                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight; the Age he liv'd in is not well known, but the most common Opinion is, That he flourish'd under the Emperor <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian. Quintilian,</hi> who mentions all the Historians of Note in the Tenth Book of his Institutions, written in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55246:115"/>
                        <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Time, yet says not one Word of <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi>'s History; which induces us to believe, That his Work might not have been Publish'd at that Time; which Opinion is also confirm'd by the silence of the other Ancients.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> has written the History of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> in X Books; but the two First, with the end of the Fifth, and some little places of the Tenth, have been lost. There is not a more excellent Author among the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, than <hi>Quintus Curtius:</hi> He may be said to be among Historians, what <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> is among Conquerors; and that the Panegyrist is to the full as great as his Hero. So that <hi>Alexander</hi> would have now no Reason to complain that he had not, like <hi>Achilles, Homer</hi> to celebrate his Actions. Some are for <hi>Livy</hi>'s Style, others for that of <hi>Tacitus</hi>; but all agree upon the Excellence of that of <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> which is beyond all dispute worthy of the Age of <hi>Augustus,</hi> as <hi>Vossius</hi> speaks: <hi>Imo vel Augustaeo aevo digna est dictio. Iustus Lipsius</hi> says that he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that Princes should make themselves most familiar with, and that they ought to have him continually in their Hands.</p>
                     <p>Let us now consult <hi>Rapin</hi>'s Judgment upon this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
<q>
                           <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> says that Critick, is shining and florid. Nothing can be more Polite than <hi>Quintus Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>; he has a florid and gay Expression, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleases the Men of Wit. Every thing ought to be grounded upon Reason; and therefore <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> is not always in the right: When he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make his Hero so admirable, he does not make him take the wisest Resolution, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the most Heroick and Perillous; he always finds a Charm in Danger, and cares not so much for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, as the Honour of Conquering. It is in his Power to surprize <hi>Darius</hi> in the Night, and by that means keep him from knowing how weak he was; (<hi>Darius</hi> having double the Men): But this great Man who is less sollicitous of getting a Victory, than
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55246:116"/>
making his Valour to be admired, attacks the King of <hi>Persia</hi> in the broad Day, being resolv'd rather to die with Honor, than Conquer by a Surprise. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> after his defeat, offers to divide <hi>Asia</hi> with him, and proposes a Match between him and his Daughter; but <hi>Alexander</hi> rather chuses to arrive at Glory thro' Dangers, than become a Master so peaceably; he will hear none of these Proposals, and aims at nothing but what's extraordinary. His Historian, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, does him a great deal of Honor; but does not all this great Honor want a little probability? Does he not make his Hero more Rash than Wise, and more Venturesome than Ambitious? He thought those Sentiments more noble without doubt; but on the other side, he has strain'd them too far, and has given us Reason to question, Whether he has left us a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or a History. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> might very well have spar'd to make <hi>Alexander</hi> so infamous as he does in some Places. There are some priviledged Persons, whom we ought to treat with Civility and Respect; we may, indeed, relate their personal Faults, but we must never offend their Dignity, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base their Greatness. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> deserves to be commended for his Sincerity, for he speaks the good and the bad of <hi>Alexander,</hi> without being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd for the Merit of his Hero. If one can find Fault with his History, it is for being too Polite: But nevertheless he has excelled in a pleasant and natural way of describing Manners. That Character of Perfection which is conspicuous in those great Men, is not to be found any more in the succeeding Ages.</q>

                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> was born of a Noble Family of <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, and was raised to the highest Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in the Common-wealth: He liv'd under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Vespasian</hi> and the succeeding Emperors, with all the Reputation and Honour due to his Birth and personal Merit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:55246:116"/>He was in Years when he set himself to Write, and 'twas under the Empire of <hi>Trajan</hi> that he composed his History, of which we have but V Books left. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he wrote his Annals, great part of which have also been lost. Besides those two Works, he publish'd a Treatise of the Manners of the several Nations who, in his Time, inhabited <hi>Germany</hi>; and the Life of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi> his Father-in-law</p>
                     <p>The Learned seem to be divided as to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ought to be made of his Style; yet the Truth is, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> is an incomparable Writer. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his Text, occasion'd by the Ignorance of the Transcribers, does perhaps make him more obscure than he would be of himself; and this is the Opinion of Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe le Vayer.</hi> But let some People say what they please, the best way is to side with <hi>Vossius,</hi> who finds so much Eloquence, so much Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectness and so many Beauties in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that he does not stick to say, that he is be best and wisest of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Quis enim non videt Dictio Taciti, quam sit ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, quam tersa &amp; limata?

                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Two hundred Years after the Death of <hi>Tacitus</hi> the Historian valued himself upon bearing the same Name with him, and being descended from him. He caus'd his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But all the Care that Emperor used hath been in vain, since of One and twenty Years of his History, we have only the account of one left, and V Books of about Thirty, according to St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Great Duke <hi>Come de Medicis</hi> made choice of <hi>Tacitus</hi> among all other Historians, as one from whom he expected more sound Precepts and Instructions for his Conduct, and more solid Satisfaction to alleviate
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55246:117"/>
the Cares which are inseparable from the Government of a State, when a Prince endeavours to merit the Title of Father of his Country. <hi>Casaubon</hi> is quite of another Opinion, and maintains in his Preface to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libius,</hi> that the Reading of <hi>Tacitus</hi> is most dangerous for Princes, by reason of the many ill Examples, which are scattered up and down his Works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The Stile of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> says Monsieur <hi>Rapin,</hi> is not very proper for History, for it is full of Starts; and when it shines, 'tis like a Flash of Lightning, which dazles more than it gives light. <hi>Tacitus</hi> is a starting Wit, that skips from one thing to another. His Sense comprehended in few Words, is too close for the Readers Capacity, which is often pusled with it: And because he does not follow Nature in what he relates, and generally forgets that he Speaks to Men, so he seldom instructs us as he should. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when upon the occasion of the <hi>Papian</hi> Law, he relates the Original of Laws, or when in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he describes the Priviledges of Sanctuaries, he does not trace things back to their beginnings; he never explains things thoroughly, nay, sometimes he gives a false Account of them, as when he takes upon him to describe the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion in the fifth Book of his History. His Style is also very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it, which is a great Fault in an Historian, whose primary Function is to instruct. <hi>Tacitus</hi> is still more uneven than <hi>Sallust:</hi> His Connexions are generally forced, and the Thread of his Discourse very much Broke and Interrupted, which is no small discouragement to the Reader, who cannot follow him without putting himself out of Breath. There can be no better and exacter Description than that which <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes, of the Treat which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Messalina</hi> gave to <hi>Silius</hi> her Favourite Gallant. This was a Vintage Feast with all its Ceremonies, the Season being then Autumn, and favourable for that purpose. Mirth, Pleasure, Effeminacy, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Impudence, Lewdness and Debauchery; all in short is there described, with an exqiusite Elegance and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55246:117"/>
delicacy of Expression: The particulars are related succinctly, discreetly, and withal, in a very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner: And nothing can be more judiciously placed, to make, by that gay Picture, the Death of <hi>Messalina,</hi> which follows soon after, the more Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical and full of Horror. In short, there are some happy Circumstances which give a particular Grace to every thing, when a Man knows how to employ and place them as he should. As for Figures, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> is not so scrupulous; he seems to aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to dazzle us: The boldness of his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and other Tropes, makes his Expression so high strained and troublesom. <hi>Tacitus</hi> is an ill Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his Fire, for he uses it every where; his Colours are also too strong and glaring; and because he is often too expressive in some things, and does not Paint them to the Life, he therefore seldom affects us. A Description ought not to be too minute and particular, but such as is the Description of the Isle of <hi>Caprea,</hi> in the fourth Book of the Annals of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; for we find in it the Reasons <hi>Tiberius</hi> had to retire thither towards his latter Days, which makes it necessary; and as it is Concise, Polite, Elegant, and has nothing in it either Impertinent or Superfluous, it may be said to be a perfect one. Nothing can be finer than the Speech which <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes <hi>Tiberius</hi> Speak to the Senate, upon the Reformation of Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the third Book of his Annals: Never did any Historian make a Prince Speak with more Dignity. A Picture ought to be true and resembling, wherein <hi>Tacitus</hi> is not very exact, for he rather chuses to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his own Fancy, than imitate Nature; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours more to make fine Pictures, than true ones: If his Pictures can but please, as that of <hi>Sejanus</hi> in the fourth Book of his Annals, he little cares whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they resemble or no, for he makes <hi>Sejanus</hi> a great deal worse than he was, if we can believe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terculus,</hi> who commends him. <hi>Tacitus</hi> draws the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Tiberius</hi> by his Actions, by which only he makes him known. <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Politicks are often false, because his Morals are not true: Either he
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55246:118"/>
makes Men too bad, or he is not himself plain enough. His Reflections are not natural, because they want Innocence. He Poysons and puts an ill construction upon Things. He has by that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour spoiled several People, who imitate him in that, tho' not able to do it in any thing else. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> which is related in the sixth Book of <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s Annals (upon the occasion of the News brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of a <hi>Phoenix</hi> which appeared in <hi>Egypt</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Tiberius</hi>) is according to the Rules of an allowable Digression. The Question is scanned and examined by the different Opinions of the Naturalists about this extraordinary Bird, whose Qualities, Figure and Shape are succinctly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. These sort of Strokes well placed in a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are a great Ornament to it, and serve won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully well to stir up the Readers curiosity and keep his attention awake. This that follows is a fine Stroke taken, out of <hi>Tacitus. In the height of the Mirth and Frolicks of that famous Treat which</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salina <hi>gave her Lover, they caused a poor simple Fellow called</hi> Valens, <hi>to get up into a Tree, and asked him what he saw: A Storm</hi> (said he) <hi>which gathers in the Air and comes from</hi> Ostia. These Words spoke by that blundering Fellow, spoiled presently all their Sport, and cast a deep sadness into every Body, tho' blurted out at random and without design; for they were a Prognosticating of the return of the Emperor, who arriving soon after, caused the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press to be stabbed, being grown weary of her Lewdness. Those Strokes that have something sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing in them, are very happy in History. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> has no good Morals; He is a great Dodger, that covers a bad Soul under a very fine Wit: He is mistaken in true Merit, because he thinks there can be no other than that of being cunning; and he always speaks more out of Policy than according to Truth. He not only has ill thoughts of his Neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also he shews no Piety or Reverence for the Gods, as one may see in his Discourse upon Fate against Providence, in the VI Book of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55246:118"/>
wherein he ascribes all to the Stars and blind Chance, upon the occasion of <hi>Trasullus,</hi> one of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>'s Astrologers, who was grown his Confident at <hi>Caprea.</hi> So difficult it is for an ill Man to be a good Historian; for one has generally the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with the other. <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates so many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenities of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that <hi>Bocaline</hi> cannot bear with him for it. <hi>Tacitus</hi> has a particular way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing Things and Persons, different from all the rest; but he sticks too much to great Things, and will not descend to the little ones, which are not always to be slighted. He thinks well, but he does not always hit upon a clear Expression. He is sometimes too much a Philosopher. He is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in his Decisions upon every thing, and speaks as if the Fate of all the World lay at his mercy. He Moralizes upon the Follies of others, that he may Lash every Body, and speak ill of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: He has spoiled a world of People, by creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them a desire of studying Politicks, which is the most vain of all studies: This is the Rock against which so many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as <hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> and so many <hi>Italians,</hi> such as <hi>Machiavel</hi> and <hi>Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralio</hi> have split.</q>

                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:55246:119"/>This Author has writ the History of the first 12 <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>; which makes up a Series of History of above a Hundred Years. He is beyond dispute one of the principal Authors of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue; and <hi>Bodinus</hi> assures us, that none of the other Historians ever writ any thing more exact or more finish'd than what we have left of him. St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who had taken him for his Pattern, when he begun his Catalogue of the Ecclesiastical Writers, says that <hi>Suetonius</hi> has writ with the same freedom as those Emperors lived of whom he writes the History. And indeed he relates a great many obscenities which the World would not much care to know; and it were to be wished, says <hi>Muret,</hi> that <hi>Suetonius</hi> had not inform'd us so well of so much Lewdness, as <hi>Tiberius, Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> have been guilty of. For it is to be fear'd, that when a Man relates so many Impurities, he may seem to set up a School to Teach them. There are some other Pieces of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> but they do not concern Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. <hi>Iustin,</hi> according to the most probable Opinion, flourish'd in the time of <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> He is the Abridger of <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi>'s History, and so they charge upon him the loss of that great Work.</p>
                     <p>The History of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> contain'd XLIV Books, and <hi>Iustin</hi> has kept to the same Number in his Abridgment. The <hi>Latin</hi> of <hi>Iustin</hi> is very fine, and such as is thought worthy of the Age of <hi>Augustus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> he was a Native of the Country of the <hi>Vocontii</hi> in the <hi>Gallia Narbonensis,</hi> and flourish'd under <hi>Augustus.</hi> His Grand-father was made Free of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> through the favour of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great: And his Father, after having born Arms under <hi>Caesar,</hi> became his Secretary and Keeper of his Seal. The Loss of his History is one of the greatest Misfortunes that could happen to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Learning: It began at <hi>Ninus,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55246:120"/>
of the Assyrian Monarchy, and came down as low as the Emperor <hi>Augustus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Iustine</hi>'s Epitomy of this History, there are many Chronological Faults, which ought not to be imputed to <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> for he was a Person too skilful to be guilty of them.</p>
                     <p>THESE are the most considerable Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, which was continued by those commonly call'd <hi>Augustan</hi> Writers, whose Names were <hi>Spartianus, Lampridius, Capitolinus, Vulcatius,</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards by <hi>Amianus Marcellinus,</hi> a faithful and judicious Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who flourish'd in the Year of Christ 375. and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Victor,</hi> who liv'd in 395. and was an Author of great Prudence.</p>
                     <p>But to give particular Accounts of these and the many other Historians, who will claim the same Respect, would too much swell our Volume; and they may be the rather omitted, because those that follow are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly short in excellence of those we have been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; which the learned <hi>Gerhard Vossius</hi> declares and confessed, that the good Days of History were past, and the doating Age of it began after the <hi>Antonines,</hi> when he began his second Book of Latin Historians with these Words, <hi>Transitur ad Historiae Senectutem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is exceedingly useful to a Reader, to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the History of the Author's Person and Circumstances, together with a Character of his Work, before he begins to read it; for whereas without being preinform'd, perhaps half the Book shall be read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he discover it, and many Excellencies and Beauties, and it may be Faults, of the Work pass'd by unobserv'd, for want of such Knowledge. The Reader is on the contrary, very much enlightned, and Studies the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with a great deal more pleasure and true Profit, when he is already taught wherein his excellency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, or where his Faults lie, that he pass not by the one without proper Notice, or be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>We shall proceed now to a short, but distinct, and as exact as possible Account of the most considerable Ancient and Modern Monarchies and Governments of the World.

                  <head>CHAP. I. An Account of the Church of God under the Old Testament.</head>
                  <p>GOD created the Heaven and the Earth, and all that in them is. He created them out of Nothing, by the sole Power of his Word, for his own Glory. He did not make them all at once, as if it were out of Necessity; but in Six Days
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55246:123"/>
time, and according to the Order which he thought most convenient. The first Day he made the <hi>Light</hi>; the second he made the <hi>Heaven</hi>; the third Day he divided <hi>the Heaven from the Earth,</hi> and caused the Earth to bring forth <hi>Herbs, Trees,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Plants</hi>; the fourth Day he made the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi>; the fifth Day he made the <hi>Fishes</hi> and the <hi>Fowls</hi>; the sixth Day he caused the Earth to bring forth <hi>all the other Beasts</hi>; and lastly, he made <hi>Man</hi> to command all the rest of the Creation. The seventh Day God rested, having finished all his Works; that is, he ceased from producing new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God made Man in his own Image and Likeness; that is to say, after he had formed a Body out of the Earth, he breathed into it the Breath of Life. 'Tis this Soul which is the Image of God, because it is a Spirit. God having made <hi>Man,</hi> made also <hi>Woman</hi> to be an help meet for him; and he made her of one of the Man's Ribs; that so the Man and the Woman might love each other entirely, and be made one, as being but one Flesh.</p>
                  <p>The Man whom God called <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Woman whom God called <hi>Eve,</hi> were Innocent when they came out of the Hands of their Cteator; but they fell into Sin by the Malice of the Devil, and involved all their Posterity in their Guilt, and in all the Miseries conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereupon. All Mankind make up one sinful Mass of Perdition; out of which, God makes choice of a small number of Persons to compose the <hi>Heavenly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> These Elect are mix'd on Earth in the Church among the Men of this World, whom God looks upon as Vessels of Wrath, and abandons to his Justice. These Carnal and Fleshly-minded Men, together with the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, make up the Church of the Reprobate, which in Scripture Language is called <hi>Babylon.</hi> All that happens here on Earth, is for the Sanctification of the Elect, whose Assembly composes <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is actuated by no other Principle than <hi>Charity</hi>; whereas <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Slave to its Lusts and Passions, is under the Dominion of <hi>Concupiscence.</hi> So that the Church, the Object of our Lord's Mercy, is the only thing which lasts in the World for ever. All Things pass away, all Things perish; the most puissant Monarchies fall to decay. The Church
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55246:123"/>
alone remains; thô God sometimes seems to abandon it, in order to purifie, correct, and prove it. This is what may easily be collected from the whole Sequel of this Chronology; where we shall find, that all Empires have an End, whilst the Church lasts always, and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> brings within the Pale of his visible Church all Nations of the Earth, by virtue of the Cross. This made St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> to say, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> became Lord of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, not with the Sword in his Hand, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by having his Hands nailed to the Cross. His Words are, <hi>Quid fortius manu hâc, quae mundum vicit, non ferro armata, sed ferro transfixa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Forasmuch as <hi>Christians</hi> cannot have any greater Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, than to be acquainted with the History of that Church, whereof they are Members: Their Curiosity, methinks, might induce them to enquire how the Church of God still subsists, even when every thing else decays, and submits to the Stroke of Fate or Time. We can discover the Duration of Monarchies, trace their Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Progress, and End: But the Church <hi>Militant</hi> here on Earth is what began, and will end with the World. What an amazing Sight is this! Can any thing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Curiosity of a Man of Genius, than to know how this Church, a Stranger here on Earth, surrounded by so many Enemies, and which so many Kings and Emperors attempted to destroy, has still subsisted spight of all the Fury and Malice of Hell?</p>
                  <p>The Church of God under the Old Testament begins with the World, and ends at <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the Corner-Stone which under the Gospel reunites all Nations in his Church, and which takes away that middle Wall of Partition, which stood formerly between the <hi>Iews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Its Duration is according to some about 3950, according to others 4000 Years. But since 'tis difficult to trace the Succession of so many Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without being bewilder'd, we have assigned several <hi>Epochas,</hi> which may serve as so many Points of Sight, to direct us farther; or as so many Breathing Places to rest in before we proceed: We shall therefore consider the <hi>Iews</hi> to the Coming of <hi>Christ</hi> under four kinds of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>

This is apparent in the whole Series of this History, and what <hi>Samuel</hi> foretold and threatned upon the Establishment of their first King, was abundantly verified upon them at last, <hi>viz. That if they did wickedly, God would destroy both them and their King:</hi> For when the Measure of their Iniquity was filled, and they had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the highest Perfection of Impiety Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was capable of; then were they carried into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, their Temple and City defaced, and themselves made Slaves to the Heathens, whose Gods they had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. I need not Instance in any more Particulars, since all the World knows, and our own Nation has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, that Publick Communities, considered as such, receive according to their Deserts their Rewards or Punishments even in this World.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. An Account of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy.</head>
                  <p>HAving in the preceding Chapter given you a short, but exact Account of the State and Condition of the People of God from the Creation down to our Saviours time: We shall now proceed to <hi>Prophane</hi> History, where we must not expect to meet with that Accuracy and Exactness of Chronology, which <hi>Moses</hi> and others of the Inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have observed in their Accounts. In this and the three next Chapters we will Treat briefly of the Four <hi>Great Monarchies, viz.</hi> The <hi>Assyrian, Persian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi>: And afterwards we shall give you a short Account of the other Monarchies and Republicks, which were Contemporary to them.</p>
                  <p>The Monarchy of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> is the first of the four; but before we treat of it, we think it not amiss to give you a short Description of that Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Assyria,</hi> properly so called, was a Country of a large Extent, situated in <hi>Asia Major</hi>: Bounded on the North by <hi>Armenia</hi> the <hi>Greater</hi>; on the East by <hi>Media</hi>; on the South by <hi>Susiana</hi> and <hi>Babylonia</hi>; and on the West by the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> which parts it from <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> which at present is called <hi>Diarbech.</hi> But the Empire of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> or which is called <hi>Assyria Major,</hi> was of a greater Extent; for it took in <hi>Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>; in a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all <hi>Asia</hi> except the <hi>Indies.</hi> This was the State of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> under <hi>Semiramis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been observed, that nothing is more intricate and difficult than to trace the first Beginnings of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, which are commonly dark and obscure, and full of Fables. This is apparently true with respect to that of the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> the first Rise of which is very hard to find out. Authors are divided in their Opinions about
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55246:137"/>
it; and as they differ very much in the Account they give us of its first Founder, and of its Duration, so they dissent as much in the Number, and in the Names of the Kings, who reigned over it. Those who follow <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> as <hi>Vsher, &amp;c.</hi> make <hi>Ninus</hi> to be the first Founder of it, affirming the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the <hi>Arabs</hi> to have reigned in <hi>Assyria</hi> before his time. They place the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Monarchy about the year of the World 2737, before <hi>Christ</hi> 1213. So that its Duration from that time, to <hi>Belshazzar</hi> the last of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchs, takes up 656 years. Others who follow <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> such as <hi>Sethus Calvisius, Petavius, Helvicus, &amp;c.</hi> make <hi>Nimrod</hi> to be the first Founder of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and place the beginning thereof in the year of the World 1788, before <hi>Christ</hi> 2162; so that the Duration of this Monarchy, according to those Authors, is about 1647 years.</p>
                  <p>Now thô the former Account seems most Authentick, and carries the greatest Face of Truth, yet we shall choose to follow the latter likewise in compliance to the generality of Historians; and herein we shall first lay down the Succession of the Kings from <hi>Nimrod</hi> to <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> (as they are copied from <hi>Theodorus Zuinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> by <hi>Gutberleth,</hi>) in whose time the Monarchy was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Babylonians.</hi> After which we will briefly relate the State and Condition of the Divided Monarchy under its separate Kings, whose Names we will likewise give you from the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>

                     <p>Notwithstanding the Darkness and Obscurity of these Times, and the various Opinions of Authors about the first Founder, and about the Names and Number of the succeeding Kings of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy; yet they afford us so much Light, as to give us occasion to make these following Reflections.</p>

                        <p>THO' the Title of <hi>Monarchy</hi> belongs equally to all States that are under the Government of one single Prince, who is stiled the Monarch of that State so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd; yet in History it more peculiarly relates to the four great Monarchies of the World, who succeeded each other, and in their Turn conquered and gave Law to the other Petty Monarchies of the Earth.</p>

                        <p>THE first of these Monarchies was (according to the joint Testimony of all Writers) the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> which by Historians, both Sacred and Prophane, is promiscuously stiled, the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. It was called the <hi>Babylonian Monarchy,</hi> because of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> which <hi>Nimrod</hi> the first Founder of this Monarchy built, and because a great many of its Monarchs held their Court at <hi>Babylon.</hi> It was stiled the <hi>Chaldean Monarchy,</hi> because <hi>Babylon</hi> was in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and several of its Kings were <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> Lastly, it is called the <hi>Assyrian Monarchy,</hi> because <hi>Ninus,</hi> after he had built <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Assyria,</hi> translated the Seat of the Empire thither.</p>

                        <p>FRom the Beginning, Growth and Decay of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy, and of the other three, we may once for all observe, that the Providence of God, thô unseen and unregarded, had the greatest Share in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them from so small a Beginning to so great a Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, as to be at last the Terror and Scourge of the rest of the Inhabitants and Kingdoms of the Earth: That the Designs and the Glory of this Supreme Being were all along carried on and promoted by these Humane Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even whilst they only thought of advancing their own private Interests, and of enlarging their own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories: That when the Designs of this great King of Kings and Lord of Lords were once brought about, and his Glory sufficiently signalized, then he discarded those Instruments, took the Empire away from them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed it on another People. This is so visible from the whole Series, even of Prophane History, that it needs no other Proof than the Considerate Perusal of what Historians have delivered to us about the various Changes and Revolutions that have happened in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Monarchies of the World. Those who were the Greatest, arrived by degrees to their Height from very small Beginnings; and when they were there, there they stopp'd; some invisible Power giving a Check to their growing Greatness. Afterwards we find, that in the midst of all their Glory, they have either dwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away as they rose, or else lost all they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering for several Ages together, within the compass of a few years or days. And does not all this sufficiently prove an over-ruling Providence, which takes care of all Human Affairs, and disposes of Kings and Kingdoms as he thinks fit?</p>

King by all the rest, which he brought about by this Stratagem. These Lords could not very well agree among themselves, what Form of Government they had best have. <hi>Otanes</hi> was for a <hi>Democracy. Megabizus</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that an <hi>Oligarchical</hi> Government would be most advantageous: But <hi>Darius</hi> preferred a <hi>Monarchical</hi> State before either of the former, and his Opinion met with the greatest Applause. The Question then rose, who should be their King, since the Heirs-Male of <hi>Cyrus</hi> were extinct. At last they agreed unanimously, That the next morning by Sun-rising they should all mount on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and the Man whose Horse neigh'd first should be acknowledged King. <hi>Oebor, Darius</hi>'s Groom, had the Art of making a Horse neigh when he pleased; which Skill he then made use of in favour of his Master: So that no sooner was <hi>Darius</hi> mounted, but his Horse neigh'd, the other Lords alighted, did Obeisance to him, and owned him for their King. He reigned 36 years.</label>

                  <p>Within a while after, <hi>Darius</hi> being returned from Hunting, sprained his Foot as he alighted off his Horse. There were a great many <hi>Egyptian</hi> Physicians then at Court, who used their utmost Skill to ease the King; but all to no purpose, for he neither slept, nor was his Pain abated for 7 days together. At last <hi>Democedes.</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Physician, was called for, who managing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper according to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Method, gave the Prince something to make him sleep, and healed him in a few days.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Democedes</hi> was likewise Fortunate in curing the Queen <hi>Atossa</hi> of an Ulcer in her Breast. Among other Favours which that Princess urg'd him to demand of her, he intreated her to inspire the King with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of conquering <hi>Greece.</hi> He had his Desire granted, for <hi>Darius</hi> ordered fifteen of his chief Nobles

to attend <hi>Democedes,</hi> that they might take a View of the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> which he intended to conquer.

                  <p>BEfore we shew you this mighty Monarch in his Grandeur, it may not be amiss to speak a little of the Birth, Character and Actions of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> before his <hi>Persian</hi> Expedition, together with his surprizing Progress in the Conquest of the Eastern World.</p>
                  <p>'Twas in the year of the World 3595, before <hi>Christ</hi> 355, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> was born at <hi>Pella,</hi> a City in <hi>Macedon:</hi> His Mother <hi>Olympias,</hi> while she was with Child of him, dream'd, That her Bowels were extended over all <hi>Asia</hi>; which was verified in the Conquests made by the Son she at that time bore in her Womb. He was born with all the Endowments of an Heroick Spirit, had a great and aspiring Soul, a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per full of Fire, a lively Genius, and, thô impatient of Restraint, was mild enough to be prevailed upon by reasonable Advice, till in the latter end of his Reign, when the <hi>Persian</hi> Luxury had debauched him. To these natural Qualifications, his Father (a wise and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55246:144"/>
Prince) added an Education that finished this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Piece; for in his tender years he was commited to the Care and Tuition of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher; by whose Wisdom this Noble Prince was so far improved, that <hi>An Philippo Patri, aut Aristoteli ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistro plus debuit Alexander,</hi> is become a common Subject of Declamation in the Schools.</p>
                  <p>When he was but a Youth, visiting his Father's Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, he saw the Horse <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> whom, when by reason of his fierceness none of the Grooms durst ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ride, he undertook to tame, and leaping upon his Back, rode him round the Ring; his Father surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and delighted with the Courage of his Son, ran to him, and with Kisses and Embraces bad him seek some larger Territories, for <hi>Macedon</hi> was too straight to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so great a Soul. At the Age of 18 years he shewed a wonderful Courage in the Battel of <hi>Cheronesus</hi> against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> wherein (some say) he saved his Father's Life, and gained the whole Honour of that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>His Father <hi>Philip,</hi> after he had gained many signal Victories in <hi>Greece,</hi> was preparing for an Expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Persia</hi>; but was hindred in it by Death, being killed by <hi>Pausanias</hi> at the Wedding of his Daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> about the year 3615, and was succeeded by his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was at that time about 20 years of Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander,</hi> to follow his Father's Example, went to <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and caused all the Confederated Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> to meet at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where by the Consent of all, except the <hi>Lacedomonians,</hi> he was chosen Generalissimo of the Army raised against the <hi>Persians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Spring of the year 3617, he marched through <hi>Thrace,</hi> and made Incursions into the Country of the <hi>Triballians</hi> and <hi>Illyrians.</hi> He had a bloody Engagement upon the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and therein defeated <hi>Sirmus,</hi> the King of the <hi>Triballians.</hi> Upon occasion of this Battel, a Report ran that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was beaten, which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> (corrupted with <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Gold) so inculcated at <hi>Athens,</hi> that the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, and Revolted: But <hi>Alexander</hi> soon convinced them of their Mistake, for having finished his Work by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55246:144"/>
the Reduction of those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he returned to <hi>Greece</hi>; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> were wise enough to beg his Pardon, and obtained it; but the <hi>Thebans</hi> despising his Threats, were be sieged, their City taken and ras'd to the Ground, except the House of <hi>Pindar,</hi> which <hi>Alexander</hi> caused to be saved, and gave it to the Posterity of that excellent Poet.</p>
                  <p>And now having satisfied his Honour and Revenge, <hi>Alexander</hi> again bethinks himself of his <hi>Persian</hi> Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and passing into <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> he was again declared Commander of the Forces raised for that Service: 'Twas in this Journey that he gave a Visit to <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick at <hi>Corinth</hi>; and soon after the return from it, that in a Dream he saw the High-Priest of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who Exhorted him forthwith to go to the Conquest of the <hi>Persians,</hi> wherein he assured him of Success.</p>
                  <p>And now all things being prepared, <hi>Alexander</hi> gave away the Government of his Dominions to his Friends, distributing to some Villages, to others Boroughs, and to others Sea-Ports and Territories, and reserving little or nothing, <hi>Perdicas</hi> asked him, <hi>What he kept for himself?</hi> To which he answered, <hi>Hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now leaving <hi>Antipater</hi> chief Administrator, he set forward for <hi>Asia,</hi> having 60 Long-Ships to transport his Army, which consisted of 40000 Men, whereof <hi>Parmenio</hi> was made Commander of the greatest part.</p>
                  <p>When he came into <hi>Asia</hi> he visited the <hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> from whom on the Mother's side he was descended. He said, <hi>Achilles</hi> was doubly happy, in having such a Friend as <hi>Patroclus</hi> during his Life, and such a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist as <hi>Homer</hi> after his Death. After this he passed the <hi>Granicum,</hi> a River in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where he met with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> at the Head of 100000 Foot, and 20000 Horse, drawn up in a Line of Battel. The two Armies joined, and a very sharp Engagement happened between them. The <hi>Persians</hi> lost 20000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, and about as many more were taken Prisoners. <hi>Darius</hi> and his Army, which appeared so formidable, were put to flight; and <hi>Alexander</hi> gain'd this Victory with the Loss of only 100 Men.</p>
                  <p>By this means an Avenue was opened into <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> marched to <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Lydia,</hi>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:55246:145"/>
which the Governor surrender'd to him with all the Treasures that were therein. From thence he marched to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he put an end to the <hi>Oligarchical</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Place, and established <hi>Democracy</hi> in its stead. After this he took <hi>Miletum</hi> by Storm, which was a very strong Town, and famous for the Colonies it sent out to the Neighbouring Islands. But <hi>Halicarnasseus,</hi> which stood out against him to the last Extremity, was by his Orders demolished. In a word, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a year he became Master of all <hi>Phrygia, Lydia, Pamphylia, Pisidia, Paphlagonia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>

The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> according to <hi>Iustin</hi>'s Account, were 400000 Foot, and 100000 Horse: But <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> does not reckon above half so many. In this Battel the <hi>Persians</hi> lost 100000 Foot, but others say only 50000. Let the Loss be more or less, <hi>Darius</hi> was put to flight, and that he might not be discovered, threw away his Imperial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. That which went deepest to the Heart of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince was, that his Mother <hi>Sisigambis,</hi> his Wife <hi>Statira,</hi> his two Daughters, and his Son not above 6 years old, were taken by the Conqueror. But <hi>Alexander</hi> used them always like Queens, paid them great Respect, and for their Comfort assured them, that <hi>Darius,</hi> whom they supposed to be dead, was still alive.</label>

He went up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with a Design to besiege it, but the High-Priest <hi>Iaddus</hi> meeting him in his Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Ornaments, prevented his Intention; for <hi>Alexander</hi> was so struck at the sight of him, that he alighted off his Horse, and did him Obeisance, crying out, <hi>That God appeared to him in the same Shape, and commanded him to go and conquer Asia.</hi> This High-Priest read to him the Chapter in <hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein it is foretold, That a <hi>Greek</hi> should conquer the <hi>Persians</hi>: Which he was very well pleased at, and sacrificed in the Temple, offered great Oblations, and gave the <hi>Iews</hi> full Toleration to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Laws and Religion.</p>
                  <p>The next year <hi>Alexander</hi> marched with his Army into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Pelusium</hi> surrender'd to him. From thence he went to <hi>Memphis,</hi> where he found 800 Talents, and several precious Stones belonging to the Crown. From thence he marched along the <hi>Nile</hi> to the very utmost Parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> went into the Province of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and visited the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> where the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle declared him to be the <hi>Son of Iupiter</hi>; which was what <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Ambition aimed at. And this Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance sufficiently shews how far the Excess of Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity transports Men.</p>
                  <p>After this he went in search of <hi>Darius,</hi> who on his part rallied his Forces, raised more, and omitted nothing that might put him in a Posture for another Engagement. As <hi>Alexander</hi> made his Approaches, so <hi>Darius</hi> ordered his Army to march from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the River <hi>Tigris</hi> on the Right hand, and <hi>Euphrates</hi> on the Left.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Empire of <hi>China.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE should now, according to our Proposal in the beginning of the Second Chapter, proceed to the Fourth <hi>Great Monarchy,</hi> which was that of the <hi>Romans</hi>; but upon second Thoughts, we judge it convenient to alter that Method, (how Natural soever at first sight it may seem,) we shall, before we proceed to that, give you an Account of those Petty Monarchies, which were Contemporary to, and conquered one after another by the Three Great Monarchies of the <hi>Assyrians, Persians,</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> and were at last all of them swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the <hi>Roman,</hi> of which they became so many Petty Provinces. But because the <hi>Chinese</hi> Monarchy has of late Days been much discoursed of, we shall in this Chapter, by way of Digression, treat of that <hi>Empire,</hi> thô it has no relation to, and was never dependant on the four Great Monarchies, as being never conquered by them or any other, till of late years they were over-run by the <hi>Tartars</hi> their Neighbours; and therefore we should not in this Treatise have inserted any thing of <hi>China,</hi> were it not that the Learned World is grown extremely Inquisitive into all that concerns this great Empire.</p>
                  <p>If the Accounts and Relations we have of the <hi>Chinese</hi> were exact and true, it must be owned that this great Empire is the most ancient, and has lasted the longest of any in the World. The <hi>Chinese</hi> Historians maintain, as a thing Self-evident, the <hi>Fohi</hi> their first King ascended
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55246:156"/>
the Throne 2952 years before <hi>Christ.</hi> They tell us, that this Prince, and the seven next who succeeded him, and had been Elective Emperors, reigned the space of 745 years: That after this, the Empire of <hi>China</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Hereditary to several Families, who governed it the space of almost 4700 years.</p>
                  <p>However Extravagant and Incredible the Chronology of the <hi>Chinese</hi> may appear, yet it may be reconciled to that of the Bible, which we follow chiefly. We need only suppose, that <hi>Noah,</hi> who was born 2894 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Birth of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was <hi>Fohi</hi> the first Emperor of <hi>China.</hi> The Description which the <hi>Chinese</hi> give us of this <hi>Fohi,</hi> may very well agree with <hi>Noah.</hi> This is no such extraordinary Supposition, if we consider that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations looked upon <hi>Noah</hi> as their Head and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For is not he that <hi>Saturn</hi> of whom the Poets speak, and whose three Sons, <hi>Iupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Pluto,</hi> are <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> the three Sons of <hi>Noah</hi>?</p>
                  <p>After all, suppose we cannot reconcile the History of <hi>China,</hi> as to its Chronology, with that of the Bible; yet there is no Question to be made, which of the two ought to be followed, whether that whereof the Spirit of God is the Author, or the other which has only Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Testimony to support it. And would it not be exposing our Holy Religion to the Scorn and Derision of the Prophane and Atheistical, if we should prefer Human before Divine Testimony? This will appear the more unreasonable, if we briefly consider these two Things. First, that the Chronology of the <hi>Chinese</hi> is very dubious and uncertain, their Annalists cannot agree in their Accounts. <hi>su-ma-quam,</hi> one of the most Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated among them, makes their Empire to begin in the time of <hi>Hoam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ti,</hi> 250 years later than <hi>Fohi.</hi> And then, in the next place, how full of Romantick and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Fables is the History? One Instance may serve for all; In the time of <hi>Confucius</hi> a certain <hi>Lausu</hi> lived, who is said to have been 80 years together in his Mother's Womb. And now, shall we give up the Account in Sacred Writ, which is True, Certain, and Authentick, which Men inspired by God himself have given us, which has been approved of by the Learned Men of all Ages, and confirmed by several General Councils; shall we, I
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55246:156"/>
say, give up such an Account, so delivered, and so au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, to the vain, fabulous, and uncertain Account of Human Tradition?</p>
                  <p>But however, that we may not so much as seem to put the least Slight on that which so many Learned Men have in such great Esteem, 'tis requisite to give you a short Scheme of the History of the <hi>Chinese.</hi> In doing this, we shall observe our former Method of reducing the Monarchies to certain set Periods of Time, and we shall consider <hi>China</hi> under XXIII. States, from the first founding of its Empire, to the present year 1698, which lasted about 4596 years.</p>

                  <p>We have had so little to do with <hi>China,</hi> till of late Days, that 'tis hardly worth our while to set down the Names, and the Chronological Succession of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Chinese</hi> Emperors from the time of <hi>Noah</hi>; yet if any Credit be to be given to the Account which Father <hi>Martini,</hi> and Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> two Jesuits, have handed down to us about this Matter, I believe we could not put too high an Esteem on such a Chronological Series of Kings, which reaches to the very first Ages of the World. But to be plain in the case, We do not think these Collections to be much worth, since we are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether these Fathers were able Criticks or no, and upon what Memoirs they founded their Account. For thus much we learn from their very Histories; That there happened several Distrubances in <hi>China,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the Loss of a great many of its ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. Mention is therein made of a certain <hi>Yven-ti,</hi> the third Emperor of the tenth Family, who about the year of our Lord 552, when he saw himself appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and made Prisoner, before he would surrender himself, broke his Sword, and burnt his Library, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were above 140000 Volumes, which he did upon the Consideration, that neither his Sword, nor his Books, would be of any farther use to him.</p>

                        <hi>Confucius</hi> the <hi>Chinese</hi> Philosopher.</head>
                     <p>IN the year of the World 3233, and 717 years before <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was the famous <hi>Confucius</hi> born, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Philosopher that <hi>China</hi> ever had. He drew in his first Breath in the Village of <hi>Leu ye,</hi> hard by the City of <hi>Kiofeu,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Xanton</hi> on the North of <hi>Nankin.</hi> It was under <hi>Kimvam,</hi> the 24th Emperor of the third Family, that he began to signalize himself by the fineness of his Philosophy, to the Profession of which he adjoyned a singular Innocence of Manners. His Writings are full of very fine Maxims, and such as tend wholly to establish Quietness in private Families, and Peace in the publick State. He was of the Opinion, that it is very important for Sovereign Princes, that the Fathers should have a Supreme Authority over their Children. He would have their Authority be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive, because in truth the Inclination of a Child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a right Ply betimes, and being kept to an entire Dependance under a Paternal Authority, would be the more easy to submit to the Yoke of Regal Power. The <hi>Chinese,</hi> and the adjacent Nations, such as the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Tunquin</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> stiled <hi>Confucius,</hi> a <hi>wise</hi> and a <hi>holy Man.</hi> His Writings are in as much Esteem among those Nations, as the Gospel is among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. There is scarce a City but has a magnificent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege dedicated to <hi>Confucius</hi>; and every where may be
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55246:158"/>
seen Inscriptions in Golden Letters, <hi>To the Memory of the Great Master</hi>; or rather, <hi>To the Memory of the Illustrious Prince of Learning.</hi> Never did any Philosopher receive greater Honours from his own Country, insomuch that his Posterity was highly honoured, not only by Noble Titles, but also by great Revenues, and particular Marks of Esteem.</p>
                     <p>About the year of the World 3728, <hi>Xi-hoan-ti,</hi> the second Emperor of the fourth Family, governed with a great deal of Severity and Cruelty. This was the Man who caused the famous Wall to be built to cover <hi>China</hi> from the Incursions of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About the year of the World 3786, reigned <hi>Ven-ti,</hi> the third Emperor of the fifth Family, who was a Prince of extraordinary Temper. In his time Paper was first invented in <hi>China.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 650, <hi>Cao-cum</hi> caused several Temples to be erected to the true God, and favoured the Establishment of Christianity, which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly preached in <hi>China</hi> under his Predecessor.</p>
                     <p>In the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1064, <hi>Ym-cum,</hi> the fifth Emperor of the nineteenth Family, began to reign. In his time lived the famous Historiographer <hi>Su-ma-quam,</hi> whose Annals begin with <hi>Hoam-ti,</hi> which most of the <hi>Chinese</hi> look upon as the first Founder of their Monarchy.</p>

                  <p>There is in <hi>Egypt</hi> the famous <hi>Istmus</hi> of <hi>Sues,</hi> that parts the <hi>Red Sea</hi> from the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have in vain attempted to cut, so as to joyn those two Seas.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more obscure or uncertain in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, than what has commonly been published concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government and Succession of the first Kings of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Here we walk even in <hi>Egyptian Darkness</hi> it self, and cannot set two Steps forward without being misled. Historians cannot agree among themselves about the Names, the Time, the Number, nor the Series of these Kings. No body knows whether these Dynasties, which some look upon as Successive, and which they range one after another, be not most of them Collateral, and of the same time or no. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> says upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that for all the Care and Pains he took in consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priests of <hi>Egypt</hi> about their Antiquities, yet he could find nothing in them but what was very dubious and uncertain; and that whatever has been published of <hi>Egypt</hi> before the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> might very well be reckoned as Fabulous. What Credit then can we give to what the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians have related from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests, with whom it was very common to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the Grandeur and Antiquity of their Nation by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick and surprizing Relations? Shall we believe them when they confidently tell us, that the Gods and Demi-Gods reigned in <hi>Egypt</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34201 years before any Kings reigned there? With such Stories as these did the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Priests amuse <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> when he consulted them about the Antiquity of their Kings. In one word,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55246:159"/>
it seems very likely that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests invented those Fabulous Reigns, that they might not yield the Glory of their Antiquity to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> or <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who assigned several Myriads of Years to their Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. There was a kind of Emulation upon this Point between these two Nations, which inclined their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to invent several Successions of Imaginary Kings. This Emulation is what is very real, the Signs whereof are very visible in the Writings of the Ancients. Wherefore all that can be said of the first Government of <hi>Egypt</hi> with any certainty, is, that <hi>Cham</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah</hi> having planted it, govern'd this Land for about 160 years, and was succeeded by <hi>Mizraim,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Osiris</hi>; after whom a great number of Kings are named, but with such a mixture of Fable, that we shall not trouble our selves or the World with a frivolous Account to their Dynasties, which <hi>Manetho</hi> would have us believe were 17, before <hi>Thetmosis</hi> or <hi>Amasis</hi> their first known King. We shall omit likewise to speak of their State under their unknown Kings, or under those who were stiled <hi>The Shepherd Kings</hi>; and will begin our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Thetmosis</hi> or <hi>Amasis,</hi> who began to reign in the year of the World 2207, from whom we shall continue the Succession down to <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Death, when it became a <hi>Roman</hi> Province; which happened about the year 3920.

                     <hi>SIcyon</hi> was one of the most ancient Cities of the World: It was situated in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> a <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> upon a Hill about two Leagues off the Sea. 'Tis from this City that <hi>Sicyonia,</hi> a part of <hi>Greece,</hi> derives its Name. The Account of this State is the most Ancient of any in <hi>Europe,</hi> but withal, the Darkest and most Obscure. However, to give some Idea of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> we shall consider it under two distinct States, which lasted about 966 years.</p>

                     <hi>AThens,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Attica,</hi> was seated on the River <hi>Cephissus,</hi> in the very Heart of that Province, which was looked upon as the most eminent Province of all <hi>Greece.</hi> This City was consecrated to <hi>Minerva,</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and has been esteemed one of the most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and flourishing Cities of the World. <hi>Cicero</hi> says, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were perfect Masters of Politicks, Religion, and Husbandry; that they were the first Founders of Law and Equity; and that they transmitted these Things to the rest of Mankind. Nor was <hi>Athens</hi> only the Publick School of Arts and Sciences, but it was likewise the Seat of Magnanimity and Valour, and as famous for great Commanders, as it was for Men of Polite Parts and Learning. It's <hi>Areopagus, Liceum, Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, Portico,</hi> and the vast Number of its stately Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, have been very much celebrated and talked of in the World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Areopagus</hi> was properly the Senate-House of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Place where a certain Number of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates determined the Causes of Private Persons. It was to this Place that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought to give an Account of his Doctrine, and where he made that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Discourse, the Subject of which he occasionally
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55246:169"/>
took from an Altar which he had seen in that City, dedicated, ΘΕΩ ΑΓΝΩΣΤΩ, <hi>TO THE VN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KNOWN GOD. Dionysius</hi> one of the Areopagites, and a Woman of Quality named <hi>Damaris,</hi> embraced the Christian Religion, and were converted by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Liceum</hi> was a College, where <hi>Aristotle</hi> taught his Philosophy, for which Reason it was called the <hi>Lycéan Philosophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Academy</hi> was a fine House with Gardens and Fountains, where <hi>Plato</hi> taught his Philosophy. This Name of <hi>Academy</hi> came from one <hi>Academus</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> who gave that House to <hi>Plato,</hi> and hence those who were his Disciples were called <hi>Academicks. Arcesilaus,</hi> who came after <hi>Plato,</hi> being willing to reform some Points of his Doctrine, founded that which was called the <hi>Second Academy,</hi> of which, <hi>Pericles</hi> the Disciple of <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> was the Head. <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> taught, That we cannot come to the perfect knowledge of any thing and that therefore we ought to suspend our Judgment in all things, without being positive in the determining any thing about them. There was a <hi>Third Academy</hi> founded by <hi>Carneades</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> who taught, That there was some Things probable, and others true and false, but that the Mind of Man could not tell how to distinguish them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portico,</hi> which was called <hi>Pecilé,</hi> because of the Variety of admirable Pictures with which <hi>Polignotus</hi> had enrich'd it, was the Place where <hi>Zeno</hi> the Cynick held his Lectures of Philosophy, whose Followers were called <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the History of <hi>Athens</hi> we meet with Four diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent States, under which it appeared to the World, from the year of the World 2394, in which it was founded, down to the present Times.

After this happened an Engagement between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> near <hi>Miletum,</hi> wherein the latter had the Advantage. The <hi>Oligarchy</hi> of 400 was abolished at <hi>Athens,</hi> and that of 5000 was set up, which ordered <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who had been banished, to be recalled, and his Goods which had been confiscated, to be restored to him. <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> with <hi>Thrasybulus</hi> and <hi>Theramenus,</hi> were made Generals of the Armies, the Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of these great Commanders caused a new Change of Affairs in <hi>Athens,</hi> all Things looking with a better Aspect than formerly. A Sea-fight happened between the Fleet of <hi>Mindarus,</hi> which was joined with the Ships of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> and the Fleet of the <hi>Athenians</hi> commanded by <hi>Thrasillas</hi> and <hi>Thrasybulus.</hi> The Victory was a long time very doubtful, but at last favoured the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who lost 15 of their Ships, and took 21 of the Enemy's. This Action happened about <hi>Cinossema,</hi> a Promontory of <hi>Chersonnesus</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> which Place is noted for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sepulcher of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> which is there.

There happened another Sea-fight in the same place between the <hi>Athenian</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Fleets, which last got the Victory under the Command of <hi>Hegefandride,</hi> their Admiral. <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Thrasybulus,</hi> and <hi>Theramenus,</hi> went to the Relief of <hi>Cyzicus,</hi> which <hi>Mindarus,</hi> the Commander of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> would have taken by Storm.

                     <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were so far disheartened at this Defeat, that they sued for a Peace; but the <hi>Athenians</hi> refused it, being excited to this Refusal by the <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> of the City. These <hi>Demagogues</hi> were a sort of Men, who were very fierce, given to Change, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious to the utmost of their Power, and who by their bold Speeches drew the whole Populace after them. But the <hi>Athenians</hi> often repented this Refusal of Peace to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>; and <hi>Cleophon,</hi> the most pestilent of these <hi>Demagogues,</hi> was often reviled for having been the chief Cause of it.

This Engagement, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened near <hi>Egos-Potamos</hi> in the Straits of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> gave <hi>Lysander</hi> an opportunity of blocking up <hi>Athens</hi> both by Sea and Land, which he besieged so straitly, that he obliged it to surrender to him: And then he set up 30 Tyrants to rule there, and granted the <hi>Athenians</hi> Peace, upon Condition that they would demolish their Walls within 10 days. Whilst these Tyrants had the Government in their hands, they committed many and great Outrages. Several of the Citizens were banished, and their Estates confiscated by them.

In this Century flourished <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who at 32 years of Age taught his Philosophy at first at <hi>Mytelene,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Lampsacus.</hi>

Some time after the <hi>Athenians</hi> revolted from him, and sided with <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> upon which he besieged <hi>Athens,</hi> but broke up from before it, being perswaded thereunto by <hi>Crates</hi> the Philosopher.</label>

They sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to crave Help of the <hi>Romans</hi> against <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who warred against them. 'Tis said, they sent another time three Ambassadors to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to get off the Fine of 500 Talents imposed upon them, for having pillaged <hi>Oropus.</hi> Those Ambassadors were three Philosophers, who flourished in this Century, <hi>viz. Carneades</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> the Academick; <hi>Diogenes</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Stoick; and <hi>Critolaus</hi> the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55246:175"/>
It was observed, that each of these Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers had a quite different Talent in Oratory: <hi>Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> expressed himself imperiously, vehemently, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly: <hi>Critolaus</hi> made a coherent, even, and methodized Speech: And <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his Harangue seemed reserved, modest, and afraid to say too much. This Air of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy being a new Thing there, was very dazling in the Eyes of the <hi>Romans</hi>; and the Youth being charmed with the Conversation of those Philosophers, were all for studying that Science. But <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor, who was of Opinion, That Philosophy would soften the Temper of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and make them less fit for War, to which he designed to Discipline them, dispatched these Philosophical Ambassadors from <hi>Rome,</hi> and banished all Philosophers out of that City.</label>

                     <hi>SParta</hi> or <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> was the Capital City of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> and one of the most considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> seated on the River <hi>Eurotus.</hi> It was the strongest City in all <hi>Greece,</hi> thô it had no Fortifications, and defended its self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Walls for the space of 800 years against all its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Authors are not agreed about the Time, or the Founder of <hi>Sparta</hi>: Some say, <hi>Spartus</hi> the Son of <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>; others, that <hi>Sparta</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Lacedemon</hi> founded it. Some assert, that <hi>Spartus</hi> the Son of <hi>Phoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> King of <hi>Argos</hi>; and others, that <hi>Lelex</hi> was the Founder of it, from whom it was called <hi>Lelegia,</hi> it not receiving the Title of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> till in <hi>Lacedemon</hi>'s time, who was its fourth King. And there are others which affirm, that <hi>Cecrops</hi> the Founder of <hi>Athens</hi> was likewise the Founder of <hi>Sparta.</hi> It is by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that there was never any People in the whole World more skill'd in Politicks, than the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> We have one famous Instance of this, and which seems to be almost a Prodigy, <hi>viz.</hi> That one and the same Government should be under two Kings at the same time, and so united to each other in their Interests, as to last above 800 years together under that Form. And 'tis manifest, that after this Government of two Kings ceased, both the Glory and Grandeur of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> began to decline.</p>
                  <p>As Authors agree not about the Founder of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, so neither do they agree about the Time wherein it was founded, nor about the Number of their first Kings. All things were so obscurely handed down to us before the first Olympiad, that Chronology and History too must needs be very imperfect.

                     <p>Before we proceed to give you an Account of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> it will not be amiss to speak something of the Wars which happened between the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and the <hi>Messenians.</hi> The first War broke out in the second year of the ninth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> being in the year of the World 3207, before <hi>Christ</hi> 643. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were offended that <hi>Ctesphontes</hi> had treacherously seized upon the Territories of <hi>Messina,</hi> by defrauding his Nephews of their Right thereto. The Enmity increased by the Battel fought at the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> wherein <hi>Teleclus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Alemenes</hi> who was then King, was killed. At last they came to an open Rupture, and the War was for many years together car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with doubtful Success on each side. At last the <hi>Messenians,</hi> whose Country was the Seat of War, seeing themselves almost ruined by the Difficulties under which they struggled, thought fit to evacuate all the Towns which lay farthest off the Sea, and to retire to the Mountain <hi>Ithomene.</hi> After this Retreat, there was a Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Arms on both sides for some years together. But the eighth year after, the War broke out afresh
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55246:178"/>
between the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Messenians,</hi> and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with doubtful Success, sometime one, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the other, getting the better. In the first Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Messenians</hi> lost their King <hi>Euphaes,</hi> in whose stead <hi>Aristodemus</hi> was elected: But in the second, being assisted by the <hi>Arcadians, Argives,</hi> and <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> they won the Battel. Now the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of Success, and both they and the <hi>Messenians</hi> sent to enquire of the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> about the Event of the War. The Oracle favoured the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who besieged <hi>Ithomene,</hi> and took it from the <hi>Messenians,</hi> who became subject to the <hi>Spartans.</hi> Whilst this War lasted, 'tis said, that the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> for fear their Nation should decrease, detached 50 of the most robust young Men in their Army, and sent them into <hi>Sparta</hi> to get the young Women with Child. The Offspring of these Virgins, (being from them, which in the <hi>Greek</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, called <hi>Parthenians,</hi>) when they were grown up, were slighted, and no body would own them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this, they join'd in an Insurrection with the <hi>Helots,</hi> but being overcome, were forced to remove thence, went into <hi>Italy</hi> under the Conduct of one <hi>Phalantus,</hi> where they built <hi>Tarentum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Messenians</hi> were at last so uneasie under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> that they revolted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in another War which lasted 18 years; in the issue, the <hi>Messenians</hi> were conquered, fled into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there built <hi>Messina,</hi> which still bears the same Name. We now proceed to the succeeding Kings.</p>

                     <p>The Ambition of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and the Moderation of <hi>Aristides</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> occasioned the Associated <hi>Greeks</hi> to translate the Sovereign Administration of their Affairs from the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to the <hi>Athenians</hi>; and to these last they committed the chief Care of carrying on the War against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and of driving them out of <hi>Greece.</hi>

All <hi>Greece</hi> was engaged in this Quarrel, some siding with this, some with that Party; but most espoused the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> The Allies of the latter met at the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and under the Command of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> King, invaded <hi>Attica.</hi> The <hi>Athenians,</hi> to give them a Diversion, sent some Forces into <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus</hi> to ravage that Country, and having driven out the Inhabitants of <hi>Aegina,</hi> put a Colony of their own Men into that Place. The next Campagne <hi>Archidamus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Attoca,</hi> where a deadly Plague laid the whole Country waste, of which great Numbers, among the rest <hi>Pericles</hi> the first Author of this War, died.

They became Masters of the Island <hi>Sphacteria,</hi> over-against the Promontory, which they thought would facilitate their Design. But the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> coming upon them with a greater Fleet, block'd up the <hi>Spartan</hi> Fleet in Port, and by this means laid Siege to the Besiegers. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to <hi>Athens</hi> to treat about a Truce, but none they would grant; whereupon those who were in the Island were forced to surrender upon Discretion, and were put every Man to Death. The <hi>Athenians</hi> puffed up with this Success, refused to make Peace, thô upon very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Terms, but soon repented of their Folly. For within a while after they received two great Defeats, the one at <hi>Delos,</hi> and the other at <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> a Town in <hi>Thrace,</hi> where <hi>Brasidas</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> gave them great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance. At last a Peace for five years was made,

upon Condition, that the Men and Towns (some few excepted) taken on both sides should be restored.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But thô they in Honour to him say, he was a King's Son, yet the <hi>Sidonians,</hi> his Countrymen deny it, and affirm, that this <hi>Cadmus</hi> was only the King's Cook, and that he ran away with a certain Musick-Girl called <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia.</hi> His coming into <hi>Greece</hi> was about the same time that <hi>Ioshua</hi> governed <hi>Israel,</hi> so that it may be very justly supposed, that he carried a Colony of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> whom <hi>Ioshua</hi> had expelled, into <hi>Greece.</hi> Whether this or the other Account be truest, we shall not here stand to determine, thô upon very weighty Reasons the latter seems to be most probable. However, most agree, that this was the Man who first brought Letters into <hi>Greece</hi> from <hi>Phenicia.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Polydorus</hi> succeedded his Father, married the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Nycteus,</hi> by whom he had one Son <hi>Labdacus,</hi> whom at his Death he left to the Care of his Father-in-Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Labdacus</hi> succeeded. In his time <hi>Epopeus</hi> the King of <hi>Sicyonia</hi> ravished <hi>Antiope,</hi> the other Daughter of <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteus</hi>; upon which, a War broke out between them, wherein they both died of their Wounds which they received. Upon the Death of <hi>Nycteus,</hi> his Brother <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> was made <hi>Labdacus</hi>'s Governor, who administred the Government so faithfully, that <hi>Labdacus</hi> upon his Death committed his Infant Son <hi>Laius</hi> to his Care.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Laiùs</hi> succeeded his Father. In his Reign, his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Lycus</hi> having punished <hi>Antiope</hi> according as <hi>Nycteus</hi> had ordered him, was at War with her two Sons, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phion</hi>

and <hi>Zethus,</hi> and was killed by them in an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Thebes</hi> was taken by them, and the young Child <hi>Laius</hi> very narrowly escaped.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Amphion</hi> and <hi>Zethus</hi> reigned over <hi>Thebes. Amphion</hi> built Walls round <hi>Thebes,</hi> married <hi>Niobe</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and Sister of <hi>Pelops</hi>; who having a great many Children, boasted that she was a better Breeder than <hi>Latona</hi> her self, which occasioned her to lose them all. For <hi>Apollo</hi> was commanded to kill all the Males, and <hi>Diana</hi> all the Females; upon which <hi>Niobe</hi> was so stupified, that the Poets feign she was turned into a Stone. Thô this Account is rather Romance, than true History, yet we thought it would not be amiss to insert it, that so our young Reader may have some Light even in the Fictions of the Poets which he may meet with. A while after <hi>Amphion</hi> and his whole Family were cut off by the Plague; <hi>Zethus</hi> pin'd away upon the Death of his Son, whom his Wife had unfortunately killed; and these Brothers being thus removed, the <hi>Thebans</hi> restored <hi>Laius</hi> again to the Throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laius</hi> married <hi>Iocasta</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Meneceus,</hi> by whom he had a Son; but the Oracle advising him to beware of him, he bound his Feet, and exposed him in order to make him away. The infant was according to his Order exposed, but found by a Shepherd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought to <hi>Polybus</hi> King of <hi>Corinth.</hi> He took care of the Child, brought him up as his own, and cured him of the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which he had in his Feet, from whence he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oedipus.</hi> A long time after, <hi>Laius</hi> uncertain what was become of his Son, and <hi>Oedipus</hi> ignorant who were his Parents, both went to make their Enquiries at the Oracle. In <hi>Phocis</hi> they met by chance, where <hi>Laius</hi> very roughly commanding him to give the way, was killed by his Son, whose hot Blood it seems could not brook such rude Provocation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Upon the Death of <hi>Laius, Creon</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iocasta</hi> usurped the Throne, till such time as <hi>Oedipus</hi> did explain the Riddle of the Monster <hi>Sphinx.</hi> For all Travellers, who passed by where she sate, had the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle proposed to them upon these Terms, That in case they could not explain it, they should be put to Death; but whoever did, should marry <hi>Iocasta,</hi> and be King

of <hi>Thebes. Oedipus</hi> unriddled the Riddle, and married his own Mother <hi>Iocasta,</hi> after he had killed his Father: Both which he did ignorantly. At last a full Discovery was made, both of the Murder and the Incest of <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>; upon which <hi>Iocasta</hi> hanged her self, and he was kept Prisoner by his Sons, sent to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there died with King <hi>Theseus.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> the two Sons of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> agreed to reign alternately; but <hi>Eteocles</hi> being once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Throne,</hi> would not let his Brother have his Turn in the Government. Upon this, <hi>Polynices</hi> made his Apli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to <hi>Adrastus</hi> King of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> his Father-in-Law. <hi>Adrastus,</hi> to revenge the Affront, marched at the Head of an Army, and sat down before <hi>Thebes.</hi> After many dubious Skirmishes, it was agreed, That the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should determine the Quarrel by fighting a single Duel. They accordingly fought, and killed each other, but did not put an end to the Contest; for a sharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement followed, wherein the Soldiers of <hi>Adrastus</hi> were cut off, and himself rid away full speed for his Life.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Laodamas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eteocles</hi> succeeded, but being in his Minority, <hi>Creon</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iocasta</hi> was his Governor.

                     <p>This King was a very Martial Prince, warred against the <hi>Etolians,</hi> and defeated them several times.

Accordingly he besieged it, and after 7 months, with the loss of a great many Men took it by Storm, put all the <hi>Tyrians</hi> to the Sword, and burnt their City.

It must be likewise acknowledged, that all the Account we have of <hi>Italy</hi> before <hi>Romulus</hi> is very Fabulous and Precarious, and such as no Historian can rely upon. However we shall give you a short Account of what passed in <hi>Italy</hi> before those Times, thô we shall not vouch to the Truth of all that is contained therein; nor do we desire to impose any thing upon the Reader, but leave him to be a Free Thinker, and his own Judge in the Case.</p>

                           <label>3443. <hi>Tarquin</hi> being banished, the <hi>Romans</hi> resolved upon choosing no more Kings, but to elect two Consuls yearly out of the <hi>Patritians.</hi> These Consuls were elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the People in a General Assembly called <hi>Comitia Centuriata.</hi> The first Consuls were L. <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> and L. <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus.</hi> In their time <hi>Tarquin</hi> sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors from <hi>Hetruria</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; but their Proposals being rejected, they had recourse to underhand Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; by which they won over to <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Interest seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral young Noblemen, and among the rest, two of the Sons of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who conspired against the Consuls, and were beheaded. <hi>Collatinus</hi> resigned, and <hi>Valerius Popli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> was chosen Consul in his stead. About this time <hi>Tarquin</hi> brought an Army against <hi>Rome,</hi> engaged the <hi>Romans,</hi> was defeated, but <hi>Brutus</hi> the Consul was slain by <hi>Aruns</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> as he alternately fell by the Hand of <hi>Brutus. Valerius</hi> made a great many good Laws, and among the rest one, whereby two <hi>Quaestors</hi> or <hi>Publick Treasurers</hi> were created. After the Death of <hi>Brutus,</hi> he was suspected by the People of aiming at the <hi>Regal Power</hi>; but he soon removed their Jealousie, by holding an Assembly for the Election of another Consul, wherein <hi>Lucretius</hi> was chosen, but he dying a few days after, M. <hi>Horatius</hi> succeeded; in whose time the <hi>Capitol</hi> was finished, and dedicated. <hi>Valerius</hi> was chosen a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time with <hi>Lucretiùs Tricipitinus.</hi> Before this year was out, <hi>Porsenna</hi> King of <hi>Clusium</hi> espousing <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, marched against <hi>Rome,</hi> besieged it, and was very near taking it; but being at first repulsed by <hi>Horatius Cocles,</hi> and afterwards struck with Admiration at the Bravery and Undauntedness of <hi>Mutius Scaevola,</hi> and at the Courage of <hi>Clelia</hi> a <hi>Roman Virago,</hi> he made Peace with the <hi>Romans.</hi> These three noble Acts are too He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick to be passed over in Silence, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit to mention them, thô our designed Brevity will

admit of but a very short Relation; when <hi>Porsenna</hi> attack'd the City, his Onset was so vigorous, that the two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls were wounded, which so dishearten'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> that retiring in Disorder to the City, the Enemy had entred with them, if the Courage of <hi>Horatius Cocles,</hi> who alone defended the Passage of the Bridge, had not hindred them, and given an Opportunity to those that were got over to break down the Bridge; which being effected, the valiant Hero leap'd into the River, and (thô wounded) got safe over. <hi>Mutius</hi>'s Action was equally Brave, for the City being extremely straightned by <hi>Porsenna</hi>'s Siege, and other Reliefs failing, he got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Enemy's Camp in Disguise, resolving to Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the King, but by mistake he stabb'd his Secretary; and being examined, boldly declared his Intention, and with invincible Courage thrust the Hand that committed the Mistake into the Fire, in Punishment for the ill Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it did its Master. <hi>Porsenna</hi> surprized at the <hi>Roman</hi> Courage, not only pardoned <hi>Mutius,</hi> but also concluded a Peace; for ratifying of which, Hostages were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and among them ten <hi>Roman</hi> Virgins: But it seems even the Women among the <hi>Romans</hi> scorn'd to be Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for under the Conduct of <hi>Clelia,</hi> one of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, these ten Virgins got from their Keepers, swam over the <hi>Tyber,</hi> and in spight of the Enemy's Darts got safe home. Within a year or two the <hi>Sabines</hi> began to be very troublesom to the <hi>Romans,</hi> making Incursions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Territories, but were defeated by them in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Battels. In the heat of this War came <hi>Actius Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> with 5000 <hi>Sabines</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and became the Head of the <hi>Claudian Family. Tarquin</hi> still restless and dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, had his last Recourse to the <hi>Latines,</hi> whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to declare War against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and at the same time fomented the Differences which were then at <hi>Rome</hi> between the richer and the poorer sort. To obviate the Mischiefs which might arise from an Enemy abroad, and Foes at home, a particular Magistrate named the <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> was created, who for a set time should have the sole Administration of Affairs in his own Hand. This <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> was never made but upon extraordinary and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Occasions.</label>

                           <label>3453. <hi>Largius Flavius,</hi> one of the Consuls, was the first <hi>Dictator,</hi> who chose <hi>Sp. Cassius</hi> for <hi>Magister Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the <hi>Master of the Horse.</hi> He had 24 Axes and Rods carried before him, and by these Ensigns of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty aw'd the People, and quieted the Tumults of the City. He began the <hi>Census</hi> after the Pattern of <hi>Servius Tullus,</hi> wherein 150700 Persons of full Age gave in their Names; but he made a Truce with the <hi>Latines</hi> for one year. When the Truce was expired, both Parties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to take the Field. The <hi>Romans</hi> perceiving the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> were very strong, thought fit to create a second <hi>Dictator.</hi> The Choice fell upon <hi>Posthumius,</hi> who chose <hi>Ebutius Elva</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse.</hi> He hastened his Levies, marched against the <hi>Latines,</hi> engaged and defeated them near the Lake <hi>Regillus.</hi> Upon this, the <hi>Latines</hi> earnestly sued for a Peace, which was granted them. Thus ended all the Wars made upon <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Account, who being abandoned by all his Friends, fled to <hi>Aristodemus</hi> the Prince of <hi>Cuma,</hi> where he soon after died, in the 90th year of his Age.</label>

                        <p>Upon the finishing of this War, <hi>Posthumius</hi> laid down his Office, and <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> and <hi>Servilius Priscus</hi> were made Consuls. And now the Differences between the <hi>Plebeians</hi> and <hi>Patritians</hi> broke out afresh, and were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried so high, that neither the leading them to fight against the <hi>Vosci, Aequi,</hi> and <hi>Sabines,</hi> nor all the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals of the Senate, could reconcile and bring the meaner sort back from <hi>Mons Sacer,</hi> whither they were retired, till such time as they granted, that they might choose Annual Officers of their own among themselves, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them from the Injuries and Insolencies of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> The Senate was forced to comply with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and they made choice of L. <hi>Iunius Brutus, Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Bellulus,</hi> C. and P. <hi>Licinius,</hi> and <hi>Icilius Ruga,</hi> for their Officers, who were called <hi>Tribunes of the People.</hi> They were at first only <hi>Five,</hi> but at last their Number increased to <hi>Ten,</hi> who in time grew so Exorbitant, that

by some Authors they were stiled <hi>Pestes Reipublicae.</hi> This remarkable Change of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, from <hi>Aristocracy</hi> to <hi>Democracy,</hi> or rather to a mixture of both, happened in the 260th year of the City, 46th after the beginning of the <hi>Persian Monarchy,</hi> and in the 3d year of the 71st <hi>Olympiad.</hi>

The Office of <hi>Tribunes</hi> being ratified by the <hi>Senate,</hi> the Commons obtained farther, that they might choose <hi>Two</hi> out of their own Body yearly to assist these Officers; which Assistants were afterwards called <hi>Aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> Upon these Grants made, the Commons readily Listed themselves to march against the <hi>Volsci,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Posthumius</hi> the Consul. He took <hi>Longula</hi> and <hi>Polustia</hi> from them, and invested their Metropolis <hi>Corioli,</hi> which was taken by Storm through the Bravery of a valiant <hi>Patritian</hi> named <hi>Caius Marcius,</hi> who from thence was Sirnamed <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> Upon this, and the Defeat of the <hi>Antiates,</hi> who came to the Relief of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioli,</hi> the <hi>Volsci</hi> were forced to make Peace.

                        <p>After this, the <hi>Romans</hi> were engaged in several Wars abroad with the <hi>Volsci, Hernici, Aequi, Veientes, Hetru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and <hi>Sabines</hi>; we shall not relate the Particulars of each, but only in General take notice, that in some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements the <hi>Romans</hi> were worsted, in most came off Conquerors, and forced their Enemies to make Peace.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55246:201"/>
At home there happened great Disturbances within this Period of Time, the most Remarkable of which, with some other considerable Things, we think fit briefly to relate. The first Disturbance arose from the <hi>Lex Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> the Law for dividing the Conquered Lands among the Meaner sort, which was the occasion of many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Mischiefs for many years together. It was at first proposed by <hi>Cassius,</hi> thrice Consul, who aimed at the Sovereignty, and promised to be put into Execution by the Senate, who waved the doing it for a great many years: But at last <hi>Cassius,</hi> when out of his Consulship, was called to an Account for his Ambition, and was condemned to be thrown down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, which was accordingly done. The next great Disturbance happened upon the account of one <hi>Volero,</hi> a turbulent Man, who when made <hi>Tribune</hi> to revenge an Affront offered him by the Consuls, who would some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have listed him for a Common Soldier, was a great Instrument of passing a Law for the Establishing the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia Tributa.</hi> Within this time the whole Family of the <hi>Fabii,</hi> who undertook to defend the <hi>Roman</hi> Frontiers, and had posted themselves in a Castle called <hi>Cremera,</hi> were all cut off by the Enemy. <hi>Quintius Cincinnatus</hi> was taken from the Plow, first made Consul, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year made <hi>Dictator</hi>; in both which Posts he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself with a great deal of Prudence, Conduct, and Courage. Within the same compass of time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened first a Famine, and then a Plague at <hi>Rome,</hi> which cut off a great many of the Inhabitants. At last they sent Ambassadors to <hi>Greece,</hi> to bring such Laws from thence as were most Excellent and most Conducive to the Good of the Commonwealth. Upon their Return the <hi>Decemviri</hi> were created, who were ten Men to be Elected yearly out of the Chief of the Senate. Upon this the Consuls elect resigned, and were made two of the <hi>Decemvirate,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes, Aediles, Questors, &amp;c.</hi> were divested of all their Authority. This notable Change of the <hi>Roman</hi> State happened in the 302d year of the City, in the 2d year of the 82d <hi>Olympiad,</hi> 88 years after the beginning of the <hi>Persian Monarchy,</hi> and 450 years before <hi>Christ.</hi>

At first they governed with so much Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Moderation, and Equity, that the People were charmed with their Conduct and Administration; but they soon degenerated to Tyranny and Oppression, which occasioned the short Duration of their Power. The first Set of these <hi>Decemviri</hi> reduced the Laws brought from <hi>Greece,</hi> with some Additions of their own Customs into ten Tables, and the next <hi>Decemviri</hi> added two Tables more, from whence they were called, <hi>The Laws of the Twelve Tables,</hi> so much talked of by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Authors.</label>

                        <p>The <hi>Decemvirate</hi> regarded neither Senate nor People, but cut off the most considerable Citizens of both sorts. Among the rest, <hi>Siccius Dentatus,</hi> the <hi>Roman Achilles,</hi> was killed traiterously by a Party of 100 Horse, which he headed against the <hi>Sabines.</hi> At last <hi>Appius,</hi> one of the <hi>Decemvirate,</hi> attempting to abuse the Daughter of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> hasten'd the Downfal of that Form of Government, which ended in less than 3 years time, and returned to its former State of being governed by Consuls. <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Horatius</hi> were made Consuls for the remaining part of the year. After which, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> thought fit to call the <hi>Decemviri</hi> to an Account. <hi>Appius</hi> was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Prison, and before his Trial was found dead. <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> the next to him in Guilt, was accused, condemned, and killed himself in Prison. The other Eight banished themselves. This year the Consuls warred so successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the <hi>Aequi, Volsci,</hi> and <hi>Sabines,</hi> as to deserve a Triumph. Within 3 years after the <hi>Romans</hi> obtained another signal Victory over the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Volsci.</hi> And now the <hi>Tribunes</hi> being more turbulent than ever, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would satisfie them but the passing two Laws, the one for permitting Marriages between <hi>Patritians</hi> and <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians,</hi>
                           <pb n="385" facs="tcp:55246:202"/>
and the other for making the <hi>Plebeians</hi> capable of the Consulship. The first was passed; but as an Expedient for the other, it was proposed, That six Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors should be chosen with <hi>Consular Authority,</hi> three <hi>Patritians,</hi> and three <hi>Plebeians,</hi> who were stiled <hi>Tribuni Militum,</hi> i. e. <hi>Military Tribunes.</hi>

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55246:205"/>
into Obedience and an Alliance with the <hi>Romans.</hi> After this, the <hi>Romans</hi> having learned from the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to build Galleys, sent out a Fleet of about 120 Sail, which engaged the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, and defeated them. This first Victory by Sea was gained by <hi>Duilius,</hi> one of the Consuls, who afterwards raised the Siege of <hi>Aegesta,</hi> and took <hi>Macella</hi> by Storm. The next year they invaded the Islands of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> which they took from <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General, who was slain there: Many Towns in <hi>Sicily</hi> were taken and lost on both Sides. After this, the <hi>Romans</hi> resolved to remove the Seat of War into <hi>Africk,</hi> set out a Fleet of 330 Sail under the Command of <hi>Regulus</hi> and <hi>Manlius,</hi> Consuls; <hi>Regulus</hi> defeated the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> a second time by Sea, made a Descent upon <hi>Affrick,</hi> and became Master of <hi>Clupea,</hi> a City seated on the Promontory of <hi>Hermea.

                        <p>Notwithstanding these Wars with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> proclaimed and carried on a War against <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi>: In <hi>Sardinia</hi> they had great Success, killing in one Battel 12000 <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> taking many Prisoners, among the rest <hi>Asdrubal, Hanno,</hi> and <hi>Mago,</hi> Persons of Note. <hi>Sicily</hi> revolted from the <hi>Romans,</hi> but

The chief Fomenter of these, was <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> a Man of a restless and turbulent Temper. He being made <hi>Tribune,</hi> preferred a Law, forbidding any Man to possess above 500 Acres of the Publick Lands, and ordering the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus to be divided amongst the Poor.

                        <p>Whilst <hi>Pompey</hi> was abroad, a horrid Conspiracy was carried on at home by <hi>Catiline</hi> and his Accomplices, which was discovered to <hi>Cicero</hi> the present Consul by <hi>Fulvia</hi> the Courtesan of <hi>Q. Curius,</hi> one of the Plotters. Upon this, <hi>Catiline</hi> was banished, several of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators apprehended and put to Death, and the whole Plot was quashed by the Vigilance and Care of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was the first Man that was stiled the <hi>Father of his Country.</hi> After these Disturbances, <hi>Cesar,</hi> who had been <hi>Questor</hi> and <hi>Aedile,</hi> was made <hi>Pretor,</hi> and afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the High-Priesthood. Upon the expiring of his Pretorship, he procured the Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon <hi>Crassus,</hi> a wealthy Man, to be his Security for 830 Talents; having run so far in Debt by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness, returned to <hi>Italy,</hi> stood for the Consulship, and entred into a Combination with <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> who were stiled the first <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and managed the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Rome</hi> at their Discretion.</p>

We are now arrived to that part of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Affairs, which make up a great part of their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but yet to keep to our proposed Brevity, we shall relate only the principal Matters, and that as briefly as possible. The first Effect of this <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> was the promoting <hi>Cesar</hi> to the Consulship, one <hi>Bibulus</hi> being his Collegue. As soon as <hi>Cesar</hi> was Cousul, he confirmed all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Acts, won the Commonalty over to him, by preferring and enacting a Law for dividing certain Lands in <hi>Campania</hi> among such poor Citizens as had three Children or more, procured the Province of <hi>Gaul</hi> to be assigned him for 5 years, and accordingly at the end of his Consulship marched thither with four Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</label>

                        <p>
                           <pb n="400" facs="tcp:55246:210"/>Before he went away, he married his Daughter <hi>Iulia</hi> to <hi>Pompey,</hi> procured his two Friends, <hi>Gabinius</hi> and <hi>Piso,</hi> to be made Consuls, and <hi>Clodius</hi> one of the Tribunes. In his Absence, <hi>Cicero</hi> was banished by the Instigation of <hi>Clodius,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> sent against <hi>Ptolemy</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s first Enterprize was against the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> whom he defeated, and killed near 200000 of them. After this he turned his Forces against <hi>Ariovistus</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> who had molested the <hi>Sequanians,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Allies, had an Interview with him, came to an Engagement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him, killing about 80000 <hi>Germans</hi> upon the Spot.</p>
                        <p>The next year <hi>Cesar</hi> marched against the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who had confederated against the <hi>Romans,</hi> gave them Battel, defeated them, and the rest bordering upon the Sea-Coast, yielded. After this, he led his Army against the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> and cut them all in Pieces. Upon the News of these Victories, the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> decreed a solemn Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival for 15 Days, and this year <hi>Cicero</hi> was recalled from Banishment.</p>
                        <p>The next Spring <hi>Cesar</hi> designing for <hi>Italy,</hi> sent out <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Galba,</hi> one of his Lieutenants, against the <hi>Antuates, Veragres,</hi> and <hi>Seduni,</hi> whom within a short time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. Soon after his return from <hi>Italy,</hi> he marched against the <hi>Veneti</hi> and subdued them, and about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the Campagn went against the <hi>Morini</hi> and <hi>Menapii,</hi> but did nothing against them. In the mean time <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Sabinus,</hi> two of his Lieutenants, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the one the <hi>Sontiates,</hi> and the other the <hi>Vnelli.</hi> This Winter <hi>Cesar</hi> went to <hi>Italy,</hi> took up his Head Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Lucca,</hi> where the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> entred upon new Measures, and <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> being made Consuls, continued <hi>Cesar</hi> five years longer in his Government in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and assigned <hi>Syria</hi> and the <hi>Parthian</hi> War to <hi>Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Pompey.</hi> And by this time <hi>Cesar</hi> had got wherewithal to pay his Debts, and make Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to his Friends.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth year of <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Expedition, he fought an Army of <hi>Germans,</hi> being 430000 strong, defeated them entirely, cast a Bridge over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> relieved the <hi>Vbii,</hi> returned and crossed the Seas to <hi>Britain,</hi> made them submit, and returned again to <hi>Gaul</hi>; and reduced the <hi>Morini</hi> and <hi>Menapians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="401" facs="tcp:55246:210"/>The next year he crossed again into <hi>Britain,</hi> gave them Battel; defeated them, and their General <hi>Cassive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> sent to him for a Treaty. Upon his return into <hi>Gaul,</hi> he relieved Q. <hi>Cicero,</hi> one of his Lieutenants, who was besieged by the <hi>Eburones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The sixth Campagne, <hi>Cesar</hi> reinforcing his Army with three Legions more, and as many Auxiliaries as he could get, subdued the <hi>Nervii, Senones, Carnutes,</hi> and <hi>Menapii</hi>; crossed the <hi>Rhine</hi> a second time; marched against the <hi>Suevi</hi>; turned his Arms against the <hi>Eburones</hi>; returned to <hi>Gaul,</hi> and put the <hi>Sicambri</hi> to flight, who had set upon <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Camp. After this, he fell afresh upon the <hi>Eburones,</hi> and then called a Council in <hi>Gaul</hi> to punish all Revolters, and for the supplying his Army with Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
                        <p>Whilst <hi>Cesar</hi> was thus Successful in <hi>Gaul, Crassus</hi> raised his Levies for the <hi>Parthian</hi> War; in his Journey marched through <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; rifled the Temple of its Treasure to the value of 10000 Talents; fell upon the <hi>Parthians,</hi> but was routed and killed by them. Thus fell <hi>Crassus</hi> one of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and by this means gave rise to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests between the other two, which soon after ensued. <hi>Pompey</hi> kept at <hi>Rome,</hi> and did all he could to lessen <hi>Cesar,</hi> and to raise his own Esteem.</p>
                        <p>After the Death of <hi>Crassus,</hi> great Contests happened in <hi>Rome; Clodius</hi> was killed by his great Enemy <hi>Milo,</hi> and <hi>Milo</hi> was banished to <hi>Marseilles. Pompey</hi> was made Consul alone, and afterwards took <hi>Scipio Metellus</hi> for his Collegue, having lately married his Daughter <hi>Cornelia.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Caesar</hi> carried on his Conquests in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and in two years time compleated them: He put in for the Consulship in his absence, but was opposed by <hi>Pompey,</hi> who made two Laws particularly levelled against him; after which, <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Enemies proposed to recal him from his Government, which was violently opposed by <hi>Curio,</hi> who with <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Longinus</hi> fled to him disguised like Slaves. Upon this, the famous Civil War between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Cesar</hi> broke out, which lasted two years, and ended by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Death. For <hi>Caesar</hi> leaving his Province without Leave of the Senate, passed the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon,</hi> became Master of <hi>Ariminum</hi> by Surprize; which put <hi>Rome</hi> into so much Disorder, that <hi>Pompey</hi> with the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55246:211"/>
Consuls and Senate retired to <hi>Capua,</hi> and thence to <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium.</hi> After this, <hi>Labienus</hi> upon some Disgust left <hi>Cesar,</hi> and went over to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party. <hi>Cesar</hi> advancing, took the Towns of <hi>Picenum,</hi> which lay in his way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Master of all that Province. Then he marched against <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who had possessed himself of <hi>Asculum</hi>; but upon his Arrival, retreated from the Place. The next Town he invested was <hi>Corfinium,</hi> which, after some time and resistance, he took, <hi>Domitius</hi> being taken, and <hi>Lentulus</hi> coming out to <hi>Caesar,</hi> begg'd his Pardon. After this, he marched directly to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> blocked up the Place and took it, <hi>Pompey</hi> retreating with his Forces to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> a City in <hi>Epirus,</hi> to which Town the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls were already gon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Caesar</hi> being now Master of all <hi>Italy,</hi> but not in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to pursue <hi>Pompey</hi> for want of Shipping, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to settle some sort of Government. He there fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the Senate, seized upon the Treasury for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the War, and soon after went to <hi>Spain.</hi> He drave thence <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius,</hi> two of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, became Master of all <hi>Spain,</hi> and took <hi>Marseilles,</hi> which was held out against him by <hi>Domitius.</hi> Upon his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he was made <hi>Dictator,</hi> but having made several Laws, laid down that Office in 11 days time.</p>
                        <p>After this, <hi>Cesar</hi> undertook his Expedition against <hi>Pompey,</hi> rendevouz'd at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> he shipp'd off five of his twelve Legions, and sailed to <hi>Epirus.</hi> At last being joined with the rest of his Forces, he marched towards <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> where he besieged <hi>Pompey</hi> in his Camp, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to break up, came to an Engagement, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by him, and had been irrecoverably lost, had <hi>Pompey</hi> known how to have made good use of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. But he giving <hi>Caesar</hi> time to recover himself, the Decisive Battel was fought in the Plains of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> wherein the two greatest Generals of the World dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Universal Empire. The Engagement was sharp on both Sides, but at last <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, himself forced to fly from Place to Place, at length to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where upon his Landing he was treacherously killed by <hi>Achillas,</hi> and <hi>Septimius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Tribune. Thus fell this great Man, and by him fell the second Head of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> leaving <hi>Caesar</hi> to be sole
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55246:211"/>
Master of <hi>Rome.</hi> This happened in the 706th year of the City, and 46 years before <hi>Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the Fight at <hi>Pharsalia, Cesar</hi> followed <hi>Pompey</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he heard of his Death, caused a stately Sepulchre to be built by the Place where he had been murder'd, with a Temple, which he called the <hi>Temple of Wrath.</hi> He then went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Interest, worsted <hi>Photinus,</hi> Administrator of the Government, and by firing <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Fleet, burnt down the famous <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Library, wherein (as some report) were 700000 Volumes. At the beginning of this Expedition, the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> made him <hi>Consul</hi> for 5 years together, <hi>Dictator</hi> for a whole year, and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune</hi> for his Life. After this, he marched from <hi>Egypt</hi> against <hi>Pharnaces</hi> King of <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> whom he subdued so soon, that in writing to <hi>Anicius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Celerity of this Expedition in three words, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici.</hi> Upon this he embarked for <hi>Italy,</hi> and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was scarce arrived, but called away again to subdue the Remains of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, who had rallied themselves in <hi>Africk</hi> under <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Iuba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> Against these he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a Decisive Battel put an end to the <hi>Pompeian</hi> Faction on that side the Water; after which Defeat, <hi>Cato</hi> killed himself at <hi>Vtica; Iuba</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> killed each other in Despair; <hi>Afranius, Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> fell into the Hands of <hi>Sitius,</hi> one of <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Lieutenants, and were likewise killed. Upon this, <hi>Cesar</hi> returned in great Triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> which lasted 4 days. On the first, he triumphed over <hi>Gaul</hi>; on the second, over <hi>Egypt</hi>; on the third, over <hi>Pharnaces</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi>; and on the fourth, over <hi>Iuba.</hi> After this, he paid his Soldiers, made large Distributions of Corn and Oyl amongst the People, and entertained all Comers at 22000 Tables. Upon this he was made <hi>Master of Manners,</hi> committed the Power of Judicature to the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Equites,</hi> enacted several Laws, and regulated the <hi>Roman</hi> year; which Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we still follow, calling it the <hi>Iulian Account,</hi> and the <hi>Old Stile.</hi> Whilst <hi>Cesar</hi> was doing this at home, he was called away afresh to <hi>Spain,</hi> to subdue the two Sons of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who had raised a great Party against him there. He went with the Character of <hi>Dictator</hi>: soon reduced

                           <hi>Spain,</hi> killed <hi>Cneius Pompey,</hi> but his Brother <hi>Sextus</hi> escaped. He returned to <hi>Rome</hi> and triumphed, thô a little ungratefully to some of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends. Upon his return, he was made <hi>Consul</hi> for 10 years, <hi>Perpetual Dictator,</hi> and <hi>Censor</hi> during Life; stiled <hi>Deliverer,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Imperator,</hi> then <hi>Father</hi> of his Country.</p>

                     <p>No sooner was <hi>Cesar</hi> advanced to this Honour, but he made several Alterations in the Government.

                     <p>Several of the Senators were offended at his Ambition, which they gratified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t first, by heaping new Honours upon him, in order to make him fall the more glorious Victim. The first Disgust they took, was, that when they waited upon him in a full Body to the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> where he was, he rose not up, but received them sitting. The next Offence <hi>Cesar</hi> gave both Senate and People, was his displacing the <hi>Tribunes</hi> for imprisoning some Persons, who put Diadems upon his Statues. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indication of his Aim, appeared in his Behaviour at the Celebration of the Feasts called <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> wherein <hi>Anthony</hi> offering him a Crown, he finding the People not so well pleased at it, as he presumed they would have been, refused it twice. These and such-like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Cesar</hi> incensing the Senate against him, above 60 of the Senators conspired to kill him, the chief of whom were <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> two <hi>Praetors.</hi> One day being invited to the Senate, under a Pretence of doing him farther Honour, he went to the House, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Caution given him by <hi>Spurina</hi> the famous Augur, to beware of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the frightful and ominous Dreams of himself and his Wife <hi>Calpurnia.</hi> No sooner was he seated, but the Assassines fell upon him, and with 23 Wounds killed him; who expiring, sunk down at the foot of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue. Thus fell the Great <hi>Iulius Cesar,</hi> in the 56th year of his Age, the 4th year of his Government, the 43d year before <hi>Christ,</hi> the 710th year of the City, and the year of the World 3907.

Senate, which being assembled, an Act of <hi>Oblivion</hi> passed, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s <hi>Ordinances</hi> were ratified, and all Things seemed quiet for the present. The next day <hi>Anthony</hi> ordered <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Will to be read to the People, wherein he adopted his Sister's Grandson, made him Heir of three Fourths of all his Estate, and <hi>Pinarius</hi> and <hi>Pedius</hi> of the other 4th Part. To the <hi>Romans</hi> he bequeathed his rich Gardens, and to every Citizen a certain Sum of Money. Among his second Heirs, <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> one of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, was named. This raised the People's Indignation against the Conspirators, and their Affection to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Immediately after, his Body was brought out, and burnt on a sumptuous Pile, <hi>Anthony</hi> making his Funeral Oration, wherein he extolled the Merit of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and heighten'd the People's Passion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the Fall of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> the <hi>Triumviri</hi> began to act as Sovereigns, and to divide the <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions between them. Several days after the Victory were spent in punishing their Enemies; after which, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> undertook to go into <hi>Asia</hi> to raise Money for the Soldiers Rewards; and <hi>Octavius</hi> to lead the old Troops into <hi>Italy,</hi> to put them in Possession of the Lands that were promised them. <hi>Anthony</hi> first visited <hi>Greece,</hi> then made his Progress through <hi>Asia,</hi> where he squeezed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from them, and all the Princes of the East, who were dependent on the <hi>Roman</hi> State, waited upon him. Several of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Party surrendred themselves to him, who were all Pardoned, except such as had imbrued their Hands in the Blood of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Whilst he was in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> he cited <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>Egypt</hi> thither, who waited upon him in Person, diverted him from Revenge, charmed his Heart, and made him follow her to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> where having sacrificed her Sister <hi>Arsin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

strong City of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> where being closely besieged by <hi>Octavius,</hi> he was constrained to surrender himself. Thus ended this Dangerous War in a few months time, and <hi>Octavius</hi> returned in Triumph to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> had two little Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, but were reconciled first by <hi>Pollio</hi> on <hi>Anthony</hi>'s side, and <hi>Maecenas</hi> on <hi>Octavius</hi>'s; afterwards by the Mediation of <hi>Octavia,</hi> Sister to <hi>Octavius,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Anthony. Anthony</hi> first sent <hi>Ventidius,</hi> then marched himself in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> whom he subdued, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled several Kings in the East: And whilst he was thus employed, <hi>Octavius,</hi> with the Assistance of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> routed <hi>Pompey</hi> by Sea, and outed him of all <hi>Sicily; Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> having before revolted to <hi>Octavius.</hi> But <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> aiming to get all <hi>Sicily</hi> under his Command, was turned out thence, and banished by <hi>Octavius</hi> to <hi>Cyrceum.</hi> Thus fell one Head of the second <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> soon after, who had fled for Sanctuary to <hi>Anthony,</hi> was slain by his Order in <hi>Phrygia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the Banishment of <hi>Lepidus, Rome</hi> began to take Breath, and <hi>Octavius</hi> was received into the City with a general Joy. The first thing he did, was the clearing <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> of the Robbers, who of late had been very troublesome to both. Among <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Papers, were several Letters a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> Memoirs of the Chief Senators, enough to have occasioned new Disturbances, which <hi>Octavius</hi> generously brought into the <hi>Forum,</hi> and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt them, protesting, that with them he sacrificed all his Private Resentments for the Publick Good. This Generous Act endear'd the People so far to him, that they made him <hi>Tribune</hi> for Life. Having disposed of the Government of the Provinces, he marched against the <hi>Illyrians.</hi> And now <hi>Anthony</hi> by his Debaucheries with, and his Prodigal Liberality to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> began to grow Odious to the <hi>Romans.</hi> He marched against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> but with such ill Success, that he was forced with the loss of the fourth part of his Troops, and all his Baggage, to save himself in <hi>Armenia.</hi> Another thing which gave Disgust to the <hi>Romans,</hi> was his leading <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> in Triumph into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which they looked upon as a notorious Affront offered by a <hi>Roman</hi> General to <hi>Rome,</hi> which for so many years
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55246:214"/>
had enjoyed that Honour peculiar to her self alone. These Miscarriages <hi>Octavius</hi> took advantage of to raise his own, and to lessen the Esteem of <hi>Anthony</hi>; but had no fair opportunity of declaring War against him, till he was justly excited by the Affront which he offered to his Wife <hi>Octavia, Caesar</hi>'s Sister, whom by the Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> he sent back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> without so much as seeing her, thô in Person he waited on <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Affront so provoked <hi>Octavius,</hi> that he thought of nothing but Revenge; and after he had ended his Wars with the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> he made Preparations for his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against <hi>Anthony,</hi> and proclaimed War against him. At last <hi>Anthony</hi> marched as far as <hi>Actium,</hi> a Town on the Coasts of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Cesar</hi> embarked at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> crossed the Seas, and surprized <hi>Toryne,</hi> a City near <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi> After this, they had an Engagement by Sea, wherein <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fleet was conquered, which Victory was followed by the total Revolt of all his Land-Forces, who submitted to <hi>Cesar,</hi> and were all spared by him, except some few who had been his professed Enemies. Upon this Defeat, <hi>Anthony</hi> declined in his Fortune, shut himself up in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and at last by the Desertion of his own Troops, and the Success of <hi>Caesar,</hi> he grew so desperate, as to lay violent Hands upon himself. Thus fell the second Head of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> leaving <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Caesar</hi> the sole Master of all the <hi>Roman</hi> State; which happened in the 724th year of the City, the 3d of the 187th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and 28th before <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the death of <hi>Anthony, Cesar</hi> sent to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to assure her of his Kindness and Generosity; but she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <hi>Proculus,</hi> his Messenger, admittance into the Place, where she had lock'd her self up with her two Maids. Afterwards being surprized, and taken by <hi>Proculus, Caesar</hi> gave her a Visit; but she understanding by <hi>Dolabella,</hi> that he intended within three Days time to send her and her Children to <hi>Rome</hi> to grace his Triumph, killed her self, by applying an Asp to her Wrist. Before she did this, she sent a Letter to <hi>Octavius,</hi> desiring she might be interred in the same Tomb with <hi>Anthony,</hi> which was accordingly done. By her Death, <hi>Egypt</hi> was reduced to a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, and <hi>Caesario,</hi> the Son she had by
