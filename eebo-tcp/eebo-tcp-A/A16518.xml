            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The fyrſt cauſe was, for their noble actes and deedes in the defending of their Country againſt their enemies. &amp;c.<note place="margin">The fyrſt cauſe.</note> So by that meanes, for their valiantneſſe againſt their enemies, they were extolled and aduanced vnto high dignitie, euerye perſon according vnto his deſertes, and had lyuings to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne their ſtate, and they to defend their Territories whileſt the common people dyd manure and tyll the ground.</p>
                  <p>And the ſecond cauſe in degrees of nobilytie and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe.</note> was to them that made good and wholſome lawes for the good gouernement of their common weales.

And alſo in my opinion, they are very neceſſary members in the common weale in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb facs="tcp:4923:8"/>
reſpectes, that are Trauaylers into other Countries, and they are able to profyt theyr owne Countrie in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes: for that hee is able to geue iudgement by his owne Countrie of other, whether it bee as touching the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common weale, in the executing of their lawes of the manner of traffick, and in the vſage and nature of the people, bothe in their Cities and Townes, and in their Countrie, and what manner of commodities they haue, and of the ſituation of their Townes, and in their fortifycation, and alſo of what ſtrength and force other Princes and ſtates are of, and of the order and manner of vſyng them ſelues in martial affayres in the warres, and what their Artillerie is, and how they are weaponed and armed, and furniſhed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery reſpect, which is very neceſſarie to bee knowne vnto the nobilitie, for that they may prouide them ſelues, and their Countrie for their better ſafetie, and alſo they ſhall knowe what thing ſhall annoy their enemies moſt.</p>
                  <p>Then it is a playne caſe, that Trauailers into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treies doo much profyte the common weale. For ſuppoſe this, that if we, or any Country dyd liue in that order, that we did trauaile into no place or Countrie, neither no nation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, then in proceſſe of time wee ſhould beecome barbarous and ſauage.

Wherefore I wyll ſhewe you my opinion, what manner of people are meeteſt to bee trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. For a number of people haue trauayled, and when they haue come home, they haue had no iudgement of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, but haue beene vtterly ignoraunt of ſuche thinges as were moſt meeteſt of a Trauailer to be noted, and partlye ſome of them were not capable in thoſe cauſes,<note place="margin">What maner of perſons are the meeteſt to be Trauai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers.</note> and ſome of them many times, their heades are occupied with other vaine and fooliſh cauſes. &amp;c. as this fyrſt: thoſe people that are able to benefyt their country by their trauaile, when they are come home, ought not to bee to young: for commonlye a young man his head is occupyed with euery vaine and light cauſe,

as with banketting, and play, and game, &amp; daunſing, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying with women, and gazing vpon vaine toyes. &amp;c. So that his head is occupyed with no other thing, but all pleaſaunt matters.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he that is ſent to be a Trauailer,<note place="margin">What a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailer ſhould conſider of.</note> to the ende to profyt his Country, ought to be a man that hath a ſtayed &amp; a modeſt head, and ſuch a one as is capable, and hath a good witte with him, and learned. And if hee bee ſeene in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Science, it is all the better: For then hee ſhall the ſooner conceaue any matter. And alſo he ought not to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to young nor to olde, but betweene the age of .40. and 56. or 57. yeares. &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:4923:47"/>
I haue thought it good, to aſſigne the Citie of London to be the place appoynted, how farre ſundrye notable Cities and Townes, and other places worthy of memorye are from the citie of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both their diſtance in miles, &amp; vnto what quarter of the world they doe beare from the Citie of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, according to their longitude and latirude, accordingly as ſundrye authors haue ſet downe their longitude and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: and alſo there is contayned in this ſecond Booke, the diuerſitie aſpecte, that is to ſaye, how much that the Moone ſhall change rather or later, then it doth at London, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the Longitude of the places that are mentioned in this ſecond Booke: and alſo the length of the longeſt Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day at the places named in this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Booke, according vnto the latitudes of the places ſette downe in this ſeconde Booke. And for that there is no perſon that hath trauailed generally through the face of the whole earth, therefore they muſt needes of force folowe ſuch authours, as haue written therof, whether they be true or not: and therefore you muſt needs take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they be, for otherwiſe I know not how it is poſſible for to doe it, but onely to folowe the beſt and moſt Learned authors that haue written in thoſe cauſes. And yet the learned men that haue bene afore time, muſt of force folow thoſe that haue giuen vnto them the notes of the longi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude and the Latitudes of any places that they haue not bene at them ſelues, whether they be true or not. And there bee a number of perſons, who if they doe fynde but a ſmall fault in any Booke, then by that meanes they will goe about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the whole matter, often repeatinge the matter, yf they doe fynde any errour in it: as who ſhoulde ſaye, what a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man he is, although in all the reſt of the whole booke, hee is not able to ſay any thing thereunto.

For as touching the longitude and the latitude of places, men muſt credit thoſe that haue beene there, for the trueth of the matter: and yet euery man that hath bene at any place, cannot do it, for the .100. perſon that hath trauailed vnto places, is not able to take the true latitude, but much leſſe the longitude of any place. And furthermore, as touching the true diſtaunce vnto any place aſſigned, that cannot bee by any one poynt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, as is declared in this Booke. &amp;c.

For the next way ouer the Sea and the Land, vnto any place, is to goe by the great circle which is equall vnto the Equinoctiall or the Meridian circle, which will not be according vnto any one poynt of the compaſſe, but vnto dyuers: as for proofe thereof you ſhall haue this for an enſample thus:<note place="margin">An enſample.</note> that in the latitude of .60. degrees that there were two Townes or places in that paralell, the one being oppoſite or right againſt the other, that is .180. degrees, and a degree in that paralel doth containe .30. myles. And nowe

to goe iuſt Eaſt or Weſt in that paralel, to come vnto the place aſſigned, it is .5400 myles: as for proofe therof, multiply .180. tymes .30. but that is not the next way vnto the place aſſygned: but the next way is to goe by the Merydian lyne, that is to ſay, to goe due North, vntill you do come ryght vnder the pole, and then to goe by that Merydian, due South, tyll you haue that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude agayne: and then it is but .3600. myles, as you may knowe by playne multiplycation, as it is from the latitude of .90. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, vnto the pole, to go due North .30. degrees, and from the pole, Southward agayne, other .30. degrees, that is in all .60. degrees: and then to multyply .60. tymes .60. it ſheweth the true dyſtance, which is but .3600. myles. And to goe by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell lyne, that is due Eaſt or Weſt, then it is .5400. myles, that is halfe ſo much more, as by playne proofe you may know.

Therefore as briefly as I may I wyll ſhewe vnto you: yet there hath famous and wyſe men written thereof in our Engliſhe tongue as <hi>M. Leonard Dygges,</hi> and <hi>M.

Therefore I doo intend to treate the leſſe thereof, and eſpecially of thoſe thinges that thoſe haue written of, I wyll not meddle withall at this tyme, for that they haue ſufficiently declared it, as this: for to know the contentes of Lande, to be meaſured in Triangles, beyng ſure for to make a ſquare angle and ſo forth, as <hi>M.

You ſhal multiply the length with the breadth, then that number that commeth of that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, you ſhall deuide by .160. and that ſhall ſhewe vnto you the true numbers of Acres, then if there bee any halfe roddes or quarters of roodes, if that they be in breadth, you ſhal adde then to the length, and if that they be in length, you ſhall account them in the breadth, and ſo foorth. Nowe I doo knowe that euery man hath not Arithmetike, therefore you ſhall make your account by this meanes, for to knowe the true contentes of the meaſure of

Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore for your better vnderſtanding, where there is half pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and quarter of pearches, both in the length and in the bredth, then you ſhall doo thus, by a peece of Lande that is 53. roodes long, and a halfe, and of bredth 42. and a quarter, then 42. pence maketh 3. ſhillinges and 6. pence: laye downe 3. tymes 53. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, and that will be .7. pounde and .19. ſhillinges, and then ther is 6. pence more, in the bredth: and 53. halfe ſhillings maketh 26. ſhillinges and 6. pence, then laye that to the other ſumme, and then it maketh 9. pounde 5. ſhillings and 6. pence, then there is in the length halfe a roode more, therefore you muſt account it in the bredth, and 42. halfe pence maketh 21. pence.

Then put that noble to the other noble, then that maketh 14. markes, then the 4. grotes, put to the other 4. pence, maketh 5. grotes, and ſo that peece of lande which is 53. roodes long and a halfe, and 42. roodes broade and a quarter, ſhal be in meaſure 14.

Thus much haue I ſayde for the meaſuring of all manner of plate formes, for that the common people fall into ſuch a number of errours for lack of Geometry &amp; Arithmetick, as thus. Some wil holde opinion that if any Square or Circle be as muche in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more, they wyll ſay that it is but as bigge agayne, where that it muſt needes of force be 4. times ſo big, as for enſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple by a Paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is but 12. foote ſquare euery waye, and an other Paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in lyke maner) 24. foote ſquare euery way, now that Paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being 12. foote ſquare, contayneth 144. foote, and the other being 24. foote ſquare euery way, contayneth .576. foote, that is 4. times ſo bigge as the other that is but 12. ynches ſquare, as by this Enſample it doth appeare.

the one of theſe ſquares to be 12. foote ſquare, and the other 24. foote ſquare: for yf that you would haue a ſquare the one to bee as bigge agayne as the other, then yf that it bee a ſquare roote as theſe 2. figures afore made: Then looke how many foote it is from corner to corner, right agaynſt it, paſſinge by the Center of the ſquare, the length of that Lyne from corner to corner, ſhall make an other ſquare vpon the foure ſydes as bigge agayne as the other from corner to corner: as for enſample thus.</p>

the ſquare roote of .12. is cutte from the one corner to the other corner, and the length of that lyne from the one corner to the other is 17. foote lackynge 1.33. parte of a foote, and yet for the more plainnes, you ſhal haue this enſample by the ſquare afore made of .12. foote euery way, and ſo beinge cutte from corner to corner, it is 17. foote lacking 1.33. parte: and when you haue done, you ſhall put the 2. partes ſo cutte a ſunder, together, laying the ſyde 12. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 12. and then it wyll make a Tryangle as bigge as the ſquare: then adding ſo much more vnto it, wyll make a ſquare roote iuſte as bigge agayne, as by this enſample it doth appeare.</p>

                     <p>And now furthermore for Circles or longe ſquares, all is one matter, as for an enſample thus by a Circle of 12. foote broade, and the Compaſſe ſhall be 37. foote and 8. ynches and better, for this is generall for euer looke how many times 7. is in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, ſo many times 22. ſhall be the circumference.

And alſo if the mould of the Ship be neuer ſo well made, and yf it wyll beare no ſaile but ouer heeld, that is to ſay, to lay downe the ſyde in the water, then it can neuer goe well, how fyne ſo euer the moulde is, for it is yll ſhapen to goe, when al the one ſyde is downe in the water, and the other ſyde all out of the water, and then it cannot abide the force of the wynde to driue it: whereas the Ship that is able to beare a good ſayle, muſt needes goe wel, for that the force of the winde muſt needes draw it, for that it is able to beare ſayle, and then the winde muſt needes force it to goe. &amp;c.

For this is generall for euer: Looke how much of any Tymber or any other thinge that is hydde, or in lownes euen with the water, as iuſt of waight as of ſo much water, as the true quantity of that parte that is from the edge of the water downewardes into the water neyther heauier nor lighter, and then that parte that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the water doth ſhew iuſtly what diuerſytie of waight is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the water and the woode, or any other ſtuffe that is putte into the water. For any thing ſwimming in the water, the halfe being aboue the water, and the other halfe vnderneath the water, that thing that ſwimmeth in that forme, is iuſt halfe the waight of ſo much water: and if in the ſwimming .3. quarters be buryed in the water, that thinge is iuſte 3. quarters of the waight of ſo

much water, and ſo foorth, to any other proportion, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo much in wait, to make it of the iuſt waight of the water: then that thinge being in the water, ſhall ſwimme euen with the edge of the water neither hygher nor lower. But if it bee any thing heauier then the proportion of ſo muche water, then it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto the bottome: and then looke how much in waight it is heuier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſo much water: ſo much it waieth in the water the lighter,<note place="margin">Of things that ſynke.</note> as the waight of the water co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto. For if ani thing in the water, be double the waight of the water, propor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then ſhal that thing waigh iuſt half the quantytie of that waight, til it be lyfted from the bottome vnto the very edge of the water, and then if that the thinge doe waigh but halfe the waight more then the quantitie of ſo much water: then ſhall that thing in the water to be waighed, waigh but one thyrde part of his waight that it would waigh, if that it were out of the water, and ſo foorth to any other waight or waightes, hauing proportion in bigneſſe, according to the quantitie of the water, whether it bee Braſſe, Stone, or Iron, or any other ſtuffe what ſoeuer it be. And alſo things that do ſwimme, as wood, or any other ſtuffe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is to be noted by the way, the perfect waight of any ſhip with all her ladyng, Ordinaunce, Maſtes, Sayles, and Tackle, with all other implementes in her, may be eaſyly knowen by her onely ſwimming, as thus:</p>
                     <p>Looke what quantitie of the Ship is buryed in the water, that is to ſay, from the edge of the water downwards: then if there were a veſſell or great thing made of the proportion of the moulde of a Shyppe, as much as is buried in the water, if that were filled with that water that the ſhip were in, the water ſhoulde be of iuſt equall waight, that the Ship were of, with all her tackle and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements in her. And now this being true, as it is moſt certayne, then the waight of the water being knowne, any veſſel or body is to bee meaſured by Geometrycall meanes. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, here is one ſpeciall thinge to be noted, and that is this,<note place="margin">Al water is not of lyke waight.</note> all waters are not of lyke waight, for the fineſt water is lighteſt: therfore if that any Ship be in the lighteſt water, then dooth ſhee ſwimme the deeper, according vnto the waight of the

                     <p>And now this being done exactly as it may be done with preciſe diligence, you knowing the true contentes howe many foote the ſoaled body of the moulde of the Shyppe doth contayne as much as is buryed into the water, you maye knowe iuſtlye the whole waight of that ſhip that you haue ſo meſured, with al her ladyng, ordinance, tackle, anker, and cables, with al other implementes

in her, as thus: Take of that water that the ſhip ſwimmeth in, and make a cube of mettall or wood of iuſt .12. ynches ſquare, and deepe: for that 12. ynches ſquare euery way, maketh a foote, and then waigh the water iuſtly howe many poundes and parte of a pounde the water dooth contayne in waight, and that ſhal ſhewe you iuſtly how many pounde and partes of a pounde euery foote ſquare of the moulde of the Ship dooth waigh iuſtly, and then if that you doo multiply the contentes of the number of feete, that the moulde is, and the waight that one foote of the water dooth waigh in poundes and partes, then accordyng vnto that number, the Shyp with all her ladyng, dooth waigh iuſtly without any fayle: ſo that you haue meaſured the moulde of the Shyp truely, and alſo waighed iuſtly the contentes of one foote of the water: and then by that number you may ſay iuſtly, it contayneth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tunnes in waight, as thus: by diuidyng the number of the waight of the Shippe by .2240. for that a Tunne conteyneth 20. hundreth waight, and euery .100. waight, to contayne 112. pounds.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, you may meaſure the moulde of a Shyp in this maner, with ſuch a thing as the Shyppe Carpenters doo take the moulde of a Ship, and that they doo call a moulde, or lynck ginne, and that is made of many peeces, of a foote long, or there about, and it is clenched togeather with roffe and clenche, that the ioyning wyll be put to and fro at your pleaſure, and wyll ſtande ſtiffe as you doo leaue it.</p>
                     <p>And now with this inſtrument, you may woorke more eaſely then before is rehearſed: for to know the contentes or quantity of the moulde of any Shyp in this maner: Take at euery place the halfe of the true breadth of the ſhyp, and then in lyke manner the true deepeneſſe that the ſhyp dooth goe into the water, at euery place that you doo meaſure the Shyp at, for that all ſhyppes doo draw more water at the Sterne, then they doo at the head: and then you may put three pinnes of wood into the grounde, the one pinne to be at the midle of the ſhip, and the other to be for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde of the ſhip, and the thyrde to be for the middle of the Keele of the Shyp, and to ſet them truely in diſtaunce, accordyng vnto the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4923:100"/>
halfe breadth of the ſhippe, and the other vnto the true deepneſſe that tht ſhip dooth goe into the water, and ſo ſhall that pinne for the middle of the Shyp, make a ſquare Angle vnto the pinne, for the ſyde and the keele of the ſhyppe, and then with the inſtrument lay that vnto the ſyde of the ſhyp, and put it in and out as the ſhip dooth rounde from the place of the vpper edge of the water vnto the Keele, and then laying that moulde of the Shyppe vnto the two pinnes, that is to ſay, to that pinne for the ſide, and the pinne for the Keele of the Shyp: and then meaſuryng that in cloſer, as you doo a platforme, the trueth of the contents ſhall appeare, and then doublyng that nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, it wil ſhew you the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the whole breadth of the Shyp, and then to multiply ſo much in length, as dooth keepe one proportion: And thus doyng as often tymes as the proportion of the moulde dooth alter, and then addyng al your numbers together, and caſting the contentes in all poynts, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is rehearſed, the trueth of the ſolid body of the moulde of the Ship ſhall appeare, and ſo taking the true waight of one foote of that water, as before is expreſſed in all poyntes.

And then it ſtandeth you in hande to gette ſuch Timber that wil not breake for that burthen, for if the Tymber dooth breake, it wyll put al in haſſard of ſynking agayne.

Therfore we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conclude thus of any ſhyp, if the ballaſt be caſt or heaued ouer vnto the ſyde of any ſhyp, that the ſhyp dooth turne ouer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyngly, alwayes to haue the heauyeſt part downewardes.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore, contrary vnto the vayne opinions of a number of perſons that ſhoulde be wyſe, that if the ballaſt be throwen ouer vnto the ſyde, that the ſhyp ſhal ſwymme vpon the ſide, and yet the ballaſt ſhal neuer ſlyppe, for that alwayes the ſhyp dooth turne of itſelfe, to bryng it vnto the leuel, except it be let by ſome cauſe, whiche is, eyther by makyng it faſt, or els by ſome other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal matter, or els it wyl followe accordyngly. &amp;c. And ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4923:115"/>
haue bene of that opinion, that no Shyp dooth ſwimme vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but that there is as much waight or more belowe in the water, as is aboue the water: but that is vntrue, as before it dooth appeare, by the enſample of a Raſke or Barrel. For you doo ſee that it wyll ſwymme, and the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yeſt part wyll turne downwards: &amp; if that it be not one quarter of a pound heauier on the one ſyde, then it is on the other, that part wyll turne downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes: and yet for all that, that part that is in the water, wyll not waygh the .10. part of that which is aboue the water.</p>
                     <p>Therefore you may conclude, that if the ballaſt doo lye all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the one ſyde of the Shippe, the Ship ſhal ſwimme vpon that ſyde, and the Keel ſhall come out of the water. And if that the ſhip ſyde be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hight, there is no more daunger in her ſwimming on the one ſyde, than if ſhe were vpright in the water. And alſo the Ship dooth not ſwim ſo deepe into the water, lying on the one ſyde, as ſhe dooth ſwim when ſhee is vpright, for that the Shippe is more lancker, or ſlenderer, or ſharper: that is to ſaye, not ſo full and rounde, by the means of her Tuck and Runne, and the Foreway, as the ſyde is rounde and full. Therfore it cannot go ſo deepe into the water, for as before is ſayde, that nothing can goe no further into the water then the proportion of ſo much water in waight. Wherfore the ſyde being rounde and full, it is the more boyenter a great deale, &amp;c. And alſo it is very good to bring a Shippe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a barre or ſhulde, for lying vpon the ſyde, it dooth draw much leſſe water, then when it dooth ſwimme vpright &amp;c. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng it is not ſo good for to Karrene the Queenes maieſties Shippes, as it is the Marchants Shippes, for two ſpeciall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the fyrſt is this: the Queenes highneſſe Shippes haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes as muche ballaſt in them, as they doo vſually goe to the Sea withall, to be faſt to beare a ſayle, which is no ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in her bigger ſorte of Shippes: and then what a charge is it to take the greateſt part of the ballaſt out of them, and too take it in agayne, for they muſt take more then .3. quarters of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt out, when they doo Karren them: whereas the Marchauntes Shippes doo delyuer all the ballaſt out when they do lade their ſhips: therfore the Marchants ſhal not occupy the 20. part of the
<pb facs="tcp:4923:116"/>
charges that the Queenes Shippes muſt. And the ſeconde cauſe is this, that in the Queenes Shippes, the ballaſt is alwayes fyrme and harde, by the meanes that it is ſeeldome or neuer ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and alſo the Cooke roome is made vp with bricke vppon the ballaſt, and alſo there is ſet vp in the Cooke roome with Brycke worke the furnaſes, to boyle theyr beefe, and other prouiſion, that is made for the dreſſing of mens vittailes, as Quens and hatches &amp;c. which were no ſmal charge to remoue and make vp agayne, whereas in the grounding of them all, theſe two great charges are ſaued, that Marchauntes ſhyps in theyr karrening ſhall not neede to bee at. &amp;c. And thus I ende the fourth Booke.</p>

But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they may geue ſuch credit vnto it, as the ſequell of the reaſons ſhall ſupport vnto them, for that they bee but my ſimple opinions: wherfore they may beleeue them as they lift.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow beginneth the fifth Booke which is concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes of ſundry things that are to bee ſeene in trauei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng vppon the face of the earth. And although there bee nothing that happeneth, but the prouidence of almightye God, dooth bring it to paſſe: yet notwithſtanding it hath a naturall cauſe why it is ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeemeth ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or vnpoſſible for that God dooth woorke all thinges by a meanes, and yet doth come to paſſe by ſome naturall cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And fyrſt of the naturall cauſe of Sandes and Bankes in the Sea and ryuers, my opinion is this: that whereas a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sandes and Banks are many times ſeene at the mouthes and entraunce of many great riuers both into the Sea, and alſo vp into the riuer, that it happneth by this meanes, by the ſhalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe ſeas, and the great indraft of the Ryuer. And then by the meanes of the ſoyle of the Countrye in the riuers, beyng a good diſtaunce from the ſea, and eſpecially after any great raine, dooth bring downe the ſoyle, for all the lande water dooth alwaies runne downe towardes the ſea, where as it dooth ebbe and flow, and ſometime the water ouerfloweth the banks, and then the ſwiftnes of the running of the water dooth fret away the bankes, and ſometime it happeneth in the winter after a great froſt.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4923:119"/>
And ſuch other lyke cauſes, ſometyme from ſandye grounde, &amp; ſometime from clay grounde, &amp; ſometime ſtony grounde: &amp; other good moulde dooth fall into the Ryuer, and ſo is myxed and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled too and fro with the water, and is alwayes caried towardes the ſea by the violence of the ſtreame, for that alwaies, where it doth not ebbe &amp; flow, the ſtreame runneth towards the ſea: &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it doth ebbe &amp; flow, there the ebbe doth runne both ſwifter &amp; lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the floods doo, &amp; ſo by that meanes, it is alwayes caried towardes the ſea, &amp; alſo any thyng is apter to rolle, or runne down the hyll, rather then agaynſt the hyll. And thus the ſoyle of the countrey beyng tumbled too &amp; fro in the water, is waſhed and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in ſuch ſorte, that the water is made thycke therewith, and the fat or clammye ſubſtance, become owes, but the greety or ſandy, or grauelly ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth alwaies keepe towards the bottome, for that it is more po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous or heauier then the fatty or clammy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and then this grauelly or ſandye ſubſtance, beyng dryuen downe towardes the ſea, by the violence of the ſtreame, goyng by the bottome, then where it dooth find any place to ſtaye at by the way, there it reſteth, and ſo groweth more and more, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a ſande, and then the Tyde, by the meanes of ebbing and flowyng, dooth make or ſcoure out a chanel, or paſadge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one ſande or bancke, and another. And alwayes thys happeneth, whereas the Sea is but ſhalowe, and the Ryuer or hauen hath a great indraught, that is to ſay, to run a great diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the lande, whereby there is much ſoyle brought downe by the meanes afore rehearſed. And then the Sea beyng but ſhallowe, it hath no great deſcent to runne downe the hyll. And then by the meanes of the floods, &amp; the bellowes of the Sea, dooth cauſe it to be ſtayed, although that ſometyme it happeneth, that one ſande or bancke doth decreaſe, and weare away, and another dooth increaſe and waxe bigger, and many tymes the chanels doo alter, ſometymes deeper, and ſometymes ſhallower: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes whereas a chanel was, becommeth a ſande, &amp; ſometyme whereas a ſande was, is become a chanel, as experience hath many tymes ſhewed, which happeneth manye tymes by ſome ſtormes or great wyndes, ſometymes from one quarter of the
<pb facs="tcp:4923:120"/>
world, and ſometyme from another quarter. And by that meanes the greatneſſe of the bellowes of the Sea, dooth beat, or waſhe awaye the ſande from one place, and ſo dooth reſt vppon another place: and then the Tyde or ſtreame doth ſcoure or frette a newe Chanell, betweene one ſande and another. &amp;c. As we maye ſee by experience in dyuers places, as the mould of the Ryuer of Thames, and Humber, and the Ryuer of Roane, and ſuche other lyke places, whiche I doo omitte at this tyme.</p>

                     <p>And as before is rehearſed, the grauelly or ſandye ſubſtance dooth dryue with the ſtreame,<note place="margin">Of the ſoyle of the Countrey.</note> by the bottome, but the fatty or clammy ſubſtance is mingled with the water: for although you ſhoulde take any earth or ſubſtance, and waſhe it and tumble it in water neuer ſo much: yet notwithſtanding it cannot be conſumed all away, but if you doo let it ſtande ſtyll, then it wyl ſettle it ſelfe vnto the bottome, and you ſhall fynde the ſubſtance agayne.

So although the earth is mingled with water, by the meanes of the fretting of the ſtreame and the Tide, and alſo the ſouſſyngs of the bellows in great winds, toſſyng it to &amp; fro in ſtormy weather, yet notwithſtanding in fayre and calme weather, in ſuch places, whersas there dooth not runne a great Tyde or ſtreame, then that earthye ſubſtance doth ſettle it ſelfe agayne on ſuch places as are defended by ſome Naaſe or poynt, and in ſome Bay or place, that the grating of the Tyde or ſtreame dooth not greatly trouble it, &amp; is then called Owes, or as the common people that be not neare dwellers vnto ſuch Ryuers, doo call it Durt, Myre, or Mud.

And then many tymes it happeneth, that thoſe that are the dwellers there aboutes, or els the Lordes of thoſe ſoyles, doo Inne that ſame grounde, and make the walles for the defence thereof.

And this is generall for euer, that looke whereas there is any great ſtore of rockes, it is a token of a deepe ſea, it is a token of a ſhallow Sea, that hath many ſands. And the cauſe of rocks in the ſea, in mine opinion is this, as it is knowne vnto all perſons, that the age of the world is of no ſmall time: ſo that I am of that opinion, that the Rockes that are now ſtandyng in the ſea, haue beene parcell of the maynelande, or at the leaſt, ſome Ilandes ſtandyng in the ſea of long time agoe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there bee no mention made of any ſuche Ilandes ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng in the ſeas, in thoſe dayes. The cauſe thereof might be this: for that they that were of long time agoe, made no accoumpt of any ſmall Ilandes, that were towardes our Weſt Occian. For
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4923:123"/>
theſe weſt partes, in thoſe dayes were ſcant peopled, as Ireland, and Englande, and Scotlande, and Brytayne, the weſt part of Fraunce. For it is no long time agoe, that Irelande hath beene throughly well peopled, although it bee a long time agoe, ſince the fyrſt entraunce of Brute, yet it was long ſince the Incarnation of Chriſt, before that this Countrye became throughly peopled, as it dooth appeare both by the Chronicles, and other ancient hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</p>

And as ſome haue ſayde, it is as ſalte in Iſelande, and at the North Cappe, which is within the Polle or Cyrcle, neare fyue degrees. And there the Sunne cannot haue any great power, for that the Sunne hath but a very glaunſyng ſhadowe in Iune. And in the Wynter part of the yeare, the Sunne wyll not appeare or ryſe vnto them, in the ſpace of tenne Weekes.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, if the water of the ſea were made ſalte onely by the powers of the Sunne, then thoſe ſeas muſt needes become freſhe, by another great cauſe, and that is this: For in the Spring of the yeare, in the meltyng of the Snowe and the Iſe, there falleth ſuch abundance of freſhe water, that it would make it freſhe, and yet the water is verye ſalt, inſomuch that in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places in the North parte, they doo make ſalt of the ſea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, although that it is not made by the heate or powers of the Sunne, as it is made in Spayne and in Fraunce, for that they doo make it in Scotlande with the heate of the fyre,<note place="margin">Salt is made of the ſea water in Scotland &amp; in Roſey.</note> &amp; ſo as ſome haue ſayde, it is made in Roſey, not farre from Sainct Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas. And furthermore, as it may be prooued, the water is not made ſalt by the power of the Sunne, for that the heade of the great Ryuer Nylus that commeth from the Mountaynes of the Moone, &amp; hath Latitude beyond the Equinoctial twelue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: And ſo in ſundry places, ſtandeth in ſundry great pooles,<note place="margin">Freſh water in ſeas or pooles vnder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall.</note> not farre from the Equinoctial, and ſo paſſeth from vnder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, vnto the Northwards, and dooth empty it ſelfe in the middle earth ſea: and yet that water is freſh, and not ſalt. So that it is manifeſt that the powers of the Sun, are not altogether the cauſe that the water of the ſea is ſalt. Wherfore in mine opinion, the water of the ſea is become ſalt by the Minerals or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the nature of the ground, which is ſalt properly of it ſelf, and ſo mollified or ſoked, that it turneth vnto water, hauing anye moyſture or lyquor to come vnto it.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:4923:129"/>As for an enſample, that in ſundrie places, it is knowen that there is Salt found and dygged out of the ground, and is perfect Salt, and occupied for Salt, after they haue made it cleane, and beate it ſmal. And as it hath been credybly reported vnto me, there is a hyll or Mountayne in Barbary in Africa,<note place="margin">Salt mines.</note> that Salt is digged out thereof, and is a great diſtance from the ſea. And the like is reported to be in the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of Hungary, here in Europ, that there is ſalt digged out thereof, and is ſolde and bought into dyuers places, as into Polonia, and into ſome places of Germanye.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The ſea made ſalt, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the grounde.</note>Then it is a playne caſe, that there be ſuch wynes or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralles in the grounde, which maketh the thyng to be moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Sea is made Salt by the mineralles or ſubſtance of ſalt in the grounde.</p>
                     <p>And yet for further proofe therof, here in England, at the Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Cheſſeſhyre, there is in ſundrye places, a water or Bryne that they doo make Salt of, and is a good diſtance from any Sea. And ſome haue made argument, that it may come from the Sea, thorowe the Vaynes or Coues in the grounde, which is moſte contrarye, by thys meanes: for if that it come from the Sea, thorowe the grounde, then it coulde not be ſalter then the water of the Sea, for that at the Wyches, is much ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Sea water. For if that it come from the Sea, then it muſt be ſomewhat freſher then the Sea water, by the meanes of the ſcouring it ſelfe thorowe the earth, and by meeting of ſome freſh waters, as the earth is not without freſh water. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, as concernyng the ſaying of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Plato, in his Dialogues of <hi>Tymeus,</hi> and <hi>Crecia,</hi> and alſo is written by <hi>Marcellius Ficius,</hi> that in the olde time, there was an Ilande in the Sea, ouer agaynſt Africa, bygger then Africa and Aſia, which Ilande was called <hi>Atlantyda,</hi> and that the Kynges of this Ilande did gouerne a great parte of Africa and Europa, and as <hi>Marcellius Ficius,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> ſay, by the meanes of a great earthqake, and a great rayne, thys Ilande ſunke, and the people thereof were drowned: and after the ſinkyng of thys

But they doo not conſyder this, that no place can bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, but that it is furniſhed with ſomwhat, either with earthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or water, or ayre, or Fyre, &amp; euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is finer in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce then the other, as the earthy ſubſtance is groſſe and harde, ſo the watry ſubſtaunce is thinner, and yet ponderous and heauy: ſo that there can be no place hollow or concaue in the earth, but it is filled with water or ayre. For the water by his ponderouſnes dooth deſcend and ſeeke to the lower parts. And then looke where as the water is not ſufficient to fyll the hollow place, then ayre dooth repayre thyther to fulfyll the reſt, takyng his place next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue hym, as we may ſee by experyence, that if wee doo dygge in the grounde, wee ſhall meete with Sprynges of water: as by the enſample of the digging of Wels in the grounde, that when they haue dygged ſo low, and haue founde but a ſmall ſpryng, then letting it ſtande a certayne time, thither wyl repayre a great qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Water afterwardes. And then this being true, that the water dooth fynde paſſage through the vaynes in the grounde, then it is a playne caſe, that ayre muſt the rather fynde paſſage, for that it is an Element more thinner and ſubtyller then water, and wyll ſoke through any ſmall thing ſooner. For the nature of ayre is to deſcende very deepe into the earth, if it bee not fylled with other ſubſtaunces. So in lyke manner water, although it be ponderous and heauy, wyll aſcende vpwardes, yf the ayre can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come thyther by the meanes of the cloſeneſſe or thightneſſe of the thing that the water is incloſed aloft or ouer it, and alſo the water wyll not deſcende or fall downe ſodaynlye, although the ayre be vnder it being incloſed in it, that the water by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4923:131"/>
be ſtyred by ſome accidentall cauſe.</p>
                     <p>And now to returne to the cauſe of Earthquakes,<note place="margin">The cauſe of Earthquakes.</note> my ſimple opinion is this. The ayre being incloſed in the bowels of the earth, which hath happened by the meanes before rehearſed, or by diuers other meanes, which I am not able to rehearſe, that the ayre may bee incloſed in the grounde or earth, and then when it ſhal pleaſe almighty God to bring it ſo to paſſe, for God is the worker of all thinges, either by one meane or another, that the waters may ariſe and encreaſe in the grounde, and eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any great and continuall rayne, and the water being ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and heauy, dooth ſeeke into the earth, expelling or thruſting out the ayre that is neare the ſuperficiall part of the earth, and ſo by his ponderouſneſſe ſetleth it ſelfe lower and lower, and then the great and continuall rayne dooth lode the ſuperficiall face of the earth with water, and dooth cauſe the earth to ſwel and ſhutte it ſelfe cloſe aloft on the vpper part of the earth, and that water in the earth, by ſetlyng it ſelfe lower and lower, and the earth by his cloſeneſſe wyll not ſuffer the ayre to depart out of the earth, ſo that there is no roome in the earth to holde or contayne both the Ayre and the water, but that the ayre in the earth is forced to rent the earth to haue roome ſufficient. And alſo at that time the earth is more apter to ſeperate it ſelfe, then it is at any other time, for that the earth is ſoked and made ſoft by the great moyſture that is in it.</p>
                     <p>And by this meanes, in ſuch places whereas this cauſe dooth happen that the grounde dooth quake and tremble,<note place="margin">Of the ſhaking of the earth.</note> and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that are neare thereabout, vntill ſuch time as the ayre doth fynde paſſage to get out of the ground, and if that it cannot fynde paſſage, then it dooth ſplit and rent the grounde, caſting al things that are ouer it, or in the way of the ayre, that breaketh ſo out of the ground ouer it, and poſſible to turne the buildings vnderneath the earth or grounde to the great and maruaylous deſtruction both of the people and buildinges where this happeneth. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And by this meanes thoſe places, that haue beene Lande, may become Water, being neare vnto the Sea or any great Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4923:132"/>And in lyke manner whereas there haue bene any Pooles or Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may be dryed vp, as cleane as though there had neuer beene any Poole, or Ryuer, or water there, by this meanes: for after that the ayre in the earth hath rent the earth to ſeeke paſſage out, then this thing happening there or neare vnto the water, may run or deſcende into that place wheras the ayre was before, and alſo in the turning vp or ſplitting of the grounde, there may bee ſome hilles or cliffes ſtandyng vp much higher then the grounde was before. And ſo by this meanes the places that haue bene dry land, may become ſea and water, and in lyke manner that place that hath beene water, may become dry lande. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And furthermore, in lyke manner there may by this meanes before rehearſed, be Ilandes caſt vp in the ſea, by the meanes of the ayre breaking out of the earth. &amp;c. for that is the propertie of ayre, to runne and to ſeeke into all places, that is not occupied or furniſhed with ſome of the elementall ſubſtances, ſo that rather then any hollow or concaue place in the earth ſhall bee vacant, ayre wyll ſeeke thither, if it were in the very Center of the earth. For as is ſayde before, if water bee able to ſeeke paſſage through the vaines in the earth, then much rather the ayre ſhall doo it, for that it is much thinner, &amp; ſubtiller then water, although that ayre wyll geue place vnto water, by his ponderouſnes or waight. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Fyrſte thus my opinyon is, that America is parte of

the great Ilande called Atlantida, as it is further declared in the eight Chapter goyng before,<note place="margin">How all the new founde Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came peopled, as all America, and all other Ilandes.</note> that the Kinges of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande dyd gouerne a great part of Europe and Africa, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vnto ſome Authors, that the Kings of that Ilande were the ſonnes of Neptunus, then that dooth ſygnifye that there was a trade or occupying of Shipping betweene theſe knowne partes and that great Ilande, and then when that great Ilande dyd ſynke, as before is declared, the Sea Atlanticus was ſo full of mudde,<note place="margin">All the great Iland called Atlant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by the Enſample of America, that all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande dyd not ſynke, but the Weſtermoſt parte dyd remayne ſtill. Although this happened long beefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of Chriſt, and as before is declared, the great ſtore of mud and fylth that dyd remayne in the Sea, was the onely cauſe that dyd let the Trafficke and paſſage betweene vs in theſe knowne partes, and them that were vnknowne vnto vs in all this long time of this mud remayning in the Sea: ſo long time, that thoſe men that were the Sea men in thoſe dayes, were of long time dead before the Sea was cleare of the mudde. And alſo thoſe ſea men,<note place="margin">Olde ſea men being gone, the other did neuer attempt to ſeeke any thing</note> as it is to be gathered, that were in the Ilande, dyd periſhe by the meanes of the ſinking of the Eaſt ſyde of that great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande. Wherfore it is to be gathered, that thoſe that were in theſe partes, dyd neuer attempt to ſeeke any Lande that wayes to the Weſtwardes, neither thoſe that were remayning vpon that part of the Ilande that dyd not ſynke, dyd neuer attempt to ſeeke any Lande vnto the Eaſtwardes.</p>
                     <p>And in lyke manner, they could not ſo conueniently doo it, for that they had no Shipping to goe vnto the Sea, but ſmall Boats called Cannouſes, which be occupyed to no other purpoſe or vſe, but onely to goe on fyſhing, or els to tranſport themſelues from Ilande vnto Ilande, neare vnto the mayne. &amp;c. And yet it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſome people might paſſe out of theſe partes by ſhipping although they neuer made any returne agayne, but might tarry there, and inhabite in thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>And now inſomuch that it is knowen, that they had boates, and dyd tranſport them ſelues from place vnto place, and from Iland
