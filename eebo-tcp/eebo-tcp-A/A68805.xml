            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ONOURED Friends: By your experienced kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I have emboldened my selfe at this time, to present you with a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of our ancient friend, Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Taylor, whom alive you heard glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The subject of them is, <hi>the Principles of Christian Practice.</hi> All Philosophie saith: such as the Principles are, such


<pb facs="tcp:18868:3"/>
are the Affections, and the Conclusions. The world seeth it in those famous divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, of Gentilisme, Judaisme, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metisme, and Christianisme: wherein, as any is more throughly grounded, so he is more resolved in himselfe, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from others. The Church also seeth and bewaileth it in her wofull divisions. To let passe the Theorie, and consider the <hi>Practice</hi> (wherewith wee have now to doe:) wee shall easily observe in the course of Christians, that, as they lay downe their Principles, and frame their plots and projects, so their lives also, and particular passages thereof, are framed.</p>
            <p>The maine aime and plot of a true Christian is, to please God and save his soule howsoever. Accordingly hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to <hi>denie</hi> himselfe, that hee may give up himselfe wholly unto God: hee seekes out after <hi>Christ,</hi> and will get this great pearle, though hee sell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of all his worldly endowments and comforts: hee meanes afterward to <hi>follow</hi> Christ, even through thicke and


<pb facs="tcp:18868:3"/>
thinne, and though hee bee daily compelled to take up his crosse in following him: Hee knowes, that by overmuch daintinesse and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie in the way of holy obedience, hee may hazzard his <hi>soule,</hi> which, if hee had lost a <hi>a temporall</hi> life, hee might have received againe in life <hi>eternall.</hi> Hee considers, that if hee could get or hold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much of these worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, yet all would bee meere <hi>losse</hi> upon the losse of his soule: and, if his soule be once lost, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee <hi>recovered</hi> againe. And howsoever hee may cheare up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for a while with those vanities, yea perhaps for a long while, yet in the day of <hi>judgement</hi> at farthest; when Christ comes to reckon' for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans talent and employment; hee knowes he must rue the time of his former securitie, or licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; whenas only those that have aimed aright, and rightly steared


<pb facs="tcp:18868:4"/>
their course for God and heaven, shall (though with much hardship) arrive at the wished haven of rest and glorie. Hereupon it is, that many a poore Christian wades a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame, and labours still to <hi>approve himselfe unto God,</hi> by <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 4.</note> honour and dishonour, by good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and bad report, by the armour of righteousnesse on the right hand, and on the lest. So that hee may obtaine that incorruptible crowne of life, which is set before him, he cares not what paines hee takes in <hi>running,</hi> nor how hard censures hee endureth from carnall specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. That hee may not mistake his way, through blindenesse in himselfe, or false guides abroad, hee useth the means of sound and heavenly <hi>knowledge,</hi> and in them all <hi>intreats</hi> the Lords helpe and guidance, who alone is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, comfort, and strengthen him in his pilgrimage: and, when hee


<pb facs="tcp:18868:4"/>
obtaines this, hee soots it <hi>lustily</hi> along, till in the strait way, though rough, and full of crosses, hee gets into his Fathers house, where is bread enough, and comfort, and glory. And whereas in his travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hee espies a number of <hi>sensuall</hi> men, who are wholly taken up with <note place="margin">Jude 19.</note> their pleasures, treasures, honours, friends, seastings, or other trifles, these hee pitieth, and prayeth for them, and resolveth for his owne part, not to entangle himselfe with the affaires of this life, that he may <hi>please</hi> him who hath chosen him to be a souldier. <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the disposition, and these the behaviours of a Christian well principled and bottomed; The effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting whereof, both the Authour intended in preaching these things, and I now intend in publishing them: together with encouragement to all those, who stand stoutly, wisely, and constantly to their own


<pb facs="tcp:18868:5"/>
               <hi>Principles,</hi> whatever the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conclusions of the world be toward them.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, numbers of men and women, missing of these Principles, and falling upon other which are deceitfull, doe spend their lives in meere vanities, and lose both God and their soules before they are aware. Some meane to bee rich howsoever, esteeming wealth to be the blessednes of man: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which ground, they sticke not for injustice, bribery, oppression, cheating, and other indirect arts of getting. Others attend their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and account it happinesse to live deliciously for a season: which therefore they will enjoy, though with uncleannesse, intemperance, unthriftinesse, prodigalitie, other sinnes, and totall forgetfulnesse of <hi>the Afflictions of Joseph.</hi> Others <note place="margin">Amos 6. 6.</note> admire the honours of the world, or credite with men of the world, or


<pb facs="tcp:18868:5"/>
applause of the people: which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hold, they care not though they undermine, traduce, flatter, smooth, betray religion, any thing: <hi>Yet honour me before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And others, taking up other <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 30.</note> ends, and grounding themselves upon Principles of their owne, goe wide of Christ and heaven, as farre as East and West.</p>
            <p>Yea though they will seeme sometimes to put on a vizard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Hypocrite mindes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his owne selfe-respects; to have his Minister thinke well of him, to be accounted some body in the profession, to get credite with some who may doe him a good turne another day, to get friends, custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, chapmen, and worke out his owne advantages the more freely and slily: Accordingly hee holds none but an hobling course in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing religion, halts betweene two opinions, sayes and unsayes; in one


<pb facs="tcp:18868:6"/>
companie speakes well of good men, and good things, in another companie quite otherwise, pretends God, and intends himselfe, in fine, makes nothing of his religion, and if the winde serve right, hee will take the next occasion to strike saile, and become a Persecutour of religion and religious persons.</p>
            <p>The like of many Apostates. What other cause can be given, why numbers of Christians fall off from the profession or obedience of the Gospell, but that they never lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned well and throughly these <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christian Practice,</hi> to denie themselves, to take up their crosse, to follow Christ, to looke to the welfare of their soules how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, to provide for the day of their accounts, to run and strive lawfully, to depend on God by prayer for direction and blessing, and to save themselves from this untoward generation, of Epicures


<pb facs="tcp:18868:6"/>
and worldlings? If these grounds had beene well laid, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left off building so shamefully, as now have done: nor had their house come tumbling upon their heads, but that their foundation was laid in the sands.</p>
            <p>Others there are, that abuse good Principles (as, concerning the infinite mercie of God, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ:) or settle upon false and insufficient Principles, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prosperitie, deliverance out of trouble and danger, example of the multitude, rulers, preachers, and the like; thereby bolstering up themselves, either in grosse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saneness, or a refined Atheisme, till their soules be utterly lost, unlesse the mercie and grace of God doe greatly prevent them.</p>
            <p>They are thrice happie, who are thus prevented. It is the Lord only, who gives us both a Saviour, and the knowledge of salvation, and


<pb facs="tcp:18868:7"/>
wisedome to attend our <hi>Principles</hi> aright: hee doth it for us, and must therefore have all the glory. To his grace and mercie I commend you both (my much respected Friends:) intreating your acceptance of this small present, and pardon for this large Preface. The Lord often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your yeares upon you, with all heavenly and earthly blessings, and peace upon Sion. So prayeth,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ &amp; the Christian; so it is a part of Christs own cross: for, as all the members suffered with Christ on the crosse, as their head and surety; so hee suffers with them as his members, and after a sort hangs still on their crosse. The head and members of this body are inseparable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we should never think of the troubles for Christ, but cast our eyes also upon the crosse


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18868:35"/>
of Christ, where wee shall see him sanctifying, sweetening, and conquering all our sorrowes, and behold him a companion, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yoke-fellow, bearing for us the heavie and ponderous end, and the greatest part off us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in all our sufferings for Christ wee should support <note place="margin">3.</note> our faith &amp; patience in beholding what was the end of Christs crosse, and so expect the same happy end and issue of our crosses for Christ; that as he passed from the crosse to the Crowne, so will hee in the end admit us into the fellowship of his crowne and glory, whom he hath vouchsafed as Simons and companions in the bearing of his own crosse, which is an unspeakable helpe and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to our perseverance.</p>
               <p>Next, what is it to take up the <note place="margin">III.</note> crosse?</p>
               <p>It is not to devise a voluntary <note place="margin">What it is to take it up.</note> affliction for a mans self: as Baals


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18868:35"/>
Priests lanced themselves, and <note place="margin">Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> Popish Priests and Proselytes at set times afflict and torture their bodies by whipping cheare, to merit thereby.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to run into affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or pull the crosse upon our shoulders, or thrust our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to danger, no not for Christ, as Peter thrust himselfe into Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas hall.</p>
               <p>For first, Christ did not carry his crosse, till it was layd upon <note place="margin">Reasons that we may not pull the crosse on our selves.</note> him. Secondly, our rule is, to use all good meanes for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies, health, wealth, strength, and comfort. Christ himselfe did flye persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">1.</note> till the time was come; and <note place="margin">2.</note> commanded his Disciples if they were persecuted in one city, to flye into another. Thirdly, every bearing of affliction must bee an <note place="margin">3.</note> obedience of faith; and therefore must bee grounded upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. No souldier


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18868:36"/>
must of his owne head raise war against his owne peace, nor set fire upon his owne house; this is not the part of a good souldier, but of a mutinous and seditious fellow: So no souldier of Christ must be superfluous in suffering, but see hee be prest into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell by the great Generall and Commander. Fourthly, we may <note place="margin">4.</note> not tempt God by running afore him, but follow him going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. If without sin, and with good conscience wee may escape danger, and do not, we run upon it, and it becomes our own crosse, and not Christs.</p>
               <p>It is enough to <hi>suffer</hi> wrong; wee must not <hi>offer</hi> wrong to our owne persons. We are not bound to <hi>seek</hi> the crosse, nor <hi>make</hi> it, but to <hi>beare</hi> and <hi>take it up:</hi> Nor to <hi>fill</hi> the cup for our selves, but to <hi>drinke</hi> it when God reacheth it. Our afflictions must not be a cup of our own brewing, or a potion


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18868:36"/>
of our owne providing, but the Father must give it us: <hi>John 18. 11. Shall not I drinke of the cup, which my Father hath given?</hi>

This is to take up the crosse. Now God laying on the crosse, wee must not pull away the shoulder, nor hide our selves from the crosse under the covert of sinfull shifts, nor avoid it by any unlawfull meanes, but take it up, and buckle to the burden.</p>

Let the same minde be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.</hi> But alas! we strive to go one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another in pride, and taking honour, because the minde of Christ is not in us.

Never was there such a copy. And this for our imitation, who must <hi>walke in love as hee loved us, Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. and 1 <hi>John 3. 16.

body, the Church.</p>
               <p>The rules these: 1. Christians must ayme at such sincerity in love, as to bee willing to give their lives, 1. for God, 2. for his image, and stand in a readinesse to undergoe any danger for GOD and his image sake: for, <hi>love seekes not her owne.</hi> 2. Wee must intend the salvation of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5</note> before our owne lives; for their soules are better than our lives: so did Christ, and so did the Apostle Paul, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 15. I would most gladly bee bestowed for your soules.</hi> 3. Not rashly, and <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> without calling; for, Christ died not for us, till he was called to it. Which when we have, we must part with our lives, even for their bodies, much more for their soules.</p>
               <p>Thus of the <hi>matter,</hi> wherein we must follow Christ.</p>
               <p>Next of the <hi>manner</hi> of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">II.</note> him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:18868:54"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> How can wee follow Christ, seeing he is in heaven, and we on earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not having his bodily <note place="margin">How Christ can &amp; must be followed.</note> presence on earth, wee cannot make any pilgrimage to follow him with the feet of our body: but,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee must follow him <hi>in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. By faith, a threefold act of it.</note> 
                  <hi>faith;</hi> move after him with the feet of faith: which to do, know that faith hath a threefold worke in this businesse.</p>
               <p>First, it causeth us to know &amp; acknowledge our Captaine, and <note place="margin">1.</note> the way wherein hee is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: for it tels the Christian, that he being now set into Christ, and become a member of him; If hee now live, hee must live unto him: If he dye, he must dye unto him; he is not his owne, but at his Lords command wholly, and must follow him close in the meanes of his presence, especially in <hi>searching the Scriptures, which


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18868:55"/>
testifie of him, John</hi> 5. 39. as also in listening to the inward teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and guidance of the Spirit; &amp; taking the benefit of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by the change and fiuits in himselfe, since hee had Christ afore him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, faith will hold us in our way, and keep our leader in <note place="margin">2.</note> sight. It will not bee led by the opinions of men, or customes of the world, but by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and will of the Captain. It will not looke a squint to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it selfe to Christ and the world too; but it knits the heart undivided to Christ alone, as an only perfect Saviour and Pattern. Yea, because he now liveth, and moveth, &amp; hath beeing in Christ, he can no more be without him, than a member without the head, and, as a member followes him through fire and water, perils and torments, most earnestly and cheerfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:18868:55"/>
Thirdly, faith causeth a man, <note place="margin">3.</note> whensoever he is slipt out of his way, to return back by a new act of repentance: as when Christ looked backe upon Peter, &amp; exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his faith, he wept bitterly: &amp;, saith the Church, <hi>Cant. 3. 3. Saw ye not him whom my soule loveth?</hi> And thus faith is crowned with perseverance. This of the first way to follow Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must follow him in <hi>love</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. By love. 2 Cor. 5. 14. Gal. 5. 6.</note> &amp; ardent affection, by which faith alwaies <hi>worketh.</hi> No other thing must constraine us, but love: as a wife out of love follows her dear husband. And this wil be stronger than death: nothing can separate us, neither height, nor depth, nor sword, nor death, nor a sea of the waters of affliction can drown it. Yea, zeale &amp; fervency of spirit is required to exclude hypocrisie &amp; lukewarmnes: for dissemblers and halters can never follow Christ in the rugged waies wherin he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before us.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:18868:56"/>
3. Wee must follow him <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. What it doth in this thing.</note> for love of himselfe, not for selfe-love: for selfe-deniall must goe before the imitation of Christ. This will make us follow him into Jerusalem, and out of <note place="margin">1.</note> Jerusalem, unto the Consistory, unto the Crosse; as well when they cry, <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> as when they cry, <hi>Hosanna.</hi> And not as many, who follow the times, and not Christ.</p>
               <p>It will make us follow him <hi>for right ends:</hi> not for loaves or <note place="margin">2.</note> perishing bread, as the Jewes: not for curiosity, as Herod, to see a miracle: nor as Peter, to gaze and get newes in the high Priests hall; but as the Disciples, <hi>John 6. 68. Master, thou hast the words of eternall life, and whither shall we goe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will make us follow him <hi>wholly, not lamely,</hi> as on one legge, <note place="margin">3.</note> as such who profess his doctrine, but deny his life, live carnally,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18868:56"/>
covetously, uncharitably; all this religion is naught and vaine, and opens the mouth of Adversaries, to say from the loose lives of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, that our religion is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to good works.</p>
               <p>Where did Christ teach thee, that professest to follow him, to sweare, to lye, to deceive, to profane the Sabbath, to raise slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to revenge, to spend thy time in gaming, idlenesse, or the like? where learnest thou this of Christ?</p>
               <p n="4">4. We must follow him <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. With constancy.</note> without wavering or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, not for a brunt or a start, not as the young man that came hastily, but departed heavily: He loves no lookers back. Know that Christ is best at last: and, though thou mayest bee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weary, yet Christ will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh thee, and lead thee to rest.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>manner</hi> of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>

Againe, the equity appeares, because here is nothing required or requested of us, but our Master hath done it before us, and commended it to us by his owne example: Our Joshua saith to us his souldiers, What you see mee doe, that doe you; and shall a common souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er recoile or start back from that

               <p>First, if we look at our selves. Wee would faine be leaders and devisers, which Christ knew wel enough: and, as we easily stray of our selves, so wee are easily mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, either by our owne lusts, or by other perillous guides: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one; as the people, who <hi>in simplicity</hi> followed Absalom, <hi>not knowing</hi> whereabout hee went, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18868:58"/>
this precept of Christ, both for prevention and direction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if wee looke at the <note place="margin">2. Justice of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such.</note> justice of God, who gives over men to follow dangerous guides, when they refuse Christ by his Word and Spirit to lead them: See it in a number of instances.</p>
               <p>How many are given up, as the Heathens were, <hi>to their own harts lusts, Rom.</hi> 1. 26. that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were given up to the Divell to buffer, or any tyrant to torment, than delivered to fall by their owne hand; and all because they will not have Christ to lead them, nor will follow him! Nay, seeing the Divell ruleth in lusts, to be given up unto lusts, is, to be left into the hands of the Divell, the Prince of the ayre, to bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at his will: And how just is it, that a sheep that will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Shepheard, should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Butcher?</p>
               <p>How many others who will


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18868:58"/>
not follow Christ in the Word, are given up to follow the world, and the course of the world? Some follow their <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 10. every one from the greatest to the least: tormenting themselves and the world in it; give no rest to it or themselves, allow neither GOD nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any rest on the Sabbath, &amp;c. Others walke <hi>after the course of the world, Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. and <hi>fashion</hi> themselves unto it, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. as appeares in many, who have sold themselves over to voluptuousnes, delicacy, pride in apparrel, tiring out all the tires and fashions of all countries. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spend their time in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or gaming, or sports, and other calling have they none. But all the world knowes, Christs life was humble, painfull, sober, heavenly, holy, fruitfull, and cleane contrary to these who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive onely a name of Christ, but


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18868:59"/>
follow the world, a sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Christ.</p>
               <p>Numbers are given up to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low evill company, &amp; evill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, because they despise Christs counsell. Hee that refuseth the counsell of wisedome, it is just that folly should lead him: See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 30. 31.

               <p>Thus dangerously are men gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to perillous guides, who will not have Christ to guide them. And this is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond motive.</p>

               <p>For the former: 1. Some are


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18868:65"/>
bound <hi>inwardly,</hi> by an inward call and voice of the Spirit; as Paul was <hi>bound in spirit</hi> to goe up to Jerusalem, even to suffer, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 22. and was endued with such a spirit of courage and fortitude, that his life was <hi>not deare</hi> unto him; but he was ready to endure all extremitie; for Christ. Such a spirit GOD gave to Luther, when hee went to Wormes to dispute, that though hee saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death &amp; danger before him, yet so many Divels as there were tiles on the houses could not turne him off. And to many of the Martyrs in Queen Maries daies God gave in silly bodies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and stout spirits, to contemne all threats and torments. These may not flye in persecution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some are <hi>externally</hi> bound to stand, by vertue either of the <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>generall</hi> calling of a Christian, as when by a mans flight the whole Church and truth is indangered,


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18868:65"/>
which must be dearer than a mans life: or of the <hi>speciall</hi> calling, as when by the worke of it GOD may bee more glorified, and the Church edified, I must keep mee in the way, notwithstanding the perill ensuing. For example: If the persecution bee generall and common to the whole Church, the Minister may not flye; for the weak are in great danger, &amp; most need the support of the strong: &amp; now the duty of the calling must be dearer than his life. Whereas if the persecution were personall, &amp; directed against the Pastor onely, hee were in his owne liberty to withdraw himself, only for a time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are tyed &amp; bound not <note place="margin">3.</note> to flye, by reason of their present estate, especially in two cases:</p>
               <p>First, when God hath cut off all law full meanes and wayes of flying, and a man cannot escape but by unlawfull meanes; as an officious lye, hearing of Masse, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations,


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18868:66"/>
pealing &amp; discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the brethren, or the like. Here a man must abide the will of God, who hath called him to stand out, and do no evill to save his life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when a man is in hand or hold under the custody of the Magistrate, though unjustly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, he may not break prison, nor use violence; but obey the Magistrate in unjust sufferings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies counting it <hi>thank-worthy to endure griefe</hi> for GOD and Christ <hi>wrongfully, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what if the prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doore be left open, as sometime it may be, or hath been?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If God open a doore, this is not a breaking of prison. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles <hi>(Acts</hi> 5. 19.) used no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to get out; but when the Angel opened the door, they went away &amp; shifted for themselvs: &amp; thus not themselves only, but the Church was preserved in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:18868:66"/>
Now all these that are thus brought by God to the wrestling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, must strive for the best game, without shrinking or star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away.</p>
               <p>But there are a second sort, that <note place="margin">And who may.</note> are more free, and have liberty to avoid persecution by flight, in these three cases:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If any have not attained <note place="margin">1.</note> strength sufficient to bear the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity for Christ: our Saviour <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 28.</note> would have these costs to bee fore-cast, as in the Parable of the Builder, &amp; of the Captain muste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his forces. Only in not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strength bewail thy weaknes, &amp; use means of further strength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the danger be certain and <note place="margin">2.</note> present, not suspected or surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: for a man may not (as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas) by casting feares cast himself out of his calling; but if hee see certaine perill to himselfe, and no great hope of doing good by his stay, he may flye.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:18868:67"/>
3. If avoiding private respects (as loosing himselfe from duty, <note place="margin">3.</note> or out of excessive feare shifting for himselfe) hee ayme directly at the furthering of Gods glory, and Christs Kingdome: for it is a rule, in which wisdom &amp; consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must over-rule. If it may make more for Gods glory to flie, flie; if to stay, stay: thus seeking Gods Kingdom in the first place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how prove you, that such may flye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> By the commandement &amp; practice of Christ himselfe, <hi>Mat. 10. 23. If they persecute you in one city, flie into another:</hi> and so him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did. Hee could by miracle have saved himselfe; but for us he would rather humble himself by flying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 15. And, he was now as strong in spirit, &amp; as ready to dye, as he was afterwards: but Gods time was not yet come.</p>
               <p>So did the Apostles. Paul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persecuted at Damascus, was

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes: but in the severall rankes of beleevers God hath not set all his children in the same degree of grace; some are babes, some young, some old men. It is


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18868:68"/>
not greatest perfection for a childe, to offer to run before hee can goe; but boldnesse, which costeth him many knockes and falls. Neither for those of a lower stature in Christ, to cast themselves into danger, before, or further than need shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: for, when times come that GOD seeth fit for any by death to glorifie himselfe, and edifie his Church, his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will find meanes without a mans owne presumption to call him thereto.</p>
               <p>Now the point issuing out of the words thus expounded, is this:</p>

If any man come to me, and hate not all, yea even <hi>his owne life,</hi> he cannot be my Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: by <hi>hatred</hi> hee meanes not


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18868:69"/>
that affection <hi>simply</hi> considered, but in <hi>comparison,</hi> namely, if the love of God and our selves, the love of Christ and our friends cannot stand together: all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection must give place. <hi>Hebr. 12. 4. Yee have not yet resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted unto bloud:</hi> as if hee had said, Yee have resisted sinne unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, unto losse of substance, unto bonds, and other evils; but yet it remaines to resist unto bloud, as Christ did. <hi>Revelat.</hi> 12. 11. they that overcame by the bloud of the Testimony, and the bloud of the Lambe, <hi>loved not their lives to the death,</hi> that is, doubted not to hazzard them for the truth and faith: so as no torment could drive them from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 35. Wee have the cloud of witnesses before us in this duty: they were <hi>racked and slaine,</hi> and <hi>would not bee delivered,</hi> but refused the offer of life and


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18868:69"/>
liberty upon condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Gospel. The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall History mentioneth one Phileas, a Noble man and Martyr, who going to execution, seemed as one deafe at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, and blinde at the teares of his friends, moving him to spare himselfe: As the waters use to breake themselves on a rocke, so was hee altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible. And when one Philoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus defending him, said, <hi>How</hi>

                  <hi>can hee bee moved with teares on earth, whose eyes behold the glory of heaven?</hi> hee also was taken in, and both presently beheaded.</p>
               <p>Amongst our owne Martyrs, when at the stake many of them had letters of pardon offered, they would not looke at them, nor would bee delivered on their conditions. Others absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused them. One said shee came not thither to deny her Lord. Not one of them accepted them,

Againe, if wee looke on his merit and desert, hee loved not his life to death for us, but readily offered it up on our behalfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. How then should wee hold our selves bound in way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18868:70"/>
if wee had a thousand lives, to give them up for him? shall the Just for the unjust, and not the unjust for the Just?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if wee looke to the <note place="margin">2.</note> truth and Gospel: it is far more worthy than all wee can give in exchange for it; it cost Christ deare: hee thought it worthy of his life, and bought it with his precious bloud, which was <hi>the bloud of God, Act.</hi> 20. 28. &amp; should wee thinke much to buy it with our last bloud? Remember the precept, <hi>Pro. 23. 23. Buy the truth and sell it not,</hi> no not at any rate. God hath magnified his truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and so must wee: Shall not Christ shrink from the truth to save his life, and shall we, being called to witness, leave it in the plaine field?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, looke on our selves: <note place="margin">3.</note> 1. We are souldiers under Christs colours: A souldier in the field sels his life for a base pay, &amp; is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <p n="2">2. This is indeed rightly to love our selves, when wee can rightly hate our selves. We must learn to love our selves by not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our selves, who indeed hate our selves by loving our selves too well: And this is, if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve our Lord, to save &amp; preserve our life by thus casting it away. A man that will save his seed, &amp; not cast it away into the grrund, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it by such saving; but if hee sowe it, he reneweth it, &amp; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it somtime an hundred fold: So to lose thy self for Christ, is to save thy selfe, and to reap an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold: for it is but sowne to

Divorce not the parts of the text: as there is losse in the text, so there is a greater gain by it; as the harvest makes him a gainer, who in seed-time seemed a loser.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The case indeed is heavie, as Christ implied, saying, <hi>Wo be to them that give suck in those dayes:</hi> but, 1. thou art a saver, if thou sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest nothing but Christ: thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest well enough, if in case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thou lovest nothing but Christ: 2. cast thy care on the Lord, who is wont to save his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all appearance: And, speake not one word for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on thee, and two for thy selfe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the dayes (thankes bee to God) are peaceable, and there is no great need nor use of this doctrine.</p>

Wee know not how soon wee may have use of it; one powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow from under-ground may shake all our foundations. Little did the Christians in King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards daies thinke of such a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine change as Queene Mary brought in. 3. Never were Gods people neerer danger, than when they thought themselves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest off, and cried, Peace, peace. 4. No Christian is well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but hee that in peace hath attained a ready disposition to lay down his life at any warning


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18868:73"/>
for the Name of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But who would not give his life for Christ? all say they are ready.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet first if times should change, would they indeed, who now in daies of protection are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of the Gospel of Christ? would they stick to Christ, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes, who when hee weares a golden Crowne, thinke it good policie not to bee seene with him?</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it to bring mens lives in their hands, to Christ and his profession, to shrinke now for feare at the name of a Professor, and bee ready to faint to heare a damosell say, Surely thou art one of them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, would they suffer for the profession, that now scoffe &amp; scorne at Professors, under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful titles, that now are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors themselves, &amp; goe as far in persecuting as they can, and


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18868:74"/>
the lawes wil suffer? No, no: those that now robbe them of their good names, while the Gospel is publikely professed &amp; protected, would easily bereave them of their lives, if times would afford them lawes and liberty.</p>
               <p>So as the great part of the world is not resolved of this truth, that to lose the life for Christ is to save it; and those that now deny him in the peace of the Gospel, are farre from dying with him in the triall.</p>
               <p>Now because this is a building, which requireth great fore-cast, and is above naturall strength, we had need furnish our selves with all the helpes to set it forward, and fit our selves well to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of so difficult a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What are they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Begin with God: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume <note place="margin">I. Practices to prepare for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</note> not of thine owne strength, as Peter. It is a worke of sound

&amp; are well conceited of by others, because they are rich? but if either themselves or others should see how farre off salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are by means of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they would soon change their note and minde: And why may they not see this?

The wise Merchant that found the pearle, lost all to buy it. The Disciples left all for Christ. But easily may we see, how millions of men undervalue Christ in comparison of the world: for,</p>
               <p>First, what is the chiefe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <note place="margin">Signes of Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued fo th wrorld.</note> studie, time, costs and paines of men employed upon? is it not for the food that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, and profits of the world? in the meane time the labour for <note place="margin">1.</note> that durable food, and the Manna that came downe from heaven, is either none or formall, sleight, seldome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how are the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men generally bent? is <note place="margin">2.</note> Christ their chife joy, or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? hath. Shee gained their thoughts? delight they in his love, more than in life? Or see we not the multitude preferre the

world before their chiefe joy, set their hearts upon it, doat upon it, their thoughts runne first and last, and all day long after it, with unwearied delight and comfort? when in the meane time they banish thoughts of Christ, of their treasure, portion, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in heaven. How doe most men feare the losse of the world, more than the losse of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, their soules, and salvation? How doe they more grieve and sorrow in a trifling losse of the world, than when by sinne Gods favour and the grace of Christ is forfeited?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how do the speeches <note place="margin">3.</note> of men bewray them to bee worldlings? and if the speech be <hi>according to the abundance of the</hi>

                  </gap>avorie word concerning Christ, or the salvation of their soules? or speake to them the language of Canaan, it is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew? or thrust in a savory speech, of God, his word, or grace, how strange and unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come is it? their <hi>pennes</hi> tell us, that their <hi>hearts</hi> indite no good <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 1.</note> matter. Is not this to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Christ in comparison of the world? or is this to be a pilgrim, or to possesse, or rather to bee wholly possessed of the word?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> There is no man, whose ordinary theme is not more of the world, than of GOD or Christ: and will you therefore <note place="margin">Speeches of the world, how to bee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited.</note> conclude, that there is no man but loves the world better than Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Wee are all more carnall than spirituall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">1.</note> our thoughts and speeches, will be wandring: but wee must


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18868:98"/>
not please our selves herein, but mortifie and subdue carnall words as well as desires, and groane under this corruption: for, is it not a wofull and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull errour, that earth and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing things should more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and possesse us, than the great things given us of God in Christ?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I grant wee have callings, and earthly affaires, <note place="margin">2.</note> which tye us ordinarily to speak and thinke of such things: but the speciall calling of a Christian must bee ever subordinate to the generall, and in all earthly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a man must carry an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minde. God gives no leave to be earthly-minded, even while a man is earthly-employed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the speaking and thinking more of a thing upon <note place="margin">3.</note> necessitie doth not ever argue more love unto it, but the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and thinking of things out


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18868:98"/>
of the valuation of judgement: for instance, A workeman thinkes more of his tooles, and an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman speakes more of his husbandrie, than of his wife or children, because these are the object of his labour; but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not, hee loves them better, because he doth not in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment esteeme these better. Now let a Christian preserve in his judgement a better estimate of Christ, and heavenly things, and his speeches in things earthly will still preferre that, and runne upon it.</p>
               <p>So of the two former proofes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he loseth his soule for <note place="margin">3.</note> the world, that for wealth or by wealth hinders his owne salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as numbers doe by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full getting the world, falling downe before the divell for it: wealth is even the divels wages for some sinne committed, being either gotten or kept by evill

               <p>Of the former sort are such as live by dicing houses, filthy <note place="margin">Unlawfull callings make wealth dangerous, when got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> houses, and the like places of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish resort, which may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the divells houses of office. And those that live by unthriftie gaines, by usury, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, making the instruments of pride and sinne, or a calling to which they are not fitted, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient Ministers, who runne but are not sent, because they are not gifted: God need not send a message by the hand of a foole.</p>
               <p>Of the latter sort are, first, those <note place="margin">Or the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of lawfull.</note> that enrich themselves for doing a dutie which they doe not, as grosse Non-residents, that feed <note place="margin">1.</note> themselves, but not the flocke: or for doing that they ought not to doe, as Lawyers, who take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for pervertings equity and

               <p>Secondly, when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <note place="margin">2.</note> to hold men, and uphold them in a course of sinne and damnable lusts, as riot, gaming, drinking, whoring, pride, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or the like: or when men waste them in contentions and quarrels needlesly, as some penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious snake that cannot finde a groat in many yeares to uphold the ministry, or any good motion, yet can finde pounds and pieces good store, to spend against his Minister or neighbours, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe his rotten and crooked wil.

Secondly, make Christ thy friend, by relieving his poore <note place="margin">2.</note> members, whom wee have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with us, not onely to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their humility and patience, but also the mercy and liberality of the rich: and Christ acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, what is done to them is done to himself: and who would not relieve Christ, if he stood in


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18868:103"/>
need? Thirdly, make the poore <note place="margin">3.</note> thy friends, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, by their prayers, and testimonie of thy charity. The loynes and bellies of the poore blessed <hi>Job: Obadiah</hi> fed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God: <hi>Dorcas</hi> made gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the poore: <hi>Cornelius</hi> his almes came up before God, and obtained a remembrance. Fourthly, make all men thy <note place="margin">4.</note> friends; <hi>To do good and distribute, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased, Heb. 13. 16. Doe good unto all, especially the houshold of faith, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. How fit is it, that the necessities of men in want should bee relieved by such as are laden with super flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to this very end, to doe good to others?<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the gathering of wealth should be like the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Manna (Exod.</hi> 16. 17.) whereof some gathered more, and some lesse, but so as hee that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered more, had no overplus,


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18868:104"/>
and hee that gathered lesse, had no want. Fiftly, make thy selfe <note place="margin">5. Terrena om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Greg. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6.</note> thine owne friend, by laying up a good foundation in good works, by an hopefull and liberall seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: <hi>for he that soweth sparingly, shall reape sparingly:</hi> and by workes of mercy further both thy reckoning, and reward of mercie: All which blessing and reward they wilfully deprive themselves of, who neither for their Masters honour, nor the good of their fellow-servants, no nor for heaven and salvation it selfe, will part with any thing; but in stead of blessing lay up judgement mercilesse for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, shewing no mercie.</p>
               <p>So of the first meanes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, use riches to serve God with more <hi>cheerfulnesse,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> and with a good heart in the midst of <hi>abundance.</hi> A rich man <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 47.</note> may have more freedome to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the word, more time for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18868:104"/>
prayer, reading, and godly conference; which time and spare houres the poore want, who are bound to their daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and must not bee spent by the rich in riot, in lusts, in gaming and idlenesse, but in doubling their measure of grace, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the meanes of grace, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hearing, praying, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so much the more, as God hath freed them from the inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant labour, care and travell of others. For, if thou hast so many spare houres, thou must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whether thou art richer in grace, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those houres, than those that have no such release from their labour. But in stead hereof, how have the things of the world thrust in upon many, to take up their thoughts, to unsetle good resolutions, to resist good motions and duties, to justle out the course of fruitfull conversing


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18868:105"/>
with God! Oh what hurt have their soules sustained in all these particulars!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, draw out of these <note place="margin">3.</note> outward things a spirituall use: for else the beasts use them as fruitfully as wee. For example: when I see my selfe or others so intent to treasure in earth, I must turne mine eyes upward, and say to my selfe, Alasse, what am I doing! I professe my selfe cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and called out of the world, that I am a citizen of heaven, that I am risen with Christ, &amp;c. and must I drowne my thoughts in earth, and not seeke things above? I professe the pure religion, which keepeth it selfe unspotted of the world: and being called out of the world, I must in the world looke for affliction which ever attendeth the chusing of the better part: I must not now live after the cours of the world, as in times past: I am crucified to the


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18868:105"/>
world, &amp; the word to mee: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve two Masters, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so contrary things, nor share my heart betweene God and the world, nor have one foot in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and another in earth; sinfull pleasures will never suit with spirituall joyes and delights. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, doe I cast mine eyes upon my own or other mens full cups, and large revenues? and is my earthly heart working it owne contentment in the abundance of outward blessings? now must I checke it, and bend it backward, and say to it, Alasse, what will it availe mee to leave barnes full, houses full, chests full of treasure, and carry my soule emptie away in respect of true grace? And thus, one way or other, a good heart may still helpe it selfe by temporalls.</p>

                  <hi>Let the Heathen be wakened, and come to the valley of Jehosaphat:</hi> for there I will sit to judge all the Heathen round about. But allegoricall and typicall prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are not to be expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the type and similitude; which seemes to be this: As that valley of <hi>Engeddi</hi> (called the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> from the noble victory of <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> against the Moabites, Ammonites, and other enemies gathered against the Church) was situate in the sight of the city Jerusalem, and mount, a type of the Church: so the Lord will revenge and judge all his enemies, before or in the last judgement day, in the sight of all his holy people, and Saints, who in their manner shall judge the world. And hence some godly and judicious Divines have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceived, that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat shall bee set up in some

place neare Jerusalem, both to increase the terror of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the glory of Christ, to sit there as Judge where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was judged. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it as a resolved opinion, is rash and ungrounded.</p>
               <p>Others thinke it shall be upon the earth, that the sentence may bee given where the facts have beene committed, that Christ may shew himselfe a Conqueror where the combate was, and justly condemne others where himselfe was unjustly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And sundry things of the Fathers sound hereunto. But in vaine should wee seeke a reason of that, which whether it selfe shall be, is altogether unknown. If the Scriptures had said it should bee on earth, then the reasons were good. But, wherever it is, the wicked shall <hi>looke on him whom they have pierced.</hi>

               <p>True it is, that Christ now <note place="margin">Ans.</note> glorified hath laid downe all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and knowes both the day and houre, and in this his exalted estate is ignorant of none of the workes of God, which have beene, are, or shall bee, his Deitie enlightning his humane soule.

                  <hi>To the Saints:</hi> when they shall behold him that was betrayed, spitted upon, crucified, pierced, dead, buried, now advanced above all men and Angels, and crowned with honour above all that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature is capable of.</p>
               <p>But <hi>in the Saints</hi> also hee shall be marvellous: 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. for when Christ who is our life, shall

appeare, <hi>we also shall appeare with him in glory, Col.</hi> 3. 4. First, the members shall partake of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Head, that the Head may bee exalted in the glory of the members. Secondly, the Saints shall admire, not only his glory in himselfe, but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. How admirable will it be to see themselves, who were in the world accounted the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweepings, and driven out of the world with obloquie, contempt, fire and sword, yea who were but even now dust and ashes, newly crept out of the grave and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse, so suddainly to attaine that fulnes of the glory of Christ, in their soules and bodies! In their soules, such a wonderfull perfection of Gods image, such deepe knowledge of the secrets of heaven and earth, such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in their wils unto God, clothed with such righteousnesse as God in his presence-chamber

is delighted to behold. And their whole bodies changed, and aray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with immortalitie, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made spirituall bodies <hi>like the glorious body</hi> of Jesus Christ. And the whole man filled <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> with rivers of pleasures at Gods right hand, and swallowed up with that happinesse which eye hath not seene, nor ever entred into the earth of man. This glory have all the Saints, in whom the glory of Christ in his appearing is complete.</p>
               <p>Note hence the long-suffering and patience of our Lord Jesus <note place="margin">

               <p>Againe, let this bee a ground of patience and contentednesse, if <note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, as all the power of the country attends the Judge to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <note place="margin">3.</note> malefactors, so Christ hath obtained <hi>great might and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to destroy the wicked, Rev.</hi> 11. 17, 18. so as his revenge must be proportionall to his power, and his power shall make his processe short, and his dispatch speedie.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Their ministrie serveth to set forth the glory of Christ the head. The most potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs that ever were in earth, in


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18868:156"/>
their most stately and most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent showes were but seely creatures and wormes to this, and attended with weak men and flyes in comparison of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That by their ministery the great worke of the great day <note place="margin">2.</note> may bee powerfull, and speedily dispatched. For,</p>

For besides that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them is mighty in his owne nature, and thence denominated <hi>principalities and powers,</hi> and said to <hi>excell in strength, Psal.</hi> 103. 20. so shall now for the time the power of Christ bee added to their owne, which shall bee of such invincible strength in every one, as Satan and all the gates of

hell cannot, much lesse the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the world shall be able to resist any one of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they shall doe it <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,</hi> because their wills are <note place="margin">Willingly:</note> wholly conformable to the will of Christ, whom they love with all their strength.

the will of God, in whole and in every part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they shall doe it <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Diligently:</note> 
                  <hi>and perfectly,</hi> in most strict and exact manner. For they could not continue in their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous estate, if they should not bee every way answerable to the law of God, both in the puritie of their nature, and in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their worke: for how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Angels compared with God are imperfect <hi>(Job, chap. 4. vers. 18.)</hi> yet in comparison of Gods Law they have perfection, and no spot of sinne cleaveth to them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it shall bee done <hi>speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Speedily. Rev. 4. 8.</note> and in the <hi>twinkling of an eye,</hi> with unconceiveable quicknesse and celeritie; which is noted by their <hi>wings</hi> and <hi>girded breasts,</hi> readie and prest to the businesse of their Lord.</p>

be of use against all wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First, to force them, and present them before the Judge, be they never so rebellious: for they shall <hi>blow the trumpet,</hi> that all <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 16.

Secondly, to be (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) witnesses, and give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against the ungodly, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny secret sinnes: sure wee are, they attend our Congregations (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.) and why not in our private chambers? Thirdly, to be instruments of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the wicked, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 41, 42. the reapers shall gather the tares, and <hi>cast them into unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So of the third.</p>

that day, for first they shall with admirable expedition gather the Saints out of their graves from all the foure windes, and bring them into the presence of Christ: secondly, as they attended them in their humilitie, so now shall their service be exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in that day: never was <hi>Hagar</hi> so comforted by an Angell in her distresse, when hee refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with water, as they shall be by the Angels in this day of refreshing: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1.

                  </gap>ire, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels shall helpe and hide them, that the fire shall not hurt them; that looke as the three servants of GOD walked in the midst of the fire, and had no hurt, onely their chaines were loosed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>God sent his Angell among them, Dan.</hi> 3. 25. so here all the godly shall bee safe in that fire, which shall drive the wicked to desperation, not able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those terrible burnings. And that fire shall resemble the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the red sea, which was a wall to Israel, but a well and pit to drowne <hi>Egypt.</hi> Yea and as that fire of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that sheltred Gods servants from the Tyrant, but licked up and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the enemie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas Satan at that day, being at his last &amp; most desperate

               <p>Thus the office and ministrie of the Angels shall marvellously set out the glory of Christ, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the worke of the great day, bee serviceable for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ruine of all enemies, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily advance the comfort and salvation of the Saints, in these particulars. But I read not in the

Scripture a word of those chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and ridiculous conceits of <hi>Petrus Thyreus</hi> a Jesuite, who in <note place="margin">Jesuites feigned of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for Angels at that day.</note> the description of Christs glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearing appoints some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to beare up the cloud, and hold up the seat of the Judge, and some to beare the crosse before him, others the crown of thornes, others the nailes, others the speare and other instruments of his passion: Which he hath grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed, because hee hath seene these things finely &amp; artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially painted upon tables: Sound proofes of Jesuites: when they want grounds from Prophets and <note place="margin">Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, and into the earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Angels being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though they fill &amp; occupie no place, yet must needs be defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in some place, now in one, and then in another, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time locally ascend, and locally descend, after a manner unknown to us. Hence in <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 12.</note> the Angels are said to <hi>ascend and descend:</hi> and not onely in <hi>vision,</hi> but <hi>actually, Luk. 1. 26. Gabriel</hi> was <hi>sent from GOD to a Citie in Galilee.</hi> So our soules are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substances, and yet they <hi>local<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ascend to heaven,</hi> and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection <hi>descend from heaven</hi> to be united to their bodies. In like sort the Angels are described to be of most quicke motion, and for their celeritie and swiftnesse are compared to the <hi>windes,</hi> and have <hi>wings</hi> ascribed to them, as flying with most swift motion about


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18868:160"/>
their Lords commands. And so must it needs bee: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their motion is <hi>without all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The nature of their motion.</note> 
                  <hi>resistance</hi> of bodily substances: no body can resist an unbodily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and all resistance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">1.</note> bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being without resistance, <note place="margin">2.</note> their motions are <hi>without all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or wearinesse:</hi> they are rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in their motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It must be most speedy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>by no meanes hindred:</hi> so as <note place="margin">3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> in a short time, above that wee can perceive, they can move be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene heaven and earth. I say not, <hi>in a moment;</hi> for Angels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not locally move betweene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, as from heaven to earth, but by passing <hi>the meane,</hi> which is to be done <hi>in time,</hi> though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>short.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee conclude, that the spiritual nature of Angels, though it occupie and <hi>fill no place</hi> as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies doe, nor hath any <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptive</hi>


                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:18868:161"/>
place assigned them as they, and though by their motion in place they neither expell nor move any body out of place; yet are they moved locally, and shall descend with Christ to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and quickly expedite all things belonging to it by their Ministrie.</p>
               <p>Observe hence a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">

               <p>For first, hee comes now with another manner of traine, than hee had following him upon earth: Then he had twelve poore <hi>fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1.

                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:18868:161"/>
and to suffer for sin: but now he is to judge righteously, and to revenge sin. Fourthly, he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">4.</note> the Lord of the holy Angels, and therefore in his <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>agonie,</hi> they were readie to <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 11. Luk. 22. 43.</note> comfort him: and when hee was at the weakest, hee was of power to command <hi>many legions</hi> of <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 53.</note> them: but that was not the time to shew forth his Majestie by their attendance, as this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is. Fiftly, those Angels <note place="margin">5.</note> which ministred unto him in his incarnation and birth, in his life and death, were Angels <hi>of grace,</hi> Preachers to shepheards, Disciples, women and others, appearing sometimes by one or two, to one or two persons.

                  <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>earth shall confesse him:</hi> and Christ himselfe, to prove his headship, useth the same argument, <hi>Joh. 1. 52. Hereafter shall yee see the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ascending and descending on the Sonne of man,</hi> that is, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string to him as the head of the Church, as was figured in <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. for Christ is <hi>the ladder,</hi> by which onely wee ascend to heaven: this ladder reached from heaven to earth, noting his two natures, <hi>divine</hi> from his Father in heaven, and <hi>humane</hi> from <hi>Jacobs</hi> loynes on earth: <hi>Angels ascend and descend on it,</hi> noting their <hi>emission</hi> and <hi>admission,</hi> descending to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ascending to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:18868:162"/>
Besides, he must be greatest of <note place="margin">2.</note> all, who is honoured of all: and so Christs eminencie above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is proved, because <hi>all the Angels of heaven must honour him, Heb.</hi> 1. 6. And the more, and more honourable the Attendants and Ministers be, the greater is the personage so attended: but the Angels are every where spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as the excellencie of the Creation; and in the glory of these servants behold the glory of their Lord.</p>
               <p>Againe, their <hi>incessant service</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> to Jesus Christ advanceth his glory: <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 31. the vaile of the Tabernacle which covered the most holy (expresly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the flesh of Christ which hid and covered his Deity) must bee made of broydered worke <hi>with Cherubims:</hi> not without Cherubims, which noted the multitude of Angels serving Christ. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 20. The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18868:163"/>
signifying the Angels, must lift their wings on high, as attending Christ, and their faces must bee to the Mercy-seat; which lively resembled Christ, on whom their eyes must still be cast, as the eye of the handmaide to the hand of her Mistresse.</p>
               <p>Thus wee shall see how they served Christ as man, even in his lowest estate, as well as in his highest. In his birth they sang glory to God, and were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of him to shepheards. After his temptations they <hi>ministred to him,</hi> spreading a table for him in the wildernesse, and waiting at his table, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 11. In his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the garden they <hi>comforted</hi> him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 43. In the grave they <hi>roll away the stone</hi> for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2. In his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension they waite upon him, and <hi>lead him to the Ancient of dayes,</hi> of whom he received a kingdome over all creatures, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13.


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18868:163"/>
But much more now they attend him, and assist him in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day, wherein hee is to put forth his greatest power and glory, in the most glorious worke that ever was or can be.</p>

               <hi>Christian must runne:</hi> for, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is nothing but a race,</hi> and every Christian must <hi>runne the race set before him, Hebr.</hi> 12. 1.

            <p>Now Christian life is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">And that in siv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18868:202"/>
for five respects conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As all running must be in a way, and within bounds and <note place="margin">1.</note> limits: so here, the way to run in, is the <hi>way of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, Psal.</hi> 119. 30. This is the right and good way, the lightest and shortest way, the fairest and cleanest way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all windings or turnings to the right or left hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In running is a strife and <note place="margin">2.</note> contention: so in the Christian race: but the strife is not by speed or swiftnesse of feet, but a spirituall strife, of faith, vertue, piety, good conscience and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And as in a race the whole man runneth and striveth and every part of the runner: so in this race, a man cannot have religion in his mouth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and say hee will runne, but scarce move hand or foot in any good duty: no man can run with his tongue, and his foot


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18868:203"/>
stand still. Israel professed, that <hi>whatsoever the Lord commanded</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deu 5: 27</note> 
               <hi>they would doe:</hi> here were good words: but how often did they tempt him in the Desart? <hi>Paul</hi> would not runne, as <hi>beating the ayre</hi> with bare words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26. Neither doth the kingdome <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 20</note> of God stand <hi>in word, but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> which is, when in all things wee labour to keepe faith and good conscience, in all things, before God and all men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In running there is a goale <note place="margin">3</note> or prize which we run for. The prize or Crowne for which we runne, is everlasting glory: not a crowne or wreath of flowers, but an <hi>incorruptible crowne, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As in a race are spectators, <note place="margin">4.</note> and the Vmpire that gives the crowne or prize: so here, the spectators are <hi>men and- Angels,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4 9</note> and the Vmpire is God, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt Iudge, who, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the race, giveth the


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18868:203"/>
crowne to every one that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth well.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As at the end of the race, <note place="margin">5.</note> the wager is wonne or lost, and the crowne received or mist: and as the race is runne, so it is disposed: so at the end of our life, the prize of eternall life is either wonne or lost; and if it be in the race lost, it can never be recovered, neither by bribe nor intreaty. If in this life we win it, we weare it, or else it is lost for eternitie.</p>
            <p>Thus Christian life is a race.</p>
            <p>Next, why must we runne this race? <note place="margin">2. Reasons why wee must run this race.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is no standing in Religion: and the way is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long which we have to goe: we have a large journey, as farre as betwixt heaven and earth; and <note place="margin">1</note> though we <hi>runne,</hi> we shall come in slow enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The time is short which <note place="margin">2.</note> is allotted to runne this race: namely, the time of this life,


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18868:204"/>
which is but as a vapour, a post, an arrow flying in the ayre: the day is short, the night hastens, and our feare of being benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted should hasten us thorow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The parties against whom <note place="margin">3</note> we runne, are very swift and cunning to supplant: sor wee runne against <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> the devill, our flesh, sin <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 12</note> and sinners, who incessantly seeke to slacke our course in this race; sometimes casting in our way (as <hi>Medea)</hi> a peece of flesh, and sometimes golden Apples (as the Poets feigne, of <hi>Atlanta)</hi> that is, the profits or pleasures of this life, all to cast us backe in our way: nay, our owne incumbrances are so many, as wee need no other to slow our pace: So as the swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test runner shall come slow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and if the <hi>runner</hi> scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be saved, where shall the <hi>loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer</hi> appeare?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wee must runne, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">4.</note>


               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:18868:204"/>
both our disaffecting and distasting things below, which we hasten from, as also our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest affecting and desire of the goale and crowne which is in our eye: as the two Disciples, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> runne to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne <note place="margin">Ioh 20, 4.</note> one another, through earnest desire which of them should first see Christ being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen: so the Christian must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and strive who may enjoy Christ first and most, and see him as he is.</p>
            <p>But <hi>when</hi> must we runne?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Our whole life must be <note place="margin">3 Al our life, the time of this race.</note> a race. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. Passe the whole time of your pilgrimage here in feare.</hi> Now is the time to winne or lose the goale. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life is wonne or lost in this life. Spare thy paines here, and there shall bee no spare of thy paines hereafter. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take the time, even this day: as a wise runner will set out betime, and get the start if


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18868:205"/>
he can, of his Adversary: <hi>Psal. 119. 60. I made hast, and delayed not to keepe thy Commandements.</hi>

What an unfit businesse a race is for those times: a man to run had need of health and strength and not bee bound on his bed of sickenesse. 2. It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that hee should runne to <note place="margin">2</note> heaven in his death, that hath beene running to hel all his life. for as the tree leaneth, so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it falleth and lyeth. 3. Wisedome will tell a man, <note place="margin">3</note> that sicknesse and death are the time to end our running, not to beginne it: and that Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is a <hi>race</hi> to heaven, not a <hi>jumpe:</hi> and the way is long, and needs both a <hi>long time,</hi> and <hi>good speed</hi> to attaine it. <note place="margin">4.

            </p>
            <p>Now if wee must runne in the


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18868:205"/>
Christian course, we learne how <note place="margin">Conceit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of a Christian course.</note> to conceive of the sound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion; namely, that it is a laborious and painefull course, as running is a violent motion, and a straining exercise wherein the whole man must runne; especially when a man runneth up an hill, as we doe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven. And therefore <note place="margin">Who doe not.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They are deceived, that <note place="margin">1</note> thinke a sound Christian can live at ease, or in security. Is a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of flowers denyed to him that loves his ease better than the toyle of the race; and is the Crowne of eternall life given without labour? or can it stand with the excellency of salvation to be so easily attained? or is it not worth all our diligence, to <note place="margin">2 Pet. i. 10</note>

Now consider, if Christ bee the chiefe and onely ayme of thy life, thy prize, thy purchase, thy all in all, in comparison of whom all else is drosse and dung.

But very few make Christ the marke whereat they runne: few hold him in their eyes and thoughts. And what can they hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at length, that never runne at a right marke?

               <hi>Rom. 9. 16.

And they looke not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that looke asquint with the Galathians, partly at Iesus, and partly at <hi>Moses;</hi> partly nt faith, partly at merits, as Papists; whereas the eye of faith lookes right forward <hi>at Jesus, the author and finisher of faith and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 2.

way, being all strawed with crosses, but will choose a faire broad way though it carry them cleane from the marke. Why doe they not consider, that they leave the way wherein Christ himselfe walked, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? and that the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a strait way, and few find it?</p>
            <p>Secondly, carnall friends and <note place="margin">2</note> bad society is as a chaine to fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and as a leaden weight han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the heeles of many, that say they run for heaven: These will perswade, as <hi>Peter</hi> did Christ, <hi>Master, pitty thy selfe,</hi>

much moved, or much regard the speeches of men.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How may I doe so?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:18868:220"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> By three rules: First, hold fast the <hi>doctrine</hi> of grace: hold it strongly, both in thy judgement, and in thy affection: get not onely knowledge, but the love of knowledge: sticke conscionably to the meanes, both publike and private. For spirituall strength is maintained by spirituall meanes, as naturall by naturall. And by meeting God in Sion, in his owne Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Gods people <hi>walke from strength to strength, Psal.</hi> 84. 7. Secondly, hold fast the <hi>degree</hi> of grace, that thou fall not from thy <hi>first love,</hi> first zeale and heat. What hope of his attaining the <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4.</note> marke before him, that goeth backward? Now the way to keepe grace in the degree, is, partly to repent of all, to cast out and keepe out all sinnes, small and great, open or secret; partly to <hi>respect all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6</note> even the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, costly, and dangerous.


<pb n="392" facs="tcp:18868:221"/>
Thirdly, hold on the <hi>act</hi> of grace: by keeping al graces in exercise, and blowing up every grace which else wil lye hid and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in corruption, asfire in ashes. Every new act wil grow into an habit and custome, and habits are easie. Thou that intendest to attaine, must get forward, and gaine ground; never contenting thy selfe with one gift of grace, nor with one degree of that gift, nor with one or a few acts or exercises; but be adding, as to vertue, faith; so faith to faith: see 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A runner, through haste in his way, may easily stumble <note place="margin">6. Recover speedily out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fall.</note> and fall: and if thou fallest in thy running, thou must speedily rise by humble confession, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and repentance. Hee that lyes in his fall, shall never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the marke. Wee say it is no shame to fall, but it is a shame to lye still. But in our spirituall course it is a great shame, in such

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may I be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, <note place="margin">Motives so to runne, that we may obtain 1</note> thus to strive to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Consider this: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else thou attainest, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a shadow, smoake, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: all thy wealth is but beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, all pleasure but bitternesse, all mirth but madnesse. If thou attainest not this goale, nothing that thou attainest can make thee better, every thing makes thee much worse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As good never run, as not <note place="margin">2</note> attaine: for, not attaining, thou losest all thy beginnings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and all thy labour is lost; thou hast done and <hi>suffered


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:18868:222"/>
many things in vaine.</hi> Besides, thou loosest all thy talents, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">Cal 3. 4.</note> profession, hearing, prayers, sufferings: all is lost. Finally, thou loosest all thy righteousnes, charity, mercy, reward and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; all thy hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. It is farre worse and more <note place="margin">3</note> unhappy, to run and not attaine, then not to run at all.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes by permission, not Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: not in respect of the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> by whom he was moved, which was the Spirit of God: but in respect of the <hi>matter,</hi> which being a thing not of such

absolute necessity, he was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to choose a manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very proportionall; conceiving it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itter to perswade them in a thing indifferent, as more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, than to lay an absolute command, as if it were a thing absolutely necessary. 2. Where he saith he thinkes hee hath the Spirit of God, hee speakes not <hi>doubtfully,</hi> (for he was sure hee had:) but <hi>humbly,</hi> by an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall <hi>meiosis</hi> or diminution, so to checke the boasting of proud and false Apostles, who to magnifie themselves, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuante and elevate <hi>Pauls</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, made great brags of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which they said <hi>Paul</hi> wanted.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:18868:227"/>
their persons and acts are the principall matter of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because hee is the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">3</note> and maintainer of them: for else had they long since beene lost and perished, by the rage of Tyrants and Heretickes, but chiefly by the wrath of Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His by eminency, for the <note place="margin">4 Eminency of these statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other</note> excellency and perfection of them, and to distinguish them from all the lawes and statutes of men: for,</p>
            <p>First, all mens lawes are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, <note place="margin">1</note> alterable, abrogated or changed at their pleasure: but <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7</note> the <hi>Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> and as unchangeable as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for this present life one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">2</note> and bind not beyond it: but these are eternall, the charter and rule of heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they may direct and command, but give no ability to <note place="margin">3</note>


               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:18868:227"/>
performe, as they doe. They may curbe and represse the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of nature, but cannot change the nature, nor alter the man: but Gods statutes not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the way, but lead into the way; not onely restraine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but abolish it. It <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the soule,</hi> and changeth the heart and life:</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they for their end conduce to a well ordering of a <note place="margin">4.</note> civill and sociable life amongst men, in peace and honesty: but Gods statutes to the ordering of a spirituall and holy life among Saints, before God, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of grace and glory.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, those being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, <note place="margin">5</note> the Law-maker may pardon; or he may give a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation to himselfe to violate them, and none is above him in his Kingdome to punish him. <hi>David</hi> the King needs not much to feare any law of man: but Gods statutes transgressed, none


<pb n="406" facs="tcp:18868:228"/>
but God can pardon; from whom no flesh can get dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to offend in the least branch but it shall be revenged in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or his surety.</p>
            <p>So of the second generall.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, why doth <hi>David</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. Why it is called the way of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Metaphor of a way, what it implyes. 1</note> call the word <hi>the way</hi> of Gods statutes? which hath a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, and noteth singularity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Metaphor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, that we are all <hi>travellers</hi> here in a strange countrey, and travelling home, <hi>Heb</hi> 11 13, 14 But the way we know not, nor can man or Angell teach us the way, unlesse God shew it to us, as he did to <hi>Adam,</hi> who could lose his way, but of himselfe could never finde it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implyeth, that God hath <note place="margin">2</note> made knowne <hi>the way</hi> in his word: called the way, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it points us the way, as also because it leads us to heaven and happinesse, as a way tends to some end, or intended place.


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:18868:228"/>
Hence it is called the <hi>way of God, Acts</hi> 18. 26. the way <hi>of peace, Luk.</hi> 1. 79. the way of <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Act.</hi> 16. 17. the way <hi>of life, Psal.</hi> 16. 11. because it leads us to these, as a way to a City.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It implyeth, that this way <note place="margin">3</note> and word of God must be <hi>known</hi> of us, as the way must be of a traveller: And therefore as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and as <hi>David</hi> here, wee must bee ever asking after the way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It implyeth, that as a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller must keep the beaten and <note place="margin">4.</note> high-way, so must these Statutes be pathed and trodden of all the travellers of heaven; neither must wee turne out of this way <hi>to the right or left hand.</hi> Our thoughts must not stray out of <note place="margin">Esa. 30. 21</note> the way, as it is said, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> implyes in this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, that whosoever are <note place="margin">5</note> out of this way, and transgresse these statutes, they wander from the God of peace, and from life,


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:18868:229"/>
are out of Gods protection, and lyable to all the curses of the Law, as men out of the Kings high-way are out of the Kings protection. Hence it is said of wicked men, <hi>Psal. 14. 3. They are all gone out of the way:</hi> and, the way of peace they <hi>have not knowne.</hi> And as a man having lost his way, knowes not where he shall lodge, so such as goe on their owne wayes, following the lusts of their hearts and eies, are blind-folded and carried by Satan to the lodging of death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eternall.</p>
            <p>These things lye in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor.</hi>

face to shine, but wisdome? whereas, what an unseemely thing is ignorance of Gods sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to a man, either as a man, or as a Christian?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As a man:</hi> God having <note place="margin">Ignorance unseemely to a man, as a man.</note> given a man a minde and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable soule, beyond a beast, whereby he hath enabled him to conceive of heaven and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and hath elevated him with a particle of Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this very end, that hee should rise above the beasts in high contemplations of Divine things, and in the knowledge and obedience of the minde and will of his Creator: how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely is it, that that Divine minde should bee taken up with base, transitory, and sinfull things? that a man should thus degenerate, and fall backe to a brutish condition, forgetting he hath a reasonable soule, which <hi>David</hi> rates in himselfe, whose <note place="margin">Psa 73. 22.</note>

in one point of Gods providence and administration, makes him as <hi>a beast before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Christian man, yet <note place="margin">Especially as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man.</note> much more unseemely: for a Christian professeth himselfe to be a Citizen of heaven, heaven to be his Countrey, God to be his King, his Word and Statutes to be his Charter: now is it not absurd and unseemly, that a man should be ignorant of the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lawes, and customes of his owne Countrey?

and unreasonable were it for him to cast away the deeds of his land, to breake off the seales, to bee wilfully ignorant of the clauses that convay such an estate unto him and his?</p>
            <p>So of the second Motive.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, consider the delight and pleasure in the Statutes of God, which are full of sweet ravishments to such as attaine them, and should quicken us to the taste and feeding on them. In other things we see what paines men will take to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe their pleasure. Now as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is most uncomfortable, fitly therefore compared to <hi>darknesse,</hi> to blindnesse, to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a pit, and to lying in a <note place="margin">Prov 4. 19.</note> blacke and stinking dungeon: So knowledge and wisdome, which is compared to <hi>light,</hi> and the <hi>bright shining of the Sunne, Prov.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Knowledg delightfull to mans understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> 4. is most delightful to the soule, as the light to the eye:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In it selfe: because know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

is the proper worke of understanding, and the highest part of man: and as a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally delighteth in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of naturall things, so an enlightned minde in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divine and spirituall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And especially in respect <note place="margin">Specially for the excellent obiects.</note> of the Object, which is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things: This made <hi>Salomon</hi> say <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17.) all the wayes of wisdome are <hi>wayes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> For what man, unlesse he have an infinite distemper in his soule, would not be ravished to know in some measure those infinite perfections of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, whereto we are commanded to strive? yea, to see in some sort the unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble depths of Gods wisedome and knowledge? and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in some measure the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse mystery of mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and salvation? Was it not an admirable delight, when <hi>Moses</hi> stood upon the top

            <p>This of the third Motive.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, consider the way wherein we are to walke: <hi>the</hi>

            <p>First, a continuall strife to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all the hinderers of saving knowledge; for light ever figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth against darknesse. And the lets to be removed, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Originall corruption: a chiefe part of which is darknesse of understanding. Labour in mortifying naturall corruption, which as a blacke cloud hinders the shine of this Sunne.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Actuall sinnes: the nature of all which is, to increase igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and blind the minde yet further. Of these, some <hi>keepe out</hi> knowledge, some <hi>drive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

which besot men, and diminish even naturall knowledge: see <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The pleasure of sinne: as <hi>Eve</hi> in tempting, and <hi>Adam</hi> in attempting the sinne, the very sight and beauty of the Apple dazelled the cleare knowledge of innocency. And as the sinne of the Sodomites smote them with blindnesse of body, that they could not finde the doore: so doth it much more the soule of the sinner, that he cannot find Christ who is the doore of life.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

them: for, till they be in part subdued, there is no possibility of saving knowledge, no more then of Sun-shine at midnight.</p>

thus keepe the Law, and much lesse attaine a further perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were to get beyond <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency.</p>

In which similitude is implyed, 1. That the whole life of a Christian is a very pilgrimage on earth: 2. That the Christian Pilgrim, now absent from God, must be very choyce of his way, in which he must come backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto God. 3. That see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sunne is seene onely by his owne light, and every man is


<pb n="478" facs="tcp:18868:264"/>
as a blind man in the things of God, without all direction in himselfe, therefore every one must pray with the Prophet, that the eternall Sunne would strike if it be but one beame of this saving light upon his heart; and by that, he will be directed to the whole body; with holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that if the Lord please to afford him but a small streame out of his fulnesse, he will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that riveret untill it bring him to the well-head.</p>
            <p>But why is this the scope of a godly man in learning Gods sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because this is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Reasons. 1</note> of Gods teaching, and his intention in teaching: <hi>Deut 4, 5, 6. These are the Statutes</hi> and <hi>Commandements, which I have taught you: keepe them, and doe them,</hi> for this <hi>is your wisdome.</hi> And the Lord cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully teacheth him the way, who with <hi>David</hi> resolveth to keepe


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:18868:264"/>
it: <hi>Psal. 25. 12. What is the man that feareth the Lord? him will hee teach the way, that hee shall choose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>knowledge</hi> of a way <note place="margin">2</note> will bring none to his end and desired place, but the <hi>keeping</hi> of the way: whence the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes a narrow keeping of the narrow way: <hi>Prov. 7. 1. My sonne, keepe my words, hide my Commandements, binde them on thy fingers;</hi> that is, keepe them in thy whole practice: nay, <hi>keepe them as the apple of thine eye;</hi> implying, that as nothing can be so small or slight, but it hurteth and disturbeth the eye, which naturally shuts it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the least dust, so not the least erring from the Word but disturbeth in this way. And therefore we must take up that holy counsell, <hi>Prov. 4. 26. Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the path of thy feet, and let all thy wayes bee ordered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>

3. So many as are the Lords, <note place="margin">3</note> have the guidance of the Spirit, who leads and preserves them in this way: whence the godly, who are taught of God, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> whose office is to lead out of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14</note> into all truth. And from hence is this way called <hi>the way</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 20.</note> 
               <hi>of good men:</hi> because onely they have the conduct of the Spirit in it: and it is unknowne, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented by the wicked.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To <hi>hold</hi> this way, is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all our labour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <note place="margin">4.</note> our owne comfort. But all the labour is lost, when the way is lost. Thou canst never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle decline this way, but thou sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest into some one of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny roads that lead unto destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But in keeping this way is <hi>great reward, Psal.</hi> 19. 11. for it leads to God, who is an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great reward. Againe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the way of comfort and pleasure. It hath comfort <hi>for


<pb n="481" facs="tcp:18868:265"/>
the present:</hi> whereas stragling Christians have no comfort in the way: a wandring man is an uncomfortable creature. Also it hath comfort <hi>hereafter:</hi> for it leads to life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 2. keepe my Commandements, and <hi>thoa shalt live.</hi> It is the way of life, shewed by God, leading to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of joy in his presence, and to the pleasures of his right hand for evermore, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Hath God then taught thee this way? bee conscionable to <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Now because Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments will make this way as uneasie and asperous as they can, and assault thee on every hand to turne thee out of this way, thou must come armed with such meanes as may helpe to containe thee in this good way: as,</p>

            <p n="2">2.

But Gods Spirit never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached any for walking with God, even accurately. When Israel goeth out of Egypt, they must looke for Egyptians to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them: And thou, <hi>as a good Souldier,</hi> must suffer afflictions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3.</p>

Wee must eat and drinke <hi>our owne:</hi> the sweat of our owne brows, not other mens, as many that cut large shives into other mens loaves; I meane, that which they know is not theirs, but other mens, if all debts were paid: this were an high kinde of injustice, condemned, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 12.

rest. All that eating or drinking, by which wee make our selves heavy, sleepy, unweldy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for duties, is sinfull. For this is not a refreshing, but oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; not a refection, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For season, it must be so, that we eat not up too much <note place="margin">3</note> time, which would hinder our callings: but rather <hi>redeeme time, Ephes.</hi> 5. 16.

health and reason it selfe; thereby utterly perverting Gods Ordinance, who hath ordained them for servants and helps, not masters and hindrances.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The best appetite is, to taste the sweetnesse and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">5</note> of God himselfe in his creatures: saying within our selves, O Lord, how sweet and good art thou in thy selfe, who canst put such sweetnesse into thy creatures!</p>
            <p n="6">6. The best Sawee is good and <note place="margin">6.

               </gap>obriety, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and grace in the heart: for, whom call wee to our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but Gods children by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, who must every where be like themselves and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Thirdly, God hath given us leave to be merry, but with this onely restraint, Be merry <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and not against him. <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 10.</note> Never must God be set out of sight, in our merriments: as doe they, who never think they can be merry, but in rude and ungodly behaviour, and wanton naughty speeches, unbeseeming Christians. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi>


               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:18868:277"/>
thought it profitable, that mens speeches at their meales might be written. If Christians should doe so, what kinde of bookes would they be?</p>
            <p n="7">7. In eating and drinking we must season our hearts with <note place="margin">7 Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking. 1 Chap. 1. 6.</note> these or the like meditations:</p>
            <p n="1">1. How prone we are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate joy, and so provoke God in our feasts. <hi>Iob</hi> suspected his sonnes, being in likelihood good men, and sent to them to sanctifie themselves, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sacrificed for every one of them all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Watch against incitements <note place="margin">2.</note> which we shall not want to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our selves, and arme against them. We read of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that being invited to a feast where a notable harlot was to be present, he asked counsell of <hi>Menedemus,</hi> what hee should doe? who bade him onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that hee was a Kings sonne. So good men may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited,


<pb n="505" facs="tcp:18868:277"/>
where none of the best may meet: the best counsell is, Keepe ever in minde that you are Kings sonnes, Gods children, and a base thing it were for such to be allured by the wicked to things unseemely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mingle our feasting with a meditation of our end and <note place="margin">3</note> mortality. <hi>Joseph</hi> had his tombe in his garden, to season his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights with meditation of his death: The Egyptians had a Skeleton or carkasse brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their feasts, for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. So set thou thine owne carkasse before the eye of thy mind, and it will moderate thee from pampering it: alas (say thou) this feeding and feasting is but a little repaire of a ruinous house, that must downe short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider how many of Gods servants want some part <note place="margin">4.</note> of thy superfluity, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them never sate downe


<pb n="506" facs="tcp:18868:278"/>
at such a table: then follow the meditation, Who am I that I should be full, when so many are hungry? that I should abound when so many doe want? how am I engaged to God for thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse? how should I sinne to requite his love and bounty with such unkindnesse, as by it to grow wanton, idle, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of him most when he is most mindefull of me? must I eat and drinke, to rise up to play? Oh no, I must bestirre me in duties, in which I may expresse love for love: neither may I sinne as those great men, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. who ate the fat, dranke the sweet, and had wine in bowles, and <hi>forgate the afflictions of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph:</hi> no, if I eat the fat, and drink the sweet, I must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>to send some part to them, for whom none is prepared, Nehem.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
            <p>This of the peoples eating and drinking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:18868:278"/>
Now of those words, <hi>And rose up to play.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a practice condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Sports and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lawful and how.</note> in this people, it will be a question, Whether it bee not lawfull to sport, or play? To which I answer: it is lawfull: as in the former branch, not eating and drinking were condemned, but their sitting downe to eat and drinke: so in this latter not all play and sport is taxed, but their rising up to play: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a time to laugh, Eccles</hi> 3. 4. but this time, when <note place="margin">1.</note> they lay under the curse of God, and danger of sinne, was not it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee are commanded to <note place="margin">2 Phil. 4. 4</note> rejoyce, yet <hi>in the Lord,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. But these were laughing, and singing, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing about the Calfe, in honour of their Idoll.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Recreation is Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the necessary refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing <note place="margin">3.</note> of body or mind, or both; and the sitting of either or both


<pb n="508" facs="tcp:18868:279"/>
to the calling. But these rose up to play, thrust themselves out of their callings, and did nothing but eat and drinke to play; as many turne their recreations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vocations, and intend nothing else.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scriptures allow, both <note place="margin">4.</note> exercises of body, as the use of the bow, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. and of musicke, <hi>Neh.</hi> 7. 67. and of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hawking, or birding, so that such sports bee without swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, disorder, and needlesse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of the silly creatures: As also exercises of the minde and wit, suppose honest riddles <hi>(Judg.</hi> 14.) and such games, as the ground of which is wit or skill, Chesse, Draughts, and the like. And farre are wee from disallowing any delight, which Gods Word alloweth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

But note here: <hi>though play and recreation bee lawfull, yet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi> In sports is much sinne.</note> 
               <hi>much play as we so call, is sinfull: and much sinne lyeth oftentimes in playes and sports, lawfull in themselves,</hi> as our Text gives instance. And I thinke the rule will prove generally true, that Christians doe more multiply their sinnes in abuse of things lawfull, then in adventuring on things unlawfull; and faster doe they rivet themselves in those sinnes which lye in lawfull things, then in such as are easily convinced to be unlawfull. An hard taske it is for a Teacher to winne Christians by profession, either from wicked practices if they please to call them play, oh meddle not with mine eyes! or from the usuall sinnes attending such recreations, as in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of them are not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: In both, resembling <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> mad-man, that casteth darts and firebrands, and saith,


<pb n="510" facs="tcp:18868:280"/>
Am I not in sport?</p>
            <p>But a wise and teachable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian will confine himselfe to Gods allowance, and neither in jest catch at any forbidden fruit, be it never so pleasant in it selfe, or strongly perswaded; nor in the use of allowed delights, straine beyond the bounds and limits of the Word; nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of us as injurious, when we disallow in men nothing, but what God himselfe in the Scriptures restraineth them in.</p>
            <p>And if we will be ruled by God in our sports &amp; rejoycings, we must listen to his directions, 1. in the choyce, 2. in the use of our play.</p>
            <p>First, our choyce must be of sports in themselves lawfull. <note place="margin">1 Choyce is to be made of sports.</note> We may not play with holy things, suppose Scripture-phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: wee must feare the holy name of <hi>Iehova,</hi> not play with it: nor with oaths, our owne or others: nor with lots, which


<pb n="511" facs="tcp:18868:280"/>
are a part of the Name of God, yea more solemn then any oath, and must not be vainly used, or for recreation. Neither on the other side may we play with sinne, or things evill in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>viz.</hi> to make one drunke or sweare, or to laugh at such persons: it is a matter of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to see Gods Image so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, his honourable name so disgraced; and <hi>Davids eyes will gush out with rivers</hi> of teares <note place="margin">Ps 119. 136</note> for such sinnes. So in other sinful merriments.</p>
            <p>Or if wee have not warrant for them, by generall rules of the Word: if the lawes of the land prohibit them, as unlawfull: if honest heathens have on good ground condemned them: if the Fathers and judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have blotted and disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, &amp;c. Here pause on that rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 48.</p>
            <p>And Christian wisedome will also guide us to the choyce of


<pb n="512" facs="tcp:18868:281"/>
the best spots. A spirituall mind will chuse spirituall recreations, as a carnall mind will use carnal. And although there be time and place for bodily, yet a wise Christian must in the highest roome set heavenly delights, <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> comforts of the Spirit, joy in God and his Word, walking in the garden of Christ, where is most sweet and ravishing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in hearing, reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, holy conference, and in gathering and smelling the sweetest flowers of knowledge, faith, love, hope, holinesse. Here is a profitable, and a lasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And here is a tryall of the constitution of thy soule: the soule that more contents it selfe with carnall delights, then these, is of a carnall constitution, if it be so constantly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen warrantable sports, we must <note place="margin">2. Vse law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> beware we sinne not in the use of them. And to keepe us from


<pb n="513" facs="tcp:18868:281"/>
sinne in our recreations, wee must looke to our <hi>neighbour,</hi> to <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>our neighbour,</hi> the rule of wisdome to be observed, is, we must wisely sort our selves <note place="margin">1</note> in our sports, with the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, godly, and wise of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, condition, and sort of life, that may rather watch over us, that we offend not in them, then any way draw and provoke us so to doe. No pestilentiall ayre so contagious, as where swearers and riotous gamesters are met. And as thy company is, which thou chusest and usest, so art thou.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must looke carefully <note place="margin">2 Our selves how to be ordered in sports.</note> to <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, for our affection; that it be moderate. Wee may <hi>use</hi> lawfull sports, but not <hi>love</hi> them. Hee that <hi>loves</hi> pastime, <note place="margin">1.</note> shall be a poore man, saith <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Prov.</hi> 21. 17. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle commands Christians to


<pb n="514" facs="tcp:18868:282"/>
               <hi>reioyce as not reioycing, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 30. that is, to bee so moderate and retired in our joyes, as not over-value them, nor set affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on them, as having grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to doe. Moderation will observe due circumstances: it suffreth not a man to be given over to sport, nor to sit up night and day, and turne dayes into nights, and nights into dayes, as intemperate and riotous game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doe: nor will it let the duties of generall or speciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lye aside for daies and weeks together; because the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thing is better than the best that is indifferent, and sports were not ordained to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our callings, but to fit us for them, as whetting a sythe to forward the mower; but if a mower shall doe nothing but whet, whet, for a whole day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, wee would say hee is mad, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for our ends. Our <note place="margin">2</note>


               <pb n="515" facs="tcp:18868:282"/>
ends must not be, to passe the time, which passeth whether we will or no, and we ought to <hi>redeeme</hi> our time, and not let it passe without gaining somthing <note place="margin">Eph 5. 16</note> better than it selfe. Nor yet to maintaine idlenesse, as men that cannot tell what to doe with themselves else, which is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then idlenesse; for idlenesse is not onely not-working, but a doing of trifles, and that which we dare not bring to God in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. And is not the case piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that Christians having so much good worke to doe, and so many meanes, and so many cals, and so little time, should finde nothing so necessary as cards and dice?</p>
            <p>Againe, the end of sport is preservation of our health, both of soule and body, and not to impaire the health of either; as many by watching at play, and forgetting or forgoing their diet and rest for play, destroy their


<pb n="516" facs="tcp:18868:283"/>
health, and call in numbers of disease <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on themselves, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes untimely death.</p>
            <p>Lastly, seeing nothing can be lawfull, wherein some glory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewes not to God, therefore if the end of our sports be not to enable us with chearefulnesse in duties of Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, it will all be returned as sinne in our reckoning. Thus of the ends.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must guide our selves in our sports by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring <note place="margin">3 Rules for our sports</note> these rules:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may not recreate the outward man, but to better the inward: for Gods wisdome hath subordinated all inferiour things to the furtherance of the best things; the seeking of all other things (even necessaries, much more indifferent) to <hi>the Kingdome of God, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi> And he wils, that all <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> earthly joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> helpe forward our spirituall joy, in God and his


<pb n="517" facs="tcp:18868:283"/>
Christ, and the eternall joyes of Kingdome. But when they will step in competition with these, they are to be snibb'd, and cast out. Never must our chiefe joy be abated for these: nor our chiefe affections unsetled of that fulnesse of joy at Gods right hand for evermore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember we have a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <note place="margin">2.</note> course and race to runne, and beware we clogge not, nor <hi>oppresse</hi> our selves with pleasures <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 34</note> that instead of speeding us in our way they become the Divels birdlime to entangle us; in which while we flutter, we are not able to mount aloft in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditations, but having escaped we are as long in unly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and setting our hearts, as would have done the duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What ever wee winne <note place="margin">3 What may not be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st in play. 1.</note> or lose, wee must watch heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>First, that we lose not our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, meeknesse, and love to


<pb n="581" facs="tcp:18868:284"/>
our companions; as they that scorne, and quarrell, and storme, and rage like heathens, against lucke, and chance, and fortune; yea, sweare and curse, if never so little crossed, as they that never heard of Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may not lose <note place="margin">2</note> our goods, nor waste our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor play away more then without any doubt or scruple of conscience we may bestow on honest delights; the necessary maintenance of other things, and contributions to the Church and poore, first liberally provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee may not lose our <note place="margin">3</note> good name, which is a precious thing; nor runne into the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to bee accounted dicers, gamesters, idle persons, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with them; nor by rude, scurvilous, or obscene words or actions get a brand of a rude and disordered mate. This they justly winne, that lose their


<pb n="519" facs="tcp:18868:284"/>
mastery, and are at the command of play.</p>
            <p>Now certainely in this Vse alone must all recreations become good and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though corrupt nature cannot brooke to bee so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But to those that are ready to object the use and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the world, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle answereth, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Fashion not your selves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this world, but prove what is the good and acceptable will of God.</hi> And if any say, Oh but others are of another practice, that know more then you; I say, if they know not the truth of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, now backed by the authority of Scripture, they know not so much as I, and whosoever walke not by Gods rules, sinne against their owne soules. And sanctified hearts will inure themselves to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly


<pb n="520" facs="tcp:18868:285"/>
joyes, and preferre them above carnall; and little affect those, which loose persons so much, and so dangerously deat upon.</p>

Certainly it is not unlawfull to eat and drinke, to play, to <note place="margin">Onely the abuse of creatures is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> recreate our selves with sport, pastime, and musicke, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the naturall and civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and blessings of God in this life.</p>
            <p>For God hath ordained, not bread onely to strengthen the heart of man, but wine to make his heart glad, and oyle to make his face shine, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 104. 15. things as well of pleasure as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, things comfortable as well as profitable; both to make knowne his owne bounty and large grace, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his servants in chearefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>As for matter these outward delights are the good gifts of God, so likewise are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and wholesome for our selves, to fit us both to the chearefull service of God, and to the performance of duties in the speciall calling, which are


<pb n="523" facs="tcp:18868:286"/>
painfull and would be todious, if we were not cheared and strengthened with such batts and refreshings in the way. For such is our frailty here, that both our minds would grow dull and sluggish, and our bodies be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, if they stood alwayes bent. And therefore a mans life without pleasures and delights is like a long journey without Innes, in which is all travell, little or no comfort, or refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing</p>
            <p>So that, not the use of these <note place="margin">As in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Epicures.</note> things is here condemned, but the abuse onely, when Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans use them unchristianly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Heathens, Atheists, and Epicures, then Christians. As thus:</p>
            <p>First, the Heathens and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists abused those things, for <note place="margin">Foure wayes, 1</note> that their persons were unclean: <hi>Tit. 1 15. To the impure and unbeleeving is nothing pure.</hi> And if thy person be not in Christ,


<pb n="524" facs="tcp:18868:287"/>
reconciled, and by faith justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou canst have no true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in any thing: all true joy being an effect of <hi>peace with God, Rom.</hi> 5. 3. Thou that art in thy sinnes, impenitent, lyest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curse of God, and guilt of sinne, hast indeed another bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse in hand than to follow thy pleasure: thou art like a condemned prisoner going on to execution: a man would thinke he had other businesse to doe, then to stay by the way to eat and drinke and make merry, to play at cards, dice, and the like. The Psalmist saith, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce ye righteous:</hi> but thou that <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 11</note> art a wicked man, a prophane, carnall, and carelesse wretch, hast no call nor right to rejoyce, but rather drowne thy selfe (if it were possible) in the teares of sad and timely repentance. <note place="margin">2</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Heathens and Epicures missed in the matter of their pleasures, in that they


<pb n="525" facs="tcp:18868:287"/>
understood only that to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which was sensuall, to be seene, heard, tasted, touched, or the like. And whatsoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted their senses, that they swallowed as a warrantable pleasure. So the young Atheist is said to <hi>walke in the wayes of his heart, and in the sight of his eyes, Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. And <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he would try the life of an Epicure, saith (Chap. 2. 10.) <hi>Whatsoever mine eyes desired,</hi> I with held it not from them, I with-drew not mine heart from any joy. Even so, when thou carest not (in comparison) for any higher joyes, than those that runne into thy senses, what art thou but a Christian Atheist? And when instead of naturall, honest, and civill pleasures, thou layest hold upon carnall and worldly delights, as surfetting and drankennesse, chambering and wantonnesse, lust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse; unlawfull sports and


<pb n="526" facs="tcp:18868:288"/>
recreations, which thou canst not warrant by Gods word, and because they please the sense and carnall minde, though by Gods rules and in themselves they be hateful and to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet stil thou followest them; what art thou all this while but an heathenish or brutish Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Heathens and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures <note place="margin">3</note> failed, in that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized their pleasures, making their belly their god, esteeming voluptuousnes the chiefe good, as men that knew nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the pleasures of this life. And as they over-valued them in their judgement, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they immoderately affected them, and excessively used them.</p>
            <p>So suppose thou layest hold onely on lawfull and warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleasures, but settest them up above their hlace, as judging them more fit to spend time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="527" facs="tcp:18868:288"/>
then upon Christian exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as reading, praying, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating; or more worthy then the duties of the calling, all which are necessary, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely good, but these at the best are but indifferently good, good as they are used, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably good, and in no high degree of goodnesse: What difference is there betweene thee and an Atheist, or Epicure? but this: thy sinne is farre greater then his: he might see his sinne if he were taught better: but thou art taught better, and sinnest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy knowledge.</p>
            <p>Now when didst thou cast off thy calling by dayes or weekes together for religious exercises, as thou doest yearely for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? How unreasonable a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were it, to call men to a fast of 12. dayes together? when could we perswade men to it? And yet they will tell you, they love religion better then their


<pb n="528" facs="tcp:18868:289"/>
pleasure. But beleeve them who knowes not, that the thing a man most loves, he will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy most time to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Epicures failed, in that all their pleasures were <note place="margin">4.</note> severed from religion: they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away thoughts of God: they denyed the resurrection, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved no judgement to come. They thought this was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and therefore the best religion was to eat, and drinke, and play, and be merry; to fill the skin with present delights, and powre out themselves upon pleasures, while they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them: for after death they looked for no more pleasure, or being, then the brute beasts themselves.</p>
            <p>So if thou canst then please thy selfe, when God is set out of sight, and out of mind: in thy delights, thoughts and speeches of God are unsavoury: thou art so exercised, as thou wouldst not


<pb n="529" facs="tcp:18868:289"/>
have God to behold thee, or Christ to come to thee: thou doest in thy eating, drinking, and gaming so runne inao excesses of furfetting and drunkennesse, of swearing, coveting, wrath and reviling, and so layest the raynes in thy owne necke, as no bridle of humanity, and much lesse religion ruleth thee: Wherein dost thou differ from an heathenish Atheist, whose pleasures are as irreligions, and as unfavoury as his? onely more hatefull then his, in that thou knowest there is another life and reckoning, he doth not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How then may a <note place="margin">Rules of right u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. 1. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</note> Christian rightly use these good things?</p>

Religion must alwaies bind him to the good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, even when he lets himselfe loose to pleasures. Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious use of pleasures is in three respects: When wee use


<pb n="530" facs="tcp:18868:290"/>
them lawfully, by warrant <hi>from God,</hi> and are sure wee taste no forbidden fruit, no unlawfull game. When we use them <hi>in the presence of God,</hi> as the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites <note place="margin">Exo. 24. 11</note> are said to eat and drink before the Lord: still setting God at our right hand, and our selves in his sight. And when we use them as those that mean to <hi>make account of them to God, Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. Rejoyce oh young man, and let thy heart cheare thee in the dayes of thy youth: but know, that <hi>for all these things thou must come to iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If hee use them soberly <note place="margin">2. Soberly</note> and weignedly: and that, both in respect of affection, measure, and time.</p>
            <p>For affection: why should reasonable men affect such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, <note place="margin">1</note> as the natural brute beasts enjoy more freely then man, and which are cast in common to good and bad, and the worst men enjoy most? If grace


<pb n="531" facs="tcp:18868:290"/>
should not carry a Christians mind to better delights, yet reason at least should lift him higher, as he is but a man.</p>
            <p>Why should Christians affect those delights, which they know not whether they shall taste of, or no; or whether they will lodge with him all night? as that Epicure, <hi>Luk. 12. 20. Thou hast enough, soule, for many yeares, eat, drinke, and take thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: but that night was his soule required of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why should a Christian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect those things as pleasures, which being ended leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind them? Of other exercises beside eating, drinking and gaming, some fruit remains after them, whether in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall calling, or speciall. But of these no fruit remaines behind them, but some sighes or pangs of conscience for wasting that time, that ought to have beene better improved and imployed:


<pb n="532" facs="tcp:18868:291"/>
which hath marred all the play.</p>
            <p>These are things to bee used, but not affected; as it were not used.</p>
            <p>As in affection, so in measure, Christians must use them all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly. <note place="margin">2</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Because God so ordereth his children, that in this life they shall rather taste of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, then feed on them: and he commonly scants them in these, that they may have a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appetite to, and measure in better delights.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The abstemious use is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then free fruition, both for body and soule.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They generally never grow in greatnesse, but they remit so much of their goodnesse. See in <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe, when hee would addict himselfe to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and wine, how his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was abated, and grace ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed; how he grew into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious lusts, to get him 700.

wives, and 300. concubines, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 3. And therefore of voluptuous persons, that will hold up their hearts with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and immoderately follow these outward delights, wee may say they are mad men, and out of their minds, as <hi>Salomon</hi> by wofull experience said of laughter, <hi>Thou art madnesse, Eccles.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Time also must be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">3</note> if we will use these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights soberly. There is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for <hi>laughter,</hi> and for <hi>weeping: Eccles.</hi> 3. 4. There are times of <hi>fasting,</hi> and times of <hi>feasting.</hi> The rich Glutton was convicted of intemperance that he went in purple, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deliciously <hi>every day.</hi> He <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 19</note> did not distinguish of times, as holy sobriety would have taught him. And so it teacheth us: <note place="margin">Times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable for sports. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the time of Gods worship is not time for unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary pleasures; because there


<pb n="534" facs="tcp:18868:292"/>
is a better delight enjoyned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That working-dayes are <note place="margin">2</note> neither wholly nor principally the dayes of pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: not being appointed for recreation, but occupation and the calling. You must either prove your gaming an occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or lay it aside and fall to your vocations; or else goe on (as many of you doe) to play away your dayes and lives, in despight of Gods Words and servants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That dayes of sorrow and humiliation are on times to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict <note place="margin">3</note> our selves to naturall and civill delights.</p>
            <p>For our particular estates. Are we obnoxious to so many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, loaded with so many sins, beset with so many enemies, and yet even now set upon a merry pinne? Certainly now to be given to pleasures, differs <note place="margin">Preached at <hi>Reding,</hi> in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1621.</note> not much from madnesse. Is our Towne so afflicted, our


<pb n="535" facs="tcp:18868:292"/>
poore so destitute, and yet we still feed up our hearts with merriments and pastimes? It were grosse senslesnesse.</p>
            <p>For the publike estate. Is the Church of God in distresse? doe the enemies breake downe the carved worke of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary? is the Arke of God and my Lord <hi>Ioab</hi> in the fields? good <hi>Vriah</hi> cannot now goe home, and take his lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, though the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him so to doe. All evils, at home and abroad, are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trumpets blowne by the Lord for our humiliation. And if now, when he lowdly calls us to mourning, weeping, bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sacke-cloth, yet still there be joy and gladnesse, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Oxen, killing of sheepe, eating of flesh, and drinking of wine, what followes? <hi>Surely this iniquity shall not bee purged from us till we dye, saith the Lord of hosts, Esa.</hi> 22. 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="536" facs="tcp:18868:293"/>
And lastly, whole nights or dayes together were unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">4</note> times for delights. It would impaire the health of the body. And no man will doe so much for the health of his soule.</p>
            <p>Thus of sobriety in the use of outward delights.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must use them wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">3. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> and watchfully: and that in three respects:</p>
            <p>First, carefully watching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">1</note> Satans subtilties, who most usually layeth his nets to catch us with these baits. Hee well knoweth, that in nothing we are more prone to unbridle our affections, then in these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. The Serpent lyeth in the greene grasse. And this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent laid his temptation in the faire apple, and <hi>Eves</hi> appetite. And if once we moyle our selves in this birdlime of Satan, we are as unable to mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in divine meditations, as a Bird taken by the twigs, which


<pb n="537" facs="tcp:18868:293"/>
the more she strives, the surer she is. Satan catcheth more by lawfull liberties, than by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we must carefully <note place="margin">2</note> watch our owne corruptions; who can easily oppresse our selves by surfetting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, and that day come on us unawares; and pervert good things to bad ends. Now the <note place="margin">Right ends of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. 1</note> right ends in the use of all our lawfull liberties, are, 1. To be matter of Gods praise, for his bounty and mercies toward us: 2. To set us forward in our Christian race, and sit us to the <note place="margin">2</note> duties of piety. Take heed of all that eating, drinking, and playing, which unfits thee for Gods service, &amp;c. 3. To refresh <note place="margin">3</note> us, and sweeten our labour, when body or mind is likely to be oppressed with study or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. But to pursue pastimes too eagerly is utterly unlawfull; or when they that need least, play


<pb n="538" facs="tcp:18868:294"/>
most, and instead of surfet of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, surfet of idlenesse, eating, drinking, and pastime. 4. To put us in minde of those lasting, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, <note place="margin">4.</note> and unconceiveable pleasures, reserved at the right hand of God for us. For, if the pleasures of our prison bee so sweet, what are those in our palace? and, if they be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent, wisdome will make us watchfull that we hinder not our selves from those by these.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we must watch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">3</note> against evill companies, drunkards, and gamesters, who are principall factors for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. For being overtaken themselves, they never cease to make others the children of hell like themselves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in evill. Take heed of drinkards, a kinde of divellish poysoners, who have skill to poyson both soule and body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

            <p>Secondly, when the body <note place="margin">2</note> consumeth, the parts are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the knees bowe under a man, and with much adoe he draggeth his limbes after him, there is certainly a bodily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,


<pb n="550" facs="tcp:18868:300"/>
though there bee no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. So in the soule: when men are weake to deeds of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have no strength to conquer temptation, to suffer crosses and trials; to workes of charity, mercy, or justice; but all strength of grace seems to be exhausted: here is a dangerous disease: here may wee justly feare a spirituall <hi>hecticke,</hi> which is no sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, then deadly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when the senses <note place="margin">3</note> faile, the eyes grow dimme, the eares dull, it is an apparant signe of a bodily, or spirituall disease. A senslesse man is the sickest man, because he is sicke though he be not sensible. Even so, when the eye-strings of the soule are broken, that they see not the light of grace, nor of God, which as the Sunne shines round about them; the eares heare not the voyce of God, the feeling is gone, they have no sense of the great gashes and


<pb n="551" facs="tcp:18868:300"/>
wounds of the lusts of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, drunkennesse, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, swearing, lying, malice against God and his servants; nay, no complaint, but rather rejoycing in these; neither is there any fellowship in <hi>the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Amos 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>of Ioseph:</hi> the soule of such a man lyes very weake, as a man for whom the Bell is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to toll.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <note place="margin">4.</note> or to be taken speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, is a signe of a disease and death approching: So in the soule, prayer being the breath of the soule, when a man can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fetch this breath, cannot pray, or with much adoe can begge mercy, strength, and supply of grace; or when he is speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, a man cannot heare him whisper a good and savoury word, but all is earthly, fruitlesse or hurtfull; here is a living Corps, a painted sepulcher, not a man of a better world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="552" facs="tcp:18868:301"/>
Would men try themselves by these notes, they would soone discorne their sicknesse, and runne out to the Physician. But oh what an hard taske is it, to bring a man rightly to know his estate? A singer of the body cannot ake, but men complaine and bind it up. But the soule lies gasping, and there is no such care, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Secondly, sicknesse weakneth the body, and impaireth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor <note place="margin">2</note> of nature: so doth sinne in the soule: experience sheweth, that after some sinne we very hardly and weakly attempt any good thing for along time.

            <p>Fifthly, sicknesse is generally <note place="margin">5</note> incident to al men. So the soules of all men are diseased by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; even the soules of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, till they bee healed by Christ. And these diseases are most foule, and incurable: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Scripture to a <hi>gangrene</hi> which suddenly eateth up the body, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. and to the <hi>Leprosie,</hi> the contagion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not onely reacheth over all the parts of a man, but to others also; and for the effect, casteth a man out of the Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="555" facs="tcp:18868:302"/>
Conceive then of sinne, as of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Use</hi> 1. Thinke of sinne as a sicknesse.</note> a sicknesse, and beware of it.

He must be sicke,

every man is deadly sicke: it stands us now in hand, to get Christ to cure us. Israel, stung with the fiery Serpents, must only <hi>looke to the brazen Serpent, Numb.</hi> 21. 8. We are all as the man fallen among theeves dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded. It is onely this good Samaritan, that can binde up the wound. Or as the poore man that lay at the poole of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesda 38. yeares, and could never find cure till Christ came, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 5. And if we would be cured, we must doe as the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Genezareth, when they heard Christ was there, they ranne about all the region, and carried after him in beds all that were sicke, and diseased, and he healed them all. Goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where else, and it will be fall you as that woman <hi>(Mark.</hi> 5. 26.) that spent all shee had on Physicians, and was as far from cure as at first, till Christ came and healed her.</p>
            <p>

But Christ is in heaven: how <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> shall I have his presence?</p>
            <p>His promise is, to be with his <note place="margin">Ans.</note> Church by his Spirit and grace, to the end of the world.</p>

            <p>Thou shalt not misse of him in the midst of the seven golden Candlestickes: thou shalt finde him in the Temple teaching, as his parents having lost him: get thee to the <hi>steps of the flolkes, Cant.</hi> 1. 7. there thou shalt finde him at noone.

            <p>But I am so weake and sicke <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> I cannot get to Christ.</p>
            <p>The poore man who lay <note place="margin">Ans.</note> bound on his bed, sicke of the palsie, not able to stirre himselfe, got others to bring him to Christ, and when they could

<pb n="569" facs="tcp:18868:309"/>
earnest suit and large rewards to helpe us. And so ought we here for cure doe unto Christ; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse all against our selves, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine no secret and close sin: for that may be the cause of our griefe: and never cease impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning him for mercy, till we feele some cure to eternall life.</p>

Yet our case spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is farre worse: sinne is a worme in the conscience, and hath a poysonfull sting, which will gnaw in the soule to eternal death. This worme is in every man, comming of <hi>Adam,</hi> and none can cure it but the second <hi>Adam:</hi> for none but he knowes to make the confection, to kill this worme: And whosoever


<pb n="570" facs="tcp:18868:310"/>
goes on carelesly in sinne, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this worme to eat out the bowels of his soule, and there is no way but death with him.</p>
            <p>Suppose a man had the falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicknesse: what would he not doe or suffer, to be cured of that desperate disease, rather then be in continuall danger of falling into the fire, or water, or other mischiefes? But the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous falling sicknesse, is, to fall into sinne: the impenitent sinner knowes not when or where he shall fall: every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he may fall into the deepe waters of Gods wrath, or into the fire of hell.</p>
            <p>Oh then come in time to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: fall downe before him in confession of thy deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red estate: mourne under thy sicknesse, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his sicknesse: turne thee to thy Physician: confesse thy blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the blind men in the Gospell, and begge as they, Lord


<pb n="571" facs="tcp:18868:310"/>
that our eyes may be opened. Cry out of the stone of thy heart, and of the running issues of sinne. Get unto Christ, and touch the hemme of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as the woman having the issue of blood) and get cure. Hide thy sinne with <hi>Adam,</hi> and there is no cure, no prosperity. <hi>While I held my tongue, my bones consumed in my roaring all the day long, Psal</hi> 32. 3, 4. But the very opening of the sore is a part of the cure; because the core of sinne is let out by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; and, to <hi>confesse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro 28. 13</note> 
               <hi>sinne,</hi> is the way to mercy. Confession which brings guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before men, brings pardon and discharge before God. And besides, thy Physician is of such skill &amp; experience, as thou canst conceale nothing from him if thou wouldest.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if Christ be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, <note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, he is as willing to helpe, as able: being a mercifull <note place="margin">3</note> High-Priest, compassed with infirmities, to have compassion on them that are out of the way. How willing would a tender husband be, to helpe his wife out of a deadly sicknesse! no

            <p>Thirdly, admire the <hi>power of weaknesse,</hi> and the Omnipotent <note place="margin">3.</note> worke of this Cure by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as in the great worke of Creation; there the Sonne of God made all things, not out of something, but out of nothing: so in this great worke of our Cure by Redemption, he works our life, not by his life, but by his owne death: he makes us infinitely happy, but by his owne infinite misery: he, opens the grave for us, by his owne lying


<pb n="587" facs="tcp:18868:318"/>
in the grave: he sends us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his owne descending from heaven; and shuts the gates of hell by suffering hellish torments. He honours us by his owne shame: he breakes away our temptations, and Satans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestations, by being himselfe tempted. Here is a skilfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, tempering poyson to a remedy, bringing light out of darkenesse, life out of death, heaven out of hell. In the whole order of nature one contrary refisteth another, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond nature that one contrary should produce another. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, admire the <hi>care of the Physician,</hi> who provided us <note place="margin">4.</note> a remedy before our disease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was, or we in it: together with his bounty, who bestowed on us so precious a balme when there was none in Gilead; when neither all the gold in India, nor all the metals


<pb n="588" facs="tcp:18868:319"/>
or minerals in the bowels of the earth could save one soule, nor all the wealth in the world oure one sinner, but onely this blood of an infinite price, power, and merit. Here was a rich and free mercy, to part with his owne life, and dearest pledge of his love, and voluntarily submit himselfe to death, which was of more strength then all the lives of men and Angels. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, admire his <hi>match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse love,</hi> who to save our soules <note place="margin">5.</note> made his soule an offering for sinne, and healeth our wounds by his owne stripes. A Phyfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an sheweth great love, if he take a little care above ordinary, though he be wel rewarded, and made a great gainer by it. But this Physician must be a loser by his love: he must lose his glory, his life: he must lose heaven, and happinesse, and all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all this be unmatchable in


<pb n="589" facs="tcp:18868:319"/>
abasement, and torment, in so much that he calleth all us who are ready to passe by all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider if ever any sorrow were like to his sorrow. Here was a sound love to us, who endured to be so afflicted, and abased by God, men, and divels for our sakes, when he could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and refused it, if it had pleased him; but this love was stronger than death, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued his owne life to save ours.

               </gap>bell. What great love made him not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his life deare for us? Oh the deadnesse of our hearts, that


<pb n="590" facs="tcp:18868:320"/>
can heare this with so little sense, and provocation to love him againe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we testifie our love to Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We must not love him <note place="margin">And how this love must be testified.</note> in tongue and word onely, but in deed and truth; framing our love in some proportion unto his, which was both in word, worke, and suffering.</p>
            <p>First, in <hi>profession and word</hi> we must magnifie his great worke of Redemption, and advance it in the perfection and vertue of it, as able of it selfe to purchase the whole Church; a blood able of it selfe to save from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angell, and make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace betweene God and us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as Gods love was <note place="margin">2 Ioh. 14. 15</note> 
               <hi>actuall,</hi> so wee must settle our selves to his service. <hi>If ye love me, keepe my Commandements.</hi> Hee was a servant to doe our worke: his love onely made


<pb n="591" facs="tcp:18868:320"/>
him so. And shall we refuse his worke? Ours was a painefull taske that he undertooke: and he left us an <hi>easie yoke,</hi> to shew <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 30</note> our obedience, and gives us also strength to beare it. Hee hath given himselfe for us, and will giue himselfe to us: and shall not we give our selves to him? Certainly we serve a good Lord, and want no encouragement.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let us <hi>not love our lives</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>to the death</hi> for his sake: <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11. He that <hi>hateth not his life,</hi> in comparison of Christ, cannot be his Disciple, <hi>Luk</hi> 14. 26. The direct end of Christs life was our glory: the direct end of ours must be his glory. He maintained our cause to the death: by his death hee now pleads our cause in heaven. It is therefore not onely <hi>honourable,</hi> but <hi>equall and iust,</hi> that wee should sticke to him and his causes, in life and death; and


<pb n="592" facs="tcp:18868:321"/>
that love which is sound, is like his, even <hi>stronger then death,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>First, from the <hi>condemnation</hi>

4. As after application of proper physicke wee finde a great change in our bodies, as if wee had new bodies given us: so after the kindly worke of this physicke we may finde our selves cast into a new mould; this blood applyed, makes us <hi>new Creatures,</hi> new <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17</note> men, having new mindes, new wils, new words, new affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, new actions, new conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.

Wee are strong for our journey, for our combate, and strong to carry burdens, with a strong appetite, and digestion of the Word: every way more hearty and chearefull.</p>
            <p>Thus having received our health, by meanes of this Cure, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Preserve health of soule, once obtained.</note> wisdome commands us to be as carefull to preserve our health, as to attaine it. Every wise man will be as carefull to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe


<pb facs="tcp:18868:327"/>
well, as to get himselfe well. And to this purpose, wee must remember the counsell of our Physician, for maintaining our health attained.</p>
            <p>Amongst many directions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <note place="margin">Meanes so to doe.</note> I mention foure.</p>
            <p>First, not to be tampering with our owne medicines, nor <note place="margin">1.</note> the medicines of Egypt, merits, pilgrimages, penance, or the like; nor any quintessence or minerall from the hand of any libertine Teacher: but onely such as wee finde prescribed in the word of God, by our great Doctor.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to keepe our health, <note place="margin">2.</note> we must keepe good dyet, both for soule and body. The best dyet for the soule, is, to keepe Gods houres for our daily repast by the Word, in reading, and meditating on it: which <hi>David</hi> regarded above his ordinary food. A liberall dyet is best for


<pb facs="tcp:18868:328"/>
the soule: but the best dyet for the body is a spare dyet, a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and moderate use of meat, drinke, and pleasure, for beating downe and mortifying corrupt affections and lusts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to preserve our health, we must strive to live in <note place="margin">3</note> a good and wholesome ayre. If thou livest in a corrupt ayre, change it for a better. The worst ayre that can be, is, where worst men and worst company are. The ayre of an hot plaguy house is not so infectious, as the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ayre of wicked company. The former brings not so many to death of the body, as this to death of the soule. Live amongst Gods people, and where Gods word is purely preached; for there is the purest ayre: <hi>Psal. 16. 3. All my delight is in the Saints, excelling in vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, to preserve health, Physicians prescribe the use of <note place="margin">4.</note>


               <pb facs="tcp:18868:328"/>
