            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Perusal of this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, in defence of the Fair Sex, Written by a Gentleman of my acquaintance, much surpris'd me: For it was not easie for me to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that one so young, cou'd have treated so nice a Subject with so much judgment. 'Tis true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally Ingenious, and that he had improv'd himself by Travelling; and from thence I might reasonably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb facs="tcp:99018:3"/>
that air of Gallantry, which is so visibly diffus'd through the body of the Work, and is indeed the Soul that annimates all things of this nature: But so much variety of reading, both in Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors, such digestion of that reading, so much justness of thought, that it leaves no room for affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Pedantry, I may venture to say, are not overcommon amongst practis'd Writers, and very rarely to he found amongst Beginners. It puts me in mind of what was said of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> the Father of our English Numbers, upon the sight of his first Verses by the Wits of the last Age, that he came out into the
<pb facs="tcp:99018:3"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad heard of him. (Here in imitation of my Friends Apostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe's, I hope the Reader need not be told, that Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> is only mention'd for Honour's sake, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at I am desirous of laying hold on his Memory, on all occasions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acknowledging to the World, that unless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e had Written, none of us cou'd Write.) I know my Friend will forgive me this digression; for it is not only a Copy of his Stil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but of his Candour. The Reader will observe, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e is ready for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e has more than once mention'd me, so much to my advantage, yet I hope the Reader will take it only for a Parenthesis, because the Piece wou'd have been very perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. I may be suffer'd to please my self with the kindness of my Friend, without valuing my self upon his partiality: He had not confidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to send it out into the World, without my Opinion of it, that it might pass securely, at least amongst the fair Readers, for whose service
<pb facs="tcp:99018:4"/>
it was principally design'd. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not so presuming, to think my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can either he his Touchstone, or his Passport: But I thought I might send him back to <hi>Ariosto,</hi> who has made it the business of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Thirty Stanza's in the beginning of the <hi>37th</hi> Book of his <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> not only to praise that Beautiful part of the Creation, but also to make a sharp Satyr on their Enemies; to give Mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their envy it proceeds that the Vertue and great Actions of Women are purposely conceal'd, and the failings of some few amongst them expos'd with all the aggravating Circumstances
<pb facs="tcp:99018:5"/>
of Malice. For my own part, who have always been their Servant, and have never drawn my Pen against them, I had rather see some of them prais'd extraordinarily, than any of them suffer by detraction: And that in this Age, and at this time parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, wherein I find more Heroines than Heroes. Let me therefore give them joy of their new Champion: If any will think me more partial to him than really I am, they can only say I have return'd his Bribe: And the worst I wish him, is, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Iustice from the Men; and Favour only from the Ladies.</p>

            <head>A DIALOGUE Concerning WOMEN. Written to <hi>EUGENIA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>'TIS a dangerous thing, Madam, it must be confest, this Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with fair Ladies; and it draws us into Inconveniencies, of which we do not at first see the Consequences. I little thought, when I talk'd with your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99018:6"/>
Ladyship, of the Vertues of your Sex, that you wou'd have commanded me to have given my Sentiments upon that Subject in Writing. I grant you, Madam, you might have spoken to several of your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who wou'd have undertaken the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness at first word, with all the Courage imaginable; But to me, who never durst take Pen in hand to write any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a Billet, the Enterprise seems very terrible. I confess, when you spoke to me of it first, I was well enough pleas'd with the Design; for I thought a Defence of the Sex, wou'd be a means of obliging all of the Sex, who were worth defending; and therefore lookt upon it as the writing a Circular Love-Letter to all the fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the Kingdom. But as Men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mix Interest with Honour, so, upon second thoughts, I considered what I should get by it, besides Fame, if it shou'd suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and I found, if I perswaded all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99018:6"/>
Men to be as passionate Servants to the Ladies as my felf, I should make but a very indifferent hand of it: Thus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you wou'd engage me in a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, where it wou'd be a Scandal to be vanquisht, and a disadvantage to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: For I, who cou'd never succeed in an Amour where there was any Fool pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended besides my self, shou'd have great hopes indeed, when I had perswaded all Mankind to be my Rivals. After all, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, there were your Commands to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to it; and the Commands of a fair Lady are to me beyond all the Arguments in Nature; I therefore resolved upon the undertaking. But as 'tis no new thing to see people undertake a Business that they are altogether unable to perform, so I must own, I found a thing of this nature quite beyond my strength: You may believe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I was very melancholy at it, and 'twas then that a Friend coming into my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99018:7"/>
Chamber, askt me the occasion. As I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a Friend, so I presently told him the Business, That a Lady had commanded me to write her a Treatise in defence of Women.</hi> If that be all (<hi>said he briskly</hi>) I am come to your deliverance; for this very morning have I been at a Conversation, where the Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Vertues and Vices of that Sex, has been handled as fully as can be desired. Thou appear'st to me, my dear Friend, (<hi>said I, embracing him</hi>) like my better Genius, and therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther Ceremony, sit down, and give me an account of the Conference.</p>
            <p>Taking a walk (<hi>said he</hi>) this Morning in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> with several of my Acquaintance, there was one amongst the rest who was all the while, either gazing upon the Ladies as they came by, or speaking with that indifference to us,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99018:7"/>
that made us very plainly see, he did not mind the Subject of our Discourse, tho' we talkt of all the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things that offer themselves in such Conversations.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99018:8"/>
if they please, shall be our Judges. Tho' I am very unwilling, <hi>answered Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logynes,</hi> to lose a Morning that has call'd out all the best Company of the Town, yet since 'tis in defence of the Ladies, and you so boldly challenge me, I take you at your word, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if I get the better in the Judgment of these Gentlemen, you shall engage to be in Love by to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning. Upon condition, that if I overcome (said <hi>Misogynes</hi>) you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to be out of Love by the same time, I agree. That is no equal stake, reply'd <hi>Philogynes,</hi> for 'tis to lay Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against Unhappiness; however, I am so well satisfy'd of my Cause, that I will undertake you, even upon those odds.</p>
            <p>Upon this agreement we walkt all to the other side of the Park, full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the event of the Debate;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99018:9"/>
when we were come thither, we found we had the whole Walk to our selves, and so <hi>Misogynes,</hi> who gave the Challenge, began in this manner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Propagation</hi> of Mankind being the only way to preserve it from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; and the Copulation with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being the only means that Nature has ordain'd to that end; there is no doubt but all Commonwealths ought to give any reasonable Encouragements to it; I have therefore always admir'd the Wisdom of those Governments that incited, or compelled their Subjects to marry, as a thing so much more necessary to Mankind in general, than pleasing to any one in particular; but that a man shou'd, out of a meer act of Judgment, run after Women, that he shou'd find delight in their company, is so very extraordinary, that the wise men of old thought it hardly possible, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

            <p>Notwithstanding this, had you a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of marrying 'em, I shou'd not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together so much condemn you; nay, had you but a design of enjoying 'em without it, there might be somewhat still alledg'd in your excuse. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable soever such a design may be, as to the Moral part, the action it self is very agreeable to the Natural.

            <p>It is a very good, as well as a very general way, to guess at People by the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99018:10"/>
Company they keep; and thus we may give a great Judgment of the Female Sex, by a view of those with whom they are the most pleas'd of our own. Well, let 'em appear then; what do you find? Fine Coats, large Cravat-strings, and good Perriwigs I must own, but for any thing else, they, and their Perriwig Blocks are Criticks alike. 'Tis true, to do 'em justice, they talk most learnedly of Points and Ribons; have most Mathematical Heads for the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ladies Topknots, make as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Figures, talk as loud, and laugh more than any in Drawing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, and Play-houses; and those who know nothing of their Language, wou'd take 'em, by their Gestures, to be the wittiest persons in Christendom; but if unluckily you understand 'em, you will find it only false Fire, and that all this violent laughter is produc'd by no jest.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99018:11"/>
Then take 'em out of their own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, begin a Discourse of any thing that is worth knowing, they are dumb; out of Modesty? No; but they hate to talk of things that are <hi>grossier</hi>; and the Pedantry of Scholars, and Gravity of Men of Business, is utterly unfit for a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Were it nothing but the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of such sort of Creatures as these, it wou'd be enough, I shou'd think, to frighten a Man of Sense from 'em. Can you see these Fops, as much as you are us'd to 'em, without laughing? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it rather makes you blush to think you shou'd bring your self into compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with such Tools as they are: I am far from blaming them for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ladies: They avoid the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Men who despise 'em, for that of Women who admire 'em: Nor do I find fault with the Ladies, for being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99018:11"/>
pleas'd with them; for since Likeness, they say, breeds Love, what wonder is it they are fond of those Men whose Follies make 'em most like themselves; but for a Man who has some pretences to Wit and Learning; for one who might be acceptable to men of Sense, to run after 'em; nay, for a man who spends all the Morning in the study of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to spend the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon amongst the Impertinencies of Women; puts me in mind of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks Stages in <hi>Naples,</hi> where the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Jackpuddings entertain the Spectators by turns</p>
            <p>'Tis possible, you will say, that all this makes for you; that the faults of your Rivals render your Vertues the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and that there is no doubt, but a man of Merit may succeed in any place where a man of no Merit may pretend; but, alas, Sir, you deceive
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99018:12"/>
your self very much, if you encourage that Opinion. Had you fit Judges, there is no doubt but you were in the right: But if the fairest Lady in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom were amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> where they paint the Devil of her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, do you expect they shou'd do her Beauty Justice? Or if a slender man were amongst the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> do you think they wou'd admire him for being well shap'd, where they thought none but big-belly'd men to be so? Credit me, Sir, a man who leaves his Parts to the Judgment of Women, is very near the same Circumstances: Will you not believe me in that case, because I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess an enmity to 'em? You do well: but will you believe themselves? View all the Town, take good notice: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the young Heiresses who run away from their Guardians, is there any one who does it with a man of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99018:12"/>
Sense? Amongst all those Widows who ruin themselves by second Marriages, is there any one who does it with a man of Sense? Amongst all those Ladies who Cuckold their Husbands, is there any one who does it with a man of Sense? We see 'em do these things eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, with Chaplains, Dancing-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Butlers, and Footmen. Who are the men that shew the tender Billets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd? What are they who boast of the Favours of all the finest Women in Town? Are they not the most despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Mankind? Are they not such whose Conversation is the jest of men of Sense? And have they above one thing about 'em, that distinguishes 'em from the other Sex?</p>
            <p>After all, Sir, are not the Women in the right in this point? Or do they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shew more Judgment, than when they pitch upon such men? What do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99018:13"/>
they look for in a Husband, but one who will admire 'em, who will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by 'em, and upon whom all their little tricks will pass? And who but Fools are fit for that? What do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in a Gallant, but giving 'em Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure without Scandal? And to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part they have a receiv'd notion of the Ability of Fools: Then for the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, who so likely to give none as those men, whom the World will hardly believe were favour'd by 'em, tho' they took their Oaths upon it? For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Experience teaches us the contrary, yet People are apt to fancy, a man of Sense must succeed before a Coxcomb; and will rather believe the former are favour'd, tho' they swear they are not; than the latter, tho' they swear they are.</p>
            <p>But alas, Sir, men of Sense they think know 'em, and that they take, as well as

No

sooner was the Husband gone, but the Wife tells it, under a Vow of Secrecy too, to her Maid; she to another who was her fellow Servant, who told it to her Lover; so that, to be short, it ran so fast, that as soon as the Senator came into the Market-place, one took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and told it him for a great Secret; away goes he, and tells his Wife she had undone him, in divulging what he had trusted with her: She denies it with a true feminine Impudence: How cou'd it come to be known then? <hi>says he.</hi> Alas (<hi>reply'd she</hi>) are there not three hundred Senators, and might it not come from any of 'em, as well as you?

Morning in the Senate, told her, they were making a Law for men to have plurality of Wives. But it is somewhat a more Tragical Relation <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives of <hi>Fulvius.

my time is come, and I must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gone. The Devil you shall, <hi>said I</hi>; you wou'd engage me in a pretty Affair; I promise a Lady a Defence of her Sex, and you will make me send her a Satyr against it. Truly, my dear Friend, <hi>said he,</hi> I design'd to have told you all, but 'tis later than I thought, and I have Business waits for me. No Business, <hi>said I,</hi> can be so considerable to you, as the satisfying a fair Lady is to me, therefore sit down, and bring me fairly off what you have told me already, or you and I shall be Friends no longer. <hi>After all, Madam, to tell you the truth, tho' there is no great matter in this speech of</hi> Misogynes, <hi>yet I can hardly believe he made it upon a sudden; 'tis possible tho' they two having discours'd the matter as they told us before; might have provided themselves each with Arguments.

wou'd be suffer'd to talk so long without interruption; at least I am sure, some who we know were none of the Company. But 'tis possible, that he who told me, might leave out all that was spoke by others, for brevity sake, being as you see in haste.</hi>

            <p>If you are as apt to be mistaken in your Judgment of Things as of Looks (<hi>reply'd Philogynes</hi>) 'tis no wonder you shou'd make such strange Conclusions. Whatever seriousness you may see in my Face, does not, I'll assure you, proceed from any distrust of my Cause, but an astonishment at what strange Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Invention of man can suggest against the best things that are. I say, The Invention of man, for I am far from believing you in earnest in this point; I have too just an opinion of <hi>Misogynes</hi> to think he does any thing but put on this humour for a tryal of skill; and I no more believe you a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of Women, for the Invective you have made against 'em, than I believe <hi>Erasmus</hi> a lover of Folly, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium he has writ upon it. If you have therefore any thing more to urge, forbear it not upon any suppos'd Conviction you see in my Countenance; for, notwithstanding that I think you have handled the Subject as fully as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one who has undertaken it, yet I'll assure you I cannot submit to your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and therefore am very ready to hear any thing you have further to urge. No, <hi>says Misogynes,</hi> I am sensible I have troubled the Company long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough about a trifle, and 'tis very fit you shou'd have your turn of speaking now. <hi>Part of the Company was already convinc'd by his Arguments, the other part thought he had said as much as the matter wou'd bear, and therefore both agreed in desiring</hi> Philogynes <hi>to speak what he

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99018:38"/>
we all see: On the other side, I know how natural it is, for every one to avoid contempt; and when a man is despis'd in one place, what so reasonable as to make you believe he is esteem'd in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And I hope the Gentlemen themselves will take it for a Compliment, when I tell 'em I do not believe a word they say in this point; since certainly a Man of Honour wou'd rather of the two, tell a Lye to the prejudice of a Woman who uses him ill, than a truth to the utter ruine of one who grants him all the favours he can ask.</p>
            <p>But let us judge 'em by their Actions say you! Do not most of the young Heiresses run away with pitiful Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? If they do, Sir, it should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deserve your Pity than your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; or if you must be angry, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the Guardians whose seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity frighten 'em away, and yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

'Tis no wonder that one who has never seen any Town, but where he was born, should think that the finest in the World; and you cannot blame a Woman for being in Love with a Man who does not deserve her, if she never saw any who did. All that we can reasonably expect in that point is, that she shou'd make some satisfaction when she see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the World better; and if she shews her contempt of her Choice then, 'tis as much (if not more) than can be required. In like manner you cannot say a Widow makes an ill Choice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you prove she was offer'd a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If a Man, who is obliged to ride a Journey, does it upon an ill Horse, you will be very well satisfy'd certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he tells you, 'tis the best he cou'd get. (<hi>I confess, Madam, this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99018:39"/>
seems to me but a very indifferent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for the Widows; for he wou'd make us believe, 'tis but next Oars with 'em; and so I told my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Modesty being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an inseparable Quality of wit, there is no wonder that a Man who is possest of that, should so seldom succeed in these Undertakings. Whilst Fools, by their natural impudence push on the thing; and Married Women are a sort of Forts that are sooner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Storm than Treaty. So that

            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, as I cannot see any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Women should naturally love Fools, more then Men of Wit, so I shall very hardly be brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to believe they do. In a Husband I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they propose a Man whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation shall be agreeable as wel as his Person; and who shall have wit
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99018:40"/>
to entertain 'em, as well as wisdom to direct 'em; and in whom can this be found, but in Men of the best Sense? If in a Gallant, as you say, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Pleasure without scandal, 'tis very hard the heat that warms a Man's Brain, should so entirely settle there, as to render him incapable of pleasing'em otherways; though 'tis possible, by reason of his having variety of thoughts to divert him, he may not give himself so entirely up to those pleasures, as People less capable of thinking do: and for the scandal, who so proper to hinder that, as those who have prudence to mannage things so as not to be found out, and wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to turn it off if they are? Whilst a Fool by his want of Sense shall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make the thing publick, if there be an Intrigue, or by his vanity brag of one, though there be none. Add to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99018:40"/>
this, that when a Woman seems pleas'd with a Man of wit, every body is apt to attribute it to the pleasure of his Conversation; whereas, when she is fond of a Man, in whom we can see nothing to be lik'd, we naturally sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose she likes him for something that we do not see: and though 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it may be only want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Lady, yet the world is apt to Compliment her Understanding in that Case, to the prejudice of her Reputation. And to conclude, Sir, though I do not believe all those Men successful who say they are not, yet I am very much inclined to believe all those Men not to be successful, who say they are.</p>
            <p>For your Examples of Women Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have sufficiently I think reply'd to them already; and for your other Arguments, if it be an affront to call
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99018:41"/>
a Man effeminate, I hope you do not think it any great Compliment to tell a Woman she is Masculine; and had that Argument been urg'd against you, I dare answer for you, you wou'd have said, that that only proved the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Sexes diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet when we come to examine the Cause
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99018:42"/>
of this disorder, what is it, but <hi>Morats</hi> giving him his Life at her request, or his leaning upon her Lap when he dyed. I rather mention this than any of the Poets you spoke of, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the motions and Passions of a Lover are described with as much Art and Delicacy, as in any of those Ancients, but also, that seeing the whole business before you, you may judge of every little cause of his disorder, as well as he himself, which in Odes and Elegies you cannot do; You see the Lover there in a fury, but what cause he has to be so, there is no body to tell you, but he who is in it. Add to this, that a Man often feigns jealousie of his Mistress, to hinder her from being so of him, and will upbraid her falshood to defend his own. (<hi>That is a thing now I confess, Madam, which I can hardly believe.</hi>) And it is evident,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99018:43"/>
they had not really any such bad O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Women, since with all this they did not cease to run after 'em. However, if you think these general Answers not sufficient; let us see what we can say to particulars. For the Complaints of Cruelty and Scorn; I look upon 'em as things of course, and therefore shall say nothing to 'em. If <hi>Anacreon's</hi> Mistress did ask him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but money; why did he chuse one whose necessities drove her upon it. And if other Men have made complaints of the Womens minding wealth more than Love; I desire to know whether Women have not as much reason to make the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Men. And for those who talk of their Mistresses incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, let us see first whether they were Constant to them. For <hi>Ovid,</hi> he does not pretend to put it upon you,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99018:43"/>

For <hi>Horace, Suetonius,</hi> (or who ever it was that writ his Life) informs you that he was intemperately given to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and what wonder then, that a Man who try'd so many, shou'd find one or two false. <hi>Tibullus</hi> had two <note n="3" place="bottom">

Thus what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever qualifications those Great Men had, Constancy you see was none; and tho' we allow you, each of 'em had merit enough for any one Woman, yet one Man can hardly have enough for half a score.</p>
            <p>Now if Ruine and Desolation has come to Great Men, and States, from Women, it shew'd they had a good Opinion of the Sex in general, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99018:44"/>
they wou'd suffer for 'em; and had they not been sensible the greatest part were good, they cou'd never have been impos'd upon by the bad. Then as for those Ill Women whom you have mention'd, as I suppose you will not undertake to defend all the Actions of Tyrants, and Murderers; so I do not think my self at all obliged to defend all the Women who have been guilty of some of their Crimes. The Dispute is not whether there have been any Ill Women in the world, but whether there are not more Good. And when I have told you that the same Book that condemns <hi>Dalilah,</hi> cries up <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and <hi>Iael</hi>; That if <hi>Homer</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Helen</hi> guilty of some faults (for you will see that <hi>Homer</hi> does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present her Cause so violently bad) he tells us of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi> and a thousand others who were very good
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99018:45"/>
ones; That if <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> was false to <hi>Agamemnon, Penelope</hi> was as Famous for her Truth to <hi>Vlysses</hi>; and so put you Example against Example, which I forbear to do, only because it is so very easie; should I, I say, do but this, you cou'd not complain that your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were unanswer'd. But truly, Sir, we might carry the thing much farther; we might defend some of those Women you mention'd, and excuse the rest. For <hi>Dalilah</hi> I shall say nothing, out of respect to the Scripture, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents her as an Ill Woman; 'tis possible, were she alive, she might tell you in her own defence, that what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you have of her, is from her profest Enemies: That however taking the thing as they tell it; if she did commit a piece of treachery, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Enemy of her Country; and that it was very hard she should be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99018:45"/>
so much run down for the same thing they have so much admired in <hi>Iael</hi> and <hi>Iudeth,</hi> as well as every body else did in <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi>; she wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps push her defence further, and tell you, that thô she deliver'd <hi>Samson</hi> to the <hi>Philistins</hi> to be kept Prisoner, yet she neither drove a Nail through his head, nor cut it off. But for <hi>Helen,</hi> give me leave to tell you, 'tis a great dispute amongst the Historians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she was forc'd away by <hi>Paris,</hi> or went by her own consent; several are of the former Opinion; and <note n="1" place="bottom">

very well profess her self a Mistress of 'em; and all this before she was thirty Years of Age.

seiz'd upon like accounts since, yet you see there has not been one of 'em who ever made a Discovery.

            <p>But no wonder you are so severe upon the faults of Modern Women, when you fall upon those whom all Antiquity has reverenc'd. 'Tis hard

that <hi>Iael</hi> and <hi>Iudeth,</hi> whose Actions have been so long admir'd, should be call'd to account for them so many Thousand years after.

But must poor <hi>Penelope</hi> fall under your displeasure too? I am sensible how much she is like to suffer, who is defended by so dull a Fellow as <hi>Homer,</hi> against those most ingenious Gentlemen, who are the Lampooners of our Age: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as their Ability in scandal needs no foreign aid; and as I am satisfied they would think it a disparagement to 'em to be reckon'd with <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> let us free 'em, pray, from such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Companions.

            <p>After all this, Sir, if you still think with <hi>Le Chambre</hi> that Men have a greater natural inclination to Vertue than Women, yet I hope you will grant they have taken a very becoming care to overcome that Inclination; and if Nature has not given so large a Talent to the other Sex, yet they have improved that Talent much better than we have done ours.

            <p>But it is generally agreed that all Vertues are requisite for those who Govern well; and since there are some Countries where Women are Excluded from the Throne, and no Countrey where they are not post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, it wou'd be convenient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks to see what they do, when by accident they are plac'd upon it.

to the Glory so Heroick an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking deserved; however as it was neither want of Courage nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in her, so we ought to render her that veneration which is due to so resolute an Enterprize.</p>
            <p>But as one of the greatest attempts the <hi>Britains</hi> made for their Liberty was whilst they were led by a Woman; so we must own the greatest Glory our Nation cou'd ever boast, was under the Government of one of the same Sex. It was in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that this Island arrived at that pitch of greatness, to which it had been ascending for several Ages, and from which it has been declining 'till very lately ever since; 'Tis the Name of this Princess that is dearer to all <hi>Englishmen,</hi> than the Names of all the Monarchs since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest besides, and the only one whose

            <p>But however we may forget things that are past, let us not oversee that which lies before our eyes; and since the occasion is so very fair, I know not how we can omit the shewing our Sense of those Vertues, of which the whole Nation has demonstrated so grateful an acknowledgment by the Body of their Representatives; and never were they more truly their Repre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99018:70"/>
the Sun. A Princess, who though she never shew'd any fondness of Vain-Glory, or Authority, yet when the necessity of the Kingdom called her to the Helm, Managed Affairs with that dexterity which is very rarely found in those who are the most am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of Command. Every thing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that little time of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was order'd with that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Conduct, and Prudence, that her greatest Friends cannot find Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough to commend, nor her greatest Enemies the least pretences to condemn. Though she had a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band venturing his Life in another Countrey, with a Bravery equal to what has made us suspect the Stories of Antiquity; Tho' our Fleet, the Bulwarks of the Nation, was managed in a manner the Courage of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:99018:70"/>
Seamen was utterly unacquainted with; Tho' a Monarch, who thinks himself able to contend with all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> together, seem'd to make his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Efforts against a Princess, who had nothing but the Universal Hearts of her Subjects to defend her; Tho' all Christendom was in suspence to see the Event of the Undertaking; and every little Prince had forgot his own danger, to contemplate hers; Even at this time did we see her look with all the unconcern imaginable, and whilst every body else was alarum'd for her Safety, she only seem'd to have known nothing of the Danger. Not that this unconcern proceeded from any igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of her Condition, or unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Contempt of her Adversary; No, she provided against their Attempts with all the prudence cou'd be wisht
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99018:71"/>
for, at the same time that she lookt upon the Danger with all the Courage in Nature.</p>
            <p>But however great these Vertues may appear, when they are set off by the Lustre of a Publick Command, yet they are in effect much greater, when they teach People to despise all such dazling Trifles. Here it is, Sir, that we have a fresh Field for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when we see a Lady dissatisfi'd at that Glory which she had to every bodies satisfaction beside, and grudge her self that Authority, which she ow'd to the absence of a Husband whom she loved so much better than that. What think you, Sir, of that alacrity, of that joy with which she resign'd up the Government? Does it not put you in mind of the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who quitted their Plow to

            <p>These are those Blazing Comets, whose fatal Glories portend Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a Government, whilst the Vertues of the others, like those of the Sun, give it Life and Heat, by
