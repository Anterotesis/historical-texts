            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough your great Kindneſs and Care of the health of me and mine, much oblige me to you, and your Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worth much more, and your worthy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren command my great Reſpect and Love; yet none of theſe ſhould have moved me to ſay a word of all that I have ſaid of your deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wife, which I had not verily believed to be true: And it was Gods Grace in her, which much more commanded it, than all my debt to you and yours.</p>
            <p>She was ſo Exemplary, as that I think it my Duty for the good of others, to make this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of her Character, and of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34217:3"/>But one great Defect is here to be notified to the Reader, That almoſt all her ſecret way of Duty, and particular Converſe is omitted, which you that were ſtill with her, could have deſcribed; For I thought meet to ſay no more than I either knew my ſelf, or was obvious and known to many.</p>
            <p>The words which I heard but yeſterday from the mouth of your Brother in diſcourſe, were ſuch as I doubt can be ſaid of few, that in ſo many Years, <hi>from the hour of her Marriage, to her Death, ſhe was never known to do one diſobliging action, or ſpeak one diſobliging word, of or to any one of her Husbands Kindred or Relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had it ſeemed meet to you, or to your worthy and ingenious Son, and your pious Daughter (the true image of her Mother) to have been the Deſcriber of the Soul and Life, of this Exemplary Saint, how much more fully could you have done it, than I, that was ſo much leſs acquainted with her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34217:3"/>She is gone home, and you and I are at the door; The Lord give us ſo to live by Faith on the Promiſe and Love of God, and the things unſeen, that thence we may daily fetch our ruling Motives, and ſtabliſhing Conſolations, and not from a tranſitory deceitful world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and following Chriſt and his Saints under the Croſs, may with them poſſeſs the incorruptible Crown; and be found at his Call among thoſe that love his appearing, and be for ever with the Lord. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>A Text that ſpeaketh of Rejoycing, and that in an heritage, and an heritage for ever, may ſeem unſuitable to a mournful Funeral: But it was choſen by our deceaſed friend, and not without juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable reaſon. That which was a day of Sorrow to us, was a day of Reſt and Joy to her; and it was meet that ſhe ſhould foreſee that Joy, and taſting it in the firſt-fruits, ſhould commend that to us which ſhe had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34217:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
found ſo ſweet, and would bring us to the felicity which ſhe hath now obtained. If the damned ſenſualiſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. would have had one ſent from another world, in hope to ſave his unbelieving Brethren, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if a holy perſon were deſirous that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould partake of her pleaſure and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: and like the Lepers that found the Siege of <hi>Sama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia</hi> raiſed, would not feaſt and rejoyce alone. She choſe this, no doubt, as that which was moſt lively imprinted on her own heart, with a juſt deſire that it might be imprinted alſo on the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that ſo we may not only rejoyce with her that now rejoyceth in the heavenly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Every man may prove his own works, and ſo may have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not</hi> (only) <hi>in another.</hi> Let us therefore by God's aſſiſtance ſo improve theſe words, as may conduce to this deſired end.</p>
            <p>By God's [<hi>Teſtimonies</hi>] here is meant that ſupernaturally revealed <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was poſſeſſed by the Church of the Jews, as God's peculiar people, ſuppoſing the Law of Nature, and the common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

which God had given to all the reſt of faln mankind: Both the Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are here included; the Types and their ſignification of the thing typified.</p>
            <p>[<hi>I have taken them</hi>] ſignifieth, I have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them,</hi> implying that God revealed them; and I have <hi>Accepted them,</hi> implying, that <hi>God had Offered them</hi>; and <hi>I have choſen them,</hi> implying the preferring them before all competitors; and <hi>I have truſted them,</hi> as ſignifying their ſpecial uſe, for the <hi>guiding, ſtabliſhing, quieting,</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>[<hi>For an heritage</hi>] ſignifieth</p>
            <p n="1">1. As that which I truſt to as my <hi>ſecurity</hi> for an <hi>heavenly Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And as that which now is my <hi>beſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> while I am in the way, (including the things connoted.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as that which I prefer before all Wealth and worldly Heritage. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> had larger Dominions than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; but neither of them was King of God's peculiar People, that had poſſeſſion of his Oracles, nor had the Promiſes which he had, that Chriſt ſhould be his

Son and Succeſſor on his Throne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>word</hi> [<hi>for ever</hi>] relateth both to the <hi>Inheritance as everlaſting,</hi> and alſo to <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>choice,</hi> as immutably hereupon determined.</p>
            <p>They are ſaid to be the <hi>Rejoycing of the heart aptitudinally</hi> in themſelves, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to chooſe them, and <hi>actually,</hi> becauſe he had <hi>choſen, believed, loved,</hi> and <hi>obeyed</hi> them.</p>
            <p>So that this is the ſum of the ſenſe [<hi>worldly men make choice of a worldly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and hopes, and on this they truſt; and in this they ſeek their chiefeſt pleaſure: But I, though bleſſed largely with thy bounty, have ſuffered many afflictions in the world: But thy Word hath been my Guide, and thy Promiſes ſtill fulfilled to me; and experience hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed my Faith and Reſolution, to lay all my Hope upon thy Word or Covenant, both for this life, and that to come, and from it I ſeek and fetch my comfort: It hath been my joy in all my ſorrows, and in it to the laſt will I rejoyce</hi>] This is the ſenſe of the Text, from which we are all taught.</p>

And did we not ſee that ſin maketh many uncapable, it would be harder to reaſon to believe that all ſhall not be bleſſed by ſuch a God, than that all the faithful ſhall be bleſſed.

that which no meer man could tell us? How <hi>God</hi> made <hi>Man</hi> and all the <hi>World,</hi> and what <hi>Laws</hi> he gave him? How ſin came into the world, and death by ſin?

If <hi>good Laws</hi> be the ſafety and honour of <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> are not <hi>God's Laws</hi> ſo to all the World?

And which of us cannot ſay, Had I been ruled by <hi>God's Laws,</hi> I had eſcaped all the guilt, the ſhame, the corrections, the terrours that have befallen me?

            <p>O how glad would every true Chriſtian be, if God's Laws were fuller written on his heart, and he could but be and do all that God therein commandeth. For want of

            </p>
            <p>How joyful ſhould we be if we could but <hi>truſt God, and love him, and obey him,</hi> and be free from ſin, as much as the Law of God commandeth us? We teſtifie therefore <hi>that the Law is holy, and juſt, and good,</hi> while we repent that we break it, and wiſh that we could better keep it: For this would keep our Souls from guilt and ſhame, and terrors, and our bodies from much calamity and pain; all Gods ways are pleaſantneſs, and all his paths are peace.

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34217:11"/>II. But how are <hi>God's Teſtimonies</hi> our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage <hi>for ever</hi>? When in Heaven vve ſhall have no need of Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. [<hi>For ever</hi>] ſometime ſignifieth, <hi>to the end of my life</hi>] as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 23. <hi>I ſhall dwell in the Houſe of the Lord for ever</hi>; and ſo oft.

            <p n="2">2. And the <hi>Heritage promiſed</hi> by them, and <hi>connoted,</hi> is <hi>everlaſting</hi>; and the holineſs imprinted by them on his Soul, vvill be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated, and perfected in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>What is it for Believers to take God's Teſtimonies for their Heritage</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is ſuppoſed that the flattering world, and the pleaſures of the fleſh, do ſtand here in competition, and are by many taken for <hi>their beſt,</hi> and this beeauſe they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34217:12"/>
either <hi>think not of,</hi> or <hi>believe</hi> not the better things of a life to come, and the comforts of a holy proſpect and preparation. In this caſe every true Believer, ſeriouſly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, and what can be ſaid on both ſides, what the world and fleſh will be and do for him, and what God and grace, and glory will be and do, doth wiſely diſcern and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the world is vanity, and ſin abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God is all ſuffient, infinitely good, and to be truſted, and his word moſt wiſe, and juſt, and true: And therefore though his belief have its imperfections and aſſaults, yet he ſo far believeth Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to be ſure, and his precepts to be good and neceſſary, as that he reſolveth here to place his hope and truſt for his whole felicity in this life and hereafter, and to give up himſelf to the ſtudy, love, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Gods Laws, as the <hi>guide and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and comfort</hi> of his Soul, renouncing all the flatteries of the fleſh and world which ſtand againſt it, and are preferred by ſenſual Unbelievers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:34217:12"/>In few words, this was <hi>Davids</hi> faith and choice, and this is the faith and choice of all true Believers, by which we may diſcern whether we are ſuch; though all have not the <hi>ſame degree</hi> of truſt and fixed reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet all have this much in ſincerity.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Queſt <hi>But can all ſay, They are the Rejoycing of my heart</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> All of them can ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We <hi>ſee</hi> that there is in the Word and Covenant of God in Chriſt, unſpeakably more <hi>matter fit to be our Joy,</hi> than in all the pleaſures, and wealth, and honours of this world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And therefore we <hi>prefer</hi> it before them all, in our <hi>deſire</hi> and our <hi>fixed choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And we find ſo much <hi>goodneſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs</hi> to us in this ſacred Word, as that we <hi>love it</hi> as our <hi>food</hi> and our <hi>ſecurity,</hi> though not with the appetite and love which we deſire.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And though we have not that joy in this our love to it, and in the hopes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34217:13"/>
glory, which a <hi>ſtronger faith and love</hi> would cauſe, yet we find that it is our <hi>beſt,</hi> and we perceive more good in it than in ſinful pleaſures; and the true and chief ſupport of our Souls in all our fears and troubles, and in our proſpect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, is from the love and Word of God through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And though our pleaſure in it be not ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and luſcious, it is much more ſolid and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying to our Souls, than we find in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
            <p>And the ſweetneſs which we taſte in it, is greater at ſome times than at other.</p>
            <p>And the comfort which we have in our bodily health and welfare, is much as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to us the love of God performing to us his promiſes, and helping us to ſerve him with joy and gladneſs, in order to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy.</p>
            <p>This is the ordinary caſe of true believers; though extraordinarily; 1. Some tempted, troubled, melancholy Chriſtians overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief and fears, do not perceive this much in themſelves. 2. And the healthfuller ſtronger ſort of Chriſtians have yet a more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34217:13"/>
ſweet and conſtant pleaſure, in the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Ways of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſaid this much for <hi>Explication,</hi> a little more may ſuffice to ſhew you <hi>why</hi> and <hi>whence</hi> it is that <hi>Believers</hi> receive the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>God</hi> with this fixed <hi>Choice,</hi> and <hi>Truſt,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is from <hi>honeſt Self Love</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi>: They certainly find that it is <hi>their beſt</hi>; that it is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and that there is nothing elſe to be found in this World, that will ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, to be a quieting ſecurity, guide and comfort to the Soul. They perceive what <hi>they need</hi>; and that nothing elſe can ſupply thoſe needs: This muſt be their Hope, or they muſt deſpair.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is from <hi>Holy Suitableneſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and the goodneſs which they reliſh in his Word. As <hi>God</hi> giveth every living Creature an <hi>Appetite</hi> ſuitable to his Food, and Benefits, ſo doth he to the <hi>New Creature. Holineſs</hi> is moſtly the Souls Appetite to <hi>God,</hi> and ſpiritual good. The word which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth and guideth us to the incorruptible Crown of glory, is an incorruptible ſeed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6. and it is our Milk or Food,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34217:14"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. and by it we are made Partakers of the <hi>divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and it is the <hi>ingrafted or innaturalized word which is able to ſave our Souls,</hi> Jam. 1.21. And as the whole ſtock is marvellouſly turned to ſerve a little <hi>graft,</hi> which is planted into it, and as if it had loſt its former kind, doth bring forth only the fruit of the graft, ſo is <hi>God's Word</hi> implanted in us to the change of our <hi>nature,</hi> and our <hi>fruits.</hi> And it is no ſound Appetite which hath no pleaſure. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if a ſtrong belief do cauſe us <hi>to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory, that we may receive the end of our faith, our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>All <hi>God's Commands</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> have by the divine impreſſion of them on our ſouls, leſt ſomewhat there which is like them, and connatural; even a <hi>holy light</hi> to underſtand their truth and goodneſs, and a <hi>holy love</hi> to them, and the things revealed, to <hi>deſire them,</hi> and <hi>take pleaſure</hi> in them, and a <hi>holy livelineſs</hi> to purſue the good deſired. And this is the writing of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> on our hearts: And in this ſenſe it may be ſaid that <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is in our ſouls, and dwelleth in us, even as an <hi>efficient</hi> principle,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34217:14"/>
and a beloved Object, and deſired end. And if this be all that they intend, thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> have no reaſon to accuſe us, for not preaching a <hi>God,</hi> and a Chriſt within us. And if this be it that is meant by thoſe who tell the World, that by ſaying that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is in us,</hi> we are more arrogant than the Pope, that claimeth a viſible Monarchy; we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this joyful priviledge, this earneſt, ſeal and firſt-fruits of heavenly glory, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thank him who hath vouchſafed it, and aſſured us of it in his word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 11. 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.12, 15, 16. And if the Scorners have any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Scriptures, let them read and tremble, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I have given you the ſenſe and the reaſon of this Doctrine: We come hither to learn what uſe to make of it. And I think if I preach alſo on the <hi>Copy</hi> or <hi>Impreſs</hi> of this Text, whoſe Reliques we have laid in the duſt, and tell us <hi>what uſe ſhe made of ſuch Doctrine,</hi> it will be a conſiderable help to our own Application.</p>

            <p>When She choſe this Text, it was from ſuch a ſutable ſpirit, as all men chooſe the food, the friends and company, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſcourſe which by agreeableneſs they moſt delight in. That She made Gods Word and Covenants, (connoting Gods Love, Chriſt, Grace and Glory, the ſpring,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34217:16"/>
matter and end) her beſt, her heritage, her all, contemning all that ſtood in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that theſe were the rejoycing of her heart, She ſhewed to us that knew Her by theſe notable effects.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By her conſtant, ſerious, diligent uſe of the Word of God, by hearing, reading, conference and meditation. Her food was not more conſtantly uſed, nor I believe ſo ſweet to her. Her hearing in the publick Aſſemblies, nothing but neceſſity could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt: And her private conſtancy her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations know. She practically told us that the bleſſed mans <hi>delight is in the Law of the Lord, and therein doth he meditate day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1.2.</p>
            <p n="2">II. She <hi>made ſo much,</hi> (in eſteem, uſe and thankfulneſs) of <hi>every little</hi> of the help She could get in theſe ſpiritual things, as ſhewed that they were her heritage and joy. When ſome come home with <hi>accuſations</hi> of the Sermon, as <hi>dry, dull,</hi> or <hi>weak,</hi> She found in it ſomething for profit and ſolace: I am ſure my own converſation and duties have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34217:17"/>
been truly guilty of the foreſaid faults, and yet how gladly would She come over the way to us at prayer time. How much did She value now and then a little (too dull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable) conference, and took it for a loſs that She could have no more. How glad was ſhe of now and then a too dry and ſhort Letter, and how carefully would ſhe keep them. As if with the Woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> She had been begging for the crums. Alas our duller appetites ſeldom ſo deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or delight in, much larger portions of well-dreſt food, but fulneſs hath loathing, and we call it <hi>dry manna,</hi> which we are weary of; or every little fault in the dreſſing turneth our ſtomach againſt it; full ſouls loath the honey-comb, but to the hungry every bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing is ſweet.</p>
            <p n="3">III. She loved and received the Word of God from <hi>any faithful. Miniſter that brought it:</hi> Its true that She <hi>more frequented and deſired</hi> ſome than others: But her Religion was not Faction, or ſiding with this Party or with that: She was far from a Shiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal mind or practice. When one Party ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34217:17"/>
from all that Preach in the Pariſh Churches, and another from all that Preach elſewhere, She ſeparated from neither.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Accordingly She loved all perſons that feared God, as ſuch: Not confining her Affections or Kindneſs to thoſe of this or that controvertible Opinion: But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and holy ſimplicity, and ſerious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Religion which She had her ſelf, was it that She loved in all others whomſoever.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And accordingly her <hi>conference</hi> was not about <hi>controverſies,</hi> or matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which too many ſpend their hours in theſe times, but that which tendeth to edification, and to adminiſter grace to the hearers: She was not ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> oft repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for <hi>ſtriving about words,</hi> and little things, that tend not to edifie but ſubvert.</p>
            <p n="4">VI. Much leſs was She tainted with any Hereſie, or dangerous Errour in Religion, nor ever drawn from the truth, and her ſpiritual ſtedfaſtneſs; but cleaved to the form of wholſom words, and the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34217:18"/>
that is in Chriſt, and to them that held the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace; avoiding the vain janglings of men of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Pride and Corrupt minds.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. She was not of a cenſorious back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting temper, nor uſed, as too many faulty Chriſtians, to make it her diſcourſe, to find fault with others, and make her ſelf the judge of Controverſies, Caſes, Actions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which ſhe underſtood not: but had learned that leſſon, [<hi>ſpeak evil of no man,</hi>] and to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>be called</hi> to it, before ſhe <hi>judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. She was very deſirous of the good of all, and glad of any thing which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote the converſion and ſaving of mens ſouls.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. She was charitable and liberal alſo to their bodies; in an unuſual degree; as I am able to ſay by particular experience, in which I have known it exerciſed to the poor.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34217:18"/>X. Her humility and deteſtation of pride was manifeſt, not only in her Garb and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, but in her low thoughts of her ſelf, and the lowlineſs of all her Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and great diſlike of all that ſavoured of Pride.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. She was not moroſe, nor a refuſer of Converſe or uſeful Viſits, when reaſon requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them: but She took it for a great Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to have much diverſion by company or by matters, from her conſtant courſe of better work: And (beſides her health) was therefore the more Inclined to be much in the Country, that her mind and time might not be at the Mercy of too much intruding diverſions, and unprofitable diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Much more was <hi>She</hi> a verſe to all ſorts of <hi>ſenſuality</hi>: ſuch pleaſing of the fleſh as corrupteth the mind, and turneth it from holy work and pleaſure; and ſuch vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations as waſte precious time, and profit not our ſelves or others: Holy things were her food and feaſt, her work and recreation.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:34217:19"/>XIII. Her <hi>prudence</hi> in all matters was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exemplary; being much more againſt unadviſed raſhneſs, and actions which tend to ill effects, than moſt of us of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sex: and I confeſs I ſhould think much better of my ſelf if I could equal her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In which her Acquaintance commonly admired her, though this is a point which all muſt acknowledge much imperfection in.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. And her gentleneſs, meekneſs and calmneſs of mind and carriage was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable to her friends and moſt that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with her: She was a great Adverſary to paſſionate behaviour, which ſurely came from that Power of Grace, which had made love and meekneſs become a nature in her, ſeeing no ſuch thing could be elſe expected in one of her Sex and Complexion, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily weakneſſes.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. <hi>She</hi> did not, as the Hypocrite, give God the ſecond place in her heart and life, and the World the firſt, nor put off Chriſt with the leavings of the fleſh, nor take this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34217:19"/>
World for her beſt or heritage, and the next only for a reſerve when ſhe muſt needs leave this: <hi>She</hi> ſeemed to prize no Heritage but God, nor to ſet much by any tranſitory vanity whatever.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. <hi>She</hi> excelled in the earneſt deſire of her Childrens good, and in the care of their well-doing and ſalvation. How oft hath ſhe deſired me to pray for them? How glad was ſhe if I would at any time but converſe with them, and adviſe them: they know better themſelves (though I know much,) how much ſhe prayed for them? How oft and tenderly ſhe counſelled them? What Letters of ſerious holy Counſel ſhe would write to them? And how like ſhe was to <hi>Job,</hi> who prayed and ſacrificed for his Children, when they were merry and feaſting together, fearing leſt they ſhould forget God and ſin againſt him?</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. This kind of life which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>was her calling and trade,</hi> and in a manner her <hi>only buſineſs in the World:</hi> It was not now and then in a good mood, like a Feaſt or Recreation: but as ſhe knew that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34217:20"/>
               <hi>one thing is needful,</hi> ſo ſhe choſe that <hi>better part,</hi> which never was, nor will be taken from her. She ſo lived as if ſhe had but <hi>this one thing to mind and do in the world,</hi> to pleaſe God by obeying him, and to cleave to Chriſt, and to do good, and to be ſaved. Nothing elſe ſeemed to be much in her mind, thoughts, care, and buſineſs; her <hi>life</hi> ſeemed to be but this <hi>one thing.</hi> But I muſt confeſs that poor and tempted Perſons, that are under many worldly wants, croſſes and employments, cannot be expected to reach her meaſure in this: Though <hi>one thing</hi> be their <hi>beſt and portion,</hi> they may be toſt with many troubleſome cares and buſineſſes. But God gave her both <hi>mind, opportunity and help</hi> to live in as even a courſe of conſtant holineſs in a Family, as Monks can pretend to or hope for in their Community or ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Religion was her very life.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. In this life ſhe had alſo a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant peace of Conſcience,</hi> bewailing her <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,</hi> but not living in melancholy, deſpair, hard thoughts of God, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſort of Religion: I have oft
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34217:20"/>
heard her ſpeak of her lamented weakneſs of Faith, Love, and heavenly deſires and joy, but never, that <hi>I</hi> remember, one doubting word of her own ſincerity and ſalvation: But her ordinary ſpeech was lamenting that we were all ſo weak in our belief of the Word of God, and the unſeen World, and what execellent Perſons we ſhould be if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we had a ſtronger Faith that were liker unto ſight; and how much it ſhould be the buſineſs of all believers, to pray and labour for an increaſed powerful belief hereof, as that which would ſet all right in us</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Her patience under her bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities alſo was exemplary. Her weakneſs made her ſo lyable to dangerous Coughs while ſhe was in <hi>London</hi> air, that by this ſhe was conſtrained to live much from home. And moſt of all her life ſhe was tormented with a frequent head-ach? But in her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all this She did poſſeſs her Soul; and patience furthered experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hope, and ſhe learnt more the quiet fruits of righteouſneſs by being much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed herein.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34217:21"/>XX. And as by this She daily learned to dye, ſo the expectation and preparation for death, was her continual work and ſtate. She lived and heard, and prayed, and wrote her Letters to her Children as at the brink of the Grave, and the Door of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Not that her Diſeaſes did ſeem to us to be very mortal, or threaten this ſudden change. But ſhe knew the brevity of mans life, and that Death is ready to remove us all, and what a moment it is till that certain hour.</p>
            <p>And as ſhe lived holily, and in peace with God and man, ſo ſhe dyed with <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle likelyhood</hi> of the ordinary miſeries of <hi>Fear or Pain</hi>: A little ſoreneſs and ſwelling of her Leg, and pain towards the Hip, turned to two ſwooning fits, and in the third or fourth, having been in quiet diſcourſe with her Husband, ſhe as quietly ſunk and dyed away; deſiring that I ſhould be ſent to pray with her; ſhe was dead before <hi>I</hi> came, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſigns of nature ſtriving: And ſhe had ſaid to her Daughter after her former fits, ſhe did not think that one could have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34217:21"/>
dyed ſo eaſily as ſhe had almoſt done. A death <hi>thus expected,</hi> and <hi>thus prepared for</hi> is not to be called <hi>ſudden</hi>! Thus God can make death eaſie to ſome of us, that are apt to over-fear the antecedent pain. And now what can be more, (almoſt) deſired <hi>in this World,</hi> than ſuch a life and ſuch a death. Our dear Friend is at home with Chriſt, and Gods will, which is Goodneſs and Love it ſelf, is ſo fulfilled; even that will which muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all things, and in which only we muſt ſeek our reſt.</p>
            <p>And having deſcribed this true Copy of the Text, I may boldly ſpeak of it to ſeveral ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I may again ask both <hi>Quakers and Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> Whether the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> do not <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>work</hi> in ſuch among us, as our dear Friend now deceaſed was?</p>
            <p n="2">II. I may ask <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Whether theſe operations of the ſpirit of God on Believers, be not a ſign that God owneth the Goſpel by which he thus worketh? And that Chriſt liveth and reigneth, who can thus ſtill ſend a ſanctifying Spirit into
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34217:22"/>
Believers Souls? And whether it be not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to think and ſay, either that theſe excellent endowments of Souls are not of God, or that he giveth them all in vain, and that Believers are all deceived by God, and labour and hope all their days for that which hath no being; and that the <hi>better</hi> God mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, the more <hi>deluded, vain</hi> and <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> he maketh them, and ruleth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the world by <hi>falſhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I may ask the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> with what Face they can ſay as they uſe to do, <hi>That they never heard of a Proteſtant Saint?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may not be as <hi>Religious</hi> in the places that God hath ſet us in, as if we turned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſes, Monks or Nuns, and ſhut up our ſelves from doing any good in the world.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I may aſk the <hi>Malignant</hi> that call all ſerious Godlineſs <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> whether ſuch a life as this doth ſavour of diſſimulation? And whether ſuch <hi>Seriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> are not contraries, and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> be not a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> without that Seriouſneſs which is ſincerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whether they that in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34217:22"/>
ſolemnly vow to take God for their God, and Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour, and the Holy Ghoſt for Chriſts Advocate and Witneſs, and their Sanctifier and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to renounce the Fleſh, the World and the Devil, and when they have done, perform none of this which they vowed, but live to the Fleſh and World which they renounced, and take a holy life as needleſs, yea and hate it; I ſay, whether theſe be not the impudent Hypocrites that vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that holineſs which they abhor, rather than they that with all their deligence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the holy Vow which they have made. And if Wives promiſe Fidelity to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Servants to their Maſters, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Princes, are they the Hypocrites that are ſerious and keep their promiſe? Or they that were never ſerious in it, but ſcorn the keeping of it?</p>
            <p n="5">V. And as to thoſe malignant perſons that take this ſtrict and ſerious diligence for mens ſouls, to be but <hi>ſcrupuloſity,</hi> or the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of ſome <hi>over-zealous Bigots</hi> or <hi>Puritans</hi> who are moſt inclined to Schiſm, and to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34217:23"/>
be troubleſom or dangerous to States; I ask them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is there in all the deſcription which I have here truly given you, which is injurious or dangerous to Church or State, or any perſon? Will it hurt any one that God and men are ſeriouſly loved? and that <hi>God's Teſtimonies</hi> are truſted and delighted in and obeyed? and that <hi>God's Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is firſt ſought?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not Chriſt, and Chriſtianity, and Scripture that you accuſe? If it be ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and dangerous to be ſerious in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we profeſs and vow, ſurely it is bad in Baptiſm to vow it, and ſtill by calling our ſelves Chriſtians to profeſs it? To accuſe, hate and ſcorn the ſerious Practice of your own profeſt Religion, is to be the moſt fooliſh ſelf-condemners, and in ſome reſpects worſe than Mahometans, Infidels, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But my moſt earneſt deſire is to you the <hi>loving Huſband,</hi> and <hi>beloved Children</hi> of our departed Friend; that you will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook, <list>

But I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you from a juſt ſenſe of your loſs, we that are your <hi>Neighbours</hi> feel it; but you much more, to whom it is much greater: what <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> do <hi>know</hi> of us, or <hi>think</hi> of us, or <hi>do</hi> for us, we ſhall better <hi>know</hi> when we are there: But <hi>here</hi> you are depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the daily prayers which She ſent up for you; of the continuance of her loving care of your ſouls, and watchfulneſs over you; of her wiſe and faithful counſels to you, and of her imitable example, as it was ſtill before you; a Husband of a pious prudent helper, and Children of a tender affectionate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; your great <hi>ſorrows</hi> tell me you feel your loſs.</p>

            <p n="3">(3.) But <hi>Mercy</hi> alſo as well as <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Loſs</hi> muſt be acknowledged. Your ſorrow muſt give due place to <hi>thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Your Mother is taken from you, but remember.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="4">(4) And I have intimated your <hi>Duty,</hi> while I have mentioned your <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>

And how we differ from hypocrites who ſpeak beſt on Heaven, but really look for their beſt of earth: which Chriſt calleth [<hi>Truſting in their Riches,</hi>] becauſe that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their truſt, from which they have their greateſt expectations, and for which they moſt labour and will leave all; this a believer doth for <hi>promiſed</hi> happineſs: And this the worldly hypocrite doth for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the fleſh on Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And here you ſee that faith and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are not melancholy uncomfortable things, as the Devil and the fleſh would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade unexperienced fools and unbelievers: Unleſs it be ſad to have ſecurity from God of a Heavenly heritage, and rejoice therein.</p>
            <p>And here you ſee the differences between the mirth of a fleſhly infidel and of a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint: One is like a drunkard that is merry for an hour in a brutiſh kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooling pleaſure; or like one that hath a pleaſant dream; or one that heareth a jeaſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34217:26"/>
or merry tale, or ſeeth a pretty Comedy or ſhew: The other is more rational and heart-contenting than it ſhould be to any one of you, to have good ſecurity for many hundred years life and health and proſperity here on Earth; ſuch a birth-right do prophane fools ſell for ſuch a morſel; not knowing that the fear of God cauſed by true Faith is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence therefore we may learn how to try our ſincerity of Faith. Doth it make us take Gods promiſe and the thing promiſed as our heritage? Though we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Temptations to doubting, nay nor without the remnants of unbelief, but our hearts are troubled when we look beyond death with many fears, yet if we ſo far truſt Gods Word, as reſolvedly to take it for that which we will adhere to, and lay our chiefeſt hopes upon, we have a faith that will entitle us to the promiſed benefits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome may ſay, I cannot ſay that it is the <hi>Rejoycing of my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Can you ſay that you take it for that in which you <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſeek</hi> your joy,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34217:26"/>
though you cannot yet attain it? And that you prefer not <hi>any other pleaſure</hi> in your <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>ſeeking</hi>? If ſo, you ſhew that you truly believe and truſt to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>God's Word,</hi> though yet you reach not what you ſeek. Deſire is the firſt-fruit of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and holy joy is the <hi>flower</hi> and <hi>perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Cannot you ſay that it is <hi>this Word</hi> that maketh you hope that there is for man a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life, and that you ſhall not periſh like the Beaſts? And that your <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>ſorrows</hi> are ſomewhat abated by the promiſes of God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Cannot you ſay that you perceive a pleaſing goodneſs in the Word of God, which maketh it welcome and acceptable to you?</p>
            <p>By what I have mentioned, you may find,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Word hath not been in vain unto you, when it hath cauſed ſuch effects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that the ſame ſpirit is in you which wrote the Word; or elſe you would not love and deſire it, and take it for ſuitable food and pleaſure, yea, your heritage and joy.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34217:27"/>3. And you may hence perceive that you are not without the love of God himſelf, though you ſee him not, and have not ſuch ſenſible conceptions of him as you have of men and things which you have ſeen: For if you love truth and goodneſs and holineſs in Gods Word, becauſe it is ſuch, you ſure love beſt the <hi>greateſt</hi> truth, goodneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and that is God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And hence you may perceive that though our nature love not death, and a weak faith will not overcome all fears, when we think of coming into an unſeen world, yet really you are lovers of Heaven, in that you are lovers of that which conſtituteth Heaven, and is its deſirableneſs to man; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>holineſs</hi> and Gods Love and glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and our perpetual joy herein. If you deſire this you deſire Heaven, though the fear of death do make you doubt of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And hence you may find that you are not Worldly Hypocrites? elſe it is not Gods Promiſes, and Law, that you would take for your heritage and joy; but worldly proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and fleſhly pleaſure, and <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> ſhould have but the leavings of the fleſh,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34217:27"/>
for fear of an after reckoning at death.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And though your joy be ſmall, you may know that it is of the right kind, when it is chiefly ſought in <hi>God's Love</hi> and <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> and you would not let go the word of <hi>God,</hi> and loſe your part in it for all the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this World.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Hence alſo you may learn why all <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> ſo much value the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Word of <hi>God</hi>? Why they ſo much read it, think of it, talk of it, and hear of it; and are loath that <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould corrupt it, or conceal it in an unknown Tongue; or that any ſhould deny them the neceſſary uſe of it, or ſilence the Miniſters that preach it to them? who would willingly be deprived of his heritage, or heart rejoycing?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Yea, indeed hence we ſee, <hi>how much we ſhould ſet by it, and uſe it,</hi> how dear it ſhould be to us? How ſtrictly we ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it? With what delight we ſhould read it and meditate in it? How diligent we ſhould be to confirm our belief of it, and how we ſhould fetch our hope and comfort from it, in life and at our death?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:34217:28"/>V. And You may ſee hence, that it is no wonder that the Devil and all his Servants in the World are Enemies to the Word of <hi>God.</hi> becauſe they are Enemies to our heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and joy: And there are few better ſigns while many pretend to be for Chriſt, to know who are really for him, and who are againſt him and his greateſt Enemies; than to judge of men as they further or hinder; Love or Hate the Word of <hi>God</hi> as to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe,, as the heritage and joy of <hi>holy ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. But the chief part of <hi>my application</hi> is, to commend this <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>holy choice,</hi> and ſolid comfort to you all; and to beſeech you preſently to imitate <hi>David,</hi> and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all inconſiſtent pleaſures. If <hi>you</hi> live in ſorrow or deceit, and die in deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not for want of an offer from <hi>God</hi> of better things. Have <hi>you</hi> lived hitherto as thus reſolved? If <hi>you</hi> have, the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>you,</hi> and be ſure ſuch hopes ſhall not deceive <hi>you.</hi> If <hi>you</hi> have not, what will <hi>you</hi> now chooſe and do? If <hi>you</hi> live not to ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34217:28"/>
               <hi>end,</hi> you live not like men, according to reaſon. If you have choſen what end to live for and ſeek, what is it? Conſider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeech you, of theſe things following be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What will you take for your heritage, or your beſt, if not the future promiſed joyes, and what will you <hi>take</hi> for your <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> but Gods Word? What is it that you place your chiefeſt hopes in? ſhall health and wealth, and pleaſure to the fleſh, and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our among men, be taken for your heritage? Dare you under your hands make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for theſe to quit all your hopes of the life to come? if not, which is that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and which would you quit, if one muſt be hazarded or loſt? which hath the neareſt and higheſt place in your heartſ? which ſeek you firſt, and make all other things give place to? O Sirs, it is a ſhame to our ſtupid hearts, that we have need to be ſo oft told by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that <hi>we muſt dye,</hi> and that our fleſh muſt ſhortly lie neglected in duſt and darkneſs, till the reſurrection, and that we and all the deceitful trifles of this World are ready to part for ever! It is a ſhame that we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34217:29"/>
muſt be oft told that which every Fool and Child at the uſe of reaſon may know, how poor and how ſhort an heritage or pleaſure all thoſe have, who have no better than this World can give them.</p>
            <p>What ſay you, Will you die in <hi>Hope</hi> or in <hi>Deſpair?</hi> If Unbelief make you hope that there is no Hell, yet <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> you can have none, unleſs you truſt the Word of God? The light of Nature indeed is ſuch a natural Word or Revelation, as may tell us much of a future life of retribution; but Gods ſupernatural revelation is ſo much clearer, that we cannot expect that he will ſee by a leſſer, who wilfully rejects a greater light: ſure all men would live for ever if they could, and all would be for ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: you would not ſure die like Dogs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of a better life hereafter, if you could have good ſecurity for ſuch hopes? And what better ſecurity is there to be found, by mortal men, than (<hi>the Promiſes of God, confirmed by Chriſts Blood and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by the Seal of his holy Spirit.</hi>)</p>
            <p>In a word, without all doubt, <hi>Either Heaven muſt be your Heritage, or you muſt have none that is worthy of a ſerious thought, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34217:29"/>
to keep a man from wiſhing that he had never been born, or been a Brute, that had not reaſon to know the matter of his griefs and fears. And either Gods Word ſeconding the light of Nature, muſt give you hopes of a better life, or you muſt live and dye in meer deſpair.</hi> And ſhall that be your wilful choice?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider how unvaluable a mercy it is, to man, yea, to ſinful miſerable man, that God ſhould vouchſafe to give him ſuch an everlaſting Heritage, and ſuch ſecurity for it, and that on the meere thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acceptance of the ſinner. And how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily will they be undone, that by wilful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal are deprived of freely offered Felicity?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And conſider, how <hi>ſuitable</hi> an Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Security it is that is offered us, and how fit for our joyful acceptance and eſteem.</p>
            <p>The thing promiſed is no leſs than end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs glory with God our Redeemer, and all the bleſſed: it is in the world where we muſt be for ever! It is the perfection of that which every holy Soul deſireth: It is <hi>our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34217:30"/>
beſt, our all</hi>; it muſt be that or nothing; that or Hell.</p>
            <p>The Word or Covenant which is our Truſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is Gods own Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It perfecteth and ſecondeth natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It beareth on it ſelf the impreſs of God, even his power, wiſdom and love, in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, prophecies and grace, it is ſealed by the blood of Chriſt; by his own and his Diſciples multitude of miracles; and by the gift of his ſanctifying Spirit to all true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the end: It is confirmed to our Souls by the experience of the Power of it, and the bleſſed effects, and this in-dwelling Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the witneſs of Chriſt; and by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of prayers, by many providences, and by the experience of all Believers to this day.</p>
            <p>It is excellently ſuited to all our needs; to our wants, our dangers, our fears, our doubts, yea, and our ſinful unworthineſs in the freeneſs of Gods mercy, and all his gifts.</p>
            <p>Indeed man had rather live by ſight, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34217:30"/>
would fain know by ſeeing, whither Souls go, and what they are, and have, and do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But it is not we, but <hi>God</hi> that is the Ruler, and fitteſt to chooſe both the gift and means, the end and way: If we thankfully truſt and improve a promiſe, we ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, and have poſſeſſion. Bleſſed be <hi>God</hi> for the light of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to guide us up to the light of glory. O that we had hearts to truſt it, love it, and rejoice in it, as we have juſt cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And is it not a great mercy of God, that he hath herein called us <hi>to a life of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and preſent joy</hi>? If he had bid us only weep for ſin to the laſt breath, the condition had been eaſie as for pardon and hope of endleſs mercy; but he hath given us a word, which he would have to be the <hi>rejoycing of our hearts</hi>; and do we not love joy? or have we any better?</p>
            <p>I have not now time, and I much more want my ſelf ſuch a mind and heart as I ſhould have, to tell what cauſe of daily joy God hath given us in his word and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. But this I will tell you, that our want
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34217:31"/>
of joy is our daily ſin and ſhame, as well as our loſs and ſuffering; and among all the diſcoveries of the ſinful weakneſs of our Faith, Hope and Love, our want of rejoycing in the word of promiſe, and hope of glory is not the leſs? O what an Enemy is Death in this reſpect, that ſtanding between it, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and affrighneth us from our joys: But Chriſt hath conquered Death, to deliver thoſe that through fear of it are ſubject to Bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. And though we cry, O miſerable men, who ſhall deliver us? we ye thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>And I muſt ſecond the Teſtimony of our deceaſed Friend, in profeſſing for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, my own experience, I have taken <hi>God's Teſtimonies</hi> for my <hi>Heritage,</hi> and they have been theſe fifty Years, or near, the pleaſure of my life, and ſweeter than Honey, and preciouſer than thouſands of gold and ſilver. As we tell men in charity of the things which we have found good, the Medicines that have healed us, and commend the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have been friendly to us, and as man's nature is inclined to propagate the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34217:31"/>
knowledge, and communicate the good which we partake of, and grace increaſeth this inclination; ſo I take it to be my duty, to add herein my own experience, if it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the determining of your cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce: and reaſon teacheth all men to regard that means and remedy and good the more, which many have had experience of; and it is not to be taken for vain oſtentation, to profeſs that which all muſt have in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that will be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Though the natural and ſinful fears of pain and death, too long deprived me of much of the joy which I ſhould have had in the thoughts of the unſeen world, and too much doth ſo to this day, yet I muſt ſay that the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>perſons</hi> that love and practice it, and the holy way of life and peace, and all the means and things that here ſavour of Heaven, have been ſo good and pleaſant to me, as enableth me to aſſure you, that on earth there is nothing ſo worthy of your deſire and joy.</p>
            <p>And to encourage you, I will tell you by my own experience, what benefit may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from this kind of delight, agreeable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34217:32"/>
to <hi>Davids</hi> and our Friends experience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this means my life hath been almoſt a conſtant pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This pleaſure hath much upheld me under almoſt conſtant bodily infirmity and pain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It hath made all my ſufferings from men, and croſſes in the world to be tolerable and very eaſie to me; had not Gods Word been my delight, I had lived uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in conſtant pains and ſorrows, and had periſhed in my trouble.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath ſaved me from the ſnares of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures: mans nature will ſeek for ſome delight, and they that have it not in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, ſeek it in things hurtful and forbidden; it is only greater things that can overcome our miſtaken choice of leſſer. In my Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <hi>I</hi> was ſinfully inclined to the pleaſure of Romances, and of Childiſh Sports; but when <hi>I</hi> taſted the ſweetneſs of Gods Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Ways, <hi>I</hi> needed no other but ſpit out thoſe luſcious unwholeſome Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And though common knowledge, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Learning, be pleaſant to mans nature, and <hi>I</hi> cannot ſay that <hi>I</hi> have not overvalued it,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34217:32"/>
yet I muſt ſay, that the reliſh of theſe greater matters, hath made me ſee how much of it is vanity, and hath ſaved me from the purſuit of that part of it which doth but pleaſe curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and fancy, and tendeth not to uſe and to greater things; and ſenſual pleaſures I had no need of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It hath by this means made that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which I had, to be ſuch as my reaſon did approve and juſtifie, whereas if I had ſought it in preferment, wealth, or ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a foreſeeing Conſcience would have afrighted me out of all my pleaſure, and I ſhould have had more of the pricks than of the Roſe; of the ſting, than of the Honey. Of this pleaſure you need not fear too much; but of the ſenſual pleaſure, we more eaſily catch a mortal ſurfeit</p>
            <p n="6">6. This ſweetneſs of Gods Word, hath made alſo my <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>daily labor</hi> ſweet; ſo that it had my heart, and not my forced hand and tongue.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And this hath helpt my <hi>conſtancy</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: For when we have no delight in our work, we grow weary; and wearineſs tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give it over, or to do it heartleſly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34217:33"/>
and ſlubber it over in unacceptable hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And this hath much ſaved me from the ſinful loſs of time: pleaſure cauſeth trifling and delays; who needeth vain paſtimes, that delighteth in Gods Word and Work?</p>
            <p n="9">9. And this hath been to me an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent help for the increaſe of knowledge: For the myſteries of godlineſs have ſtill more to be learned by the wiſeſt man; and as Boys at School, ſo the Scholars of Chriſt, learn beſt who have moſt pleaſure in their Books.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And this pleaſure hath much confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my belief of the truth of Scripture, when it hath born its own witneſs to my mind, and I have taſted that goodneſs which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to its truth. I eaſily believe him that commendeth a thing to me, when I taſte or feel that it is good.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And this pleaſure hath helped me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vain thoughts and talk, while the truths of God were ſweet, and ſo continually welcome; it's eaſie to think of that which we delight in; and ſinful delights corrupt the thoughts and ſpeech with conſtant ſin.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And this pleaſure hath ſomewhat fed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34217:33"/>
my daily <hi>thankfulneſs</hi> to God, in the conſtant experience of the goodneſs of his truth and ways.</p>
            <p n="13">13. And it cured the error of my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, when I ſtrove for nothing ſo much as to weep for ſin, and perceived not that the joy of the Lord is our ſtrength, and the flower of holineſs, and likeſt to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate; and that the Spirit ſanctifieth, by making God and goodneſs pleaſant to us.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And hereby it made me find, that the praiſes of God are the ſweeteſt and nobleſt exerciſes of Religion; when before I placed more in lamenting ſin and miſery.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And this maketh many things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to me, that elſe would ſeem needful; I want not more company; I want no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation but for my body; if I have not what I would have, I ſee where only it is to be found.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And I am aſſured that the conſtant pleaſure of my mind, hath not only kept me from melancholy, but from greater ſickneſſes, and tended to the lengthning of my life (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pleaſant Studies do.</hi>) For conſtant pleaſure muſt needs tend to health.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:34217:34"/>17. And this taſte hath made me long for more, and had I not felt that it is good to draw near to God, and very deſirable to know him and his will, I ſhould never have ſo earneſtly beg'd for clearer light and more near and ſweet communion with him; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the cauſe of ſtrong deſire.</p>
            <p n="18">18. It hath been one of my greateſt helps againſt many temptations, of ſubtile ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that tempt men to ſadduciſm and doubt of the life to come.</p>
            <p n="19">19. It hath made me more communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to others, for we would all have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in our delights.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And it hath greatly furthered my Repentance and hatred of ſin, when I have taſted what pleaſure it depriveth us of; and the abhorrence and loathing of my ſelf that can delight in ſuch a God and Saviour, and word no more: when <hi>I</hi> taſte how good it is, and ſee ſo much reaſon to rejoice in it, and the hopes of Glory a thouſand fold-more than <hi>I</hi> do, none of all the actual ſins of my life, do make me half ſo much loath my naughty heart, as to think that my want of greater joy in ſo great and near a good,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34217:34"/>
doth ſhew ſo much weakneſs in my Faith, and Hope, and Love! O that <hi>I</hi> had more Faith and Love that I might have more of this delight!</p>
            <p>Hearers <hi>I</hi> have ſincerely told you what comfort you may have if you will not refuſe it from the Word of God, and from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of <hi>David,</hi> and (becauſe things near are apteſt to affect) from the experience of our deceaſed friend, and of my ſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all Gods Servants in their degree; you would live in joy; you will dye in joy; we need it in a life of ſo much trouble, and for a change that elſe is terrible; and its ſure and near. O Sirs we need another kind of comfort, than ſport or appetite, or wealth, or any ſuch fading vanity will give us, you may have ſome of it, if you will. And though joy be the top of grace which we arrive not at with a wiſh, nor in an hour, yet the nature of the new creature reliſheth or ſavoureth the things of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7. And the Spirit of Adoption is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of filial Love, and cryeth <hi>Abba</hi> Father, and the Love of God the Father, the Grace of the Son, and the Communion of the Holy

Spirit, which are the believers part, are all of them the greateſt comforters; and Chriſt giveth believers that ſeek and truſt him, that ſpring of living waters, which tendeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting ſatisfaction, and cureth indigent and ſinful thirſt.</p>
            <p>Will you then have any portion, heritage and joy which will be worthy of a man, and ſhall go further with you than the Grave? If you will you may: God and this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation are witneſſes that it was <hi>offered you.</hi> But think not to refuſe it, and prefer the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory pleaſures</hi> of Sin before it, and at laſt have it, and find that which you received, or which you ſought not firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. nor to find a <hi>Treaſure</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> where you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid it up or ſought it. The <hi>hopes</hi> of the <hi>Wicked</hi> periſh, and the <hi>Hypocrites hopes</hi> are as the giving up of the <hi>Ghoſt:</hi> But the <hi>Righteous</hi> hath hope in his death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may dye in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy, Job</hi> 8.13, 14. and 11.20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.7. and 14.32</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, that ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of rejoycing is unſuitable to the mourning of a <hi>Funeral.</hi> I think not of ſuch a <hi>Funeral,</hi> in which we commemorate the

               <hi>Holy Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and believe the preſent and everlaſting joy of ſuch a <hi>Friend,</hi> and one with whom we have long joyned in ſeeking and waiting for that <hi>Felicity,</hi> and hope ere long and for ever to rejoice with Chriſt and her, and all the bleſſed. And <hi>Funeral Sermons</hi> are not for the benefit (though for the due honour) of the dead, but of the living, to teach us all to prepare for death, which indeed is ſo much of the buſineſs of our whole life, that all the reſt is but a vain ſhew, and fooliſh trifling or much worſe.

            </p>
            <p>Woe and for ever woe to every ſoul of you, that ſhall finally reject or neglect the offer of ſuch an Heritage and Joy!
