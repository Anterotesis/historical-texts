            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN one of those Mornings of the Year wherein the Earth breaths forth richer Perfumes than are to be found in the Pallaces of Princes; by the wholsomness of whose scent, the distemper'd winds (purging their Bodies) ran to and fro,

whistling for Joy through the verdant Leaves of shady Trees, whilst Sheep lay nibbling in the Vallies to teach men humility, and Goats climbing up to the tops of barren Mountains, browzed there upon weeds, and barks of Trees to shew the misery of ambition; just at that time when Lambs were wanton as young Wives, but not lacivious: when Shepheards took care to feed their flocks, but not to fleece them; when the Lark with his Musick had called up the Sun, and the Sun with his light started up the Husbandman then, even then, when it was a morning that would have tempted the worst of sluggards to have left his bed: on a sudden I fell into a Trance, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought the Caves where the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly boisterous Winds lay imprisoned, were violently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

were then glad to bow, and stand qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, whilst low Shrubs and Bryars received a reward for their humility by being out of fear of danger: so dreadful fury lead forth this Tempest, that had not the Rainbow been a Water-mark to the World, (had what appear'd been real) Men could not have then suspected less than another deluge: for showers came down so fast, as if all clouds had been distilled into water, and would have hid their curled heads in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To make these terrors more dreadful, I fancied that the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his head as fearful to be seen, darkness then in triumph spread her sable wings, and totally covered the Hemisphere wherein I was; the blackness of Night was doubled at high noon; Beasts that were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41621:4"/>
to such sights, ran madly up and down bellowing; men were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed; and in short with the rain it lightned so fast, that the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was, seemed to be half-drowning, and half burning; the Waters striving to have Victory over the flames, and they sweating as fast to drink dry the Waters. To conclude, this Tragedy was so long a playing, and was so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, the Scene was so turbulent, and affrighting: this battle of Elements bred such another Chaos, that it did put me in rememberance of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious expression.</p>

A suddain alteration now appear'd, for this storm seemed to be blown away, and all things being quiet, methought I saw a great number of men together, and drawing near unto them, I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that each one had an Almanack
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41621:4"/>
in his hand of different sorts, consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one another; these Physico-Astrological Bil-men (commonly known by the names of Mountebanks and Quacks,) endeavoured to <hi>Apifie</hi> the Doctors, and took a world of pains to no purpose, to know whence this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of nature should proceed; but being all as wise as <hi>Gothams</hi> calves, they could say nothing pertinent to the matter. The tempest blown over, the Caelestiall bodies (for any thing these figger-flingers knew) were all in very good health; the twelve Signs were neither broken nor beaten down from any of the houses in Heaven; the Sun lookt with as red and lively a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as he used to do, and the Moon undoubledly (though then invisible) with as plump a face; and though some of them with their wonted impudence and ignorance did endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this dreadfull and sudden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the weather, did portend some! strange alteration in Church and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41621:5"/>
State, yet one standing by, (wiser then all the rest) told me he could not find by all the figures which their Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostications cast up their accounts by, that any such heavy event should befall the wickedness of these our present times.</p>
               <p>Hereupon another to satisfie my curiosity, told me he was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that this commotion of the Air had its rise &amp; derivation from nothing else but Conjuring; hearing him say so, could not forbear laughing, knowing the Bug-bear Art of Conjuration to be as false and fabulous as the History of <hi>`Pigmies, Amozons,</hi> and tales of old doting women. Though my laughter displeased the Gentleman, yet it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him not from assuring me, that which he said was a truth, and that this conjuring was about a Knight, not a Knight of worship, but a <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> Knight, a Knight forsworn, <hi>a Poor</hi> Knight, a <hi>Perjur'd</hi> Knight, a Knight of the <hi>Post:</hi> Sir said he, this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41621:5"/>
Yeoman of the Pillory and both Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (a long Inhabitant in new <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satia</hi>) was sometimes since sent with a Letter to the Devill; but he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with an answer, some mad fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, practitioners in the Black Art, laid their heads together, and swore to fetch him from Hell headlong; and now you have seen the horred effects of their operations.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I was very desirous to know the occasion of his sending. It was thus, said he: the Temple of the Muses (for want of carefull looking after) falling to decay, and many (that seemed to hate Barbarism, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) being desirons to imploy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about it, and repair it; But having many buildings of their own in hand, utterly gave it over; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counsel was therefore called of all those who lived by their wits, and such who were of the livery of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, amongst whom it was found neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that to ease the private Purse as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41621:6"/>
generall Subsidy should be levied, for the raising of such a competent Sum as might maintain the said Alms-house, of the Nine Sisters in good fashion, and keep it from falling, long were they in the collection of this Money, and though the Collectors did even swet themselves to death, yet no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nothing could be gathered, the Gentlemen (for the major part) swore bloodily they would not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute an half-penny, they had nothing to do with the Muses, they were meer strangers to them, and why should they be assessed to pay any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the relief of such laizy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Where is the Wit they boast of, if they cannot live thereon? As for Lawyers, they knew there was no Statute in any Kings Reign could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to discourse on this account; men of the Sword swore by their Arms, (some whereof were miserably out at Elbows) that they never could satisfie their hungry stomack with the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41621:6"/>
most curious dish that ever Wit had dressing of, and therefore resolved to keep their Money against a <hi>Gut-gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Campaign;</hi> Peace they cried had made them beggers, and were (some of them well qualified for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, having lost their Legs, went up and down on borrowed Stilts, that their Country might go sound and upright upon its own. They complain much for want of Action, and Poor men had a world of Actions against them, and were at so low an ebb, that Captains gave over their charge, and were led by Serjeants, Scholars, and could have found in their hearts to have made Money of their Books, Gowns, Caps, &amp;c. to have paid their share to this commendable work; but Earthly Souls held all that was theirs (how good soever) in such vile contempt, that even those who upon a good pawn will lend Money to the Devil, would not part with any Money to them upon any Interest, so much did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41621:7"/>
they hate the poor ragged Wenches, and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Hereupon at the next Sessions of the Wits; it was a greed upon to appeal to the Parliaments of Gods, who taking their condition into serious consideration on it, was by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently enacted, that <hi>Apollo</hi> (out of whose brain men of Wit and Wisdom came into the World; should with all expedition descend and prevent ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mischief; least sacred knowledge having her intellectual Soul banished from Earth, having no house there to Inhabit, the Earth should (as of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it would) turn into its primitive Chaos, and men again into Giants, to fight against the Caelestiall Powers. <hi>Mercury</hi> was likewise dispatcht from the whole Synod for the same purpose, as Embassadour to <hi>Pluto,</hi> (who is the chief) Infernal Banker to perswade him by the utmost of his eloquence, that Money might be more plentifull, or credit more easily obtained, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41621:7"/>
Scholars, and such who strive and struggle for the Bays for want of its assistance, might not be found to change their Lodgings oftner then their Shirts, and not knowing how to live at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are compel'd to confine themselves voluntarily to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> that to keep them from starving, they may go a share in the Lord Mayor and Sherifs Baskets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> (according to the decree of the Caelestiall Upper House) is now descending: the Fountains of Science flow, (by his influence,) and swell to the brim: Bay-Trees to make the Garlands for learning, are every where new set, and already green, the Muses have fresh colours in their cheeks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; their Temple is promised to be made more fair, and there is good hopes that Ignorance shall no longer walk or ride in that splendour, which better becomes the men of Wit and Learning. Yet for this <hi>Mercury's</hi> Embassy, (notwithstanding all his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41621:8"/>
craft and politie) proves ineffectual; for he cannot raise the Golden Devil. A mad Greek hearing this, who was with a Poeticall fury resolved to assist him, and in a bravery wrote a suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the behalf of Money, for its enlargement, vowing he would convert all his blood into Ink, and his brains into Cotten, but that he would have an answer.</p>
               <p>The Petition being drawn up, he thought none could run faster to <hi>Hell</hi> with it, and be sooner there, than a Suburbs <hi>

Having ended his discourse, this seeming gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Snipper-Snapper vanisht, so did the rout of the non-sensicall deluding Star-Gazers, and I left alone; then did I enter into a consideration, how many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41621:8"/>
shifts men make, and how many shapes they assume; what villany they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate, through what dangers they venture Conscience, Reputation, nay life it self shall be offer'd as a purchase for that glittering piece of <hi>Earth;</hi> the strange Magick of it drove me straight into a strange admiration.

               <p>My further consideration on this Subject was totally laid aside by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people approaching towards me; hereupon I drew near to know the meaning of this unusual meeting, I was quickly informed without asking, by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41621:9"/>
their own voluntary talking; (for great wagers were laid) that when the Petition was sent, it would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; or if so, it would not be read over; or if read over, not answered; for <hi>Mammon</hi> being the God of rich men, and not beggers, was worse, thought on than he deserved, and therefore would not hear the Petition of the Poor; (like a Lawyer in a busie Term) not be spoken with because his Client had not a penny to pay Fees, but sued in <hi>Forma Pauperis.</hi>

               <p>Now if he were to fight, it is a question which of the Play-houses his Prize should be performed at; and whether the Money when gathered, he would have couzened the Fencers thereof, or the Fencers him; because <hi>Hell</hi> being under every one of their Stages, the Players if they had owed him a spight, might with a false trap door have slipt him down, and there have kept him as a laughing-stock to all their yawning spectators, or had his Infernall Ship been arrested to any Action how great soever, all the Law in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> could not have kept him from appearing to it, (for the

               <p>Whilst wagers were laying on all sides as I said before, a little Pug, or rather Hellish Imp appear'd among us; for his colour and shape differ'd from what was humane, yet he had the voice and speech of man; for thus he said; cease your vain babblings, and do not by your Actions verifie a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb among you; <hi>none but Fools lay wagers;</hi> for Grand Seignour <hi>Diabolo,</hi> my Lord and Master is fully resolved to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his humble Orator, but being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not brought up to learning, (for to tell you the truth he can neither write
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41621:10"/>
nor read,) yet he has been at all the Universities in Christendom, and thrown damnable Heresies, like bones for Dogs to gnaw upon amongst the Doctors themselves; But having no skill but in his own <hi>Horn-book,</hi> much perplext he was to think where he should find out a proper Scribe to Scribble for him; most of the Scrivners in the Town he had at his beck, but they were so over-imploy'd in making Bonds between Usurers and unthrifty Heirs, indrawing up Leases between o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verreaching Landlords, and unwary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, in Warrants of Attorney confest to, the Wine-Merchant by a young raw nimble Squire of the faucet which gives him in-let to an House ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with every thing good, but Wine; which House has been (it may be) the ruin of a douzen of his rash predecessors, and will be infallibly his if he have not an especiall care: these, and a hundred things more these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veners are busied in, as Conveyances,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41621:11"/>
Final <hi>Recoveries,</hi> &amp;c. and at length by creating and undoing others, they turn Bankrupts themselves, and so knavishly deceive their Creditors. For these and other causes <hi>Don Lucifer</hi> was unwilling to take them from their <hi>Nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rints,</hi> because in the end he knew they were but his Factors, and that he should be a part-owner in their lading himself. Then as for those Gallantillo's, who now wear misbecoming Swords by their sides instead of befitting Ink-horns, as in the days of old; those Lawyers Clerks I mean who venture the dirtying of their Silk-stockings, and Ala-mode Spanish Breeches with trudging up and down from Office to Office, that they may bubble their <hi>Clients</hi> and abuse these poor ignorant Creatures to their faces, by exacting unreasonable Fees from them; my Master taking these things into consideration, would by no means take them from their wide lines, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting hands and Seals, &amp;c. but stroking them under the chins, call'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41621:11"/>
them his white-boys, and promised to remember them for their Ingenuity and greatpains-taking.</p>
               <p>After this, my great Master Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Malefico</hi> (for know Sir, (said he) he goes by several names, so that you cannot miscall him, call him what you please) I say he went next to the writing <hi>School-Masters,</hi> and writing <hi>Stationers</hi> (those puny Clark-undoers,) he took some of them by the fist, and licked their hands exceedingly, some of them having almost as many hands as <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>areus,</hi> by which they were capacitated to counterfeit any thing; but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the copies of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that for all their good Letters, they writ intollerable bad English, and that the world would think him a dunce, if there came false Orthography from him; he resolved to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with those Ignormus's (fellows whose faces look much like the first four lines of those humble Petitions they use to draw,) and in an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41621:12"/>
angry mood, curst them, which curse (as we have heard since) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a blessing, so that many of them have got great Estates no body knows how, which has been a great satisfaction to our great Pay-Master of Perdition.</p>
               <p>I hearing this, and fearing that our poor suppliant should loose his labour notwithstanding the Devils promise, and be sent away with <hi>si nihil attuleris,</hi> resolved to do that for nothing, which many would not do for any Money. Hereupon turning boldly without any fear or terror (as I imagin'd) to his spawn of Hell, I would undertake the task if he would direct me the way to the infernal Regions; he presently took me at my word, and was strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistaken in him, for I took him to be a Foot-Post, but he proved an Aëriall guide and hurried me, in an instant to the place by me desired: neither did I much fear my safe return, since I have read of severall men who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41621:12"/>
went thither and came back again, and as many women; but I could never hear that any of them ever returned; surely the Devil has a damnable love for the Female Sex, else he would never have put himself to the trouble and disgrace of stealing a wife from the Earth, called <hi>Proserpine Ceres's</hi> Daughter.</p>
               <p>Upon my arrivall, I found Hells Gates standing wide open; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by inquiry, I understood they were never shut. As I was entring, I cast my eyes about on this side, and on that, to the intent I might see that beastly monstrous Porter <hi>Cerberus</hi> so much talkt on by the Antients, but not a head of him appear'd there, which made me think that he either dy'd before my coming, or else never any such animall had a being. My guide and I proceeded forward at length he introduced me into a spacious Hall, where <hi>Pluto</hi> sate in a chair of state, attended by a vast number of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of different forms and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41621:13"/>
distinguishable as to dignity; by the greater or lesser splendour of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they wore about their heads. It was a day, or rather more properly night that, was set apart to give out new <hi>Commissions,</hi> and send fresh Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries into the World to supply the places of such who had tired and spent themselves in promoting new opinions in Religion, and propagating dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and dissentions amongst all sorts of People, &amp;c. Watching my opportunity, I addrest my self to his Divelship, informing him of what I came about: but this cunning Devil suspecting that I came rather as a <hi>spie</hi> to betray him, then as a <hi>spirit</hi> to do his business, and that I was more likely to have him to Barbers-Chyrurgeons Hall, there to anatomize him, then to a Barbers shop to trim him, would by no means have an answer given to the Petition. As soon as this flat deniall was pronounced, the Knight of the Post who brought the Petition, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by me, presently thought to sneak off, which being perceived, it was ordered he should be secured, and that he should severely pay for all his false <hi>Oaths and Perjuries</hi> he had committed on Earth, &amp;c. Hereupon he was hurried away by a throng of <hi>Serjeants and Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> whither I know not, but undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, directly to the place of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>for these Officers there, have not the convenience of milking their poor Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the way at Taverns or Ale-houses as they had on Earth,</hi> till they carried him to that place of ruin, where there is no hope of ever coming out till <hi>Death</hi> becomes his <hi>Turn-key.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This sight did somewhat startle me, and thought it not safe to tarry longer in the presence, but undiscover'd slunk away, resolving to view this Hellish Country, and muster all my Wits about me, to fight against this Captain of the damned crew, and not only describe his Territories, but discover his strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems.</p>

minding him well, I quickly found my mistake; for it was a Woman whom I knew, one that had been a Whore to the whole house, and such Auditors as would stick at nothing for above a douzen years. Necessity forced her into this Masculine habit; for having worn out her Petticoats to tatters, she undertook to play a mans part; and so apparell'd, rub'd off with what belonged to the stock of the house; had not the Lace been copper, the red Coat she wore would, have amounted to a good price. The next that came had pincht something to cover his nakedness, but he fared nothing near so well; <hi>having only converted a piece of an old Scene into a Champain Coate,</hi> which made him look so Comically, that the most serious there present, could not for bear laughing.

The Woman appear'd most pleasantly to the eye, having taken up some properties of their House, without the consent of their Patron, with which they made a hard shift to dress themselves, having worn out their own cloaths by strolling like Gipsies up and down the Countrey; one, though not above fifteen years of Age was drest in the habit of an old Bawd; another as young as her, in the fashion of a Witch; a third in a garb representing a She-Devil, and all of them so strangely, and phantastically apparrel'd, that all the Drolls, Farces, or Comedies that they ever Acted, came short of this pleasant sight of their Persons.</p>

                  <hi>CHaron</hi> having just discharged his fraight; I cry'd a <hi>Boat,</hi> a <hi>Boat;</hi> for I was unwilling to go over with such a crowd of miserable sad Souls. My voice being heard by this Skuller, although he was very weary; over he came; As soon as I was well seated, <hi>Charon</hi> began to complain what a bawling there has been, with what fares he has been posted, and how with much tugging (his Boat being so thwack the has split one of his Oars; and broke his Boat-hook, so that he canrow but slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till it be mended. And were it not that the Souls pay excessive rents for dwelling in the body, he swore by the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41621:25"/>
                  <hi>Stygian Lake,</hi> he would not let them pass thus for a trifle, but raise his price; <hi>why may not he do it, as well as fine Misses their rotten Commodities,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now he began to brag, what a number of glittering sparks, gallant Fellows, and delicate Wenches went lately over with him, whose names he had in his Book, and would have particularly nominated them unto me, but that they earnestly intreated him, not to spread their names any further, since they were so notoriously known already.</p>
               <p>The only wonder (said <hi>Charon</hi>) that these Passengers drive me into, is, to see how strangely the World is altred, since <hi>Pluto and Proserpina</hi> were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: for whereas in the days of old, men had wont to come into my Boat all slasht, stab'd and cut, some with one Arm, others with never a Leg; a third sort with heads like Calves, cleft in sunder, and the mouths of their wounds gaping so wide, as if they would have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41621:25"/>
cry'd for a Boat to come unto them; but now the case is altered; for my Fares for the most part, are such, who were poison'd by their insatiate wives, that they may take the freedom of having their Lust satisfied by others; or else dispatcht by their longing Heirs for living too long; <hi>Miscent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">By this you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that <hi>Charon</hi> can speak Latine.</note> 
                  <hi>Aconito Novera filius ante Diem Patris inquirit anno,</hi> some are scorched to death by whores, and so hurried out of this World; others come reeling out of Taverns into my Boat, and if they come bleeding too, it is ten to one the fatall wound was received either by giving the lie, or invindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pocky whore their Mistress. Surfeits on Food, as well as Wine send Shoals of wretched mortals to me. I have been lately troubled with great droves of People who dy'd in the field; but how I pray? not in the bed of Honour by Sword or Bullet, the miserable wretches, were hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starved.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41621:26"/>
A little before these, came a parcel of drowned Rats, but as fat as Bacon-hogs; they had been half rosted, and half boiled, by their rank scent, I knew they had more to do by water than by land; and since their profession was somewhat like mine, I was fain for pity sake take them in, for they had not a Stiver among them all. Now if the three Destinies spin no finer threds than these; men must either (like <hi>Esculapions</hi>) be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall for meer pity sake, and be sent up to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or else the land of the Black Moors must be made bigger: for the Great Lord of <hi>Tartary</hi> will shortly have no room for all his retainers.</p>
               <p>By this time (<hi>Charon</hi> looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,) as Watermen use to do, that is behind him, perceiving he was almost a shore, he desisted from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing further, and without loosing any time, I leapt ashore.</p>
               <p>The ways are so plain and direct, that I soon arrived at the Court-gate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41621:26"/>
of <hi>Avernus,</hi> which stood wide open. Hells Porter fawn'd upon me, yet would not let me pass, till I gave him his fee. He takes no Money, but executes his bawling office only for Victualls; his name is <hi>Cerberus,</hi> but the Houshold call him more properly the Black-dog of Hell. He has three heads, but no hair upon them, the place is too hot to keep hair on, instead of hair they are all curl'd over with Snakes, which reach from the Crowns of his three heads alongst the ridges of his back, to his very tail, and that is wreathed like a Dragons tail. Twenty couple of Hounds make not such a damnable noise when they howl, as he does when he barks; his property is to wag his tail when any comes to the Gate for entrance, and to lick their hands; but upon the least offer of making an escape, he leaps at their throats; sure he is a mad Dog, for where ever he bites, it rankles to the death.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:41621:27"/>
His eyes is ever watching, his mouths are continually gaping, and his howling is perpetuall.</p>
               <p>No sooner was I entred, But I met with thousands of miserable Souls, pinion'd and drag'd in Chains to the Bar, where they were to receive their Triall, with bitter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>It was Quarter-Sessions in <hi>Hell,</hi> and looking narrowly about me, I chanced to see my Knight of the Post, who was sent from Earth on a message to <hi>Pluto:</hi> though he had been at many of their Arraignments, and knew the horrour of the Executions; yet I perceived by his Countenance that the sight of the Prisoner struck him into an astonishing amazement.</p>

The Judges are set, (being three in number,) severe in look, sharp in Justice, shrill in voice, and dreadful in their sentence: the Prisoners are Souls that have committed <note place="margin">Sessions in Hell,</note> Treason against their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they are called to the Bar, their number infinite, their crimes numberless the Jury that must pass upon <note place="margin">Sin is the Jury.</note> them, who are their sins em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panneld out of the several Countries where they had their being, &amp; are sworn to find whose Conscience is <note place="margin">Conscience given in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> the witness; who upon the Book of their Lives, where all their deeds are written, gives in dangerous evidence against them; the furies who stand at the elbow of their Consciences are there already with flaming whips to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess: for they are the Beadles of <hi>Hell,</hi> that whip Souls in the Devils <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> or else his Executioners to put them to worse torments.</p>

As it was no laughing matter, I could not find in my heart to be so vain as to smile to see what sower faces they made when they

               <p>Here were a number of Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinkers as of <hi>Epsom, Tunbridge, Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidge,</hi> &amp;c. who drink it not for any great Vertue they found in it, but they loved the places, because it gave some (and they were Gamesters) an opportunity to cheat aud couzen, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41621:35"/>
to light on luxurious Women, to Cukcold their Husbands, these tasted too, but as gingerly as the <hi>Ass eating Thistles</hi> fearing to prick his chops. That little they swallowed, brought fresh into their remembrances, all their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenages Impieties. Debaucheries, &amp;c. and without hiding the least fault, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed aloud against their Villany and wickedness. There was a parcel of <hi>Semstresses</hi> who were got into this crowd, and with the rest drank of these bitter Waters, to external view they seemed to be very pretty <hi>Moppets,</hi> but understanding what their profession was, and how educated, being first pickt up by the Reverend Matrons their Mistresses, for the sake of their young and handsom faces, which would be a great inducement to bring Custom to their shop, viz. <hi>Young Gallants</hi> (alias) <hi>Scourers of the Road near Maiden head-Thicket, who teach them quickly another Trade besides what they learned of their Mistresses,</hi> and being set up

for themselves, managed it to an hair, I say understanding their Occupation and practices, undoubtedly their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides were not so fair, but that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides were as foul, these (having each of them drank a draft) shed an Ocean of tears, running down like Torrents over their blubber'd cheeks, and with such continued streams, that all the Linnen in their shops would not serve for Handkerchiefs to dry their deluged countenances; and all this came by thinking what variety of pleasures they had untimely left behind them, and what torments they were like to endure everlastingly, for so much indulging their senses, with all manner of Riot and Luxury.</p>
               <p>As for the name of this first River it matters not much; the Antients call it by the name of <hi>Styx;</hi> but call it by what name you please, all that I shall say further of it is this, that the Water is very thick; and how can it otherwise choose, being stirred with so many

Elevating his voice, said he, fellow Souldiers give me leave to tell you that danger is nothing else but a meer Chymaera, a notionall nothing; for if we say there is such a thing as danger before hand, it may be fear or misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet possibly the danger may never touch us. If we consider it in the present tense, and really ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, 'tis not danger, but Misery, and if we consider it in the preter tense 'tis past and gone.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41621:43"/>
it will be evident, that danger is a meer <hi>Non-entity,</hi> and those that fear it, fear just nothing.</p>
               <p>In the comparison of good and evil, we ever account those evills the least, which are the least lasting, and on the contrary, those goods the best which are the most constant and durable. Now for Dangers supposing that we should grant them to be evils, what more Courteous and slight evils could we wish for, than those that are come and gon in a moment. But dangers are so far from that, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sooner past than known, but the remembrance of them remains per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually fresh, and bring every day new circumstances to claw the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Nay and such a faithfull good it is; that no Malice of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune can berave us of, but it stays with us in other miseries, whereas <hi>Friends Patrimony,</hi> Honour can quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanish, and as we can no more grasp them than a <hi>shadow,</hi> so we can no

               <p>But supposing Danger, such a thing as ought possibly to be feared, since all wisemen agree with the Stoicks in this, <hi>that we ought not to be troubled for things which are not in our power, and we cannot help,</hi> and that the life of man is beset with such a many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences, which may every minute either surprize or assault us, what a madness were it to anticipate our ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetable misery, and like one who threw away his <hi>Gold,</hi> for fear of losing it, yet since Death will at last conquer us, the madness of men hath not shewed it self any more in any thing, then in their fear of it. Some assossinating themselves for fear of assassination, and therein showing at once an act of the greatest Cowardize and cruelty (for every thing must love it self the best) that is possible.

               <p>There is nothing among all the excellencies of Mankind, more shining than knowledge and Courage, and both these without dangers would be dull, heavy and unactive habits, what use were there for knowledge if we met not with the mazes and intricacies of life? And what more wise than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent ingenuity in avoiding dangers, or a vast conduct in preventing them, or a sly dexterity in weakning them.

               <p>For Courage it is only seen in danger and without them Hares and Lyons are of equall fortitude, great Souls that dare affront dangers are therein tried, and move at that time in their naturall motion, and to its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bounds, every thing hath an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, and therefore must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily delight in it. And can there be a greater pleasure to a man than for so small a triflle, as his own heart should inable him to conquer a Monster or a multitude.</p>
               <p>Brave minds are like <hi>Gold</hi> purified by the fire of dangers, and exalted up to their due perfection. And if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do so chearfully, even in her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative things imbrace every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, may we not think that rationall Souls have these desires so much the more strong, by how much their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the more noble.</p>

For the passive part of Fortitude, it is so far from being a Traytor to the happiness of man that it inebriates the mind in all calamities and makes them lushious nay restorative unto her. Now this without danger could not be; for jealousie ever attends on Misery, and there is none holds fast one link of it, but he may justly fear for to catch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. What greater misery than Poetry, which threatens by flying from us, and is a negative Enemy? yet by induring of it, it becomes light. And since what is not burdensom to us, but light must needs please us, and that a man is never himself but when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises his head or heart, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dangers he could not do, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we are beholding to them, as the spitefull Spurs and dear enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the life of man. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over man delights in nothing so much as in Fame, and how can he be more glorious than by shewing a sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nay gladness amidst so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

What more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to whole <hi>Armies,</hi> nay even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Conquerors, then security? What better means to frighten away securities than dangers? which needs must be of a Soveraign vertue, that are a means to preserve whole <hi>Armies,</hi> and of a most diffusive fruitful nature, that when they appear least they are greatest.</p>
               <p>Besides rewards are proportioned to dangers; which shews (them of a worthy and deserving nature; and therefore many men have been called the Saviours of their Country, at one time for some little performances which if they had done at another time would hardly have been noted, and hence it is that many great Stratage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Wits have no better ways ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

for startling their Enemies, or retaining their Friends, than by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the shew of their dangers.</p>
               <p>But if the shadow and meer repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of dangers, what is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and dangers themselves; when a man's in safty few regard him many may envy him; but falling once into danger, tears, commiseration, relief, and that possible from his Enemies which is the sweetest of all come unto him.</p>
               <p>Since we have manifested the rare use and necessities of dangers, it will not be hard for us, now to shew them of that gallant and cordiall nature, that they closely accompany the cast things and imediately flow from our most apparent happiness, from which they are not more seperable than heat from light.</p>

The first Man and Woman were so far from being cloathed; that it was the great mark of their Liberty and Uprightness; and the first brand that stigmatized them after their transgression.

               <p>Now in Women these desires, are far more intense; for they at all times uncover the part of their chiefest Beauty, as their <hi>Face, Neck, Ereasts and Hands,</hi> so that they do endeavour in part to break that restraint, which hides the rest of their glory, and to set forth their delicate Tresses, pleated and weaved with such variety, their Ivory Necks, their Harmonious Faces, their Milky Sphericall Breasts, and their melting Hands.

depart out of fair Bodies, that must needs be a curious Mansion which so fine a substance is in love with, and then I pray can you blame the owner to delight in it: and what a torment is delight, if shut up in one breast, and not diffused into a lively communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for all kind of blessings multiply by their division, and what greater blessing; than a rare Symetry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texion of Feature, which can charm knowledge into admiration, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty into Love.</p>

               <p>There have two great blemishes lain upon this Sex: the uncertainty and change of their judgements, and their inconstancy in their cloaths and carriage.

pretences) that Barbarism was grown to be an Epidemicall Disease, and more common then the <hi>Gout</hi> (alias Pox) or <hi>Tooth-Ach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being demanded how Poets and Players agree one amongst the other, he replied, as <hi>Physitians and Patients do agree;</hi> for the Patient loves the Doctor no longer then till by his means he hath recovered his health; and the <hi>Player</hi> loves the Poet so long as the Sickness lies in the <hi>Pit,</hi> when none will come into it, hoping by some lucky hit of this man of Wit, that the House will be so cram'd, that they must be forced to raise the Rates double of the two Galleries, and thereby barracado out the Vulgar. None but the Favourites of the House (said he) can be admitted to have a Play Acted; and into so low a misery, if not contempt, is the sacred Art of Poesy fallen, that though the Author (who is worthy to sit at the Table of the Sun) work his brains to gain applause from the more Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41621:62"/>
yet when he has done his best, he works but like <hi>Occus,</hi> that makes Ropes in Hell; for as he twists, an <hi>Ass</hi> stands by, and bites them in sunder, and that <hi>Ass</hi> is no other then the <hi>misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Audice,</hi> or that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest with Prejudice.</p>
               <p>And now (said he) having done with the Poets and Players, I shall (as briefly as I can) give you an account of what Remarks, and Observations I made (before I took my leave of the Terrestiall Globe) <hi>on the present Vices, Vanities, and fashionable Fopperies of the Town;</hi> the Infection whereof hath spread it self Universally.</p>
               <p>And first, by way of Paradox, give me leave to prove by good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that the honesty of the Age (wherein I lived) exceeded the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and that the World was never honest till then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> so proceed to my Observations.</p>
               <p>We read of a <hi>Golden Age</hi> in former times, but that was the meer Fictions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41621:63"/>
of <hi>Poets;</hi> now some are of the opinion, that the Golden Age was never till now; since Gold and costly Presents compass all things: in opposition to these, some would have it the Iron Age, since fire and Sword of late has swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> (and one would think) inexhaustible Treasures. Now all that I can say for the honesty of this Age I spoke on, that the worst of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties are now adays honest mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions: <hi>let their Practices be ever so bad, yet they would be accounted honest men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a place called <hi>Alsatia</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lies Quarter'd a Regiment of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fellows, who shall Mortgage their Ears to any <hi>Knave</hi> for a little Money, nay their Souls too, rather then he should lose an Estate in which he hath neither Right nor Interest; and yet these Fellows do impudently claim the appellatio of honest men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are not — greater under Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41621:63"/>
Now are not the Employers every whit as bad as the foresworn Hirelings; nay worse by a great deal, and yet these must be called honest men, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason, but because they look big in the worlds Eye, and abounding with Money (according to which all things are valu'd, and is the equivolent price of all things) they imagine nothing to be above their reach, but being just and honest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The world is but a great Market in which every thing is sold;</hi> as large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, fair Misses with foul Bodies, Wit, Vanity, Knavery, Mens lives, and their Reputations, and the welfare of their Families thrown in to boot.</p>
               <p>The opulent are the Men who fix their thoughts wholly upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their Estates, no matter by what means, and that which animates them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the consideration of this indisputable point, <hi>That the Rich man is never out of esteem, and repute,</hi> though he is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known to be an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41621:64"/>
but most stand so much in fear of his power, that they dare not call him so to his face; and he knows withall, that he cannot loose his interest in a good name, but by the loss of his Fortune. Who then would be in love with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Virtue? She may be admired by some, and followed by few, and here lies her unhapiness, that without wealth she seldom procures, and rarely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains her esteem in the World. Hence it is, that Rich men conclude they may bear themselves (justly) high, even to the expression of others, being already owners of what all men covet, all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and without which, even they who villifie it, cannot subsist, or effect any great exploit.</p>
               <p>And now I pray, how contemptible is Power if not regulated by Wisdom, for it disposes the Possessors thereof to greater follies, and extravagancies then others; and if they be but for a while left to their own wills, without any check or guidance, Vices take deeper
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41621:64"/>
root in them, <hi>like Weeds in good ground,</hi> and afterwards grow too prevalent to be extirpated.</p>
               <p>What is it that man would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, rather than subject himself to the Barbarous Pride and Capricious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some Persons, who are of so odious and insupportable a nature, that it is not to be wondered, if even men of despicable fortune, and rank, chuse rather to suffer their present want and penury, then subject, and be concerned with them.</p>
               <p>And now Brethren (said he) for their better information I writ a <hi>Satyr,</hi> to let them know, that they are Obnoxious to Laws, and that neither Revenues, nor Dignities exempt them from the Rules of Civility, and therefore ought not to set at nought such as they surpass in Estate, and to think, because they are not wealthy, therefore they are not men, and because some of the meaner sort are servants, therefore they must be consequently their <hi>Slaves.</hi> These
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41621:65"/>
I advised (if they purposed not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign themselves wholly up to Pride, and Arrogance, and if they will not divest themselves of all Humanity, and relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish that Nature and Reason, which distinguish as much Man from Man, as from other Beasts; if they intend not to degenerate into bruitishness) to nourish Friendly Inclinations, and make an amicable temper of Spirit as much their nature as it is possible. In former Ages, he that was rich in Knowledge, <hi>and not as in these days in Lands and Houses,</hi> was accounted a Wise man; but alas now there is no man wise, but he that hath Wit enough to gather wealth. The honest and ingenious, if they chance to miscarry, and forced by necessity to desert their habitations, they are slighted, and derided by Rich men; and if pittied by any, it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then by saying, <hi>Alas, poor Man, he was no bodies Fo, but his own, which is an English Phrase for a Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:41621:65"/>
Was not that a strange Age I lived in, where Vice, went by the name of Virtue; Drunkness was called good Fellowship; Murder reputed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Actor, a Man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, Petulancy and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Dalliance was termed Gallantry, and Gentile Courtship; Impudence passed for Audacity; Pride for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity; Avarice, for good Husbandry, Hypocricie, Nick-named, Sincerity; Adulation and Flattery bore the name of Complacency; and that which our Predecessors, called down-right Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very goes by the names of Wit and Policy.</p>
               <p>In former Ages there were many inperfections attributed to Women, that are now accounted no defects at all, nor scandalls to a good name, viz. <hi>the bitterness of the Tongue the Pride of the Heart, the Shamelesness of the Face, immodest actions, impudent looks, lightness of Behaviour, looseness of life, nor some other remarkable Marks, or</hi>
